"Flu vaccines have been a thing for years, and they range from around 30% to more than 70% effective, depending upon the year and how good a job researchers do of guessing the emerging strain based upon recently seen mutations. They definitely have not been 100% effective, because influenza mutates so rapidly. Coronaviruses like COVID and the common cold are similar (and the reason we don't vaccinate against the common cold is that it's so damn mild in 99.99% of cases).

Also you're definitely misunderstanding how vaccines work. Not sure why you would think this:

>""All \[the vaccine\] does rapidly and systematically put more people into the exposure category"".

mRNA vaccines like Pfizer are actually quite amazing in their specificity, so you don't even get exposed to a dead version of the virus, let alone a live version. mRNA literally just tells your cells what antibody proteins to print, and they do. And by having boosted immunity, you decrease the opportunity for mutations if/when you actually get infected, because your body fights it off much quicker.",t2_aiocc7wl,Immarhinocerous,0,1643968362.0,0,t1_hvjkl16,hvjkl16,False,DiamondPup,t3_sfqnki,https://www.reddit.com/r/stalbert/comments/sfqnki/photo_of_edmonton_mp_michael_cooper_on_parliament/,"Photo of Edmonton MP Michael cooper on parliament hill handing out coffee to protesters, with an upside down Canadian flag with swastikas in the background.

Exposure increases mutation opportunity the booster shots are also exposure. They shouldn‚Äôt be called vaccines because vaccines until they changed the definition last year meant that it gave you full and complete immunity to a disease. These covid shots do not do that they aren‚Äôt designed to do that. They are designed exactly like a flu shot is. You get your yearly booster so that you keep getting sick but it‚Äôs a minor issue till the genes mutate in the population. That‚Äôs why Pig Flu and Bird Flu both were mutated variants of the common flu. Because the covid poke isn‚Äôt an actual vaccine like the polio vaccine or the rubella vaccine is. All it does is rapidly and systematically put more people into the exposure category. This causes more mutations which is exactly why we have more mutations in such a rapid time frame. If covid had been allowed to propagate naturally it would have taken much longer to have mutations. Though probably more old people over the age of 80 might have died. And anyone under that probably would have the same amounts of deaths or lower.,t2_ck2us0bx,C0MM0NSEN5E,0,1643840784.0,0,t1_hvc6y9d,hvc6y9d,False,DiamondPup,t3_sfqnki,https://www.reddit.com/r/stalbert/comments/sfqnki/photo_of_edmonton_mp_michael_cooper_on_parliament/,"Photo of Edmonton MP Michael cooper on parliament hill handing out coffee to protesters, with an upside down Canadian flag with swastikas in the background.

"Honestly idk if Dr. Ahmed at Rivercrest is accepting new patients but he's a gem. Kind of an idiot at times but he'll listen, give you what you want & you don't have to wait weeks to get in to see him which is a plus.

The girls at the front desk are super rude and annoying but they're not much of an issue.

He'll never decline running tests if you need them and he'll always listen to your concerns. In my experience there's not very many doctors out there that actually take a patient's word seriously, but I've never had an issue with him getting me the care I require.

He's never declined a referral or requisition and always helps to the best of his ability. If something is outside of his expertise, he will be honest about it and ensure you are put in contact with someone who can actually help. For example, I went to him with concerns about a mole changing colours after a sunburn, he sent me to a dermatologist with a request to check EVERY MOLE OR FRECKLE ON MY ENTIRE BODY. Like I said, he takes you seriously.

"  *Would that mean we would have to build our own water treatment plant?*

Yes, but because the water in our riveer will be much more clean than the NSask, the gear needed to treat the water is much less. If done correctly, a $2 carbon filter with a $10 UV-C LED (purple light that terminates pathogens by destroying its DNA) is bare minimum for a single person. A Stalbert sized one could be done for a million if the land was included, *but* this would only work in summer, to make it year round it would be ten times more but that is still cheap (warm climates have it easy).  This does not consider an optional step of Reverse Osmosis, which is much cheaper when applying it to clean-ish fresh water compared to doing it to *salt water, which most cost studies are focused on*.

  *I bet that the water from the sturgeon wouldn‚Äôt taste the same as water treated from the North Saskatchewan.*

Taste has a huge amount of variables from the point of rain where H2O molecules form on what substance, and about a dozen others variables before getting to your tap. But, in the end distilled is best, RO is second, then you have municipal and natural filtration fighting for third. 

I RO filter our municipal water, and use the 'two-times waste water byproduct' in my plants. These filters cost about $150 and can be hooked up to your sink, or to a garden tap hose fitting. Mine lasted years without needing to change the filter. We tested St. Alberts water at \~250 ppm, after RO, it was down to 7 ppm. Distilled would bring that to 0 ppm. (I built one \[[on page 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yP_eqoUZgFSH_mvEpN4ZXXsO8xDyQhRxpt5wgjMlYkI/edit?usp=sharing)\] that uses the sun, a one square meter glass panels can meet the survival needs of two people indefinitely. 

Minerals should be obtained by your food, or by re adding a pinch of quality salt to your cleaned water, I use pink Himalayan. Normally I do *not* remineralize my diet because I want water to do its job as the universal-solvent by dissolving out mineral buildup in my body, but that is personal choice and because I put enough salt on my food.

(side note) In my opinion it helps to think that civilization should view their water as drinking water (distilled/RO), and utility water (the stuff you shower with). We use 2 liters of drinking water a day, and anywhere from 25 to 250L of utility water a day. Drinking water should be 100% perfect, and when a civilization trys=fails to treat both drinking and utility the same and bring it to 99.99% is gets unnecessarily wasteful with diminishing returns (because the end product still is not good enough for \[imo\] people), so it is down to every homeowner to add RO filters, which most don't, and the people absorb (and excrete) kilograms of all sorts of non essential minerals in their tissues over their lifetime.

 *Obviously, the headwaters of each river are very different. And water derived from the sturgeon could be more unreliable, especially in the late summer, as climate change progresses.*

This is a vast topic to explain and I did not do it enough justice, but the techniques used (level-swales, and or keline-plowing)  **turn the land into a water storage battery, and filter.** This means it mitigates floods by catching it which replenishes the water table, then it slowly releases it. The strategy takes all the rainfall of the year (even if it all came down in one month), and gradually releases it over the next \~12 months. 

This is humanities most inexpensive, most effective, tool in our toolbox to immediately reverse climate change (lowest hanging fruit, best R.O.I., etc).

"Well, for starters, you're going to need your class 5. The reality of St. Albert is you need a vehicle to commute, or else you're seriously limiting your options. If you want to live / work from here you need to accept that commuting is a package deal. [Northern Lights](http://fun2drive.net/) has been around for decades, and has a good driver's ed program that I took 15 years ago to get over my own driving anxiety.

As for colleges, there's essentially nothing as far as I'm aware. NAIT got rid of its satellite campus, but even then they were very limited in what they offered. You'll need to do online, or take the bus to campus. The commute can be tedious, but most people just grab a podcast to listen too while they wake up. It's not as bad as you think, especially if you make some bus friends. That said, everything is online right now anyway due to Covid.

For apprenticeships there's lots of trade work being done around here but, again, you're going to need your class 5. Trade guys frequently work multiple job sites, and are expected to be relatively mobile. Once you've got that sorted out though, there's so much construction going on that it's not a big deal to get in as a labourer, and then apprentice from there.",t2_8hk0bh4z,KevDevBot,0,1633866195.0,0,t1_hg3defd,hg3defd,True,InfraredSpectroscopy,t3_q54f6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stalbert/comments/q54f6k/are_there_any_good_collegesapprenticeships_i_can/,Are there any good colleges/apprenticeships I can apply within St. Albert?,/r/stalbert/comments/q54f6k/are_there_any_good_collegesapprenticeships_i_can/hg3defd/,8,r/stalbert,0,8

Gilbert Cantin is in my consideration, but I'm getting a weird vibe from him. I do think we could gain a lot by having a civil engineer on council.

-Tamdoori Fuzion - classy Indian restaurant.  I haven‚Äôt been since they moved.   they mostly sold their buffet ($35), but they had a good sized menu as well and a huge beer selection.

"Found this article from [St. Albert Today](https://www.stalberttoday.ca/amp/local-news/council-votes-to-draft-business-case-for-municipal-energy-corporation-3932798). My understanding is the motion from Dec 2019 was to defer any further discussion to a later date. Today's decision is to do a feasibility study and present a detailed business plan to be voted on by the next council in 2022. This doesn't mean the MUC is going ahead, just more research and details to come. The study would also identify potential risks and give an opportunity to explore risk-mitigating strategies.

There is currently a proposal for a solar farm in the north of the city, which is expected to be profitable in its first year. That would account for half of the projected revenue for the proposed MUC. The profits would then be reinvested into city services.

The city is expecting large budget deficits, so council is exploring new revenue streams as an alternative to cutting services or increasing property taxes. $1-4 off your utilities per resident doesn't sound like much, but if it can lower future property tax increases it may be worth exploring.

Other benefits could be from investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the city, municipal solar rebate programs, and potential waste-to-energy infrastructure. If the city could introduce a rebate program for residential solar installations similar to the City of Edmonton, there would be incentives for residents to produce their own power and save more than $4/year.",t2_5t9kamx,KMcR9,0,1625706631.0,0,t1_h4f85tl,h4f85tl,True,kneecapper,t3_ofuj5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stalbert/comments/ofuj5d/is_the_municipal_utility_corporation_muc_back_on/,Is the Municipal Utility Corporation (MUC) back on the table?,/r/stalbert/comments/ofuj5d/is_the_municipal_utility_corporation_muc_back_on/h4f85tl/,4,r/stalbert,0,4

"It's a nice neighborhood. My only issue with it is the strange premium on the house prices compared to other areas in St. Albert. A house in Erin Ridge will be $20/30k more than an identical house in North Ridge or Lacombe for some reason. I've never figured it out.

Personally, I find Erin Ridge in a somewhat isolated part of the city. Far from the Henday for a commute, only big box stores around you. If you're looking at newer houses, I find Lacombe is closer to the river valley, mature trees, hills, close to Ray Gibbons. Or North Ridge has lots more lakes and parks and connecting paths.

"Shaw 300/100 [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net) latest results are 306/88

I've happily been with Shaw for years and have never really had any issues.  Lived in akinsdale and had great speeds there, and am currently in Mission with I'd say even better speed. Telus is running fibre through my neighbourhood right now but even when complete I'm unlikely to switch.

"I use Shaw, the 1000/100 plan.

I do see those speeds, however, service is very spotty in my area because the trees have totally fucked everything underground.

The roots have destroyed all the conduits and everything is full of water.  Shaw has no plans to fix this anytime soon.  They are temporarily suspending cables in the air between lamp posts as a temp fix.

This results in random outages because my signal switches from coming in way too hot to way too cold.  I have some inline DB filters that I swap out as needed.

Shaw won‚Äôt tell you the truth about this, so all you can do is complain and hope they give you a discount/refund for the crappy service.

"The city has more or less confirmed ""we know it sucks, but nothing is likely to be changed due to the implications"". That was a response received from them after asking about whether the community and related areas would be renamed. I assume the implications and resistance to changing it would be related to the costs associated with enacting the name change. 

The city won't do anything unless enough people demonstrate concern over the matter. It becomes an easier sell when the initiative can be backed by many instead of the few. Maybe there's even a compromise that could be reached - for example, dropping portions of the name (Grandin in itself is not a negative name, this is specific to the person it's attributed to).

"Hi OP! St. Albert isa great place to live, i grew up there but relocated to calgary a couple years ago. I still own my property there in erin ridge and rent it out. When i was growing up the city was very white, when i graduated in 04 we had very little poc in my high school, but over the years it really became a very colourful city and welcoming! 

The schools are great, a lot of activities for kids, its expanded the past 8 years. my home in erin ridge was on the edge of town in 2013 but now theres much more development north of where my homes located. Property taxes are high but manageable. 

There are drugs but no more then every other small city, and its not as noticeable in st albert. There aren‚Äôt any unsafe areas in st albert. Some lower income areas but that doesnt make them shady or bad. As a female teen i was never worried about walking home alone across the city late at night after a party.

"Nothing is good about st.albert, it's toxicity painted as quaint. The people are an extraordinary example of self-entitled, fragile, egotistical, simpletons. It's basically CEO-Copland. Unless you do a loop in your crescent you're always going to be on camera and neighbours are probably watching you anyways, just because you're all that lame. And Jesus Christos!...just look at the names of streets and places. Rush hour traffic in Edmonton moves quicker than sunday traffic in St.Albert. Your cops even drive golf carts; you know, of that caveman, club swinging 'sport'. It's fucking white country club mentality. There are virtually NO good role models there. The Goddamn masonic-jew rotary Club swindles in more federal transfers (for ""arts"" and ""culture"") than what most of the province receives. You got your CFB-CO-pedos, your O&G gangstas, heroin overdoses and shootings I'm not supposed to tell about, co-ops on methamphetamines; not to mention a church, McDonald's, Tim hortons, liquor store and takeout every kilometer. Other than recent immigrants living in rivercrest (imported for fast food and 7/11 jobs), nobody has probably heard another language. Everyone is going to be a pro hockey player one day, if not sitting watching hockey and pretending could have been a pro. You're a bunch of xenophobes who are also scared of your white shadows. You actually don't have a river or a valley. Find me some French people or Indigenous left on the Metis settlement, and I mean ones who weren't forced to be anglo and white.

Cons: 
I‚Äôve been told to not see property as an ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù, and I agree. It makes sense to put your money towards something long-term, but considering property values may plummet (UCP for another 2 years + COVID after effects), a decreasing oil and gas economy which historically has made our province the place to live/work, I think buying something may be con if you‚Äôre looking to sell short term. I wanted to buy a condo in 2018 and am SO glad I didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôd be about $80,000 in the hole now.

Pros:
There‚Äôs an emotional component to having a home that you don‚Äôt quite get from renting. If you want space and affordable housing prices in Canada, this is the place. St. Albert is a good community, overall safe, yay

  I work at Barbershop Boyz. First of all, sorry your experience was uncomfortable for you. I can assure you that we are following all the mask mandates as we have been instructed by AHS inspectors. *An employee ALONE at a workstation, more than 2 meters away from anyone else* falls under the workplace exceptions. And a client getting a beard trim obviously is allowed to remove their mask. These services are permitted under the AHS guidelines. 
  The girl who sat across from you was at LEAST 3 metres away, and alone at her station. I can also say with certainty that your barber did not REMOVE his mask, his glasses fog up and sometimes he needs to let them clear. 
  Twisting the facts, blowing this out of proportion and slagging us on the internet is (in my opinion) really unjust.

"Nam Knights: In the summer of 1989 a small group of Harley-riding combat vets of the Viet Nam War, who were also police officers, banded together to form the Nam Knights.

The Club was founded in New Jersey by Jack Quigley, now retired Undersheriff of The Bergen County Sheriff's Department. Jack served as a platoon sergeant with the 11th Motor Transport Battalion, First Marine Division.

Today, the Nam Knights of America Motorcycle Club has grown to 69 chapters in 16 states, Washington D.C. and two Canadian provinces, with hundreds of members made up of veteran's of all eras as well as law enforcement personnel plus a few special and dedicated ""patriots.""

As Jack has said: ""The club was formed to recapture the brotherhood its founding members shared while serving in Southeast Asia, and to help other veterans of all wars who are unable to physically orUndersheriff Jack Quigley financially help themselves.""

""The mission of the Nam Knights is to honor the memory of American Veterans and Police Officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty, to assist Veterans and Police Officers in their time of need, and to promote community awareness through sponsorship and participation in various community and fund-raising events.""

"I took it there in 2017, the instructor was nice and relaxed she was a blond lady I'd say in her 50s. They have some different routes but mine went down green grove drive through the traffic circle in front of the medical clinic, to downtown st. albert. We then crossed st.albert trail on St. Anne/Sturgeon Road, after that we turned onto Burns st into the residential area to parallel park and park downhill/uphill properly. After completed that we went passed RS Fowler turned towards LA and back to Drayden. Mine lasted around 30 minutes but typically it would last 20 as there was construction blocking the road. Hopefully you can understand all that lol. I'd HIGHLY recommend taking a 2 hour drivers training session with St Albert drivers training it helped me a lot, pretty much a practice session of the test, well worth it. Good luck!

"I really sympathize.  The whole world is going stir crazy (even in those places with lots of theatres and clubs, they‚Äôre all closed down at the moment.)

Here‚Äôs a few ideas.  Maybe they‚Äôll all feel wrong or maybe one or two are worth a shot:

-there is a St Albert tool library.  If you want to try taking up woodworking this is a great way to do it without having to pay for tools. (Enough time and effort will turn even cheap wood into something bff awesome.)

-get into a sport or fitness activity.  Running is cheap and there‚Äôs lots of ‚Äúcouch to 5k‚Äù guides (Or more advanced if appropriate) available.  You‚Äôll be amazed what you‚Äôre capable of.

-one of Canada‚Äôs best boardgame and miniatures stores is here in St Albert.  Try a game, or get a miniatures painting kit (it costs money but not a huge amount).

-with the internet, there‚Äôs a huge number of free online courses.  Learn about something that you find cool: programming, history, astrophysics, etc. etc.  take up a language.  Learn sign a bit of sign language.

-head over to Michaels and get something crafty.  Try taking up knitting, or painting (Reddit loves Bob Ross for a reason.). Maybe make Fido jewelry you can sell on Etsy or something to cover your costs.

I‚Äôm sorry that most of these are ‚Äúrelatively cheap‚Äù rather than free, but I hope at least one will bring you a bit of entertainment.",t2_v1pv4,ABLurker,0,1593358416.0,0,t1_fw9uhje,fw9uhje,True,[deleted],t3_hh8scx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stalbert/comments/hh8scx/help_bored_asf/,"help!!! bored asf! :,(",/r/stalbert/comments/hh8scx/help_bored_asf/fw9uhje/,4,r/stalbert,0,4
