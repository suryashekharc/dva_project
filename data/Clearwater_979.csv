"I was at Wawa last weekend, the one at 19 and countryside. I was waiting for my food when I noticed a guy who was obviously impaired. He looked to be about 20-22 years old. He could barely stand, he had to lean on something if he wasn’t walking. He was waiting on food too. He had some other snacks with him and had put them down then walked away. When he came back he was looking all over the place for them, I had to actually point out where they were. I kept thinking, I hope he’s not driving. I get my food, go outside but I continued to watch him. He was eating his chips while he waited for his food. He was nodding off while eating. Like literally nodding off while putting the chips in his mouth. By the time he came out, I was finished with my food but I was concerned he was driving. He was looking all over the parking lot, I thought, maybe his ride left him? Nope, he just couldn’t remember where he parked. When he did spot his car, he went over and got in the drivers side. I’m like “he’s actually gonna drive off and he’s definitely impaired”. But he didn’t drive off fight away. I made the decision to call 911. I walked closer to his call and got his license plate number. Now mind you, I wasn’t trying to get him trouble, I just didn’t want him driving. Anyway, I called 911 and the 911 operator told me I was doing the right thing. He was still in his car, which was parked at one of the gas pumps, when the Clearwater police arrived. The officer walks over to his car, speaks with him for a minute. Takes his DL and goes back to his cruiser. A few minutes later, goes back to the guy’s car and I hear him say, it’s all good, have a nice weekend. By this time, 3 other police cars show up. But the officer tells them, he’s fine. You can lay eyes on him if you want, but he’s fine. He’s just eating. As the officer walked back to his vehicle, I spoke up and said, “I’m the one that called. He’s obviously impaired”. I repeated what I saw in the store with the staggering and stuff. The police officer again says “He’s fine. I didn’t smell any alcohol on him.”  And I said “I never said he was drunk, but he’s obviously impaired and you’re just gonna let him drive off?” I told him, “I’ve worked in an ER long enough to recognize when someone has been using”. He was nodding off standing up. I told them “I just hope he doesn’t kill anyone or himself. If he does, that’s on you guys”. 

Again, I wasn’t trying to get the kid in trouble, I just didn’t think he needed to be getting on the road, especially 19. But, they didn’t seem to care at all, last thing the officer said to me was “Again, he’s fine. He hasn’t been drinking.”",t2_1urcg5kx,jeffrey911,0,1647195496.0,0,t1_i0ipazp,i0ipazp,True,VTX1800F,t3_tcguvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClearwaterFl/comments/tcguvu/fyi_the_pinellas_county_sheriffs_office_and_other/,FYI: The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office and other law enforcement agencies in Pinellas County will be conducting a “wolf pack” this weekend to apprehend impaired drivers.,/r/ClearwaterFl/comments/tcguvu/fyi_the_pinellas_county_sheriffs_office_and_other/i0ipazp/,1,r/ClearwaterFl,0,1

"He called me in regards to getting an estimate for a move. I told him I liked the estimate and that I wanted to proceed.  I explained to him that I had to coordinate with someone to meet him at the location and told him I would call him back. In a matter of five minutes Justin called me multiple times and texted me the “good to go”.  Very pushy and high pressure. I called him back and explained I did not like the way he was being so aggressive and didn’t give me the time to get a confirmation. That is when I told him to disregard my estimate. I no longer wanted to do business with him. He yelled at me and was very condescending asking me didn’t I realize it was a long distance move.  Again I told him I did not need his services.  I received this text right after we hung up. My total interaction with him was maybe 10 minutes. He made a lot of assumptions about me without knowing anything about me or my situation.  Needless to say, I’m glad I found out how they operate before they had my belongings. I then looked them up with better business bureaus where they have an F rating.

"I’ve lived in Pinellas County since 1972.  I lived in St. Petersburg, Largo, Clearwater, and Dunedin.  Six years ago I purchased a house in Tarpon Springs.  

I would recommend getting a place near downtown Tarpon Springs, downtown Dunedin, or downtown St. Petersburg.  

My Uncle went blind while he lived in downtown St. Petersburg and he was able to live independently until he passed at age 96.  I know being blind has specific challenges and IMO Clearwater is just too spread out.  There is a lot more traffic congestion and their mass transit leaves much to be desired.  Their downtown area is not as conducive to independent living as the other towns I mentioned.  

I hope you find a great place at a great price.  If you do consider Tarpon Springs, ask about “The Fruitbowl” section.  (It’s called that bcz all the streets have fruit names) It’s quiet, close to a lovely park, a grocery store, a great produce stand, and many restaurants & quaint taverns which regularly offer entertainment.  It’s a mile from The Sponge Docks which is a great place to walk & has fabulous Greek food.  Tarpon Springs is less pricey than the other towns I mentioned, too.  I’ve found a lovely “small town” feel living in TS and the ppl here really seem to care about total strangers as well as each other.

As I said, this is just my opinion.  I’m sure many ppl will want to tell you why I’m wrong.

"Compromise only works when there are common goals that can be worked toward together.

There are very few intersecting goals for both Clearwater's residents and the Church of Scientology.

The Church is not interested in businesses being downtown, that's why they have stifled any development.

The Church is not interested in robust public services, they don't need police because they handle everything in-house. Besides, they don't want detectives asking questions like ""Why didn't you give the dying woman any water?"" 

Helping the impoverished? No thanks, Poor Scientologists aren't allowed to visit the Ft. Harrison.

Good, non-corrupt city officials who take the population's needs into account? Nope, Scientologists don't need that, they need pliable yes-men to approve their building permits.

Did you check his deleted text messages? Usually even old flip phones have a deleted text area.

If you can get on his phone, you can send a recovery email and reset his passwords for Facebook, gaming accounts, etc.

I'd also go to YouTube on the computer or smart tv and look at video history.

Perhaps you can set up a trail camera in the local woods as well to see if he is doing his survival thing, especially if he was isolating and distancing maybe he is out there avoiding everyone.

"Still missing - 

Vladek was living with my dad in East Orlando, my dad left town on 11/5/2021 with me and a couple other family members to go on a trip out of state for 10 days, Vladek elected to stay home. While my dad was gone he tried to check in with Vlad via texts and voicemails but he never answered any of them. When my dad got back into town Vladek wasn’t at the apartment so we filed the missing persons report with Orange County Sheriffs Office. The day we reported him missing my dad posted flyers…the maintenance guy from the apartment complex left my dad a voicemail saying he saw Vlad on 11/12/2021 and he spoke with Vlad…my dad is very hard of hearing so he thought the maintenance guy said that after they spoke he saw Vlad walk into the woods. So that is what dad relayed to the sheriffs office and is what is written in the initial report. But a few days later when my dad listened to the voicemail again, the maintenance guy had said he saw Vlad, they spoke a few minutes and as a side note he mentioned that he knew Vlad liked to hang out in the woods behind the basketball court to smoke/sing and said we should check there….not that he saw him walk into there. The area the maintenance guy was describing is a thin strip of woods and there was no evidence of him being there recently. We have been asking the sheriffs office to correct the information regarding his last sighting in their report/flyer they pass out because it is inaccurate and misleading but they have yet to do so.

In the year following up to when Vladek went missing, he spoke frequently about how eventually he wanted to go off and live in the woods but he said he wouldn’t do that until after my dad had passed away because he didn’t want to leave my dad alone or for him to be blamed by the family for him leaving.

We think Vlad left the apartment sometime between 11/12/21 and 11/15/21 because he was last seen on 11/12/21 by the maintenance guy. The odd thing about the story is that he stopped using his cell phone on 11/6/21, he had unread texts from that day forward. His phone was found dead in his room, the charger cord nearby.

While it appeared as if he left suddenly and did not bring anything. He successfully completed basic training and graduated from the Marines (he was honorably discharged later on). He has survival training. He could have traveled to a trail and began hiking or he could be camping near a trail.

Another theory is that he could have gotten wrapped up into a religious movement or cult. At the beginning of 2021 Vladek had a extreme switch in ideals. He had always been the type of person that strived to have the best phone,clothes,shoes….but at the beginning of 2021 he became hyper focused on Heaven, and very minimalistic…he began giving away money to the homeless and giving away possessions because he said they were distractions from Heaven. He made comments about how he wasn’t afraid of death because he would be in heaven, and that if he could be in heaven today he would. I’m a Christian but this was just a different level. 

There have been no reported sightings since 11/12/2021, my family is desperate for information regarding Vlad’s disappearance….we are worried about his safety and wellbeing 💔

Main points to note:

When my dad left for the trip he gave Vlad $100 and a credit card to use, the only transaction that has been made on that card was either the day my dad left or the following day (unclear which day due to how transactions post) for a cup of coffee at FoxTail

He shared a car with my dad, but the car was in the repair shop while my dad was out of town…he never used public transportation in the past and he was very bad with directions…didn’t have GPS on his flip phone….if he needed to get somewhere and my dad was using the car he would usually walk 

His phone was a basic flip phone that he only used for phone calls and text messages - he left that phone behind when he disappeared - all his texts were unread from 11/6/21 on…I went through the messages but didn’t come across anything helpful. 

He was not a student at UCF or any other nearby campus. However the apartment complex they live at is very close to UCF.

He was not working at the time of his disappearance. 

He didn’t have a girlfriend at the time of his disappearance that we are aware of. His only friend that he would have regular text communication with was someone that worked at one of the restaurants he frequented but that person he tried multiple times to reach out to him while my dad was gone and he didn’t get a response from him either.

He has a Facebook and Instagram but they are blank…he never posted on them/used them. There is a chance he could have used them for messaging but I can’t gain access to his accounts so I am unable to find that out.

He shared a laptop with my dad but he hadn’t used that in over a year.

His limited online presence was playing his PlayStation and watching YouTube videos via a smart TV, still trying to gain access to those accounts to see who he was following and if he was messaging anyone on those platforms 

He wasn’t into the party scene or drugs/alcohol….the most he has tried was weed

He is well recognized at the businesses/restaurants he would frequent on University Blvd, Alafaya Trail, and Waterford Lakes due to his generosity and friendly personality. He spent his free time helping people in need, he would give money to homeless individuals and have lunch with them/long conversations at restaurants and cover their check. He has a huge heart for people and will strike up conversations with people that he met, he wanted to make sure they felt heard and that they mattered. 

We adopted him and his biological sister, Irena, from Russia when he was 5 yrs old but he has no contacts with anyone there and never expressed a lot of interest in going back - the only thing I know about his biological parents is that they had a history of alcohol abuse.

He successfully graduated from the Marines bootcamp Dec 2018, he served a desk job for about 7-8 months before receiving an honorable discharge for failure to adapt - he said it was bringing up memories of his time in Russia. 

The night before my dad left for the trip he made comments to my dad about archangels and demons and how you have to be dark to kill the dark (I assume this is what he was listening to on YouTube)…it was all off the wall stuff that didn’t make a lot of sense. He bought a pocket knife a few days before my dad left…he said it was for protection…but the pocket knife was still in the apartment when my dad returned from the trip. 

He has never gone more than a day without reaching out to someone in the family. If he was in a right frame of mind at the time of his disappearance he would at least told his biological sister, Irena, that he is okay and not to worry - which he did not.

If he did decide to go off and do his own thing we are fine with that as long as he is mentally well and safe - we just don’t know….we just need to know that he is okay 💔

Ways you can help -

- We have created a Facebook group, Instagram, and TikTok page for him to help spread awareness and to keep others updated on any developments, @FindVladekHasel. Please join them and invite your contacts to join them….reshare his story/photo as much as you can. The more we get his story/photo out there the greater the chance someone will recognize him and come forward with more information.

- We are trying to get his story/photo out there as much as we can, if you know of any social media influencers or Podcasts that will share his story please do so. 

- We have created a fundraiser on Facebook for information leading to the safe rerun of Vladek. We are raising this money with the hopes of offering a reward or hiring a private investigator that can hopefully locate Vlad. Any help financially is greatly appreciated, Please share this fundraiser with your contacts as well. 

- What we have gathered is Vlad was at least listening to a YouTube pastor between Oct/Beginning of Nov 2021 that was putting a lot of focus on Heaven/archangels/Demons….we don’t know who this pastor was but if we can figure out that account it could give some insight into Vlad’s state of mind just before he disappeared. If you are aware of a YouTube pastor with these types of posts along that timeline please send us a message. 

- if you are hiking trails or working with the homeless community please memorize Vlad’s face incase you might come across him. 

- IF you think you see someone that resembles him please try to discreetly take a picture (If it is safe to do so) and send us a message of when and where the sighting was and call the non-emergency tip line for Orange County Sheriffs Office.

Thank you for anyway you can help with bringing answers to our family 💔 We love and miss him so very much 💔

"Realtor here.

The difficulty is that bricks.... aren't made anywhere in florida.  We don't have clay, we have sand.  Closest bricks used before builders wised up and started using other matiersla was Augusta... thus Augusta Bricks being everywhere.

The only spot with a lot of brick structures is Tampa, primarily Ybor, Yellow Brick Row, and some old cigar factories still standing in West Tampa.

Plus, most of Florida as a whole was built in the 1950s or newer, which is after brick was a commonly  used building material even in northern realms.

Same reasons we have concrete block here, and never really had cinder blocks.  We don't have steel mills or other heavy industry that would produce cinder blocks as a byproduct.

There are maybe a handful of brick residential structures in Pinellas.  Tampa has a bit more.

You would need a 240 volt momentary switch. You kind of answered your own question. Also it depends on the amperage of all of that and the size of the wires. Voltage is just voltage. Amperage is how much of things you can put on said circuit. So you'd have to figure out the amperage of everything first.

Hi Jeff. I just bought a house and it has a 4 post car lift in the garage. Original owner was operating it via 220 panel breaker on the other side of the garage. Not exactly ideal or safe for a lift operation. 220 plug for the lift is exposed and I can get to the wires. If I wanted a momentary switch next to the plug what should I use? Also I assume if I want to also run a 220 80gal 2 stage air compressor I assume I'll need to run a sperate line?

"It seems like inside the box where the switches are the red and black are tied together. THey probably did that because the fan installed didn't have a light, therefore no matter which switch was turned on, the fan would turn on. If the 4 wire romex we call it 12-3 romex, goes from the fan to the switches you should be able to rewire it the way you want, or have someone do it for you. But if you just want to use the remote and keep the switches you can either tie the power to the remote receiver to both the red and black, or just one of them. This way the switch will still power the receiver and remote.   


Though I usually don't like providing off/on power over and over to receivers. It doesn't hurt it but it seems to make them go bad faster in my experience.

I assumed it would be for a fan light, but the old fan didn't have a light.

New fan will be controlled by remote, but I wanted to keep the light switch option. I was trying to check that I had the switches correct, but BOTH switches activate my line tester. That is - the red and black wires BOTH seem to go hot when EITHER switch is 'on'. White wire does not activate the tester ever. Ground wire obviously doesn't, either.

"I post on here sometimes doing an AMA as I am a licensed Journeyman electrician but I don't shill for side work as a main post. If people want to hit your husband up for side work that is fine but I have found a lot of people including the mods look down on outright trying to advertise side work. 

This is a huge reason I do AMAs for this comminity and not make outright posts about side work. I think we as licensed trademen should help this subreddit first and foremost before asking for work. This is why I specifically state to keep my posts seperate from side work in the AMA posts themselves. As I think its in bad taste. 

I sometimes go through weeks of helping people through chats and messages to help homeowners fix things themselves instead of charging them and make sure every single person asking a question is taken care of in one way or another. I hope you do the same because the mods don't like blatent shilling, and a major reason why I try to strive to help the community first and foremost.

"Tried to find an easy reference for article 110 of the codebook that references panel locations for services in residential areas. This website here gives a good general idea of what is required for a panel location.  


Seems like the loft would be fine as long as you have these requirements met on site here. Gives good visual representation, better than just me typing.  


Though you will have to have a disconnect outside almost 100% positive as you cannot have unfused feeders enter the building of a residence that far in. Lots of areas won't let unfused feeders enter a building at all other than a couple feet. As always it depends on the inspector you will get. If you have a disconnect outside you do not need a panel with a main breaker, but having both isn't an issue and just gives you an extra layer of tripping protection.

"Wouldn't necessarily need a new breaker if it's the same amperage, but if you need 4 wire and only 3 wire is ran, then yes, you will have to get a proper neutral wire there.

Will it? Probably for a bit. Will you run into major issues or have a chance the neutral/ground combo gets overloaded, also maybe and probably and most likely not worth the risk.

"The Gulf is generally warmer than the Atlantic and the waves are much gentler.  Also, the sand is much smoother on Clearwater. Beach.  The Clearwater Marine Aquarium - home (and movie set) of Winter the Dolphin is there, too.  It’s very family friendly with plenty of interesting restaurants and shops even kids can enjoy.  Take a $20 Uber ride off the beach & you’ll find Celebration Station with all sorts of fun activities for kids.  Cocoa Beach is very nice, but Clearwater Beach definitely gets my vote for a place to take kids.

If you go about 10 miles north to the Dunedin Causeway you can rent kayaks from “Sail Honeymoon,” then have a very reasonably priced meal next door at the High & Dry Grille while watching the sunset.  

And don’t forget Busch Gardens, which is about 25 miles east of Clearwater Beach.  My kids loved it so much we had annual passes.  

I hope you have an absolute blast no matter which place you choose.  The weather should be perfect that time of year.

"Ive been to both a bunch.

Clearwater is much nicer. Top 5 beach in the USA. Cocoa has never really kept up with the times and feels really outdated and dirty. While Clearwater is more of a lazy retiree feel, you have St. Pete and Tampa close by for a bunch of options for the kids. If i had to pick, id do Clearwater 10 times out of 10.

St. Pete

"Not sure exactly what you're describing here. Prototype? One lamp post has 4 wires in it, white black read and green/bare....  


Ahh I see. So that's the wires on the inside of the lamp post. They probably just ran a 12/3 UF or romex to it because that's all they had. 3 ways have 3 wires but when finally going to the actual light itself are ran with 12-2 black/white/ground. So I'm guessing it's just an extra wire. They DO make circuit tracers. Basically you attach the tracer to the circuit and there is a wand you can use that will follow the signal it puts in the wires and you can detect where it goes. You can buy them online but they can be expensive.

It sounds like bad breaker or you're overloading the circuit somehow. As I said could be a bad appliance or something else on that circuit. I'd recommend finding which circuit it is in the panel and putting a claw amp probe meter on it to see how much it is drawing. If its under 16 amps (80% load on a 20 amp breaker) then its probably the breaker.,t2_66hf4,Cryptophagist,0,1641867451.0,0,t1_hs5gfw1,hs5gfw1,False,Cryptophagist,t3_s0plyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClearwaterFl/comments/s0plyf/hey_everyone_its_jeff_the_pinellas_journeyman/,"Hey everyone.

If its 12 you can put a 20 amp breaker in place of the 15 amp. But you usually should make sure the whole circuit is 12 wire.

It depends on what size wire they ran. If its number 14 gauge then by code you shouldn't put a 20 amp in. If it is then you can just swap the 15 out. Send me a picure of the wires oj that circuit if you can somehow safetly. I may be able to tell by the picture.

"Sounds like you either have a short or an appliance is drawing too much power and tripping the breaker, which isn't good. Since it happens overtime I would guess it has to do with heat or amperage. I would suggest someone test your feeders with an amp probe asap to see if you're drawing more power than normal.

It could be something as simple as the breaker going bad. This is a hard tell without some investigation. But the skillet thing is interesting.

I'd have to look at my codebook. By NEC standards you may have to install a disconnect before entering your house with the feeders because there is a code in that.

So I live in a 1990s coachman camper- it is hooked up to regular electricity but I’ve got a problem with the breaker tripping randomly. It seems to only happen in the kitchen but it will happen without running or plugging anything in new (for instance the air conditioner will be on fine for six hours then suddenly the breaker will trip) I haven’t been able to cook besides using the microwave because when I plug in the electric skillet it causes the breaker to trip as well.

"My boyfriend and I visit Clearwater about once a year. We're 28/29. And into low key quiet things. Every time we visit we go to Bait House for lunch and Pearlys Beach Eats for tacos. Those are probably our two favorite places to eat at. Then we visit Sunken Gardens. It's a beautiful botanical garden. Nearby is a place called Fourth Street Shrimp Store that we eat at afterwards. In the past we would just rent a car and drive an hour or so to visit places- Busch gardens, Three Sisters Springs (for kayaking, highly recommend if you're willing to drive), Vietnamese restaurants (im viet and sometimes need a familiar meal when traveling). We've gone to St Johns Pass but didn't care for that too much. We normally just google what's near to do and hope for the best lol This year I think we will mostly relax at the beach and still hit up our favorite restaurants but go in search of new ones.

"Depends on the ambience and cost you're looking for. I go for inexpensive and chill with easy people watching and live music when available.
Always call ahead for seating.

Pete and Shorty's is an old school brick and mortar casual Indoor/outdoor grill right on gulf to bay, they sometimes have music.

Further up the road is a little nicer venue Rumba Island grill. Simple drinks specials and great food with a tiki setting and live beachy music.

There's also Tiki Tavern. More energy with good food and cool cocktails, indoor and outdoor with music in quaint Safety Harbor. Main Street is a delight to walk through (many more cool spots on Main) as it's not as busy and obnoxiously crowded as other places. 

There are more, but hard to gauge because you might have different tastes, age preference, and budget. I chose middle of the road.

Something is tripping the GFI. Either the microwave or the condenser in the fridge. Its going to trigger the GFI regardless of how many you install. Some vacuum motors do it too.

"I'm probably going to get the terminology wrong, but one of the GFCI switches in the kitchen randomly turns off.

(121st and Ulmerton) 

(Wilcox Rd and Walsingham)

(the municipality of High Point, which is not far from the St. Pete-Clearwater airport) 

(Oak St and 119th St, specifically the north side of Ulmerton, the neighborhood south is working class but not bad)

"Considering how you are responding and explaining things here, I highly recommend using a Realtor.  Our primary job is to make sure transaction proceeds normally and that fraud and other terrible things don't happen to you.   

At least in Florida, only licensed brokers, closing agents, and attorneys are able to manage escrow for a real estate transaction and a buyer will almost always make that deposit directly.  *Even on private, unrepresented sales.*

Can you do it without those parties?  Sure.  But it's kinda like representing yourself in a criminal trial.  It's a terrible idea and you are on the back foot from the get go and extraordinarily unlikely to catch up.

"Realtor here.  Nothing in what you've said sounds illegal or a scam on it's face.

Now if he is asking you to make escrow to him well that IS a pretty big warning sign.  States vary of course but on most real estate transactions there is a impartial third party that holds funds during the contract and then disburses funds at closing or returns the deposit to the buyer under certain circumstance.

Previous scam reports should put you on alert of course.  But with the details you've given nothing sounds scammy at this point, but the devil is in the details as usual.  My random guess is he is probably a wholesaler that is way overpromising as that attracts this type of thing. Nothing necessarily illegal about wholesaling as long as they keep it in the straight in narrow but most wholesalers get tempted and veer outside and overstep their bounds.

In addition to police you if he is acting illegally, practicing law without a license, misappropriating funds, or other malicious things you can usually report him to the state professional services regulators.

"I'm in Largo. I don't drink so my suggestions are all sober stuff.

St Pete fairgrounds is really cool! I could have stayed there all day. The pier is also very nice (but was too crowded the last time we tried to go.) I love the Dali. As a bonus, in that area there are two banyan trees near the bay that are gorgeous. In Tampa there's the museum of art and the Tampa theatre which is really neat inside. 

We have a lot of great escape rooms in the area, and with the pandemic if you book for two people almost always you're going to be able to do it privately. Tampa Bay escape rooms has two locations in Clearwater and Largo. If you've never done an escape room the mad hatter room is their ""easy"" one, and wizards keep is really cool and can probably be done with just two people. DM me if you want to go, I have a 10% off promo.

Bonus if you're at downtown Clearwater you can stare at the scientologists walking around and try to imagine what kind of stuff is going on in their creepy buildings lol.

William Dean chocolates is right near Largo. They're a fancy local chocolatier and they are *amazing."" Their chocolates were flown to the set of the hunger games to be served in the scenes at the Capitol, they're that cool looking. And you can book a high tea if you like experiences like that.

If you want to drive and it's still October, Scream A Geddon is a great time. To the south, Sarasota is a cool place and I love the Ringling museum.",t2_5qmc8l7f,affablysurreal,0,1635342706.0,0,t1_hi8wfxa,hi8wfxa,True,ggcdigital,t3_qgwrlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClearwaterFl/comments/qgwrlr/fun_things_for_a_birthday/,Fun things for a birthday,/r/ClearwaterFl/comments/qgwrlr/fun_things_for_a_birthday/hi8wfxa/,3,r/ClearwaterFl,0,3

"So it's pretty rare to see something that's not just ""hike through the woods."" We're completely flat and if there's even a small waterfall within a few hours' drive of here I'd be devastated because I love them and I've never seen one in the area. I usually head up to North Georgia and further for hiking.

Any hikes you do are going to basically be through swampland, but that's still cool! Just gotta manage expectations. I've really enjoyed hiking along the outside of Honeymoon island (*not* the trail, park at the furthest beach and walk along the coast, all the way to the tip.) It's got some great shells and really cool bent trees and stuff.

I also like Brooker Creek Preserve, but I can't say it's more than ""a walk through the woods,"" it's just my favorite of those around here.

If you go to homassasa springs state park there's a large area that you walk through that's got wildlife exhibits with monkeys, a hippo, birds, etc. and you can see manatees depending on the time of the year. 

Where you're staying, up in Crystal River, is mostly going to be full of people hanging out with cases of beer on their fishing boats. I'm mentioning it because it was surprising to me when I did a staycation there. I thought I might see some quiet nature but it was a lot of people fishing, and drinking, and loud music.
