"Hello, OP :) I’m 25 and moved here a few years ago from CA! 

Usually my favorite places are outdoors. I don’t hear many people talk about Browns Woods or Walnut Woods but they’re beautiful and so close to each other, just in West Des Moines! Maffitt Lake is also like a 6 min drive from Walnut Woods and worth the drive over

If you feel like going for a 30 min drive from Downtown, Jester Park in Granger is a cool place to see some buffalo and elk! 

As for thrift stores, I love the Salvation Army dt and usually hit gold but I’ve had someone tell me it’s their least favorite so you may have to be the judge lol. The Picker Knows in west Des Moines is a fun place to shop too but it’s more antiques and cools finds.

"There’s a gravel road off the highway between Madrid and Woodward with a little parking lot that’s not even a mile from the bridge. There’s signage pointing towards it.

And I’m not making this up at all. I’ve talked to probably close to 10 ex-employees. Their business is literally set up to condemn as many units as they can. They wholesale purchase their equipment and their technicians are told to meet a monthly quota.

No one has “the right to speak unfettered in a public forum” outside of the *governing body* not silencing you for criticizing it.

The right, and whatever you land on, has a gross misunderstanding of what the first amendment and freedom of speech is, and what it protects. And you, specifically, also seem to have a gross misunderstanding of what fascism is. I haven’t seen anyone on the left advocate for the detainment or jailing of anyone for “wrongthink” or having an opinion they don’t like. The left isn’t trying to use a governing body to enforce their opinion and silence anyone else.

What they are doing is using their right to assemble to drown out opinions they find distasteful. And again, it’s perfectly within your rights to disapprove of that tactic, as I do, personally.

"We've been using Fi since they pretty much opened up to the public in 2016. Overall it's been a great experience.  My Husband and I share a plan and it's a little over $100 a month with the data plan we choose, device protection and using data.

Only complaints we've had is that the phones can be a bit expensive to buy outright. If I remember correctly we needed to replace one phone because my data never worked and trying to get help through support was worthless. We also had battery issues which ended up being part of a class action lawsuit that we received a small check for. Just this month we needed to replace our pixel phones because they bricked themselves after a software upgrade that apparently wasn't covered by device protection. We also learned the hard way that when you upgrade your phone, device protection doesn't roll over to the new phone, so we were paying almost two years for phones we didn't have. We travel a lot to Arkansas, Washington and Oregon and never have any issues with reception or  connecting to open wireless networks along the way to save on data.

Overall those problems haven't been enough to get us to cancel service.

Be careful saying much about it or they will treat you like a junkie especially in a red state and it will be on your medical record forever.

"Part of freedom of speech means I get to tell you to shut up if I want to. What you’re proposing is a system in which everyone can just say whatever they want and there are zero consequences or consideration of time and place. It’s not fascism to push someone out of a space. It’s only fascism when the governing body enforces it. Private citizens teaming up to drown somebody out isn’t fascism.

And by the way, dollars to donuts those “fascists” already knew what that person’s opinion was, and weren’t so much “afraid” of it as they were tired of the same bullshit.

For instance, I automatically tell anyone who says the 2020 election was rigged to shut the fuck up and think they should stop expressing their dumbass opinion. I’m not *afraid* of that opinion, I’m just dead ass tired of hearing it all the fucking time.

"Good for you. If you don't see the value in supporting a local business, I don't know what else to say to you. I didn't ""have to make a phone call"" to get the record I want. I chose to do so because it's important to me that I do as much of my spending locally as I can. 

Amazon will not keep an eye out for that 45 of The Green Door by Jim Lowe on the original Dot label and hold it for you if it ever turns up. How about the vintage blues I mentioned? Or old school rap original pressings? Does Amazon have any of that? No. I bet Amazon wouldn't have been able to connect me with the guy who had some rare Nirvana records that I was able to acquire, along with a huge batch of other garage and early grunge 7"" records. 

My money stays local. Yours does not.

Amazon does not offer service. You're confusing an algorithm for personal service. They aren't the same thing. You sure as hell won't meet any new friends or other like minded individuals on Amazon. They facilitate separating you from your dollars.

"I like ZZZ. It's an excellent shop with very fair prices, and Nate's a super nice guy. ZZZ is always my first call when I'm looking for something, and it's my first stop if I'm just out looking to spend some walking around money.

I don't often buy new vinyl, but when I do, I always ask Nate if he can get it for me before I try anywhere else. He almost always comes through, even for the more challenging titles. I don't think I've ever spent more than an extra $5 or so, and sometimes he comes in lower than online pricing.

For example, I recently decided that I want to add Deee-Lite's album, World Clique, to my collection. I contacted Nate to inquire. He had a copy on hand and offered to hold it for me. Obviously, I accepted the offer. He also keeps a list of specific records that his customers are looking for. I've gotten a few that way, too, and I hold out hope for a few others. Most of the stuff I like is in the used section, and still in short supply: vintage blues and old school rap in particular, also late-60s - early-80s funk.

"HyVee on the outside seemed pretty good to me.  Big contributor to the community and a health driven mission. Once inside, as long as you are not soaked in the Kool-Aid, you begin to see the deception and manipulation everywhere.  I think there are a lot of good people working there but at the top are some crafty, ego driven, rich people spending the retirement investments of the people who supposedly own it.  The average employee has no visibility into anything shareholder related and yet collectively they hold a massive amount of the shares in the company.  Only director level and above can attend the shareholder meetings and they are hush hush.  1st rule about being ""staff"" at HyVee?  Don't talk about the shareholder's meetings.

On the other side of things, I do believe that a lot of companies do some of the moonshot sort of stuff that HyVee does but they aren't dumb enough to use their own name.  All of the weird concept stores are an expensive way to do market research I suppose but using the HyVee brand dilutes the value of that brand and makes them look unfocused and sloppy.  Which maybe they are.

"I was getting Indeed emails asking me to apply for a marketing coordinator job there like 3 weeks ago. I had a friend who just graduated at ISU and was a graphic designer for them. He got an email on Saturday saying he needed to be in the office on Monday morning for a meeting. Him and 200 others were at the meeting to be mass fired. 

Hy-Vee said they’re outsourcing their marketing team now and they can apply for their third-party provider, but said they didn’t even know if they were currently hiring.

I’d assume that they’re just worried about how competitive the grocery game is getting in Iowa. But I really have no idea.

"I don't disagree with you one bit about them wasting money.  All the sports sponsorships, indy cars, Mark Wahlberg are all ridiculously stupid.  They're in talks of being a co-sponsor for the packers as they have a store in green bay opening later this year (I believe).  They've already made it clear they're going to try to sponsor the Tennessee titans when they get down there.  What's the purpose of having your name plastered everywhere anyone that would potentially be a customer has already heard of you and formed their opinion if they're going to be a customer.  Sure, run commercials for your specials or whatever but just having your name? Cmon man.  That's the other thing, they moved corporate staff down to the Nashville TN area to start scoping out land for stores.  They're planning to build a warehouse down there but currently have 4 up here (Chariton, Cherokee, PDI/Ankeny, and Lomar (DSM) in addition to a few other small places.  They're talking about only opening up 12 or so stores down there yet you're going to put product from 4 different warehouses into 1 massive complex?  It'd be more cost effective I'd think to have them run to stores down there out of the existing DCs here then pickup loads that are currently outsourced on their way back home.  Make sure you're going to be profitable down there before investing even more money into this.  Of course Hy-vee doesn't think that way though.  After all they put like 5 million dollars into a remodel in the quad cities (Moline #2) then shut it down a couple months later. They just shut down a Sioux Falls store and are sinking $4 million remodeling into a regional bakery for the stores up that way. If you've been to the Ames store on the Eastside of town every couple months they're ripping their flooring out because the water table is so high and it seeps through making the tiles come loose and glue holding them down useless.  That was part of their $4.5 million dollar remodel.  Great work! 

Has anybody actually seen their security?  If I go inside a store it's usually earlier in the day and I haven't seen them.  However, when I worked there some stores up in the Twin Cities had 3rd party security guards working in the stores that had issues with theft.

Don't even get me started on the washer/dryers you can now buy at some stores, the online pet supplies crap.  Why would anybody want to buy appliances at a grocery store?  I can only imagine how overpriced they are.  The grills they try to sell during the summer are usually $200 more than you'd get for the exact same thing at Walmart or Lowes.",t2_jvi45gr0,Special-Opening9925,0,1648045387.0,0,t1_i1sqqkd,i1sqqkd,False,Silver_Ad_8948,t3_tkipzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/desmoines/comments/tkipzt/whats_going_on_at_hyvee_corporate/,What's going on at Hy-Vee Corporate?,/r/desmoines/comments/tkipzt/whats_going_on_at_hyvee_corporate/i1sqqkd/,3,r/desmoines,0,3
