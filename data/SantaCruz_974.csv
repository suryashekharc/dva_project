"I grew up here riding the bus here in SC. The bus system here is a lot better than people seem to want to give it credit for.  Having lived in/traveled to other cities in the world, my experience of public transit showed me buses, trains, bikes, and yes, cars, can all benefit each other for traffic flow. Using buses, trains, and bikes, helps get commuter traffic off the road, this is something that hasn‚Äôt been planned for very well in our sector of hwy 1 and in some areas seems like only magic could expand it wider than it already is. Our heaviest traffic through town is North/South so it would make sense that a train would also run parallel to this direction. In conjunction to the train running through town, the bus system could offer more frequent East/West services throughout the county as support for train riders getting to destinations that aren‚Äôt readily walkable. Trains can also support more bicyclists, surfboards, and family size groups, which our county seems to attract an extra serving of in the summer. 
For many years I lived in Minneapolis/St. Paul where once upon a time there used to be an extensive rail and trolley line that connected not just the cities and it‚Äôs neighborhoods to each other but also the cities to its suburbs. The city wanted to convert to solely a bus system and paved over all its track. Now years later, they realized the train is a more valuable asset to public transit and are spending millions of dollars to put track back in. Hey so I know this one track isn‚Äôt going to solve all our transit problems, and for some of us, we won‚Äôt see it solved in our lifetime, but what it can be is a first step towards something that actually can be a better system. At least it can open the door to possibility of long range development.

And besides fuck it who knows maybe someday they will build a crazy commuter train to San Jose, but why would anyone believe in a project like that if SC doesn‚Äôt even have a train to connect to.",t2_z2n16,qerious,0,1648282780.0,0,t1_i2660go,i2660go,False,nyanko_the_sane,t3_tl00kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/santacruz/comments/tl00kd/0331_coastal_rail_trail_segments_8_and_9_virtual/,(03/31) Coastal Rail Trail Segments 8 and 9 Virtual Open House,/r/santacruz/comments/tl00kd/0331_coastal_rail_trail_segments_8_and_9_virtual/i2660go/,1,r/santacruz,0,1

"I'm in the area with a young child too. Our favorite parks are Leo's Haven (locally known as 'the new park on chanticleer'), Jade St Park, Anna Jean Cummings ('blue ball park' - the jokes are endless, and yes there are actually big blue balls there), and we walk to Floral Park on 38th-but that one is pretty small and outdated. Floral park is typically a small stop on the way to the beach. Which beach is usually dependant on the tide and how much effort we are giving (sand toys are heavier than they look, I swear).

We do a mix of shopping between Trader Joe's, Safeway and Lucky depending on time and whether we are getting it delivered or not. Target is not reliable for family style groceries, but they have the basics and we stop by once a week for one thing or another. 

The museum of discovery in the Capitola mall is pretty great for indoor activities for kids under 7 with lots of play areas and events. There's another kids place there - Giggles and Wiggles, hours can be somewhat unreliable. Junebugs gym is a nice place for toddler style gymnastics, and they even have a parents night out. 

Capitola library is the newest library in the county and pretty cool. A nice kids area with a playground outside and great new facilities. I've even find a few books that haven't been ""cracked"" yet!

Safeway (on mission) also has good deals on beef occasionally. I get family packs of Tbone and tritip for under $10 a lb. When they have deals, theyre usually pretty good. Never buy anything here that isnt ""on sale"" unless you wanna overpay substantially.

Trader Joes is the best for produce, spices, cheeses, frozen foods, and wine. In terms of cost to quality. As you stated, theyre limited and their meat is insanely expensive. 

Whole Foods has a deals once in a blue moon. Their produce is top notch but dont think about buying it unless its on sale, unless you like paying $8 a lb for apples.

Target in Capitola is the best place to buy pantry goods, always low price,  but vertly limited on produce and meat",t2_fsaau,ssjhook,0,1648227874.0,0,t1_i235ia0,i235ia0,True,astralthg,t3_tn8ubr,https://www.reddit.com/r/santacruz/comments/tn8ubr/grocery_stores/,Grocery Stores,/r/santacruz/comments/tn8ubr/grocery_stores/i235ia0/,3,r/santacruz,0,3

"Grocery outlet. Especially more pantry and frozen stuff. And some produce is definitely the best deal there. If you are a meat eater I‚Äôd say wait till Safeway has their crazy meat sales. 

The food bin and herb room. I actually haven‚Äôt been to the food bin much but might be worth checking out. The herb room has an excellent selection of dry/bulk goods including soaps which is awesome!

I also highly recommend going to the farmers market and buy directly / local. You would have to eat more seasonally which may take some getting used to. I haven‚Äôt been to the sc ones in a minute but I go to the Los Gatos one all the time and there‚Äôs a stand that sells 20$ produce boxes that‚Äôs full ofgoodies. 

There‚Äôs also the flea market on the weekends on Soquel ave! I think its fri-sun.

"Across the board, most of the delis in town are pretty lackluster. Pretty sure zoccolis and garden deli both use microwaves for their hot sandwiches, but garden deli makes their pastrami in house which puts them in a better standing, they're also extremely consistent and always deliver a good product for the best price. I'd recommend them over most other options.

The chain places (Ike's, Togo's, beach hut and Jersey Mike's) are exactly what you'd expect from a chain. Other local spots like Surf city or seabright deli can be good but are also pretty expensive compared to other options (think $15 for a sandwich, plus a side and drink you're approaching $30 with tip). 

Nothing against all of these mentioned spots as I do support them for the most part, but I also find myself making sandwiches at home more than eating out. Growing up on the east coast you're spoiled with New York heros, grinders and bbq subs in the south, the bar is set pretty high.

"Sounds like you want to vote no on the Greenway measure then. The core idea of the Greenway people is to remove all reference to rail from the county's transportation plan because they're apparently afraid of trains. This is what the measure is actually about. If this ballot measure actually passes, then the county will be forced to rip out all the rails and pave over them. They claim that they are doing this in such a way that the rails can be put back in later (""railbanking"") but no rail route that has been railbanked and paved over [has *ever* been put back in.](https://www.nowaygreenway.com/railbanking)

The people in charge of this are very shrewd though and decided to frame the issue as ""yes bike path"" rather than ""no trains"" because the truth is much less palatable. In reality, there is *already* going to be a bike path all the way from Watsonville to Davenport that will mostly run right next to the train tracks, so this isn't some new thing they're proposing. If their measure passes, the building of the bike path will actually [take *longer* and be *more* expensive](https://www.nowaygreenway.com/hidden-agenda) because they will have to remove the rails first and redo all of the planning that has already taken place for the existing rail + trail plan, and the county will have to return grant money they already have that was supposed to be for rail transit.

"Well, you're not wrong. Scotts Valley has changed *a lot* since 1996.  

If you crossed the highway and went left to get to school, you would have been at the north end of town. Potentially even outside the city limits, since it's only 2 miles from one end of town to the other. At the north end of town, just west of the highway, there's a place called Santos Pond..I was not allowed to go there as a kid, so I can't attest to crawdads or a rope swing. That pond is now inside the Glenwood  Open Space Preserve, which is accessible from the back side of Vine Hill Elementary, or across the road from Scotts Valley High School.

Your comments about there being an incline on the way to school make me wonder if you might have been south of town. Generally, the terrain slopes up as you go north, and down as you go south toward the coast. Still, 2-3 miles away from the middle school would have had you outside the city limits...but on the same side of the highway as the middle school. I'm not aware of any ponds on that side of town (but that doesn't mean they aren't or weren't there).

The many shade trees you refer to are going to make it mostly impossible to find a given property with satellite views, unfortunately.

"It‚Äôs private past the median high tide line. 

In practice, this is rarely ever enforced at any of the ‚Äúprivate,‚Äù beaches around here. Though I‚Äôve not tried to camp overnight on the actual sand anywhere around here. But during the day - never been harassed. 

I have had the opposite though, where I was on a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù beach and a State Parks ranger driving through had issue with what I was doing. 

For bon fires, you almost always need a fire ring to be legal. I have used a mini webber BBQ as a fire ring. You can also buy actual portable fire rings. 

Don‚Äôt burn wood on the bare sand. Bad juju. 

Also: If you look on a satellite map, there are some remote beaches that no one talks about and you‚Äôre rarely ever gonna see a ranger**. I‚Äôm not gonna name them but if you get creative, you‚Äôll find them.
 There‚Äôs miles of sand in the bay that hardly anyone ever goes to because they aren‚Äôt near a city center. You‚Äôll have better luck there.

"Cupcake stores just don‚Äôt really make it. The craze about them gave a lot of home bakers the idea that they can do it too, but the reality of owning a bakery or restaurant is that you‚Äôre probably going to fail. And if you aren‚Äôt failing you‚Äôre probably running in the red for the first 5 years. 

Unless you‚Äôre doing something new and groundbreaking in terms of presentation, flavors, or even store atmosphere, (preferably all 3) youre just going to be another cupcake store. 

The upside is that cupcakes are pretty cemented into American baking culture. If you have them, someone will buy them. The downfall is the side of the same coin. A cupcake is a cupcake is a cupcake. Why spend 5 dollars on a single one at a bakery when I can buy 12 for 8 at Walmart? Most people aren‚Äôt discerning enough to care that the frosting is real buttercream from the bakery and just whipped crisco from the Walmart one.  Plus, you can‚Äôt do much to the blueprint of a cupcake because then people will say it‚Äôs not a cupcake anymore. Playing with the idea of presentation in a molecular gastronomy restaurant as a plated dessert is expected, doing so in a town bakery is not.

"Look to join a club or group or meet-up that relates to a hobby or interest that you have.  Then you will be more socially comfortable because there is common ground, an activity to focus on and it‚Äôs not just some random social scene that is hard to break into and make inane small talk.  Don‚Äôt worry, most people have this problem and in college people make friends based on dorm living, fraternities, or social clubs around their interests (sports, religion, ethnicity, or hobbies like being a dj at the college radio station, following a certain band, gaming, politics, humanitarian work, etc.). Don‚Äôt be afraid to try some new activity like ultimate frisbee or something, college is where you get to try all kinds of different things.  Also if you try a bunch of different clubs then  the stakes are lower when one or some of them don‚Äôt end up being your thing.  As time goes on you will find that you know more and more people if you are open and friendly.  By the end of your time at college you will feel like you own the place lol.  Good luck!
