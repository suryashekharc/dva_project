"I'm a little slow, is broward county going to start renting out hotel rooms? Who actually owns this thing...

Short story from today adding to where broward county gov priorities are.

I called up broward parks earlier asking them why they use a non official-basketball backboard at a park I went to. They transferred the call to whomever ran the individual park I went to.  Long story short the backboards are most likely local made backdoor dealing non-official in any way shape or form, garbage. Told her the backboards are so bad that it'll turn kids off from the sport all together.

The lady replied with kids play on the courts all the time and even the summer league. I replied with because the kids don't know any better or have any other choice. She listed off all the parks in the worst parts of ft lauderdale where they happened to install these monstrosities.

You can tell how much people care about their park when they won't even replace tattered nets that look like they've been that way for 2 years.",t2_jqqkh9za,JustBangedYourMom,0,1648252955.0,0,t1_i24tdo8,i24tdo8,True,UnButtHole,t3_to1sir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broward/comments/to1sir/broward_uses_140m_in_covid_funds_to_build_luxury/,Broward uses $140M in COVID funds to build luxury hotel,/r/Broward/comments/to1sir/broward_uses_140m_in_covid_funds_to_build_luxury/i24tdo8/,5,r/Broward,0,5

"That's a good question ... maybe they are:

\-or- 

\- **Owners**, who owned the manufactured homes, but *not* the properties (being the lot), underneath?

Either way...were they scammed? Depends on how to look at it.

If you have ***x-amount*** of money, and you ***need to/want*** to live ***x-******place*** ... then you reside in ***x-home,*** whether or not you rent or own.

Where they aware of the risks?

I'm sure if they are asked:

\- ""... do you think that your manufactured/mobile home will get blown away in a hurricane...?"" 

Their answer would be ""...yes, I understand the risk, however I like it here and can afford it..."".  

If they are asked: 

""... will the landowner sell the plot of land underneath me, with less than thirty days notice, for no reason?"" 

Their answer would probably be: 

\- ""...No. I didn't understand that would be a risk. Who would, and what kind of person would do such a thing?""

"I bike the boardwalk almost every night.  I have an electric bike, but i keep the power set to either off or the lowest setting while im there.   I keep my speed in the normal bicycle range. The biggest problem i see is fucking cellphones.

Doesnt matter if they are walking/biking/blading. the people who are causing accidents are the ones staring down at their phone and not paying attention to the world around them.  They are also the ones who blame everyone else when they get hit/have a near miss after wandering directly in front of moving traffic.

The other thing is dogs.  Lost of people walking their dog throught the most crowded areas, or on at least 2 occasions, shitting directly under the ""no pets"" signs.

The big surrey bikes do take up alot of room and i could almost see the justification for those, but even then, i think its excessive.

"It's a bit ironic.  

The lockdowns, which Florida wasn't even apart of, hurt small business and boosted large retailers which in turn pumped up the stock market.  So the rich got richer and bought up all the property. 

Coupled with people fleeing heavily 'blue' states due to high tax, oppressive covid restrictions, crumbling communities with shit politics and roaming homeless camps for more 'red' states like FL, TX and TN.  Is it any wonder money and people are flooding into these areas and 'gentrifying' everything to unaffordable and over populated levels?

"Honestly, I think it's a sad situation. The idea of being able to reach some comfort or financial security in life through hard work and smart financial decisions feels like a lie. This American dream requires an increasing level of privilege through generational wealth, luck or a combination of the two.

I understand it's not any one individual or entities' fault. It's many decisions and factors that got us to this point.

Why not take the higher offer? The house next door did it. So lucky I got this house when I did!

Why not take the all cash buyer? No need to wait for lender approval! Who cares if they have a pre-approval letter!

Why take an offer that doesn't skip appraisals or inspections? I have dozens of offers on my desk, sometimes within 24-48 hours, and so many others are skipping those!

This situation, and the reverse of it, is not a good sign. I think a lot of care, analyses, and smart decision making needs to be done to keep a balance. To prevent this ""Free Market"" from being an extreme seller's market or an extreme buyer's market. So it behaves more like a bowling ball that can move in any direction on the lane, but has guard rails from keeping it out of the gutters.

It's not like we're in a truly free market, and the current setup is skewing more and more to benefit certain groups of people. I think it causes increasing instability. I don't have the answers, but I feel we can do better. 

I think we should aim for a society where children and their children should be better off than us.

Worse - KG, Copans just South of Dixie.  Runner up in the area is Cresthaven the neighborhood just North and east of Copans and Dixie.

Worst - Probably a toss up of Old Collier City, the area west of Power line and North of Atlantic and  ""Cross Town / The Bayou"" MLK as it gets East of 95 to Dixie. Runner up in the area is  ""Cypress / Cb county"" both misleading names for the area just South of Atlantic and Dixie on the West side going to about McNab.

Good - Highlands , the area just North of Sample and East of Dixie. Runner up is probably North part of Cresthaven.

Better - Old Pompano , South of Copans to Altnatic on the East side of Dixie runner up is the real Cypress Area of Pompano , South of McNab , Lyons park mentioned by another user is part of this.

Best - for actual city limits Palm Aire , the area South of Atlantic and West of Power line stretching South to McNab if you like an older crowd, any place East of Federal on Atlantic if you want to be by the beach.

"One of the main reasons you are in the situation that you are in is because years ago blue stream was called Advanced Cable Communications and they had a deal with the City of Coral Springs to be the sole ISP for the city. When I worked for Comcast I lived in Coral Springs and I was supposed to receive free service as part of my employment but because I was a Advanced Cable customer rather than a Comcast customer, there wasn't anything they could do. 

I tried for a couple of years to get AT&T or Comcast in my area and they just kept telling me they're not allowed to bring services in there. In your area they may have changed to allow those providers to come in however because they've only recently gained access to that area they have not invested in the infrastructure.

I'm over in North Lauderdale/ Tamarac area and they just brought AT&T fiber in this zone about 4 years ago. I would just try to reach out to AT&T and hound them about fiber services in your area. If they get enough requests they might prioritize bringing services to your area.

Here are some things which may help your situation:

* expand your housing choices to go beyond 1 block from the Atlantic Ocean
* look for housing on housing sites, not vacation rental sites
* be willing to not be self-employed

"You might give Teri Arbogast a call, she sold me my house.

"I hear you 100%. However,  investors are not inflating rent on a whole. While there are exceptions to every rule,  a majority of investors are only renting units for the going rate. I put a house for rent in Plantation on the market for $3k a month. Plantation is a high demand city. My property is in great condition and the showings are through the roof. I get in all kinds of offers, including offers for $3500/month. It's a good offer with great credit,  no eviction background and no criminal history. They're willing to put down first last and security.  I take it. According to mls rules I have to publicly list what i rented it for. Now, Joe up the street sees I got $3500 for my property and he wants to change his from $2700 to $3k. Even though my property is nicer,  people still want to live in Plantain. That,  my friend,  is what typically drives up pricing. This also influences surrounding areas. If rentals increase in Plantation,  then Sunrise rentals will increase as well. If I can't afford Plantation, I can afford Sunrise. So now demand to live in Sunrise increases because the people cannot afford to live in Plantation still want to live close and move to Sunrise and this rents go up. Home owners wouldn't have it any other way as the increase in rental value increases their home sale value.  It's actually one of the very few ""Free Market"" examples still left in our society. Everyone loves capitalism until it prices them out of the things they want and need. If you have Real Estate Agent working for you, they should be reaching out to the listing agent and asking what's important to the landlord.

"Where to start‚Ä¶.the restaurant itself is absolutely disgusting. The back dining room (not show room) attached to the lanai area is infested with bugs. They‚Äôre behind the wallpaper. The roof leaks. There are rats in the kitchen and feral cats that they keep around‚Ä¶to kill the rats. They have a soft serve machine that NEVER got cleaned (supposed to be nightly). No one in the kitchen took the nozzles off the soda machines to clean them. All of the ice in the restaurant comes from a machine‚Ä¶in the cigarette break room. That same ‚Äúroom‚Äù is attached to the kitchen and only separated by rubber flaps, not even a real door‚Ä¶and it has or used to have a fridge that housed all of the restaurant‚Äôs chicken. If you ever ate there and thought your honey chicken tasted like cigarettes, it‚Äôs because it did. In the big walk in, it wasn‚Äôt abnormal for melted ice cream or milk products to be sitting on top of defrosting meat. Most of the drinks on their menu are pre-mixed and sit for days in jugs. Servers and room captains *always* drank from the Mai tais and rum barrels before bringing them out to the guests. In terms of the wait staff, cocaine is a huge problem there, like most restaurants. *everyone* is racist. The seating/front desk staff and room captains had a word for black families that was explained to me as the Polynesian version of the N word. If you were a darker skinned individual eating at the Mai kai, your ticket said you were a ‚Äúpopolo‚Äù or a ‚Äúpopo‚Äù. I know of two people working there who were subsequently arrested for pedophilia. One busboy (who also regularly worked the kid show on Sunday mornings) and a room captain. The catering manager was known for putting his hand down the server‚Äôs pants. The owner Mr Levi was notorious for exposing himself to young women while working. The girls who worked in the bar had to weigh in once a week before clocking in. The restaurant itself was struggling financially for years. They used to use a tiny bank in Oakland park and were constantly overdrawn, to the point where the bank wouldn‚Äôt allow staff to cash their checks. To this day they still owe me thousands. It was also in complete disarray. The roof in the main dining area (near the stage) was being held together by literal staple guns and trash bags). Ever wonder why it‚Äôs so dark in there and the waiters have to carry flashlights? It‚Äôs to hide the holes in the ceiling.
