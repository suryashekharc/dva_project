"Casa Video is a cool place to hang with a group, they have tables and play films inside. There‚Äôs also board games you can play, they host regular trivia and it‚Äôs fun to browse movies :) They have a bar that serves alcohol but it doesn‚Äôt have that typical bar feel. And personally I am sober but I have friends who aren‚Äôt so they can drink and I can buy a soda there and still have a great time! 

I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre familiar with the MSA Annex but I really like hanging out there with friends. There is cute little shops, cool stuff on the weekends and great outdoor seating. 
Not to mention it‚Äôs just a stones throw away from the Mercado which also has cool little eateries and a coffee shop to explore. 

And I know others have said it but there is some solid hiking spots in Tucson. Which I guess might be harder to do with friends if not everyone in the group is into it. I like going to parks more I think with friends. Sitting at a table and talking or even bringing food to a park is fun.

Every mid-sized metropolis these days has their own kickball league. The least-skilled and most-boozy of all the sports. Start there if you're uncertain.

"In 1959 I lived at the corner of Randolph Parkway and East 26th Street.  The B47s flew so low we could see the men in the cockpit.  It was noisy and my bedroom lit up when they went over at night.

There were not many homes to the east of us and south of 22nd st.  

When I went to the U of A the profs might have to stop for a minute when the planes flew over, many F4s, some U2s.

All this time the city of Tucson grew to the east and the base has contribute jobs and income to the Tucson economy.

Today I am appalled by the selfish cry babies who moved into homes and apartments in the area.  Davis-Monthan AFB has  been there since 1925.  It has contributed to the Tucson/Pima County community in many very positive ways.  

People who definitely did not live near there when I did, and moved into homes in the flight path, call for closure of the base or change of mission.  These cry babies need to shut up or move.

"My local Fry's produce section has stepped up their game recently. 

I don't know if it's the cheapest, but reasonable compared to others right now. 



Otherwise I will go to the food rescue. But I need the day to process and plan. I've volunteered with them and if a piece of produce is 70% or more okay then include it. Otherwise it goes to compost/chickens.

It's all on the verge of being over ripe or might be a bit bruised. But if I have a week I'll pop over and get my boxes and can, dry, freeze what I get. 

$12 for 50-70lbs (weight depending on the week).

"This is another tool for riders to use to stay safe. I've seen arguments for it elsewhere that there are mechanical considerations for older motorcycles. They need to keep moving to avoid overheating. Or arguments that we want to be at the front of the pack with all of that gear on when it's 120 outside. To avoid getting stuck through multiple light cycles. Those are great points and all, but the core of it is safety. A tool to use to avoid getting rear ended. It won't always be possible and I will be real cautious about when I use it. Especially with the way the drivers have been wildin' out around here. 

Currently, I stop towards the right or left of the lane. Whichever provides the best path where I can maneuver towards the side of the car in-front of me, if necessary. It has been necessary at least three times so far. 

It's a great practice. Making sure you have escape paths and are ready to go at a moment's notice. But being able to filter will be even better.

"While we do have a big military base here, I don't think we would realistically be a big nuclear target. Primary nuclear targets would be our ability for nuclear retaliation, and other countries ability to retaliate. Denser population centers would likely be hit next for the psychological impact.

DMAFB would be a poor target as would other airfields as they could/would scramble to get their assets out of harms way. And in theory have the best chances of intercepting a missile.

Better targets are major power plants, pipelines and strategic resource stockpiles.

By the time we're reached on the targeting list, your probably best running towards it as there's going to be no power, fuel or food to go around.

In short, you are unambiguously and objectively incorrect in your assertion that building more housing would not solve the problem.

> but it will make real estate investors a lot of money

It's good for housing developers to make money. We want them to have financial incentives to build additional housing. Our cities need it! People should be rewarded when they provide valuable things to society. Is is good for there to be incentives for people to provide valuable goods and services.

> There is plenty of ""supply"" of ""affordable"" housing. There isn't plenty of land owners willing to share it.

So, in other words, there is not enough actual supply of housing. In the real world, people don't do things out of the goodness of their hearts. They respond to actual, tangible incentives. That is the reality that we have to contend with in solving this problem.

"> This is a survey of people from 2012

A survey of some of the world's most respected economists. And the fundamentals of economics have not changed since 2012.

> And it does not represent an economic consensus

Yes, it does. Housing economics are complicated, and perhaps I'm oversimplifying things, but the long term effects of price controls are not really in question.

https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181289

""Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15 percent by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law.""

https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/

""Rent control appears to help affordability in the short run for current tenants, but in the long-run decreases affordability, fuels gentrification, and creates negative externalities on the surrounding neighborhood. These results highlight that forcing landlords to provide insurance to tenants against rent increases can ultimately be counterproductive.""

> greedy people are bad

Whining about greed isn't going to convince anyone to build more housing! However, I can guarantee that implementing rent control measures would discourage developers from building the additional housing which is sorely needed in Tucson and many other American cities.",t2_56dja801,COLORADO_RADALANCHE,1,1648140698.0,0,t1_i1y9cn5,i1y9cn5,False,alsetkin,t3_tlyx5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tucson/comments/tlyx5c/tucson_tenants_protest_rent_hike_at_monterey/,Tucson tenants protest rent hike at Monterey Garden Apartments,/r/Tucson/comments/tlyx5c/tucson_tenants_protest_rent_hike_at_monterey/i1y9cn5/,-6,r/Tucson,0,-6

"Standard comment: Tucson is a patchwork of nicer and not nicer neighborhoods right next to each other.  Unless you get way north there's not a single area that is universally ""nice"".

That said if you can visit before you commit to a place,  do.

My own personal guidance: look around.  If people trust each other enough to leave out stuff like yard ornaments, furniture, bbqs, etc its a nicer area.  If it's full of chain link fence,  big guard dogs and junk, avoid.   Also look at the cars people have.  If they're all beat up and yours isn't, yours would be the target.  If your car looks like it's on par with the others around it, you'll be more likely to be okay.

"I was raised here. I went to Henry Elementary school which is on the eastside near Harrison and Speedway tucked back in a residential area. I have good memories of it but Tucson was much much different then.With that said I believe that area is still good although it has grown like everywhere.

I swam at friends houses but it was never the foremost activity, it was more after riding bikes , etc and by the time I hit H.S. I pretty much never swam. My dad never wanted a pool because the maintenance and cost. Looking back now I would agree with him but at the time as a young kid of course I wanted one.

For green grass and foilage a park is yourbest bet and the largest park is Reid park located central Tucson. Where I grew up it was (probably still is) Jesse owens park around Broadway and Sarnoff.

The eastside is also probably your best bet for hiking, fishing, biking. You have close access to Mt Lemmon and Reddington pass as well as SR 83 which leads to Sonoita/Patagonia area and if urban fishing was your thing also Lakeside park is in that area.

On the westside you have Kennedy park for green grass and fishing as well as the Tucson mountains for hiking/biking

"Not to defend them, but more to point out how the writer manipulates their reader here, the author says in the article that ‚Äúher former one-bedroom one-bathroom starts at $1,225‚Äù wanting us to think that her rent went from $840 to $1225. Why not say what her rent went to instead of saying what a new tenant will pay? A 45% rent increase is on the extreme side. The experience I have and others have in the industry would lead us to question this article. I might be wrong about this person‚Äôs situation since Arizona doesn‚Äôt have a law on rent increases. I do know though that increasing a tenant‚Äôs rent 45% is not standard. Charging new tenants that $1225 price is standard though. Rent goes up over time and always will.

"Yeah they are all Pea/legume family but different subspecies. 
Fabaceae aka pea family is one of the few plant families that have distinct characteristics that are consistent throughout all varying species. 
 1) The flowers all have the same flower,wing, and keel patterning 
2) opposite and opposed (pinnate) leaf patterns

"So when you unlock your Wallet with a double-click of the sleep button, it doesn‚Äôt unlock the rest of the phone. When they dismiss the Wallet it takes a second ID scan to unlock the rest of the phone.

As for grass the short answer is some communities offer that but most newer ones ban it.  The long answer is its very high maintenance and EXTREMELY wasteful on water. There are surprisingly nice astroturf options if you really can't live without it.  However, desert land scaping can be lovely once you get used to it.  We have some beautiful flowering trees and bushes that do well here for instance. Some of the city parks have nice pet grass too.  Reid Park I believe does. 

As for pools... theyre very common.  Do you think you'll use it a lot? If so, it might be worth it. Most people who have them seem to not use them a lot and kinda regret them though.  Better to find friends with pools if that's you.  However, yes they can be used year round,  often without much effort needed to heat them much.

"Agree with all of these recommendations! 

Las Conchas is the best to stay- plenty of beautiful homes on or a short walk from the beach! My favorite is Zone 1.

Don't take the hint about speeding lightly-  especially in Sonoyta - go UNDER the limit. My husband makes a point to give a few coins to the guys standing in the middle of the road as he thinks they are spotters and we haven't been pulled over, but other friends have, even going the speed limit. 

We love El Capitan at the top of the hill for a ""nicer"" meal out, and MiraBlau is really beautiful if you want more of a fine dining experience. Head right next door to ""wrecked on the reef"" for a totally gringo fun time (past the condos on sandy beach). I really enjoy Manny's Beach Bar for dancing at night or brunch in the morning.
