If you find a car you want, ask to take it to your mechanic and have it checked out first.  If they won't let you do that, then walk.

Uber (people) and Uber Eats( food). With delivering people. They did a smart thing 16 months ago and let it play out for 5-6 months. They let us drivers set our rate of pay. It was amazing feeling like the company you worked for wanted you to do well. It was all a ploy. They saw that customers would pay double or triple the normal cost to get a ride. So they figured that taking that option away from drivers was good for them but they would keep the 2x-4x fees to the rider. We use to get 75% of the total fee paid by the customer. They changed that a year ago and now the driver gets 40% of the total fee paid by the customer. And since this is Fresno, the customer thinks we get most of the fee so they never tip. I see offers for 20 minutes away ( you don’t get paid for that) and 12 miles away. We also don’t see where the customer is going or how much we will make. It’s totally blind. But if you go toward the coast. All that info is up front. Same with food orders.  The cool thing about Doordash is they limit the amount of drivers. It took me over a year of applying and being able to deliver. With Uber, it’s instant. So, Uber floods the area with drivers and it’s hard these days to get an order. No joke, I’ll be logged on for 8 hours and only get 2-5 pings for an order. Pre pan it was constant. Less drivers. It was still niche.  With DD i get offers usually every minute to five minutes. Of course sometimes you have to drive back into an area that has restaurants to get more orders. This is called “deadheading”. If you’re out of town or out of an area you should double the tip because the driver has to drive all the way back into town before they can get an order. This is for people past Temperance, other side of 99, people by and in the area of Buchanan high school. And anyone south of Jensen or kings canyon. And don’t let your teenagers in high school order food. It’s so hard to find them, they never tip, it’s a huge waste of time.

DD app gives drivers more deliveries but gives the customer lesser options for tips. I’ll always grab a Uber order over dd because the tips are usually way higher. But it depends in the restaurant and the area of town. No one tips with McDonald’s, especially Popeyes. And Popeyes is a shit show. I don’t care how much a Popeyes order will pay. They’re complete garbage and don’t care about anything in there.",t2_58cxqofu,dangdangdarn,0,1648107316.0,0,t1_i1wk9bb,i1wk9bb,False,dangdangdarn,t3_tldlhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/fresno/comments/tldlhd/doordashers_of_fresno_we_can_make_more_money_if/,Doordashers of Fresno.

I don't bother with places like McDonalds, Popeye's, Wendys, Taco bell, Chipotle, Wal-Mart, and Little Caesar's because they're typically low orders with no tip. I decline on them all the time. 


* Other drivers in the area having already declined the low orders and DD is constantly pushing them in the que when you're in the area and them having to up the payout because **someone** will eventually take them.

I've been to McDonald's as a regular customer on Blackstone & Shields and have seen the amount of DD bags just sitting for who knows how long because Dashers aren't picking them up even with DD increasing the pay. Go into  Chipotle and Habbit over by Manchester you'll see bags as well.


* McDonald's in general and the other listed places aren't worth it because, its a total waste of time. Dealing with the staff and the customers aren't better.

So what happens is that some ""top dasher""  see's the orders goes and does it regardless of the payout or miles.

Then, about a month later, in December 2020, when ICU beds were \*all\* full and front line health care workers were urging people to stay home and wear masks to not spread COVID, GB3 decided that being near the absolute peak of delta's spread was the perfect time to open back up without any announced change to operations.

"Under the new legislation, landlords will only be able to raise the rent by 5% (plus the local rate of inflation) for any existing tenant. It’s important to note that this only applies to apartments built before 2004; single-family homes or duplexes that are owner-occupied are exempt. It should also be noted that nothing about this prohibits a landlord from raising rent between tenants (that's always been the case though).
I will say that nothing about cost increases for landlords necessitates the epic rent hikes they have made. Landlords for the most part are just greedy and will charge tenants for any little thing just to keep their deposit. I mean I had a LL actually charge a tenant $20 for every nail hole, count all of the nail holes in just the room your in and see how quickly that adds up! 
But to opine on rent stabilization, it is absolutely needed, LLs are charging up to $2400 for properties in the Belmont and Broadway area, on white street, in the butler park area because people will pay it because there is a housing shortage! 
I don't guarantee to many things in life but I guarantee that they will not stop unless something makes them.

"Something is going to suffer in response then.  Rent goes up because expenses on the property increase., like electricity for outdoor lighting, parking lighting, etc.  The landlord has to pay increasing PG&E rates too for the general property electricity bill just like the rest of us.  Further, when the landscaper hands the landlord a larger bill because the landscaper is paying $6/gallon for gasoline instead of $3 and labor costs are now $15 instead of $7.50, who is going to pay that?  Then the air conditioning repair bill for occasional failures across 100 units is higher due more stringent requirements on air conditioning units and fuel costs. And you can apply this to every single expense a landlord has to outlay money and get a return in rent to cover it

"My husband and I closed on our house the end of April 2021. We had to seriously look for about 2-3 months, our cap number was 350k. We experienced a lot of cash offers and being out bid, we looked at something like 60 homes and put bids in on at least 10 I believe. We actually went into escrow twice because a seller was unwilling to make necessary repairs that came to light during inspections/appraisal. 

We ultimately decided to purchase an older home (built in 1959) so that we could get a larger property and bedroom sizes. From the start our realtor was straight with us and told us we would need to be offering at least a few thousand over asking or $1k above the highest offer. It was definitely a tiring process. My recommendation would be to look at lower cost houses so that you can make more competitive offers. 

Whatever house you choose will never be 100% what you want unless you build it. Think long and hard about what are musts for you and what you can compromise on.

I would definitely recommend Trina Craft if you need a realtor, she was amazing the whole way for us and we wouldn't have our home without her!

"Purchased a home Q3 of last year. It’s competitive out there and unfortunately your price bracket is the most competitive (according to the realtor husband and I used). We were in a different price tied, but pretty much a nice house would be gone within a couple days of hitting the market. Supposedly investors are slowing down their house purchasing, so hopefully that will leave some for the rest of us who are just trying to live in our own house! Realtor said to expect it to take longer than usual for buyers to actually close on a home in this market. Review with your realtor what contingencies could be made or what can you do to have your offers look more competitive from everyone else. Be ready to move quickly on houses you like—set up appointments to see the house asap and ask when they will be making decisions on offers or if they can share # offers made (they cannot tell you exactly what offers were made).",t2_emku2,TankForJustice,0,1647872027.0,0,t1_i1j62d4,i1j62d4,True,Chocolate-Goodness,t3_tiyef5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fresno/comments/tiyef5/what_has_been_your_experience_buying_a_house_in/,What has been your experience buying a house in the area recently?,/r/fresno/comments/tiyef5/what_has_been_your_experience_buying_a_house_in/i1j62d4/,3,r/fresno,0,3

"I can’t speak too much - I bought my first home in Q4 2019 out of necessity to bring my mom and grandmother out of an abusive living situation. Work made me WFH permanently and having a small space (didn’t buy large at first since I was supposed to only spend limited time here with predominant time in SF) was tough so realtor and I did a buy-sell and got us into a larger house. 

In all honesty, a lot of it is finding the right space at a location your comfortable with. The newer homes are always going to be significantly higher than those in “less-desirable” zip codes. But my realtor was knowledgeable on locations so he found me decent houses. I also moved hella fast and submitted offers that day. I’m in 93705 and over here, it’s very much block by block.

Let me DM you with my realtor. I know I referred someone else on this sub to him and they found a place quickly.

They didn't even brother to go down Shaw all the way to Moroa, where road construction is needed and there more potholes that you have to be wary or all the way out to Van Ness for that matter.

"heya.

there’s a lot of layers to it, so confusion is to be expected! mining cryptocurrencies is just a small fraction of it, despite that aspect often being equivocated with blockchain as a whole

in fact, it probably isn’t worth it to invest in mining crypto anymore. most popular chains now are using proof-of-stake for consensus, and ETH is looking to make that transition soon as well. Bitcoin will be one of the only “big” proof-of-work crypto remaining, and I have no idea how profitable that would be for most regular people (probably won’t be)

"Buying it in Fresno came with $7500 federal tax credit. $4500 state credit, and $3000 air quality credit so it was hella cheap (~$15,000) when I got it new in 2018.

The Leaf has a semi-fatal flaw in that it doesn't have any cooling loop for its battery pack, so even though it has a ~150 mile range on one charge if you drive over 100 miles at highway speeds in one go it can overheat and not be able to charge very fast for the rest of the day (aka ""RapidGate"").

I've found that driving ~60mph over long distances helps prevent this overheating.

If I had paid $30,000 for this car this substandard performance would be unacceptable but for a $15,000 car I can live with it. Within the past six months I've driven to SF, Tahoe, LA, and Monterey . . . basically trips in the Leaf take 2X the time that a regular car (or better BEV) would take, but with $5 gas they cost 50% vs. regular cars so it kinda evens out . . .

Going forward I'd recommend a Kia or Hyundai BEV instead, unless you're looking for a car just for getting around Fresno (and that you can charge at home or work) -- a Leaf is great for that.",t2_5wzav,torokunai,0,1647749544.0,0,t1_i1d7ion,i1d7ion,False,mesamunefire,t3_ti3z92,https://www.reddit.com/r/fresno/comments/ti3z92/california_high_gas_price_proposal_400_rebates_to/,California high gas price proposal: $400 rebates to all taxpayers,/r/fresno/comments/ti3z92/california_high_gas_price_proposal_400_rebates_to/i1d7ion/,6,r/fresno,0,6

"I don't believe taxes ever really deterred smoking, though. Not nearly to the same effect as health education and the social stigmas anyway. Smokers are looked at as second class citizens and smoking is banned in almost all public places. When people start smoking, they do it socially. The money doesn't really play a part because a pack can last you a week.  But eventually you become hooked and the government profits from your addiction just as much as the tobacco companies. At this point, money isn't going to be a deterrent because you will sacrifice other things to get your nicotine fix. If high taxes were really a deterrent, 72% of smokers wouldn't be from low income communities. I was a smoker for over 25 years before I could finally quit. But it wasn't because of the price despite the fact that I've lived below poverty until about 6 years ago.

That depends. In this case the goal of this tax is to reduce the number of *affordable* houses being converted into *pseudo-luxury* flipped houses -- because if a house can sell at $250k pre-flip, but $350k post-flip, then by preventing the flipping you are helping to keep the priced more affordable. 

This might cause the price of *flipped* houses to go up, but it might also prevent more houses from being flipped -- especially where the flipper is doing little more than painting it, putting in fake wood flooring, and throwing down some cheap bark... and then jacking up the price by $100k.",t2_1mbq8o9q,OldGreenShoe,0,1647728080.0,0,t1_i1c0w56,i1c0w56,False,lotta_lola559,t3_thilfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/fresno/comments/thilfz/new_california_bill_to_heavily_tax_house_flippers/,New California bill to heavily tax house flippers and stop equity investment from buying up homes,/r/fresno/comments/thilfz/new_california_bill_to_heavily_tax_house_flippers/i1c0w56/,3,r/fresno,0,3

"The increase in home prices are not because of inflation. It is because equity firms have gotten into the landlord business. They started by buying up foreclosures, now they are just buying up all homes in bulk. And they have the cash up front to back it up. They are not reselling them, they are renting them out. So rents have increased 30%. It is even worse for apts because they have also been buying up apts buildings, fixing them up, and hiking the rent so high the current tenants can no longer afford them. 

In Fresno, apts that once were considered to be affordable housing, are no longer. And the city has not been able to keep up with replacing these apts with new affording housing. Which as a result, obviously, increase homelessness.

"Haha. First of all it's hilarious that you're speaking to me as if you have some authority. You don't. Sit down.

Secondly...who? Are you serious? Are you incapable of following a reddit thread? 

Bredefeld is a loud and proud Trump supporter. Trump is an open white nationalist and well known racist. Which means that at a minimum Bredefeld is indifferent to white nationalism and racism. 

""What do you call it when a person sits down with eleven nazis? A dozen nazis""

Hate to break it to you bub, but all modern nazis don't strap on the SS and goose step down the street. If you're needing photos of Bredefeld in a goofy hat and red arm band, you're not gonna get it. And I bet you're the same type of person who would need a good look down a bears throat to know for sure if it'll bite you or not.
