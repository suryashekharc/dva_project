"I knew him and his truck, but I'd never heard of him harassing girls. He was one of the people who used to provide shavings for horse arenas in the area.  Definitely not a rocket scientist- now he would have been diagnosed with autism in elementary school and (maybe) gotten the help that he needed.   

He was terrified of young girls (I was one of them), so he'd become aggressive when he didn't know what else to do. I helped him change a tire once, and also helped him redistibrute a shavings load. 

Guelph really sucked for supportive care for people who needed it in the 70s and 80s and even well into the 90s.

"Yeah, my wife and I have tried Georgetown SuperStore and Orangeville Zehrs.

Georgetown Superstore switched to using boxes instead of plastic bags.  I was hoping they would switch to nothing.  Now I have an entire blue bin of boxes to break down weekly.  Over the phone I asked them about it and they said they were willing to to remove the groceries from the boxes, however when we arrive we get a lot of grief and resistance from the staff to remove the groceries from the boxes.  I realize its not the workers, this is more an issue with the company policy itself.

Orangeville Zehrs is still using bags.  Before covid they did a bin swap.  However, not everyone keeps their bins clean.  Once Covid hit they canceled the bin swap on concerns of spreading the virus (at least that is what I was told).",t2_4w1kxbqy,cspadijer,0,1648250685.0,0,t1_i24oi8n,i24oi8n,False,cspadijer,t3_to55gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/to55gh/is_there_any_grocery_stores_in_wellington/,Is there any grocery stores in Wellington Dufferin Guelph area that don't give you plastic bags or cardboard boxes when using the grocery store pickup service?,/r/Guelph/comments/to55gh/is_there_any_grocery_stores_in_wellington/i24oi8n/,2,r/Guelph,0,2

"You can't just put up drywall and call it a day.

First you'll pay the permit fees. One for apartment application and another for drywall finishes per sq ft. They'll advise you on what you have to do. There are certain codes that have to be met. If your basement was finished before 1994 you'll be in column a where your requirements will be less. This is the legal non conforming part..note i said finished.  If you have 3 or more bedrooms in the legal non conforming you can probably keep it too.

If your basement is unfinished see below.

If after 1994  and before 2001 things get harder: window wells and sizes for egress have to be bigger. Plus driveway requirements. And max 2 bedrooms. Many landlords get around this calling one bedroom an office. Shady but possibly legal

2001 or later are even more difficult: you also need a parking space and a few other requirements are harder.

In all cases:


You'll have to submit drawings of the layout you will create and they'll advise you if it meets code or not. You'll have to adjust as needed and work within that framework.

The fire department will come to advise on fire barrier requirements. You'll have to add that too.

Then you'll have to arrange electrical safety authority to inspect for two units and this will be BOTH upstairs and down. And you'll have to adjust and make those changes.

All three will have to inspect and pass before permit closed and registration completed.

When its all said and done it will depend on many factors for cost timing and your contractors.

You only need engineering if you plan to modify support walls or foundation for whatever reason such as a seperate entrance. You can also get engineer to make drawings for you if you can't. I did my own.

Also when it's said and done your property tax will slowly go up by a total of $1000/year for the increased assesment value. So if you pay 4k in property taxes now and your neighbor who has the exact same house today and doesn't have a basement apartment, you'll pay $1000 more a year once its fully phased in.

If you choose to not do this beware: guelph actively trolls for illegal apartments and tenants call them in too. You'll be caught just a matter of how many years. I was. Thats why I know :) and they will make you conform.

"First a question that can substantially impact cost

Is the basement going to become an accessory apartment (self contained and seperate from the main floor unit)? If so all sorts of extra zoning requirements, registration fees and fire seperation apply

As far as permits go, you'll need to submit a permit application, and FULL floorplan drawings detailing the following...
-Room dimensions 
-window sizes and respective dimensions to window well, grade etc.
-type of wall and ceiling finishes
-location of stairs doors, smoke alarms, plumbing fixtures, heating outlets

Egress windows are something you will require if the basement is non-accessory, and has bedrooms.

Inspections associated with your permit will include:
-electrical (ESA)
-plumbing
-hvac for any major duct rework
-major demolition


You can apply for permits through the Cities online permit application system found on the City website

My question with inflation though is just because Canadians are making more money, why does everything else have to go up as well? It’s not like everyone will start to go out and spend all of their money. The point of higher wages would be to allow us to actually afford normal things, not the extracurricular. 
Wouldn’t prices being raised be because of owners or whoever decides, thinking oh everyone has more money so I’ll just charge more now? Not because everything actually got more expensive?

"I'm not claiming to know the answer - not sure if there's even one but I do believe this brand of capitalism we're practising is no good, nor is it sustainable (it's way worse in the US). I think what some European countries are doing is a more balanced approach. It's a mix of capitalism and socialism (it also drives me nuts when people equate socialism with communism). 

IMO - anything that that is a necessity in life (food, shelter, education, health, utilities) should NOT be run as a for-profit business or privately to help ensure everyone has somewhat of an equal access to basic necessities in life. It should be run with the sole purpose to provide a good or service, with a built in  R&D model to improve efficiency and innovation (which is often the excuse for privatization). Everything non-essential can operate in the ""free"" market (it's not really free, just a illusion). 

I also think we need shift away from the notion that certain jobs are better, more elite (doctor, lawyers) where others are deadbeat jobs (e.g., the arts). Working with our hands, farming, construction trades, etc. are noble professions. We need a mix of everything no job is more important. But so many go into jobs just to make as much money as possible, and/for class/status and try to compete with each other - never satisfied because we're always seeking happiness, validation and self-worth from external sources. This IMO is strong cause in mental health illness.

We also need to shift away from this idea that environment is ours to control, dominate and exploit. We should respect it for the substances it provides. Run amok, capitalism detracts from this and it feeds on insecurities and exploitation of people and nature.

"I've written a series of articles about these issues. I'd post them on this subreddit, but I'd get bounced if I did. But I can put a couple ideas out there: 

1. the population of Guelph has increased by 30% in the last 20 years, which increases demand
2. because people can drive to work, one city Council can't fix the housing problem themselves because if a lot of houses get built people will just move to Guelph and commute to work somewhere else. The problem needs to be solved on a provincial level
3. the complaints about people who own homes complaining and stopping new higher density housing are a problem all across North America---if not the world. The problem is that people who already own a home vote in municipal elections and show up at Council meetings----and the people who don't do neither. 
4. the provincial govt set up a panel of experts called the Ontario Affordable Housing Task Force who have come up with a whole long list of very good recommendations. I would suggest everyone on this list politely tell everyone running in both the municipal and provincial elections to adopt all of the suggestions and implement ASAP
5. DON'T JUST VENT ON LINE----IT ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING IF YOU DON'T ALSO GO TO COUNCIL, CONTACT YOUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND TELL THEM YOU SUPPORT THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS, MENTION THEM IN THE ELECTION, ETC. 
6. Get informed (if you know who I am, you can look at my news blog---Guelph-Back-Grounder). When you talk to the politicians don't complain about their raises or accuse them of being in bed with big business. They are generally good people (if somewhat ideological or uninformed). Don't get angry. This isn't about you being a good person---it's about being heard. When most people talk or read something, they don't respond to what you say, but rather the emotions you use to say it. Anger just turns off most politicians and you might as well be just playing a trombone (like the Charlie Brown cartoons) for all they will hear of what you say.
7. Its a tough time to not own your own home, try to organize and help one another if you can. It's too bad, but one of the things that really brings out the nasty ""I don't give a damn"" part of middle class people are property values (the other is their children's education).

"OK your poor sister in laws case load has doubled. I feel for her, it really sucks when our government treats everyone like private business owners, that our government have been allowing them to do for years. She can thank Dougie for that. I mean at least she can afford three meals a day and an one bedroom place, on a 60 to 70k a year job.
I am the person who calls her begging her to help me eat three meals a day. I can afford 1 or 2 meals a day. I live in an $1600 apartment, the city I live in covers 45% of my rent, but can't help me when I have no heat in that $1600 unit. I get $350 after rent every month, because I pay hydro now my heat as well. I lose $140 to hydro. $210 left, phone *$35, *disabled bus pass $37.50 both are needed for phone medical appointments and to get to food bank. $137.50 left for groceries, medicine not covered, and everything else I need. I am expected to cover new space heaters to have heat in winter, that is not an ODSP problem. A happy meal is as exciting as going out to the Keg used to be. Meat is a treat. I have to pay in advance for dental work, eye glasses and medical travel. Then ODSP might return funds. The best part I sold my condo and investments to be broke enough to live this way. Old ODSP rules you could have $2500 worth of savings. You live on OW until ODSP gets approved, that $2500 do not last long.

I made more working three decades ago as a file clerk at a federal government office, than I get on disability now. Our government sees we need subcities to cover rent, but food is still a problem for disabled and elderly. If I could find a job that will hire me with my disability, I would work.

"Generation after generation, Canadians get richer, not poorer. The present generation of young Canadians have more opportunities, and a higher quality of life than ever before. But some people focus only on things that are worse, and don't really realize that things are better now.

Housing is definitely an exception, housing prices rise way faster than wages. But this is an inevitable consequence of having such tight limits on development. Very, very little new housing can be built, but there are more and people wanting to live in great places like Guelph. As long as governments prevent development, house prices will rise dramatically, and working class people will ultimately be forced to live elsewhere, where it is cheaper. To me, moving to a less expensive part of Canada is the best, and perhaps only, way for a working class person to obtain an optimal quality of life. 

I don't think it works for any group to demand respect. You can obtain respect by creating wealth, and power for yourself. But ultimately I don't think having rich people respect you is really that valuable, what is valuable is the quality of your life.

"I would love something like Profit sharing from the companies in Canada who make so much money each year. If the certain business doesn’t agree to profit sharing with its employees the government can come in and seize it, turn it into  a nationally owned company and continue doing business as usual. 
This year at my work they bragged about how the company made 70 million dollars in profit, as far as I know not a single production worker or anybody in the warehouse or offices got a raise. They could have taken 1 million of that profit and divided it up evenly amongst the 300 employees im guessing we have at our warehouse and given everyone a Bonus cheque of around 3,300 dollars, you know especially because we are the ones doing all the work each and every day.  But nope they get us shitty pizza sometimes. 

I only said a million as well just because even giving us so little, could drastically help out so many peoples lives, if I were in charge I’d say for every 10 million in profit the “company” makes, they (as in whoever the hell takes these millions of dollars) need to put aside 1 million for the people who actually make them their money.",t2_7qzid0q,michealscott21,1,1647923259.0,0,t1_i1mgywg,i1mgywg,False,michealscott21,t3_tjtkdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/tjtkdi/absolutely_ridiculous/,Absolutely ridiculous.,/r/Guelph/comments/tjtkdi/absolutely_ridiculous/i1mgywg/,0,r/Guelph,0,0

"I truly don’t see anything else happening. What happens when an entire generation of people (who have been working to build a life for themselves) 
 do when they all realize that it’s just not viable for the majority of us to make a decent living even with a full time job working overtime and picking up extra shifts, 

what do we do?

Just work ourselves to death while watching our kids have an even harder time then we did, because we’ve done nothing to not only even try and make our own lives better,  but the the lives of the people around us who we see working hard day in and day out. 
We at least owe it to our friends and family and the next generation of working class people to at least try to demand more respect for the people who actually make the world go round, as we clearly have seen over these past few years. 
It’s the working class.  

One of the ways we can demand change  is by demanding our federal government implement a new minimum wage of at least 21 dollars an hour. 

The people who are at 21 or close to it can renegotiate on their salaries as well. 
Clearly 15 dollars an hour, even the 17 I’m getting is not even a wage that can afford you the bare minimum anymore, all it does is leave you in debt. 

Also I don’t believe as Canadians, as a country, that we should have a minimum wage that only allows someone to afford the bare minimum, what are our goals as a nation?

 To provide all the labour to achieve the ridiculous amount of profit that we do, but then take that profit and put it into the hands of a very small minority? 
while the majority,  generation after generation are living harder tougher lives, with less and less quality of life and less opportunity for advancement in all areas of life.

"I'm a (not white, fairly broke) Guelph greyhound owner. While I don't live near Exhibition Park, there are a lot of greyhound rehoming groups that exist around Ontario, as there are thousands of ex-racing greyhounds that need homes every year.

Whether they weren't fast enough, were retired due to injury, or aged out of racing, greyhounds suffer many of the same problems as racehorses - there are only a few that can be successful enough to make it as a racer, the rest need to be rehomed. Kind of like a speedy puppy mill.

Greyhounds are fairly inexpensive to adopt and make great pets, even in apartments, due to their quiet nature (they prefer to be asleep 23 hours out of every 24 😜), and they're big ol' sucks.

As a contractor I disagree with this statement. A good understanding of the proposed scope and a good designer will come up with a plan that will address most issues before work has even began to prevent conflicts. I will agree that the City will not take any chances with liabilities and that can creat additional work but we’re only talking about residential construction here.

"oh i agree, people dont give them enough credit for their ability and minimalize their ability to recognize and interact with he environment around them.

but i think people are anthropomorphizing animals a bit too much.

&#x200B;

yes animals can learn, and gain knowledge of cause and effect, but to describe it as comprehension is a large leap to take from association and relation.

When a subdivision is registered, the approved street name signs are made in the following manner:

* Honourary street name signs for individuals of historical contribution to the city and City employees who died while in the service of our city are identified by blue letters on a white background with the City of Guelph crest.

"How do you know that? I would argue against all of your assumptions.

A lot of humans are terrible at self reflection too btw.

Dogs poop outside because they are taught to literally the same way humans are taught to use a toilet. Dogs don't want to shit inside and sit in their filth. Dogs in the wild don't shit in their dens. 

Dogs and animals are a lot smarter than you are giving them credit for. If you don't look at the world through a human-centric lens you'll realize that animals are a lot more sophisticated than many people think.

"I moved to Guelph when my son was 5, and we spent a lot of time at Riverside Park.  The gardens in the summer are absolutely gorgeous. They have new play equipment, a carousel and a train (hopefully those are running this summer).  Depending on where you live, you could bike there via the amazing network of trails from downtown and surrounding areas. Lots of festivals there too, pending things open up again.  It is still one of my favourite places to visit.

As others mentioned, there are amazing trails around Guelph.  If you don't already have the All Trails app on your phone, be sure to download it to find the great trails around that kids will love (Starkey, Royal Recreation Trail which has many segments all through the city, to name a few).  You could get a Grand River Parks pass (\~$130/year) that gives you access to all the GRCA parks around (Guelph Lake, Rockwood, Elora Gorge, Belwood, Shades Mills...) which have hiking trails and swimming.  I go to Guelph lake all the time kayaking and paddle boarding.  I have my own equipment but they also have rentals there (for sure kayaks and canoes, not sure about paddle boards).  Guelph Lake can get skunky if it's a hot summer though, but still good for watersports.

"Yes. I've had some success with the buttons. I was inspired by Christina Hunger.

I was able to get my dog to push buttons when he wanted to go outside, and also for when he wanted to play.

After a while though it felt like it was easier to just read his body language and other cues. We talk to our dog a LOT so he has a pretty good range of words he understands and I moved from the buttons to more just speaking 'caveman style ' if you will to replicate the buttons. But instead of me always telling him what to do, I ask him what he wants.

So, Want Go Bed? You Want Outside? What You Want? Show Me, etc.

And then he usually will gesture towards the things he wants or the activities he wants to do, or do the things I ask.

So TLDR: Yes we were able to get it him to use the buttons but we stopped after awhile.",t2_28lztqyf,salmonguelph,0,1647627632.0,0,t1_i16n1h0,i16n1h0,True,Remote-Meringue-2116,t3_th1zen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/th1zen/training_dogs_o_communicate/,Training dogs o communicate,/r/Guelph/comments/th1zen/training_dogs_o_communicate/i16n1h0/,3,r/Guelph,0,3

"I don't think that given all the other aspects of building house, it makes any sense for a developer to build affordable units unless they get some sort of trade off---like getting to build it taller than they could otherwise.

Guelph's becoming a city (it's population grew by an astounding 30% in the last 20 years.

"""What are AAC buttons?  
Recordable buttons are a type of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device. They can help people communicate when talking is difficult. They can be used to support learning cause and effect, and to show the power of communication!""

I have never tried this or heard of it, so I looked it up. My dogs can be taught to touch anything for any reason, they naturally show me by looking back and forth at something what they're interested in, cupboard (treats), front door, back door, food bowl or water bowl (distinctly even though they're side by side), so I think you could do this with lots and time and patience, but I don't know how it would be superior to learning their body language and teaching them to touch door handles/bells etc. Fun trick though.

The more time you spend positively training your dog, the deeper your bond, so if this excites and interests you, your dog will love it.

"Welcome to Guelph!  You'll love it here  (I'm close to 25 years here now, and there certainly isn't anywhere else in Ontario I'd live).  Pay no attention to the ""it's a bedroom community"" crowd.  Reality is that with the industry we have, a LOT of people have to work outside of town.   What's important is to take advantage of the things this town offers.

This town is getting great for food.  Lots of high quality restaurants here, and I haven't found myself going outside of town nearly as often as I used to.  Wooley, Miijidaa, Park Grocery, Happy Belly, Buon Gusto, Bread Bar, Heal and Baker St. Station are amongst my favs downtown (or near).  The Vienna has the best breakfast in town, and anyone that says otherwise is lying.  Polestar Hearth is an amazing bakery.

The farmer's market makes for a great saturday morning.

The downtown core normally has a number of festivals over the summer.  My favourite is Art in the Street... and I hope it's back this year.

The town is \*covered\* in walking and hiking trails.  There's long hikes and short ones near ice cream at the boathouse.

"I've lived in Guelph and Kitchener and I honestly haven't found as many good places in Guelph for steak. I'm sure others who have more experience may have more suggestions but the only place I can think of where I've gotten a good steak in Guelph is Queen's Cafe on Victoria and Elizabeth.

If you're willing to make the drive KW seemed to have the better options with Red House and JLB being two examples I can think of off the top of my head.

Otherwise I'd assume most upscale restaurants worth their salt can cook a great steak (unless they are cooking a speciality cuisine that doesn't include steak on the menu at all).

Also I know it's painful to mess up cooking a steak with how expensive it is but honestly once it clicks it's so much better than most restaurants and a bit cheaper too.

"I have no problem with adding more units on Gordon. It is needed. Plus Gordon is perfect for bussing around the city (not just for students).  However I have 2 concerns:

1. Parking.  This should 100% be full underground parking with spots above ground for visitors only.  There is no reason to have a big parking lot on wildlife land like that. 

2. Traffic. I used to live in that subdivision that this will connect to and have witnessed multiple crashes as a result of the Vaghn and Gordon intersection. In my mind, an ideal solution would be to create a raised median along Gordon preventing people from turning left. You could add a u-turn lane at Arkell and one at heritage as part of the existing Gordon road widening plan.  Anyone turning left would have to do so at a light from Heritage to Gordon. It would stop a bunch of crashes and would solve a lot of traffic buildup from cars taking the left lane to turn.

"I believe that the town is planning on monitoring the water temperature and making changes to the plant if the temperature increase is outside an acceptable range. 

But yes, Erin really needs a sewage treatment plant. On Main Street most businesses and houses are on 30-40 year old septic and holding tanks for their sewage. Given that the downtown is located right next to the credit river, if these tanks fail, which they likely will, the river and the groundwater our town uses for our drinking water system will be poisoned. That in my opinion is a much larger risk than building a sewage plant and having a possible slight increase in the river water temperature.

From everything I read about the sewage plant, and the public meetings I attended on the issue (I used to work for the community radio station and did reports on the issue) the town is trying to find the best compromise for the plant that protects the environment while still allowing for development. At the end of the day Erin is the largest municipality in Ontario with no sewage service, that needs to and will change eventually, might as well get it done now.",t2_8agpr,jacnel45,0,1647437742.0,0,t1_i0vsio1,i0vsio1,False,headtailgrep,t3_tf42qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/tf42qy/letter_south_guelph_neighbourhood_voices_concerns/,LETTER: South Guelph neighbourhood voices concerns about apartment proposal,/r/Guelph/comments/tf42qy/letter_south_guelph_neighbourhood_voices_concerns/i0vsio1/,4,r/Guelph,0,4

""This development has many short and long-term deleterious impacts on the numerous species that already call this place their home. The proposal involves the removal of 200 mature trees living in this significant wildlife habitat!

Light pollution from the surface parking lot will disrupt reproductive and roosting patterns of endangered species that live here.
