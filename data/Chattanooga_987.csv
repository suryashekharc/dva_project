"Yeah I guess you're right.  In reality I suck at everything.  Great counter-point.

I'll happily explain the name Juicy Rhino to you!  JUICE used to be the catch phrase for ""the business"" and it stood for JOIN US IN CREATING EXCITEMENT!  The internal Cydcor marketing magazine used to be called JUICE MAGAZINE.  Then it got super cheesy after 30 years, and also a way of marking the old timers in the business.  JUICE MAGAZINE became THE CYDCOR TIMES.  Not sure what they call it now.  The Credico Division calls it LIMITLESS MAGAZINE.  Not sure about Smart Circle.

Here's a hilarious clip of actor Chris Pratt, former Owner in the business, making fun of the whole JUICE thing on Conan...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EPbUDEzdnI&t=69s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EPbUDEzdnI&t=69s)

Anyways, now they've shortened it to ""Get Excited.""  I've heard lots of quality motivational calls from your owner's owner, Cody Lowery from Coast 2 Coast, and I'm sure you've noticed one out of every three things he says is ""GET EXCITED!""  but of course, he's had to repeat this stuff so many times that he doesn't sound excited at all when he says it.  More like a bored robot.  Which I think is hilariously ironic.

As for the Rhino thing... The Rhino used to be the internal symbol of the business, and probably still is unofficially.  It has thick skin and it keeps charging ahead without ever turning back!  They have a little rhino mascot in the Smart Circle head office in CA.  Lots of ""top leaders"" and ""rookie owners"" like to get their picture taken with it when they visit the head office.  If you're as successful as you claim to be, I'm sure you'll be taking a pic with the rhino in no time!  GET EXCITED!",t2_3wd3c9pp,BeCarefulItsAScam,0,1648286476.0,0,t1_i26a4en,i26a4en,False,BeCarefulItsAScam,t3_hrdgtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chattanooga/comments/hrdgtt/watch_out_for_spam_job_ads_from_a_new_company/,Watch out for spam job ads from a new company called Tri-State Marketing -- it's the same secret MLM that previously spammed job ads from VP Rush/Grand Elite/Lion Legacy/Mid Tennessee Executives/Paramount Consulting and countless others,/r/Chattanooga/comments/hrdgtt/watch_out_for_spam_job_ads_from_a_new_company/i26a4en/,1,r/Chattanooga,0,1

"I absolutely love talking to reps in stores!  But just to clear up your misunderstanding, they approach me and strike up a conversation as they are trained to do.  I like to ask them the name of the company they work for to see which answer they give (AT&T, Tri-State or Smart Circle).  Then I like to ask if they've heard the Juicy Rhino podcast.  They say no, and I tell them they should check it out some time.

As for your social media content... these offices constantly spam pictures of you guys, even after you leave one of these offices.  I just like to click through to the account.  Stop spamming social media with stuff, and I won't click on it.  Don't come talk to me in the a retail store, and I won't have a conversation with you.  But the truth is, new hires usually really appreciate it if someone gives them the name of Smart Circle at least so they can figure out what the hell they've been hired into.  Just look at all your spam job ads... nowhere once does it mention the name Smart Circle.  This is not a coincidence.

As for the picture getting posted in this forum, I posted a link to your own website with your own copy and your own pictures.  When reddit turns it into a post, I think they use the main image from whatever link you shared.  You'll need to contact the team of developers behind Reddit about this complaint.

As for the issue of Smart Circle being an MLM... back in the day, they used to happily market themselves internally as the third largest MLM in the world... behind Amway and Herbalife I think? Anyways, now that the name MLM is so tarnished, they like to insist that they aren't an MLM.  But when the FTC recently sent out warnings to MLMs about making false earnings claims, they included Smart Circle on the list.

But hey.. if you are happy in the business, then that's all that matters!  Keep grinding, ignore this kind of negativity, and prove everyone wrong when direct selling inside Target turns. you into a millionaire.  But whatever you do, don't take a cursory look at the number of offices that have opened and closed just here in Chattanooga alone.  This information will directly contradict the conditioned belief that this is an amazing opportunity that you should spend years of your life pursuing.

Also, if history is any judge, I'll probably get a DM from you in a few months admitting yeah, it was a scam but you were just too sucked into the promisees to evaluate it critically.  I've heard from several of you from Tri-State already.

"Hi guys,

We've gotten OVERWHELMING SUPPORT from the various Tennessee subreddits in working to try and defeat William Lamberth's HB-1927 that seeks to outlaw Delta-8 THC and other alternate cannabinoids in TN.

If you haven't seen my original posts about contacting state representatives about this bill, please visit my profile and you'll see posts from me in the Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and Murfreesboro subs.

I spoke with the **Tennessee Growers Coalition** who are lobbying to defeat this bill that is getting voted on next **Wednesday, March 30.**

The Tennessee Growers Coalition in the process of hiring an ADDITIONAL lobbying team to directly defeat this bill. They told me that if we donate to the link above, it will go directly to defeat this bill.

I wanted to raise awareness about this in case you can help with a donation. We can donate and we can use my original posts mentioned above to contact those voting on this bill. This is how we can help!

"Mackenzie has been missing since 11/8/2016 from Monteagle near Trussell Rd and Dennyland.  I’ve had a lovely Redditor come forward recently with new information on his disappearance and I plan on making a drive down this weekend. I’m hoping to get some more credible tips as it seems like nobody has looked for Mackenzie at all. I just want to bring him home, give his family and loved ones closure, give him a proper burial and hold those responsible accountable for their actions in the court system. 

Mackenzie was quite possibly my best friend. He was the guy I could count on for anything. He was like my little brother.  My heart is shattered without answers. I know Mackenzie would never walk away from his family and his friends.  I need answers to find myself whole again. It’s hard to move on when you don’t know if your loved one is out there still or if they have moved on to a better place.  Every day I hold on to hope he’s out there alive but the sad reality is I know he’s no longer with us but until we find him and bring him home I’m not going to let that glimmer of hope go dark.  

If you know anything, even the smallest detail please reach out to Detective Doug Henderson at the Marion County Sheriff’s Department. Or reach out to me. I don’t care if you want to be anonymous, I just want him  found so we can all make peace and move forward. Mackenzie if you’re out there and reading this I love you and I’m in your corner always.

This. Cops in most cases sit in churches and food cities. 5 over no one cares and the speed limit is dangerous on the highway. If you are gonna go under the 10 over avoid the left most lane. You will either be hit or cause an accident. Also turns don’t matter. Like Ik it says slow down especially on blind or sharp turns. But if you slow down they pile up. If you wanna drive the speed limit just start not caring ab people. If they are late I promise the 2 minutes they are behind you before another lane opens or someone turns will be made up for.

"Look, you decided to comment to my response to another commenter (electric triangle) who said “Agreed. If you can't afford the license and insurance, you can't afford to drive.” And that is CLASSIST.  They are talking about poor people who cant afford shit that’s important to function legally in the world we live in. And then you came in with the comment saying “Sorry, but needing to allocate funds elsewhere is hardly an excuse to drive without a valid license or insurance.” If you cant see whats so wrong with that it’s probably because you just dont know better and you haven’t seen the world through the same lease as me. Being poor makes you make tuff choices and forces you to take huge risks you wish you didnt have to.

"# SITUATION UPDATE & COMMENTARY

Viral prevalence in our community is at a relatively low level.

# DATA NOTES

* HCHD: ""March 10, 2022 - The Health Department is currently conducting data cleaning on a number of backlogged cases from the Omicron surge. This process will result in an increase in the total number of cases below. However, the daily case counts will still reflect the actual number of new cases received by the Health Department on that day.""
* HCHD removed the epi-linked case total from their website. I haven't seen an announcement about it.
* Earlier this week, I removed the epi-linked case metrics from my Data Studio report front page. I also moved wastewater metrics to the top of the table. I did this because wastewater data is gaining in prominence as an effective early warning tool (see the *Times Free Press* article linked below). I'll likely make some similar changes to the infographic soon.
* For the wastewater data, the weekly sample effective concentration comes directly from the reports that are archived on the City of Chattanooga website. Biobot seems to be keeping the data fresh on their GitHub repo, so this week I wrote a scheduled job to fetch the 3-sample mean directly from the repo.

"I love sunny and the reference, especially since it sounds critical of your typical beliefs (presumptuous, I know). Love it when I encounter someone who can be open-minded especially over a joke.

It’s really the interstates and highways. If you’re on a local highway or interstate (esp interstate, local highways not so much) the speed limit will usually say 55 but most people go 70-80. I honestly don’t know why this is—I think it’s just because people assume most interstate speeds are 70 but for some reason around Chattanooga it’s 55. This is just too much inconvenience for Chattanoogans to stand, so they go 70-80 instead. 

As I alluded to, this also applies to some local highways in the area. This is especially true of Highway 111/27 which does stretch into downtown approaching from the North. Because it’s so close to the interstate people seem to want to drive 70 down it too despite it crossing the TN River and being through one of the busiest parts of town (Northshore).

"My RV broke down in the middle of I'24 East Bound right past the I-124 merge on a Friday afternoon about 530 pm. We could not get to the shoulder of the road due to the instantly failed fuel pump. 18 wheelers were smoking their brakes and tires to keep from rear-ended us. Everyone was going the normal 70 mpg in a 55 zone. I had my wife and two small kids with me. Hundreds of cars passed us by and I don't blame them.

"Theirs lots of common courtesies with driving in many states, helpful driving tips include: 

Keep your speed to the flow of traffic regardless of speed limit posted.

Left lane is for passing - stay out unless your passing, and if your passing aka going faster than the right two lanes get back over or speed up if others are behind you and obviously wanna go faster. if your in the left lane even going 20 over the speed limit and someone going faster than you or wants to pass you than get out of the left lane sooner than later to let them pass without going around you (keep your want to control things out of this). 

Try and notice if your neck and neck with another driver beside you, neither of ya wanna go faster cause ya scared of going the fastest / tickets. Get over or speed up.  

Slowest/slower traffic aim to stay in the far right lane as much as possible, go to the middle when needed, such a people merging onto interstate or coming up on a slower vehicle, than proceed back to far right lane. 

And when it’s right - drive the middle lane. 

Common courtesies - notice someone behind you wanting to go faster ? Get over 
Notice someone coming up fast from a distance behind you, get over before they get to you. 

If your on a scenic back road out for your Sunday cruise (dosnt matter what day) and notice 1-20 cars wanting to go faster than you behind you.. be kind/conscious of your surroundings/common courtesies and pull over asap to let them go on their way, proceed back onto road when it’s clear. 
And repeat, it’s obvious your going slower than desired speeds so just pull over, let other around and proceed your lovely drive without any worries behind you.. 

Flashing high beams - there is a reason for this.. something is off, check your lights, signals, and speed.. notice someone flashing their Brights at you from behind, it means your going to slow, they wanna go around you. Please switch lanes, don’t be stubborn, your going to slow, let them by by getting over.. 
flashing brights might also mean you just changed lanes without checking behind you as to who is coming up that lane your changing into and you did not adjust your speed accordingly (your going slow and made them heavily reduce their speed = dangerous on both sides ) = don’t pull out in front of others going slower than the speed they are, it’s not right. 

Flashing beams also means -  
From the opposite directions / either your headlights are off when they should be on, theirs a cop ahead of you or some other reason. Check your vehicle and your surroundings. 

Lastly, have common sense, be aware of your surroundings, check your Mirrors often, know whats going on around you, & watch out for motorcycles.

Also, never ever ever pull out in front of motorcycle wether at a traffic light, a stop sign, exiting the gas station or side street into the main road, always let them pass before you pull out. Save a life. Pay attention. Call an Uber if you drink, plan your night out. $10,000 is a lot of ubers. 

Also again
Traffic.. = accordion effect = stop and go stop and go… this is for everyone.. 
Spaaace out, give a foot ball fields length in front of you and the driver ahead of you, this way you never have to stop and go.. it heavily reduces the accordion effect and we can all get back to driving the regular speed.. truckers do this and if you have a standard transmission car you are also aware of this.. less clutch use .. less wear on your clutch, breaks, and saves you gas. If everyone did this, wow. Lot less traffic

"Upwards of half a million people are arrested for marijuana possession/sales each year. Each of those arrests carry at least a fine to be made. Roughly 30,000 people are imprisoned for marijuana-based charges each year. With private prisons dominating the country, and those companies getting paid for each of those prisoners, that's a pretty big bit of income. For public prisons, that is free labor off of which each jurisdiction profits. And then you get 'perks,' from which marijuana prohibition was originally established, as in using possession as an excuse to deport immigrants, seize property (which does not require a conviction), and introduce people into a system from which it is very hard to escape and not be punished by for the rest of their lives - to further increase municipal and private profits. And then, after all that, there is the black market money to be made from illegal business. All the way down the line from growing to smoking, bribes and payoffs are made to various law enforcement entities, port authorities, land owners, transporters, wholesalers, and street sales. Prohibition is far more profitable down the line; both in money and social control.",t2_z5jyq,barsmut,0,1648142304.0,0,t1_i1ydhjo,i1ydhjo,False,IknowIamBreathingIn,t3_tldzfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chattanooga/comments/tldzfp/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/,New TN Bill to Outlaw Delta-8 THC,/r/Chattanooga/comments/tldzfp/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/i1ydhjo/,3,r/Chattanooga,0,3

"What really sucks is that they will vote on this without ever realizing or caring that there are people who depend on it. Whether it be for anxiety disorders or really serious health issues. 

I had Lyme disease that made it to my brain & lives there. Because of that I get tremors that affect my hands. I can’t hold a regular fork, cut my food, hold a glass or a plate, & it hard for me to do my job. It’s difficult to function. The doctor recommended drugs would basically help stop them but make it impossible to function, can’t drive on them, can’t work on them, have to have regular blood tests to take them. When my tremors are bad I can take one D8 and within 15 minutes I’m back to normal life. I don’t have to use the plastic cups so I don’t drop the glass ones. Lol. 

So fucking sick of our politicians not caring about things like that. It’s sucks plain & simple.

"Since everyone in the comments either seems to be a transplant or unhelpful, let a native give you the actual rule.  Basically all humans including cops but not including, as noted, Red Bankistan and Racistdale, follow these rules:

The posted speed limit on local access roads is automatically +5.

The posted speed limit on any highway is +10.  

Anything less is considered dangerous, and you don't get to ""dangerous speeding"" until you are about +20.  

Don't feel bad for not knowing this.  My SO is from VA where they apparently hired the SS for traffic enforcement and literal 1 mile over gets you a $100 ticket, but here, the cops think you're suspicious and follow you if you're doing under the speed limit, because you must be hauling drugs or something.

"As PT Barnum once said, ""There's a sucker born every minute"". Just because there are other suckers out there lining up to get fleeced by sports teams doesn't mean that Chattanooga has to get in that line. 

I reject the notion that minor league attendance is down because of capacity or a poor location. The location of the existing stadium is actually great.

"I agree with you on all points but one quibble. Can we just agree that ""it's just a plant"" *definitely* doesn't equate to ""it's harmless/should be freely available"", and as such isn't a great angle to use in the debate?

A fair number of the most addictive substances and also some of the most horrific toxins known to science are plants. It ~~might be worth being a bit more specific~~ would be a very weak argument that could be easily flipped on you in a debate with opponents.

**Edit:** y'all realize I agree weed should be legal, right? I'm pointing out a logical fallacy that weakens the argument, not saying it shouldn't be legal. If you want to effect change, your arguments have to stand up to opposition, which means they have to be logically sound. This is a crappy argument for the legality of weed that is quickly and easily refuted by any layman. Easily refuted arguments make it easier to dismiss the issue entirely and weaken the entire platform.

Hi Fellow Tennesseeans,

I'm posting this link to raise awareness about Representative William Lamberth's new amendment to Bill HB-1927 that will effectively outlaw Delta-8 THC and other legal cannabinoids derived from legal hemp. Please remember, this bill is attempting to criminalize Delta-8 THC and other cannabinoids that are legal under both State and Federal Law.

This bill will:

Decrease State Revenue – Net Impact - $4,840,900/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

Increase State Expenditures - $2,900 Incarceration

Decrease Local Revenue – Net Impact - $1,975,400/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

This is a very poorly thought out bill that will negatively impact sales revenue in the state, will increase incarceration and expenses thereof and will decrease local tax revenue. This will hurt many local businesses and hemp farmers operating legally under state and federal law and will result in more Tennesseans getting incarcerated and becoming felons in possession of a FEDERALLY LEGAL compound.

Please my fellow Tennesseans, do what you can to raise awareness about this and help stop this bill in it's tracks. Representative Chris Hurt is pushing through Bill HB-1690 that seeks to regulate Delta-8 THC and create sales tax revenue in the state. This is a better approach and I hope that the bill to regulate vs outlaw takes precedent this year.

Both of these bills are going through the process now, so please do what you can to contact local reps, local businesses who legally sell Delta-8 THC and anybody who benefits from this legal medicine to try their best and fight back.

Much love Tennessee.

"One of the best features of Chattanooga is access to features you would not expect in a smaller city.  

E.g., ATL has a fantastic Symphony, but driving from Marietta to Midtown can take 30 minutes to forever.  Chatt doesn't have the ASO, but our Symphony is incredible for a city our size.  If you live near downtown (Northshore, Southside, Highland Park), you can walk out of your house and be parked by the Tivoli Theatre in 10 minutes, no kidding.  We have two professional soccer teams (long story), college athletics, shows and concerts, festivals, farmers markets; none of which take much time to get to.  

I'd recommend Southside if you don't mind a bit of bustle, Highland Park if you are more into the artsy vestiges of Hipster culture, or Northshore if you find a good deal (perhaps west of Market).  Any of those spots keep you within minutes of downtown.  

Obviously, I enjoy the city amenities, but you can completely ignore my advice and live towards Hamilton/Brainerd/Ooltewah.  Commuting on 24/75 during rush hour generally adds ten minutes.

It's a pickup group in the sense that people post that they'll be running and others can join if they're a similar pace or just meet up to do their own thing but get some social time. On Mondays we usually meet at Mean Mug Northshore (Niedlov's in the winter for the fire pit) and have coffee after.

"I started running in Chattanooga 2 years ago and now run 4x a week. My first 18 months or so I only ran on sidewaks in Northshore but I wont run on sidewalks anymore - in January a car completely left the roadway, jumped the curb, and would have hit me from behind on a sidewalk had I not jumped behind a tree. Too many people on their phones and too easy to jump a curb. I run almost exclusively at Booker T Washington State Park or Harrison Bay State Park. Most of the middle schools and high schools have a track which is great for beginners, and also easier on the knees. 

If you insist on running on sidewalks I would recommend a high-visibility running shirt in addition to high-vis or reflective clothing and always running against traffic so you can know if you need to jump out of the way of an idiot.

"I'll be the first to say it. Avoid rossville at all costs. Throw collegedale in there too. 

East Brainerd is where it's at right now (east of gunbarrel), good luck with it though, a studio apartment runs 1200$ here. 

Hixson is where you go if you want to stay away from the city, just watch out for cat-converter thieves in certain parts. 

Redbank is petty meh in my opinion and depending on the neighborhood it can either be really nice or really shit. (Same with the ridge cut) 

You will find all of the soccer moms and young developing punks in Ooltewah, although it's pretty decent, but the housing rates are approaching those in EB. 

And finally northshore... if you want the exact opposite of hixson and truly want to be in the city to experience the "" flower child / suffisticated art / craft beer/ 12$ cappacinno hipster -yuppie"" lifestyle that is quickly consuming chattanooga, it's the place to be.

"There's a lot of good places but the ones that I was most impressed- River Street deli for sandwiches and soup. Purple Daisy for BBQ and picnic style food. Maple Street biscuits is best breakfast place in town, or Niedlovs if you want something a little cheaper/healthier. Sluggo's has awesome vegan food even if you eat meat. Blue fox cheese shop has amazing grilled cheese. Main St. Meats has the best burger I've ever had. The hot chocolate has tons of great chocolate candies. Mean mug has good coffees.

The other restaurants are fun and really good but don't stand out a whole ton from each other in my opinion.

If you want something more spectacle, rodizo sounds fun, kids always like kanpai of Tokyo, there's a Dave and busters and cheesecake factory near the mall. Hifi Clyde's seems like a pretty fun bar type restaurant, I always just gotten takeout. They have yummy in house made potato chips.

"Shortly after I got married I decided to drive from Cleveland to Chatanooga with my wife and best friend via the old road. We were obviously up to no good, we were listening to local talk radio, driving the speed limit on the way to the saltwater fish store (Bermuda Triangle). Turns out, I had an out tail light and got pulled over in Collegedale..  I've always liked cops and was nothing but respectful and cooperative during the encounter, but long story short, I got hauled out of my car and arrested in front of newly married wife. Why you ask? Well.. I had a silly traffic violation for a rolling stop, and the state screwed up and didn't mark the ticket as paid. I actually had the receipt in the car and my wife tried repeatedly to show him the ticket, but he was insanely rude, he even waited till there was traffic to pull off so it would be harder for my wife to follow him to the police station. So we had to use my school book money to get a bail bondsman to come bail me out of jail, and while I'm waiting to get bailed out that son of a gun had the gall to tell me that the judge would just toss the case out...  So he knew it'd get tossed, he knew it would be a waste of time and money, but he paraded me around like he really caught something big when I got there...  The judge did toss the case, but i was out 2 days due to court, I forget if I had to pay court costs, and I was out my school book money for the bondsman.

As someone with a lot of research librarians in his family, I can also say that if op goes to the library and asks a librarian for help they will be glad to do whatever they can, they care less about enrollment status than they do about providing a resource to the community.
