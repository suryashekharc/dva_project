Sometimes you may not get a fourth roommate. It's rare but it happened to me and my roommates this year. It's only 3 of us paying for the four person room (which still isn't too bad of a price imo at least compared to other places I've seen here). I wouldn't worry about it because it seems like lots of new people move in every semester but its something to watch out for.,t2_1fsvd1yn,firest4rtr,0,1648162157.0,0,t1_i1zrja9,i1zrja9,False,infini_doggo,t3_sr1ias,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanmarcos/comments/sr1ias/anyone_living_in_aspire_apartments_and_have_any/,Anyone living in Aspire apartments and have any opinions to share?,/r/sanmarcos/comments/sr1ias/anyone_living_in_aspire_apartments_and_have_any/i1zrja9/,1,r/sanmarcos,0,1
"I enjoy it, I consider myself completely introverted and a bit on the weirder/quiet side so the people that party tons sometimes bother me cause I can hear their music but it happens more less than often, usually by the end of summer is when it stopped (I'm on the floor right above the pool and gym/rec rooms). I wouldnt worry about noise or other people unless youre under the 13th floor/penthouse or something.

 The area is extremely convenient, I live right off campus it takes me 5 minutes to walk to campus, 5 minutes to walk to the square, downtown sm, theres a ton of restaurants right across the street that have a variety of food (mexican, tex mex, fast food, asian and korean), sewell is also 10 minutes away. You also live on top of the target and across the street from the bobcat quickie gas station in case you need to make any quick or late night trips. If target gets too costly, the walk to HEB is like 7-10 minutes away and not too bad at all. So far I rate it an 8/10 and the price I pay is really good. I pay around 850 for a unit with 3 other people and our monthly bills are like 20$-40$ max in total. The location, furnishings, room space, price, safety precautions, amenities and etc. are good pros.

 The only cons are that there is always at least one elevator broken down or the doors in the back entrance dont work--it seems like there is always something technical going wrong with the building at least twice a month but these are just really nuisances at best because they get taken care of (and we dont have to pay for it).

 So far I really like it here, I got a discount (I think it was like 800 bucks or something) off when I first signed in, but they do give you a lot of pressure to sign the lease or renew it. I'd keep this place the last at your list to look at because they give you like a 2 day slot to confirm your lease. I moved in this late june as a sophomore and already had to renew my lease in late September-- I was living there for only 2/3 months before I had to make the decision to renew my lease in order to keep my same unit room.",t2_1fsvd1yn,firest4rtr,0,1648161682.0,0,t1_i1zqfqx,i1zqfqx,True,infini_doggo,t3_sr1ias,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanmarcos/comments/sr1ias/anyone_living_in_aspire_apartments_and_have_any/,Anyone living in Aspire apartments and have any opinions to share?,/r/sanmarcos/comments/sr1ias/anyone_living_in_aspire_apartments_and_have_any/i1zqfqx/,1,r/sanmarcos,0,1

"First you have you separate conservative values from this current MAGA nonsense. They‚Äôre different.

Most conservative values can be argued as just fine, that‚Äôs your opinion and attitudes. Many are not however.

Whether it‚Äôs the Church, monarchies, or other powerful establishments, these are the conservatives doing everything they can to maintain power over others. Every single time. Democracy, slavery, women‚Äôs rights, civil rights‚Ä¶always conservatives trying to prevent others from having rights.

For current MAGA trash, well, it‚Äôs just disgusting ignorance. Trump emboldened the dumb and scum to be vocal about being shitty.

"Austin is basically center. The juxtaposition with the surrounding area highlights the differences but to pretend like it some ultra far left area, is not really true. Basically everything west of Mopac is Conservative and the policies of the city are often limited by the state or by the 30% of voting conservatives int he area. The largest group of people moving to Austin are other Texans...from liberal and conservative areas. A city will always be more liberal than the surrounding areas because of education, youth & dealing with modern problems. The needs to advance a city tends to push against the ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"". Not enough bootstraps or community in a downtown than a small town church.

"I would say this is a rather extreme view and why the OP is asking. Being conservative does not mean any of those things specifically. Those are the things that bother you most and get the headlines from people that want you to vote the opposite way.

I consider myself progressive on many issues but if I took the Far Right's definition of progressive(similar to what you are doing here with Conservative) then you would think I want open borders and everything free. Neither are accurate and this actually gives legitimacy of why the OP is asking. 

I think the best tools to help me understand our current situation is to study the middle and ideas like Neo-liberalism. Biden and Pelosi and Clinton are Neo-liberals and that helps explain why ""progressive"" ideas are stalled. The people in power are more closely aligned to others in power. Meanwhile the lower 99% are stuck throwing stones over these terms while both middle left/right traditional power houses dig in for control of congress and elections.

What conservative values means today is racism, white nationalism, anti-gay, anti-trans, anti-anything that isn't extreme christianity, anti-anything but white, anti-education, tarrifs (NOT free trade), lunatic conspiracy theories, horse dewormers, anti-science, pro-Russia, anti-democracy, rigged (attempted) elections, etc etc etc.

"It is not wrong to have conservative values. What has happened is that conservatism has been used to ram a bunch of non conservative ideas and the term is conflated. 

Conservatives want to ban books and always spend just as much as Dems when they hold government.  All the while shouting ""small government"" is just one example.  

There are problems with ""liberals"" and ""conservatives"" because the terms are overly broad. What specifically are you asking about being an issue? If you dont have a specific idea or issue that is bothering you, than you now understand why the terms are not very useful. 

Try talking to people about policy instead of labels that are attached to 1000 charged subjects.

Edit: i was raised ""conservative"" swung left and now pretty central so neither of the big names define me. That is the main issue. Most ppl are somewhere in the middle and the labels are destroying discourse. We largely agree on basic human rights but guns, abortion and taxes get the big headlines.

u/Abodagrin this is for you
Edit: After reading your other comments in r/SanMarcos, I think you are not really interested in a discussion and just trolling expecting a bunch of people to bash on conservatism to prove a point or something. Calling people libtards in one thread and then asking ""why is it wrong to have conservative values?"". YOU are why ppl are confused. Is name calling a traditional conservative ideal? Or presuming how others feel about vaccines or Joe Biden? That language is the problem.

"My friend lives in Bishops Square which is, IMO, probably the best of the student housing you'll find. He's had some minor issues, mostly dealing with crickets during San Marcos's lovely cricket season. I live at Parkway Grande (nonstudent housing) and I think overall it's better. It used to be less expensive comparatively, but now I'm not sure. 

Funny enough, as much as I like this place I had the flea issue too! I am of the belief they never vacuumed this place before my move-in. I made them aware I am allergic to animals before ever signing my contract, and they told me not to worry. When I first moved in there were so. many. fleas. and pet hair EVERYWHERE. First time I vacuumed sooooo much pet hair and dirt came up. The maintenance guy was over fixing something and literally said ""wow it looks like it wasn't vacuumed."" 

I called the office for help with the fleas, had to wait a week because pest control only comes on Wednesdays (???), and when the guy got in my apartment he was like ""yeah I can bomb it next week."" I have a pet turtle and had just moved all my furniture in so I told him that was in no way an option for me, and he pretty much said well tough luck. I ended up going to HEB and buying a bottle of flea spray and used pretty much the entire thing on the carpet. 2 passes with that a few days apart and the fleas were gone pretty much within a week. So I would recommend that to anyone who has a flea issue when they move in.",t2_m1dsy,FreckledManatee,0,1647933374.0,0,t1_i1muitk,i1muitk,True,[deleted],t3_tjhvio,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanmarcos/comments/tjhvio/student_housing/,student housing,/r/sanmarcos/comments/tjhvio/student_housing/i1muitk/,2,r/sanmarcos,0,2

"I'm gonna go against the popular opinion on here but.....I was far from a fan of Palmer's, the menu is very small, the advertised drinks all included some form of chili (I'm a big fan of spicy food, but wasn't a fan of it in my drink).  The food was OK but I felt like i ""settled"" on a dish, and it wasn't something I would have picked, and im not a picky eater and love trying new things.

* Blue Dahlia might be a good pick.

* The Root Cellar

* CraftHouse

* Kerbey Lane

"You're fine. I watched the Same Jose, CA area go through the same thing as the Austin area is now. Home prices went crazy and developers started building in all kinds of houses like an hour away and people thought they were too expensive. Well 5 years later and yeah...

The city I'm thinking of is Morgan Hill. Kinda rural..not much going on there. But it's a not-insane commute (1 hour give or take) so all the houses were getting bought up anyway. 

I'm always reminded of Morgan Hill when people talk about stuff like this. Hold that house for as long as you can .. if you can afford to rent it out instead of selling in 5 years that would be ideal. 

Here's an article about the housing market in Morgan Hill in 2005. https://www.google.com/amp/s/morganhilltimes.com/home-price-median-soars/%3famp

In case you don't feel like reading through this: I equate what's happening in Austin similar to what happened in San Jose in the late 90s / early 2000s. I would put the housing market here around the time of the early 2000s. It should continue to insane rates, fallback down, but then be higher and stay higher than anyone thought possible.

"Think of it this way.  Right now you have about 1k sunk in as earnest money.  IF you back out they will just re-list and it will be significantly higher.  All I can say is do not trust their timelines.  I purchased with them roughly 6 months ago and was supposed to move in beginning of March (now I am realistically hoping for July).  I went out there this weekend and I don't even have shingles, walls, or windows yet.  They say 6 months, plan for 10.  By the time you go to lock rates, take a look at the recent listings at DR Horton and make a decision then.  You may end up in an interesting position.  I signed a purchase contract for a 2400 sqft in the same area for about 340 last fall and I expect it to appraise about 50k higher on final inspection.  End of the day, SM is in the ""golden triangle"" of the San Austonio corridor.  Austin and SA are going to creep closer and closer to each other and with SM being a college town in the middle I am banking on the outlying neighborhoods will be going for a premium in 10 years.  It will be a bit more gentrified, there will be higher demand, and it will be a relatively new property close enough to some metros, but still far enough away you won't deal with city problems.

"Join some of the hiking groups. I don‚Äôt know the names but they exist on Facebook if you have that. Join the San Marcos Greenbelt Alliance hikes, there are some that do bird watching so if you‚Äôre into outdoor photography there‚Äôs a double interest opportunity.

Taking your camera out and walking around is a good way to meet folks too, used to do so a lot pre-pandemic and whether I wanted to or not people approached me. The camera and what you‚Äôre photographing makes a good ice breaker and topic starter.

I would also suggest going to any and all club meetings you can on campus that surround interests. That‚Äôs where I made the most friends and I was a non-traditional aged student when I attended, you should have a much easier time.

Lots of hang out opportunities at the coffee shops and on the square as well as free concerts and the like too. In a few months the next set of summer concerts will start and they always draw a crowd.

2) Explain to her that she signed a contractually binding lease, and if she moves out, she still owes the rent through the remaining time period on the lease (or until the date someone else takes over the lease). Explain you are taking it to small claims court, you will 100% win, and that judgement will also be on her record forever. And that you will send her debt to collections, which will then be on her credit report. And you‚Äôll get your money even if it means garnishing wages 5 years from now.
