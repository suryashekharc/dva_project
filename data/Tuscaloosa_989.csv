It has very nice amenities and the grounds crew is the best I’ve ever encountered in any complex.

"The preserve is really chill. It has a mix of families and students but as someone who needs quiet (I WFH in a relatively confidential field) with a gf who can't sleep with noise and we've never had an issue. Management and maintenance are really kind and host a lot of events and give out free food. 

Also, a bit off topic but since you seem to be from out of town, I do not recommend working at DCH. My gf was a PCA there and came home with tons of bruises and scratches. Worse, the management there did nothing about it except try to gas light her and tell her that it was her fault for getting hurt despite never experiencing that any other hospital. Also, they kept sending her home with really sketchy contracts (like work 12 hour shifts 6 days a week, sign away overtime and we'll give you a one time bonus of $500). Besides her personal awful treatment there, some other friends of ours that were nurses and expressed similar issues. Also, I heard that some of old nurses and pcas are in the process of filing a case against the hospital.

"I don't think any of the organizers would disagree with much of what you wrote.  

We put together discussions on topics we know something about; generally with an intl focus; and where we can draw on our colleagues from UA and elsewhere to bring in some expertise.  That's most of what drives our agenda.  

The Ukraine war is important because it involves an invasion by a large nuclear-armed state power at the borders of NATO, and the US is also a large nuclear-armed state w/an obligation to defend its allies by all means.  So it raises the prospects of some very bad things if it escalates/expands/goes bad.  That's not purely a media invention, IMO -- I wish it were!  

The domestic effects of US wars, the toll on Americans who serve, and the problem of homelessness (both vets and not vets) -- these are all serious, important, & worth talking about.  I'm not sure we have much 'added value' to offer on that conversation -- we're not experts in that kind of policy, and expertise by its nature tends to be narrow and deep -- a few trees, not the whole forest.

* This is not just for wealthy families and private schools. There's a provision for participating schools to charge tuition for students participating from outside their home districts.

* the non- income-based provisions don't set in until 2024-25 school year and beyond. The segment that OP is digging on (weathly kids, private schools) don't figure in the way OP claims until 2 years into the program. 

* This is an education version of an HSA. 

* OP only ever uses this account to spam Alabama subreddits when a legislative agenda doesn't agree with them.

"Graduating with no, or little, student debt is a MASSIVE advantage that you don't appreciate until you're older. So if UA is throwing money at you and Austin isn't, do UA. 

That said, in terms of life, it depends on what you are used to. Having lived here for 6 years now, I find it pretty boring, but I come from the Northeast big cities. I'm not a student, but even still, there's nothing really fun here except for the University. Lake life is lake life, same as it is anywhere. Bar life here is good for what it is, but pretty limited in my opinion. Austin will most definitely have a better bar scene. The parks you reference are pretty basic here as well. When football is done, there isn't much going on until spring/summer hit. The outdoor amphitheater gets a handful of big acts and there are some festivals and Friday night free concerts for local/amateur acts. 

It's hard to argue that Tuscaloosa offers anything that Austin won't. That's why it comes down to what you like and what you are used to, and if you want to experience something different: small town living or city living?

"Personally I would go to UA. I agree with what everyone is saying about Austin having way more to offer simply because it is a bigger city and has a ton more culture than Tuscaloosa. 

That being said, Tuscaloosa has a lot to offer but you just have to look harder for it. There is a pretty cool art community that does a sort of 'open house' every month. There's bike clubs you can join. Lots of volunteer opportunities that might be harder to get into in a bigger city. Lake Tuscaloosa is awesome (although its really only fun if you know someone who will take you on their boat.) And Hurricane Creek is an absolutely free and wonderful place you can hang out, swim, and hike. There's some really nice parks, a small arboretum, and a big state park that you can camp at. The food scene is definitely lacking but it's getting there, and there are some cool craft cocktail bars as well.

You'll be about 4 hours away from the beach, close to Atlanta and Bham for concerts, close to Mobile for Mardi Gras, I think NOLA is only 5 hours away.

As long as you aggressively put yourself out there, join clubs, go outside, take people up on their offers to try new things I think you could be happy there. I have found its easiest to do this when you're new in town, people are more likely to befriend the new kid because they want to show you all their favorite spots. And graduating with little to no student loan debt is a thing of beauty.

But on the other hand you only live once, if Austin is calling your name and that's where you think you'd have the best experience then go for it!",t2_1cf5jh94,hkshett,0,1646427429.0,0,t1_hzd5nrv,hzd5nrv,True,AccomplishedMood3191,t3_t66g1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/tuscaloosa/comments/t66g1y/between_ut_and_ua/,Between UT and UA,/r/tuscaloosa/comments/t66g1y/between_ut_and_ua/hzd5nrv/,1,r/tuscaloosa,0,1

"Austin is just awesome and unlike Tuscaloosa, there are a TON of high-paying employers in town (startups, Dell, FAANG outposts, etc.) that hire directly from UT. That employment pipeline is one of the #1 reasons to choose UT over UA. Plus, UT seemingly has a much stronger student entrepreneurship program, with much more $$$ available to student startups. A lot of UA students end up leaving Alabama for better paying jobs elsewhere, such as in Texas.

Tuscaloosa is probably OK if you're a grad student and middling if you're just a regular person (which I am) – it is seriously lacking in the following areas:

* Startup culture
* Music
* Restaurants (no Salty Sow, no food truck scene!)
* Shopping
* Parks (Austin has Zilker Park, which is one of the greatest urban parks in the country)

"The number one factor here, to me, having spent time in both Tuscaloosa and Austin, is your willingness to independently chase opportunity. As someone who has tried to take advantage of every opportunity presented to them at UA, been involved in research/leadership/internships/etc., if you are willing and motivated UA can give you every opportunity to succeed, to excel, and to stand out. One thing to point out is that since the bar is generally lower, hard work goes a longer way than at a place like UT where everyone is exceptional. End of the day, companies care more about the opportunities / experiences you’ve had over the quality of your degree.

I don’t know as much about Austin, but I spent the summer in the area for my internship. Austin definitely has a ton more going for it in things to do. The best you’re gonna get in Tuscaloosa, especially going into college pre-21, is getting involved in Greek life or finding a good group of friends. Most of the entertainment here really is the bars and football as others have said, so keep your goals in mind. As someone who came in with no passion for bars or football, I’ve still had a fantastic time here, though I’ve also grown to enjoy both. Additionally, especially for engineering, Austin has a much better reputation overall (business excluded) and probably a better career fair….

BUT: for what it’s worth, don’t think that you’re severely limiting yourself career-wise by going to UA. Our business school is booming and, regardless of degree, if you choose to chase the opportunity, you can get a job pretty much anywhere. I’m in engineering and will be starting at a software startup out of college that pays just as well as what I could’ve gotten w a degree out of UT. With no student loans. It’s not the usual here, but it is possible. 

TLDR:

 UT: better entertainment and academic environment but you’re gonna be paying off student loans for the next twenty years of your life.

UA: more independence required to excel, but the ceiling is the same as UT and w/ scholarship it’s a good deal.",t2_4z38kcy7,tryinryan_,0,1646369963.0,0,t1_hza3ab3,hza3ab3,True,AccomplishedMood3191,t3_t66g1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/tuscaloosa/comments/t66g1y/between_ut_and_ua/,Between UT and UA,/r/tuscaloosa/comments/t66g1y/between_ut_and_ua/hza3ab3/,4,r/tuscaloosa,0,4

If you visited Austin and loved the busy environment, and feel like you would thrive in a city, I’d suggest you go there. I think there’s more diverse options for having fun in Austin and also, on paper, you’d be getting a better education at UT.

"I was raised in small, traditional church and actually feel more at home at COTH than I ever did there. (I know that is not everyone’s experience.) 
COTH strongly encourages small groups and while I haven’t joined one yet, I’ve heard so many stories. For instance, last week a lady and her family had covid and her small group took turns bringing the family dinner every night. The youth leaders (each location has their own set, and own location pastor) attend sporting events and pageants, etc of their youth. 
I really get a sense of closeness from the church and each location, which seems wild as I was anti-mega church for years. 
They go the extra mile to make sure no one is left out or behind, they recently had a youth conference at the Birmingham location free of charge, and they provided 4 charter buses from Tuscaloosa alone free of charge. Just a few examples. 
To be 100% fair I was raised in a southern baptist church with Sunday school and the whole shebang. Everyone talked about each other and knew everyone’s business, but I never remember them helping each other.

"If you've never been the Barber Vintage motorcycle museum is tremendous, all sorts of stuff in there, not just motorcycles.  Plus, there's Barber Motorsports park itself just behind the museum.  Can't recommend going there enough.  My brother and I have been about 2 dozen times between the both of us.  Indy car racing, sports car, vintage festivals, bike racing, all sorts of entertainment.  

The US space and rocket center in Huntsville is probably the best museum/experience I've had since visiting Wright Patt in Dayton Ohio.  They've got an entire Saturn V rocket, suspended in midair sideways and broken into pieces to walk around and under.  They do a tour of redstone arsenal just across the way which is worth it's weight on gold.  We got to see lots of warehouses and proving grounds where they're assembling rockets and engines.  We also talked to the lady in charge of the crew aboard the ISS, and got to meet her the day before they were returning an astronaut from space so the mission control was very busy.

They've got mock space stations to walk through, lots of rockets from throughout spaceflight history including a full scale model of the space shuttle.

"This property is one of the remaining original properties from pre-tornado era. ALDOT bought some right of way a couple years after the tornado when they did the McFarland access management from 15th to 13th streets and the expansion of the McFarland and 15th/Veterans Memorial intersection in 2016, so any new development would be too small to fit a new building + the off street parking needed. Interesting enough, speaking of the billboards, on the GIS parcel map it shows the advertising billboard as its own little parcel within the gas station property. There are also apparently old gasoline tanks underneath the property which is seen as a liability if the state or the city were to buy the entire property when they did the highway expansion since they would have had to clean those up, which would've driven up the total cost of the McFarland project.

"Another thing I just realized: I measured the width of the loading zones and traffic lanes on Google Earth: apparently the former parking spaces are only 6 feet wide while the traffic lanes are 12 feet wide, so there is probably not enough space for the truck to fit in. 6 feet wide loading zone is too narrow for those large 18-wheelers to fit in. Reducing the width of each travel/turning lane by 1 feet each and shifting all travel lanes to the north should allow for an additional 3 feet of space on the south side loading zones for trucks to fit in, as standard truck trailers like pictured above can have a width of no more than 8ft 6in as per federal regulations.",t2_11ieih,asdfjkll2,0,1643693524.0,0,t1_hv3j34x,hv3j34x,True,cjskLdie,t3_sdcsm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tuscaloosa/comments/sdcsm3/i_ate_at_jimmy_johns_today_because_there_wasnt/,I ate at Jimmy John’s today because there wasn’t any parking option at Chipotle on the Strip.

"I do this, more as a passionate hobby and for friends and family.  If you want to do it right, you'll need to do paint correction prior to doing the ceramic.  Even if the truck is brand new.  The ceramic coating process is by far the easiest step in the process.  It's analogous to painting a vehicle- all of the sanding and prep is 95% of the work.  Actually painting a vehicle takes only an hour or two total.  I usually have about 20 hours into a paint correction and the ceramic coating only takes a couple of hours.

The modern clear coats absolutely suck, but ceramic for sure is the way to go.  Also, know that these new ceramic coatings truly are badass, but don't be fooled by the 10 year warranties.  You do need to maintain them now and again, and you just can't run them through the brushed wash places with their strip washes and all that.  If you love the vehicle and want it to look incredible for years, you'll have to hand wash it and use a spray topper.  But...these new spray boosters are nuts over what was available just a couple of years ago, and you can do this part (the maintenance) yourself.   I've been detailing cars for 30+ years and these new products and the results are simply mindboggling to me.

"So the parking on University Blvd was removed due to the problem above: Trucks parking in the center turning lane, the problem is that it reduced a decent number of parking spaces without any new parking being created elsewhere. In addition, as mentioned in previous comments, some of the off-street parking (like Publix) is zoned specifically for their customers' use and all others get booted/towed away. As a civil engineer (no I do not work for the city) who graduated from UA 2 years ago, I think there are a couple solutions that should be studied for the Strip parking issues.  


**Parking Deck within the Strip**

First off, a parking deck is going to be needed somewhere close to the strip. Downtown Tuscaloosa has plenty of on street parking plus there is the parking deck downtown that is underutilized, while the Strip has very little public parking that can be used by anyone, with tow away zone signs everywhere on private parking lots and no public parking deck at all. Potential locations for this could be replacing the Publix parking lot with a 3-story parking deck (publix customer parking on the bottom, and everyone else parking on the upper 2 levels), replace gravel parking lot behind Publix into a parking deck, or replacing the bottom half of the Ten Hoor surface parking with a parking deck (for the last two scenarios those with west commuter parking permits will be allocated 1 of the three or more levels to keep the number of west commuter spots the same).  Pricing structure for a Strip parking deck could be something like the 1st hour free (similar to the 1 hr parking of the removed spots in the new loading zone), then $1 for 2 hour, then the normal UA parking deck rate of $2 additional hour  up to $10 maximum daily charge. On weekends the 1st hour is free then the $.50 per additional hour.  


**Improve Transit with a Downtown->Strip/UA/DCH-> Alberta Express Bus Route**

Second, public transport needs to be improved to the strip. While the University Shuttle trolley has a stop right in the heart of the Strip in both directions, the bus only runs once a hour compared to the 12 to 20 minute headways on Crimson Ride bus routes. Speaking of Crimson Ride buses, only one bus (the Residential bus) stops by the Strip by the UPS store, and in only one direction (back when I was still in school it was served by two bus routes). My idea is to create a new express bus route running along University Boulevard from downtown to Alberta, running both directions with 10-15 minute headways. Starting at the downtown parking deck, it makes stops at the Strip (same bus stop as existing University Shuttle route), University Blvd and 6th Avenue intersection, DCH/Capstone College of Nursing, then ending in Alberta where a turning loop/terminal would be located with potential mixed used development around it (on the old LeLand shopping plaza which was destroyed in the 2011 tornado). The express bus route then makes the westbound run in reverse order back to downtown. The express bus route would be able to interchange with the Holt Route in the Alberta terminal, allowing transfers between the express route and that route outside of the downtown intermodal facility. This would allow more trips between downtown, the Strip, UA, DCH, and Alberta to be made efficiently by transit instead of driving, reducing some of the traffic and freeing up parking for those who do not have decent access to transit or no transit at all (like those living north of the river).  


**Additional Bike Infrastructure from downtown to UA**  
As a final note, the city of Tuscaloosa recently got a $17 million RAISE grant for improvements to the University Boulevard corridor. The project does mention bike lanes but I am not sure where they would go (bike lanes already exist from Wallace Wade Avenue to Peter Bryce Boulevard.) A shared use path is also in place from 6th St to the nursing school/DCH, and from the US82 interchange over the railroad into Alberta. The missing gap in the path at US82 will be filled in with the upcoming University Boulevard bridge replacement project over US82 (this project is different from the RAISE grant awarded a couple months ago). Like with buses, bike infrastructure can move some trips onto different transportation modes, further reducing traffic and freeing up space for those who have no other choice but to drive.  


**Questions/Comments?**

With all of that being said, are there any other options that should be looked at? When planning transformative/large infrastructure projects there are often public involvement meetings where the public can chime in and point out areas of concern which the engineers/designers might have missed during the initial study/planning/design phase. I would be very happy to answer questions/concerns others would have on this topic. With all these solutions implemented I think it would be a win-win for local residents, visitors, students and faculty, and businesses within the Strip. Thanks for reading and Roll Tide!

"I have not heard of any bad reviews about Avery.  There is certainly an advantage to having the work done locally in case there are problems.  The 4.7l engine had some design flaws that included restricted oil flow passages and the aluminum heads with steel valve seats that were simply seated and then fall out when experiencing high heat. PROMAR advertised that they improved the oil flow and designed retainers for the valve seats - that compared to a ""standard"" local rebuild with no engine ""improvements"" and the immediate availability of the reman engine was a choice I made that has worked out so far.

I had already decided to keep my Jeep as I had bought it new, 2001, and maintained so I decided the reman engine was cheaper than buying new.

Druid City Brewing Company - great beer and people. Local artists, musicians, grad students, yuppies and professor can usually be found here. They also have an amazing open mic on Sundays.

Loosa Brews - larger, chill pub with a list of 100+ beers. Comfortable seating, arcade in the back.

The Alcove - Downtown. Great cocktails & regional beer list. More professional crowd. You can also find live music here occasionally.

The Grey Lady - Downtown. Amazing pub vibes, definitely the liveliest of this list. Decent beer list and drink specials.

"From what I understand maintenance has a cleared path to a job with Mercedes, esp if you get in 16whatever body shop now that they've phased out most of the production workers there in favor of just maintenance. The shop floor IT folks kinda just go tossed around wherever and while layoffs aren't common, the benefits are ass with most of the contractors. I think the pay is probably about the same with the maintenance having a higher top end. If you're IT and managed to get hired by mbusi to work upstairs it changes a lot though. They've got specialty teams that usually have mbusi project managers who occasionally come up from shopfloor IT. They do really well from what I've heard.

That said I definitely wouldn't leave maintenance for IT. Your work might be harder sometimes, but the contractor companies we have to deal with are snakes.

"Some of the automotive suppliers have salary jobs open that are, on paper, what you are looking for. Your mileage may vary though based on how you set your boundaries with the company (this is dictated by your boss and how replaceable* you are). Some will expect so many work hours that your pay per hour drops below $20 an hour, and some still call you all times of night. These are not usually entry level jobs, so experience/degree is required normally.

If you're looking for entry-level, I think Hobby Lobby has decent starting pay and other similar businesses may be close to that. Not being accepting of night shift may decrease your prospects at some places, day shift is usually for employees with higher seniority.

*On being replaceable, there is the whole thing about ""a company will replace you in two days, you don't matter to them"". In my experience the second part of that is true, but the first is plainly bullshit. Some people just can't be replaced quickly because of skill set and/or the amount of work they can get done.

"Shrimp Basket on McFarland Blvd, it's not even half a mile off the interstate, so it's easy access.  Gulf seafood, Po Boys and Cajun style dishes available.  It's not pricey either, about $15 a person.

Nick's in the Sticks, is a great hole in the wall steakhouse.  Easy to miss, as it has no big sign out in front of it, but pretty good food at reasonable prices.  If you eat here, you have to try their signature cocktail, the Nicodemus.  

I like Los Tarascos if you are in the mood for Mexican, and Mr. Chen's on 15th street if you are in the mood for Asian.

I'm  obviously  not  young  these days  but  my opinion  is  to  check the place  out   before  you  come here  permanently.  I moved to  Tuscaloosa   over a decade ago  and  I was  amazed  at  how  damn  racist and  bigoted  the place  still is.  Birmingham  totally different  but  even the college  is  terribly conservative  and    racist/homophobic.   There's  only one  gay bar  but  it's more  of  a late night  drag show  bar  rather  than  a place to  hangout  and chill.  I'm sure  there's  small groups  that  carve out  a  niche  but  it's  still  very much  not  out in the open.

"Owned a 1br/1ba from roughly 2007-2017. The downstairs are all single units, and 2nd and 3rd level are all 2bed/2bath. Things were always nice there, good maintenance folks for the common areas, pool, roof, etc. They actively worked to keep stray animals away. 
 
While I lived there probably 25% of people had dogs and would hang out in the courtyard and let the dogs play. In the summer it is super quiet and mostly grad students.
