"I know this is a long answer to a simple question, but I felt compelled to share some examples of why Baton Rouge's infrastructure is broken and needs more than another lane or two to fix it.

\--

interstate infrastructure in BTR can be boiled down into the amount of traffic lanes that flow through the city. While there are plenty of exits on & off the interstate, the breakdown is traffic cannot flow through the city during peak hours.

When you add up all the interstate lanes flowing through the city, excluding exit lanes and off ramps, you find the following totals:

&#x200B;

* **12 Lanes** \- Adding both east and west bound lanes on both I-10 & I-12 leading up to the merge of the two interstates.
* **9 Lanes** \- After the two interstates merge it goes down to 9 at the I-10/12 split. (4 Lanes Eastbound / 5 Lanes Westbound)
* **7 Lanes** \- It further goes down at the College Dr. exit
* **6 Lanes** \- Reducing down again at the Acadian Thruway exit
* **4 Lanes** \- Before the bridge at the I-10 / I-110 split
* **3 Lanes** \- Just before the merger of I-10E into I-110E you lose one of the two travel lanes, forcing half of I-10E's traffic to have to merge into downtown's I-110 travel lanes.",t2_hrstm,Ruebilax,0,1648263974.0,0,t1_i25flj1,i25flj1,True,peckrnutt3u,t3_to0nj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/batonrouge/comments/to0nj4/is_this_a_normal_friday/,Is this a normal friday?,/r/batonrouge/comments/to0nj4/is_this_a_normal_friday/i25flj1/,3,r/batonrouge,0,3

"Damn so many people commenting some really great ones. If some of these have already been said my bad!

Elsie’s Plate and Pie - obviously the pies but serves a mean burger with some great apps

Chow yum phat - one of my favorites, great Asian style noodle place. If you love peanuts a lot of their dishes are infused with them in a subtle way. Probably my favorite dumplings in town. 

Philly me up - philly style sandwiches with a Louisiana twist. This spot is great!!!

Sammys - awesome and consistent crawfish

Jinya - ramen spot

Red zeppelin - my favorite pizza place in town. Keep in mind the owner is a hard maga, so some people may turn up their nose at it. 

Curry n Kabab - the best curry spot IMO really good, kinda expensive

Smiling dog - great pub food. Their burgers fucking slap!!!

Chimes - I personally think they have gone down hill at the east location. The west location is still fairly solid albeit slightly overrated IMO. Serious quality issues in the last 2 years. But a place to keep in mind. Very very popular.

"Bin 77 has a pretty great outside atmosphere, probably the best patio in town, often has musical artists playing 6:30-8/9:00.  Tons of drink options and wine.  They are first come first serve seating, but usually not hard to get a spot on a week night with parties under 4.  Would recommend the seafood curry or lamb ragout with pappardelle.   Their steak is also pretty great, and their mixed green salad with chicken is a great taste pairing. 

Another option i’d suggest is French Market Bistro or Louisiana Lagniappe for inside more romantic traditional dinners.   Louisiana Lagniappe has a tuna steak thats literally the main reason I go there, and great appetizers.   French market has amazing oysters and also their fish and steak specials are always legit.  Ask about their specialty creme brule of the day.

"Maybe you could get dinner at somewhere romantic like Ninos and then spend some time walking around Perkins row, you could get dinner at Tsunamis and see if anything is going on at the Manship theater, you could get dinner downtown somewhere romantic (people really like Cocha?) and then wander around….

You could hit up the farmers market on Saturday downtown and then cook a nice meal together with ingredients you find. You can pack a picnic and go fishing / painting/ another activity at a local park. I like the park off Harrells ferry because the lake is pretty and it’s small but highland road is pretty for their parks. 

You can go to dinner and then go see what’s going on at the highland road observatory…

"No, she WOULDN'T answer that question. Because it has no relation to her job, or being on the Supreme Court.

The job actually has many qualifications, of which Judge Jackson goes above and beyond. She was an Ivy League law school graduate (who was accepted of her own merit, not through money or legacy), she was a clerk for the Supreme Court, a public defender, on the sentencing commission, as well as seated in the District Court, and the Court of Appeals.

That means, in the last decade, the Senate has confirmed her qualifications three times.

Meanwhile, let's look at Justice Barrett's qualifications when she was confirmed. She was also on the sentencing commission, and then a judge on the Court of Appeals. This means she has never overseen an actual trial. When questioned about the Bill of Rights, she blanked on the first five bills. She couldn't answer the softest of questions during her confirmation.

"If your partner works in BR and you may take a job in New Orleans, I agree with the person who said to move to Gonzales. Anywhere within the east side of Ascension Parish actually would be good, Gonzales or Prairieville area.

Ascension would be a good commute compromise, and if you ever plan to have children, the schools here are better than most of EBR.

"Hihi, I know this post is a month-ish old but I’ve been browsing the sub for a new place. 
I live there & I’ve got a (furnished) 3b/3ba for 500, utilities about 55/month. I got paired w 2 random girls (both younger than me). You lowkey get what you pay for here. It’s pretty touch and go. Said it was fully furnished & told me they have a tv in the living room. Move in day, NOPE! They have “wifi” but it’s for the whole complex so it’s easier to get a router & hook it up to that so you get your own slice of it without being kicked off every 3 minutes. Bathrooms are good sized and walk in closets. The fault is that they paint the bathtubs & the paint has slowly been chipping off since day 1. Maintenance takes forever if you’re not on their ass. We didn’t have AC and they couldn’t come fix it bc “it wasn’t above 80 in the house” so it wasn’t an emergency; told us to open the doors. Was also told they would replace my air filter and they have yet to do it. Thankfully I know to replace it bc of my horrible allergies. 
Staff is college kids mostly, they’re nice just sometimes don’t seem like they know what they’re doing. Parking isn’t too bad..the concrete is constantly fucked up. Kitchen is tiny af and washer/dryer stack and it’s a front load (another personal hell). I think that’s about it for that place. If you’ve found another spot that’s decently priced, please bang my line bc I’m trying to move as soon as the lease is up.

"Depends on what you want in a tattoo artist. Chris Allen at Alley Cats in Lobdell (formerly of Atomic Ink in BR) has been my tattoo artist going on 15+ years. He's \*astoundingly\* good. I'm going to be blunt, though... if you're looking for a TV reality show interaction (y'know... you bring in art, they work up a piece, you dicker about back and forth with a bunch of changes, then he bangs something out), you're not going to be happy. He's a SPECTACULAR artist in a small shop doing what he does, but the interaction usually looks like me stopping in with an idea, us chatting over whomever he's working on, he says he can do that (he always says he can do that, lol), I book a time/date, bring any source material, then he literally bangs out an idea as part of that initial appointment then commences to ink. I have a total of 17 pieces, 12 of those are Chris'. My husband goes to him. Most of my friends do. He's worth it.

"I commuted from the Old Jefferson area to Metairie 3-5 days per week for 6mo prior to covid.

This was my rhythm:

Be in my car no later than 5:45 am leaving BR, hit I-10 and try to be crossing into Kenner by about 6:40. If you see tail lights when you get to the Loyola exit, go one exit down or so to Williams — exit right, immediately get into the left turn lane to turn onto Veterans. Go down about ~1.5ish mi and get back on I-10. That’ll skip most of the congestion. 

I’d be in my office by 7 almost every day and miss the worst traffic. 

Leaving, if you can manage it, you’ll want to be headed to your car between 2:45 and 3. Too much later and you’ll get stuck on the way back.

If you can negotiate some remote days per week, do it. The commute is physically and mentally draining, but in my case it was a good career opportunity. Make sure you’ve done the math on gas as well especially right now.

There's an overabundance of caution now, but it's also a large part admitting that workers need to stay home and prepare their family and house for storms.

It's getting better though. Pre flood getting locked in was fairly common. Methanex locked us in during a tornado and a sheriff's deputy let us out with a pair of bolt cutters.

"Only when the threat level of tornadoes/damaging wind/flooding is high. Today we’re under a 4/5 risk for hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes - all coming through between 2pm- 5pm, right in the middle of dismissal and after school activities. I think it’s perfectly reasonable to have early dismissal at 12pm. The kids get over a half day in school and there’s 2 hours to get home until the damaging winds get here. 

But it seems to be inconsistent sometimes. When Tropical Storm Nicholas came through, nothing was cancelled or closed early. Maybe because we’d already missed so many days due to Ida. But I had to walk through shin-deep water to get to my car and it took me an hour to get home to get around flooded streets. My friend almost didn’t make it through quickly rising water while picking up her kids. Then she couldn’t get into her neighborhood. She had to park her car on a random street on one side of high water and her husband, who was luckily home, parked on the other side. She and her husband had to carry their babies in their arms while wading through water to get to the dry street. 

That never used to happen. That’s all new. Also, weather forecasts have gotten much better at predicting when severe weather will happen. So it makes sense to me that schools close more due to severe weather than they used to, because we didn’t used to get weather like this, and if we did, we didn’t have time to prepare like we do now.",t2_3np664vq,FakinItAndMakinIt,0,1647970624.0,0,t1_i1oqv5r,i1oqv5r,True,onedaysomehow,t3_tk58yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/batonrouge/comments/tk58yf/everything_closing_down_because_of_the_weather/,everything closing down because of the weather,/r/batonrouge/comments/tk58yf/everything_closing_down_because_of_the_weather/i1oqv5r/,7,r/batonrouge,0,7

"I'm an attorney who has written a threatening letter to a HOA once which kinda solved the problem. But as far as suing goes, the chances of you getting the money back are slim. There isn't a big ""you were right"" fund to pay your attorney fees. If the HOA agreement doesn't have a specific provision for attorney fees for enforcement, you can't get those reimbursed even if you win. And the damages in contract cases are pretty minimal.

Sad reality is that, if the mean letter doesn't work, fixing the roof yourself would be cheaper than litigation.

"I second this opinion. 

I’ve taught numerous friends to ride in my life, have ridden from new orleans to Toronto Canada, New Orleans to San Francisco, put 200,000 miles on an 1150GS traveling and camping all over the US- all this to say I’ve spent a lot of my life on bikes. 

I all but quit street riding and sold three bikes since moving to BR. For reference, I moved from the french quarter where everyone is driving drunk as shit. 

These students in their giant trucks will fuck you up in this city. I was nearly hit 3 times last day out in BR. Following all traffic laws, riding sensibly, these little shits just don’t see bikes on the street. They’re fucking around on their phones and have been driving for a year or so. 

Most dangerous place I’ve ever ridden motorcycles, and I’ve been all over the world on them. 

I’m sure this won’t dissuade you. With that in mind I have a little honda grom that’s about the best bike imaginable to learn on. Weighs 125 pounds.  Fun.

"Genuinely curious if this works for what? I don’t see a money basket, but here in Texas we have some churches that get donations for various activities by having kids and an adult from the church stand on the corner with signs… ""Help us get to our mission trip,"" whatever the case may be.

If you’re asking if signs like this work to save people, who knows. I suspect tons of people drive past this intersection and maybe one person is considering suicide and maybe hearing Jesus saves makes them stick around for another day. So, I mean, I figure no harm to anyone else, but maybe it did help that one struggling person, ya know?

Some churches have their members — what’s the word? I cannot think of it — but basically you have to go out and tell others about God. So he may be doing that. Maybe he’s reminding people that Jesus saves and not the church. 

Anyway, I wasn’t sure what you were asking, if what works, so I figured I’d throw multiple reasons for one man’s sign out there. 😁",t2_asjm59o9,Feisty_Beach392,0,1647785780.0,0,t1_i1elqvk,i1elqvk,True,worlds_okayest_mum,t3_ti4n18,https://www.reddit.com/r/batonrouge/comments/ti4n18/genuinely_curious_if_this_works/,Genuinely curious if this works,/r/batonrouge/comments/ti4n18/genuinely_curious_if_this_works/i1elqvk/,4,r/batonrouge,0,4

"Honestly, I wish there had been a wider poll.  We have a couple of units in our building operating as short-term rentals, and it's awful.

There are unfamiliar vehicles parked outside when you leave for work and return every night, so it's difficult to be observant for things that are out of the ordinary.  Ever since this started, it's like living in a motel, only worse, because there is no front desk to manage issues.  

Often you get crowds having a party, or traveling contractors that thump around all night.  By law, we are entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of our properties, rental or otherwise.

We moved here because this style of flat is efficient and cost effective, and walkups promote urban development through density.

"Standard Time is the time we keep in the winter - those are the sunrise and sunset times you see in the post screenshot. Daylight Savings Time has been around in the US since the early 1900s, used off and on, but more recently during the summer months - most states start DST the spring (March) and end in the fall (November). DST moves the clock one hour ahead. Proponents of DST say it increases outdoor activity due to the extra hour of daylight in the evening, saves energy, and reduces car accidents. 

But the consequences of moving back and forth between ST and DST are well documented. Moving to just one year-round time, whether ST or DST, is one of the few things almost all Americans agree on. There are pros and cons to staying at ST or DST. 

The US Senate just passed a bill to move the entire country to year-round DST in November 2023. Essentially, that would just mean that next year, instead of moving our clocks “back” an hour as usual in the fall, we’d keep them at DST. 

It very breezily passed through Senate which is weird since usually bills are introduced in the House first. Now the House will be responsible for the final vote, before it’s signed into law. I think everyone realizes this shouldn’t be a snap decision and it should be debated and discussed, which the House will now have to since the Senate didn’t bother. They haven’t scheduled to have those debates anytime soon, but there’s plenty of time to address it before November of next year.",t2_3np664vq,FakinItAndMakinIt,0,1647733538.0,0,t1_i1ccoxy,i1ccoxy,False,FakinItAndMakinIt,t3_tgogjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/batonrouge/comments/tgogjk/fun_fact_if_the_us_moves_to_permanent_daylight/,"Fun fact: if the US moves to permanent daylight savings time, the latest time of sunrise in Baton Rouge (which occurs in January) will be 8:02am.",/r/batonrouge/comments/tgogjk/fun_fact_if_the_us_moves_to_permanent_daylight/i1ccoxy/,2,r/batonrouge,0,2

"One of my boyfriends years ago had 2 ferrets for pets. Just to give you a reality check on what owning a ferret is like- they have a stinky, musky odor, even after their glands (?) have been removed. They will poop and pee in every corner of every room in your house. Even if you get them the littler corner litter box, they will still go in any corner they can find. They are not like cats in that regard. Maybe my boyfriend just didn't spend enough time training them - I don't know.   Also they can squeeze into very very small spaces. They would frequently go missing only to be found hours later inside the framework of a couch or recliner taking a nap.

"I apologize for the book I'm about to post (Top Half will be general recommendations, Bottom half is licensing information):

First of I just want to say, Learning to ride and ride safely can be one of the best decisions you'll ever make.

If your looking to learn, your best option is a class (see below). However watching some safety, training, or just general motorcycle videos is still a decent start. Next read the MOM as we call it: Properly known as the motorcycle operator manual (can be found by searching LSP Motorcycle Operator Manual, sorry the link is broken).

Also start considering what style of bike you might want, and what your interested in. Lot of options out there.

**MOST IMPORTANT:** Begin “learning” and understanding what Counter-steering is and how it affects the bike ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzk8oyNO708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzk8oyNO708)). This is the one of the MOST Crucial things you will need to understand. This is sometimes referred to as Push left go left, push right go right. Failure to understand Counter-steering can lead to you subconsciously reacting in a way that does not agree with the physics of a motorcycle. 

Personally I would also check out FortNine on youtube. Lot of interesting and informative videos in an easy to digest format ranging from Motorcycle and gear reviews, to basic fun lessons on the physics or mechanics of a motorcycle. Probably one of the best channels out there imo.

Other recommended channels:  Ride Like a Pro Jerry (More Intermediate Training) and Yammie Noob (If your just looking for fun content. Or if your a squid who wants to ride a turbo busa)

When your ready for your license go get fitted for an ECE 22.05 or Snell (Motorcycle) Helmet (Cycle gear here will get you sorted), grab some Eye protection and decent riding gloves. You can get Armor as well if you want, but leather clothing also works great.

TL;DR Fuck this state and all of it's catch 22s

**So you have 3(4) main options of obtaining your license:**

1. Schedule an appointment with the DMV to do your written test and skills test. Both are extremely easy (Like illegaly easy). You need an 80% (20/25) on the written test which is just a multiple choice test on a computer comprised of 70% motorcycle safety/road knowledge and general motor laws (Signs and shit). Following your written test you will take a ""Skills test"". At the Baton Rouge DMV this will consist on either doing A.) 3 Figure 8s or B.) 2 Circles depending on the day of the week (Literally not joking, Note: Your feet can't touch the ground). However the Skills test features a ""Catch 22"" (I will list this at the bottom. After all of this is complete pay the $15/$20 (I can't remember) for your license
2. Take the LSP Basic Rider course. It's 15 hours over 2 1/2 or 2 day schedule. The dates are extremely spread out, and are in random cities on different dates ([http://www.lsp.org/pdf/motorcycle\_schedule.pdf](http://www.lsp.org/pdf/motorcycle_schedule.pdf)).  90% chance that all of the sessions are filled. They fill up fast (last year all of the spring courses were maxed out by March). This course will cost $100 if your using an LPS Motorcycle or $25 if you bring your own (Catch 22 below will apply to this as well, SO JUST PAY THE $100). If you take your course through LPS you will get a voucher to exempt both the skills and written test and then you just need to pay for your license.
3. Take the New Rider Course at a Harley Dealer (My Recommendation, You will have to drive outside of Baton Rouge but the Bike is provided. I would recommend Mike Bruno's). This will cost $99 (Wed, Sat, Sun or Tue, Wed, Thur) or ($199/295 for prime dates (FRI, SAT, SUN)). This will be similar to the LSP Basic Rider course, but more laid back with some Harley Davidson Advertisements thrown in. The first hour of the course is touring a dealership. But the classes are laid back, and the instructors are extremely lenient on the exams. This course however with only exempt you from the Skills test. You will still need to take a written test. This may have changed, but most instructors are not fully ""re-upped"" or whatever with the DMV so their accreditation only applies towards the Skills test (Written test is a joke, so still a good deal if LSP is full)
4. Take a class at one of the rare private instructors. Will almost certainly have higher prices, and even fewer classes. They are also extremely difficult to get a hold of or even find useful information about.

**Now the Catch 22:**

You can NOT take the skills test or bring your own bike to the LSP class unless it is Registered, Insured, and inspected (LSP also requires it's below 550cc). However to get your bike Insured you need an endorsement/license, You also need an endorsement/license to get your bike inspected (See where I'm going). To take your skills test at the DMV (Skipping the classes) you will need to follow these steps:

1. Find an insurance provider who will grant a temporary insurance policy (Your mileage will vary: Geico gave me 48 hours, and progressive told me to fuck off)
2. Take your bike (I took mine in a uhaul van) to get inspected at an approved Motorcycle inspection center. They will tell you no since you don't have the endorsement. Proceed to argue with them for 2 - 3 hours about how you already went to the DMV and you can't take your test until the bike is inspected and that your temporary tag is in fact your registration as well (Most places don't realize an MC Temp tag is also its initial registration). They will then take your $20 and give you an Orange failure tag.
3. Exchange your Insurance information, Orange Failure tag, and temporary registration at the DMV for the opportunity to ride your motorcycle in circles for 30 seconds to prove you aren't going to die the moment you dump the clutch.
4. Return to said inspection center to get your bike properly certified (Bring back your receipt and failure sticker so the inspection is free) and then ride off into the sunset like a badass.

Or just ask a friend to borrow their bike. That works too. But it's difficult when you either A.) Don't have friends, or B.) Don't have friends with a bike. Strangers work too I guess.

If you have any questions or want any additional information let me know. It seems like a lot, but 100% worth it.

Finally word of advice: No matter what, take the class. Its nothing but beneficial and will help with insurance. It may also save your ass one day. I went even though I had been riding for a while. Did I learn anything new? No. But I did refine my muscle memory, and that alone has bailed my ass out ten times over in this god forsaken concrete jungle. I personally went with option 1 and the catch 22 because I couldn't wait and had rode a lot as a kid. I then took the Harley Class anyway for the cheaper insurance. I still found it extremely fun and useful in the long run.

Final Note and This applies to everyone: **DON'T BE A SQUID.** Get some proper gear. Not discount dollar general bullshit or DOT Certified horsecrap. Get an ECE or SNELL helmet and some proper gloves and go have fun on the bun.",t2_4xb4s8b,RunescapeLife,0,1647677767.0,0,t1_i19c9mv,i19c9mv,True,samanthadshay,t3_thmtna,https://www.reddit.com/r/batonrouge/comments/thmtna/aspiring_motorcyclist_in_br/,Aspiring Motorcyclist in BR,/r/batonrouge/comments/thmtna/aspiring_motorcyclist_in_br/i19c9mv/,8,r/batonrouge,0,8

"An international work visa requires a lot of work for an attorney to properly manage. There are also filing and processing costs that the client will be responsible for paying up front. Pro bono work in immigration is heavily done on behalf of undocumented individuals who are seeking asylum in the U.S. I know many immigration attorneys but am unaware of any who have done pro bono work for someone who is college educated and has an offer of employment which seemingly also comes with a living wage. Most attorneys in this area of law are solo practitioners with student loan debt of $200,000 and upwards. They simply cannot afford to work for free on a case that requires many hours of research and drafting. I would recommend trying to find an attorney who offers ""low bono rates"" for income qualified individuals. The hourly rate generally starts at $100 for transcational/ less complex matters. Google Louisiana bar association low bono attorneys. Also a heads up, you will find more immigration attorneys in New Orleans than BR. Good luck to you all. I wish there were more options.
