"Wonderful! 

I spent three or four years volunteering with SPS quite a ways back, and helped do some trainings as well. It's great to see you all still doing your good work! One of these days I plan to come back (I would need to go through training again, as I understand it's changed), but right now school makes it difficult to make that commitment. 

If anyone reading is considering volunteering, I can't recommend it highly enough. Not only do you gain some  valuable skills and meet other amazing volunteers, but you get to really be there for people when they need it most.

Parts of Watsonville are nice, just be careful you're not living in the sticks or in one of the rougher neighborhoods. I wouldn't go much further south than that though, otherwise you're looking at a pretty awful commute to UCSC. 

Soquel, often marketed as ""midtown Santa Cruz"" these days, is being worked on heavily right now, so there's a chance you can find a deal there. Aptos is great if you can find a rental there, nice and quiet.

"Everything's relative. Your experience and perception of SC will depend on where you're coming from and the resources at your disposal. Whether or not you can afford to live here will be more impactful than the water in regards to your quality of life and experience here. Expect a studio to cost \~$1500/month on the low end. There's not much work available locally, so expect to commute over the hill (Bay Area) unless you can work from home or have a skill that's in high demand. Beyond that, It's a cool place to be. Nice weather, mostly chill people, beaches, forests, hiking/biking, etc. We've lost a lot of our local flavor to techies escaping the city, so our more unique spots are succumbing to an overabundance of Starbucks and the like.  Homelessness and addiction are major issues, and watching your step for used needles is a legitimate concern in many parts of town. Bike theft is commonplace and most people turn a blind eye to obvious thieves in broad daylight. Cops would rather write traffic tickets than endanger themselves with their chosen profession. Traffic is pretty bad, especially during tourist season, or when UCSC is doing anything. Different parts of town come with their own unique pros/cons, so look into the neighborhood before you move out here.

"You say young people flock to cities like LA and SF. Saying LA is filled with people like me who want to do music as a career sounds encouraging especially saying its more affordable than SF? But at the same time I wonder if it will be very hot in LA. Idk it seems like you really believe in LA for what I want to do and maybe I can talk to my case manager about it or the program director when I go to the 90 day program in 2 days from now. I don't want my car broken into in SF. I am from NC originally and my mom and sister live in Kernersville. Some people suggested Asheville which I would consider but isn't it kind of small and I know it gets cold there. Maybe I would like the weather in LA. Do you think I can find someplace pretty in LA that feels cozy and lovely? Maybe they have similar resources for mental health subsidized housing. I don't think there is always a wait list scenario at least not here; I've heard of people going into SRO type arrangements after the 90 day program so I wonder if they can do some canvassing and find something similar in LA. What you said about LA kind of brings me hope and makes me excited. I want to believe in it. Maybe the traffic is heavy so that may affect my getting to open mics? But maybe that doesn't need to deter me if LA is definitely where a scene is where I can fit in? I gather you are saying there would be a lot of small venues that would give me a chance? Or would I be ""fighting"" with other of the many aspiring musicians for a spot, or would I still be able to get my chance since that's where the music scene is vs SF? I like how you said it's filled with people my age and there's more opportunities for housing and my music goals. It seems like it will be beautiful there too. Everywhere I made posts about up north keep getting shot down; not enough of a scene, too much crime, too expensive, etc. At least in LA I can maybe have some wiggle room as far as finding a housing program but also get a part time job then maybe rent my own place later down the road but at least have a roof over my head through some kind of mental health resource.

"Apparently there are options for my mental health/housing in SF such as a co-opt or SRO type thing that has staff there and is mental health related. I am not very well educated on it. They keep telling me to go to the 90 day program first (currently at a 2 week program) and then worry about that at the 90 day program. I am trying to do my research. If housing and a place for my car is possible in SF then I wonder if I should go with it or what. At least it's near Oakland or some small venues in SF where I might fit in. It sounds like you are really encouraging me about L.A. and I wonder if there are similar services there that can be amenable. Is SF and Oakland bad just because of the price? Surely people still live here though? Would I still be able to meet people my age here and have an audience/open mics where I can fit in/be accepted to perform? Some people recommended Humboldt. Any thoughts? The assistant director in my current program seems to be strict with me about ""accepting the services being offered"" as though I can get housing in SF after the 90 day program (actually I have heard about people going to subsidized SROs after the 90 day program) but I don't know if it's unwise for other reasons to be in SF or Oakland for my music. Tough crowds? No chance of being able to perform anywhere? I need to be able to park my car reliably though. Maybe the 90 day program can help me with services in L.A.? Is the music scene in the bay area not a good idea for me above all? Sorry if this reply seems kind of scrambled. I am worried about what will happen to me after the 90 days. Some people suggested Humboldt as a place to do my music. I am trying to find out more. Someone said there used to be a small music scene but now it isn't really happening. I have a car.

"I'm not sure any one person can give you a sufficient answer to that first question, as it' probably a very subjective answer that you'd get. I'm not personally a fan of that more abstract style, so I would answer ""no""; I sent your YT link to a buddy in the neighborhood and they said they'd probably see it live. So I think it's more or less an equal risk regardless of where you end up. 

So why do I mention Arcata/Humboldt? It is a college town (curious people willing to check out something different than their normal hobby/activity) which is accepting of artists or musicians doing their craft, more fair prices on housing than anywhere in or near the bay (imo); and I will add, very soothing to the soul and possibly a healthy place to ""get established"" given your current housing/situation. 

LA is likely going to be uncomfortable hot after living in SF, but will also be on the cheaper side and, given the large population, a higher probability of finding likeminded folks or enthusiasts to your work. 

I advise you take a look at a map to see where all these reddit-sourced suggestions are in relation to where you are now, as that will likely help you decide whats best. But yes, Humboldt (County) is about 6-8 hours north of San Francisco, and thus fairly far from a densely populated city like you're used to in the bay. 

Have you considered exploring options outside of CA? There's many more affordable places which will have an accepting/existing art or music scene outside of California than inside it.

Yeah, but it's hard to tell when the dip will occur and how far it will dip. For example, in Santa Clara County, when those prices dipped they didn't go to the bottom of when the prices started increasing sharply in 2017: https://www.zillow.com/santa-clara-county-ca/home-values/

So in that case, buying early in 2017 would have been better than waiting until the trough in 2019. And even if somebody bought at peak, the prices are almost back at peak value just a couple years later despite the dip.

"No doubt my comment is an expression of fond nostalgia for the good old days when I lived in SC, but there's only so many bars in Santa Cruz and a limited amount of bar tending jobs.

Santa Cruz is one of the most expensive places to own a bar in the country so they have to turn a good profit to survive.  The buildings cost millions to buy and if they rent, it ain't cheap, that for sure.

That means any bar that's staying alive is getting a good amount of customers which generates a lot of tips.

Especially now, after the pandemic.

"So my fiancee dropped me off at the River Street shopping center and I skateboarded the levee.  Went to Pacific Wave to see about gearing up with protective equipment.  Couldn't find a helmet, kinda a minimal critical component to attempt a skateboarding at a skatepark at my age and fiscal responsibility, IMHO.

So I went back onto the levee, made sure to hit every underpass, made it up to the Boardwalk before deciding to head back the side I came from.

Crossed over the bridge by all the hotels that lead up to the Boardwalk and went back on the other side, just before approaching the skatepark there.

Rode the east side of the levee north bound still taking every underpass possible, made it to the underpass that is by the bridge that goes by CVS and on the smoothest and fastest underpass I got the speed wobbles and ate it.  Fortunately I got away with minimal road rash on my left upper forearm, and ripped a hole in my Dickie jeans thankfully not exposing anything, and shredded up a little of the hoodies sleeve that I was wearing around my waist.

Even had a singular audience to enjoy my spill, we laughed it up as we passed and he said he wouldn't have done that underpass without a long board.

All and all an awesome time, looking forward to trying out the thread ideas once I get more physical conditioning in, and maybe more protective gear.

"Mail at my house in Santa Cruz has always been terrible (same house 11 years)  because I'm in a zone that doesn't have a regular mail carrier. Our neighbors across the street get mail everyday, but we often go 3 or 4 days with no mail and the deliveries are often late- 7 or 8 at night. We asked a mail carrier about it at one point and he said they assign our area based on who is available, and often there isn't anyone or they can't get to it until late. I've also experienced the post office marking items delivered the day before they arrive. This has happened at least 3 times and it becomes impossible to track your item. I don't know if mail everywhere in Santa Cruz is this bad, but my family all knows to allow extra time for packages. I never leave mail in the box for pickup because we never know when someone will come by. It's really a pain and this year has gotten even worse.

"Wait so your argument is that the virus mandates are ment to refocus the blame of the virus from the government to the people? You do realize that the virus isn't controlled by the government right? Blame is on the people because the people are the ones who do the spreading. It's not a nebulous entity controlled by policy choices like the economy, it is a microscopic protein robot that makes copies of itself using cells. The government doesn't have anything to do with how or where it spreads. The thing that keeps infection rates down is how hard it is for those copies to access other people's cells. The way we do that is by increasing the distance between those people(social distancing) and putting physical barriers in place between them(masks). The reason that schools and churches and the like are closed down right now is that those are social hubs, where lots of people from different social groups gather into one place for extended periods of time. If a single person with the virus transmits it to their family at home, that is a small group of people who likely spends a great deal of time in the same area. If that one person transmits it to the same number of random people at church, that means that there are copies of the virus being made in several different places at once. Do this enough times and that's how you get a pandemic. 

Now you seem to think that politicians can't remove the mask mandates in order to save face on a bad decision, because the virus is evidently still present in the population, and if the mask mandates were a good decision it wouldn't be there anymore. I would ask what you would suggest in order to prevent the virus, which I will remind you, is a microscopic protein robot that only exist to make copies of itself using our cell's biological machinery; what would you suggest we do to prevent them from accessing new cells to propagate? Because untill we develop something more targeted like a vaccine or a cure, this is literally the only means of prevention we have. And it only works at all if a majority of the population (95% or more) comply with them. That our death rate is so low is a testament to how well our community has done in that regard, but the reason we can't go on with our lives as normal is that we get new viruses from people from less compliant communities.

"Every government in the country, both local and national has failed to contain the virus. Most of them all have tried varying degrees of lockdowns and mask mandates.

So they'll push them even harder vs. admit they were wrong.

"It's not about vacations and the movies. It's about kids going to school, people being able to worship in church with their community, people living life and earning a living. 

We need to put this disease in perspective. In our county 26 people have died with the disease. The vast majority were older folks in an acute care facility. The elderly, really the sick and elderly, are especially vulnerable and we should take better precautions to protect them but the overwhelming vast majority of people who are infected are fine. 

But think about the damage the lockdowns are causing. Many kids aren't fortunate enough to have good environments for distance learning.

"Walking the boardwalk/wharf is kinda fun and pretty.  All the rides are closed, but some of the food vendors and a lot of the arcade games have been moved outside.  Natural bridges is a beautiful beach with a cool little hiking path around the park.  I just read that most state parks in the forests have closed due to fire danger, so not sure how much luck you'll have doing any of that if they're further outside of town...  If you want to get out on the water, chardonnay sailing is still offering charters at a reduced capacity and you get to eat pizza/drink beer while sailing on a 75' sail boat, think it's about $50 a person.  Crow's nest has a great happy hour and an amazing view of the beach (just ask to sit in the upper patio if possible).  You can rent a kayak and go on a self-guided tour of elkhorn slough and that's really fun too.

"I have grown up in Santa Cruz County my whole life, I 20M recently moved I live on the other side of the central coast right now *Monterey County we’re currently on lockdown.. because we are hitting above the county requirement infections a day 10/100,000 whereas Santa Cruz county is open the safer areas inside SC county such as Capitola, Aptos have been doing the best Santa Cruz *city* has been doing ok and Watsonville unfortunately has been hit the hardest out of all in the county so be extra clean and conscientious in those areas. try to get out in the water and go surfing. It's a lot of fun and a great way to get to have some fun while you're down here, maybe even meet some cool people.

"At the risk of reviving a Zombie Thread, I would recommend against jumping off Seal Rock for two reasons:

- The rock is generally inhabited by sea lions who can be dangerous.  Those are all males and they will defend themselves if they feel threatened (remember, when you land in the water, you're in their world)
- Rangers will cite you for violation of the Marine Mammal Protection act which can be a fairly hefty fine.

Jumping from the mainland side off Lighthouse Point can be iffy if you don't know where to jump from.

"I got a story for you dear internet stranger. Tl;dr at the bottom of this story.

So to give you a time and place reference what I'm about to share happened around the first time they kicked everyone out  from the Ross camp on a weekday. I used to park my car in the free 3 hour hour parking lot on the 4 intersection of Laurel and front Street (I was really broke at the time and worked in downtown. I would take brakes every 3 hours and move my car toa different free parking lot to not pay the $8 all day parking.) So it was around 8:30 in the morning when I parked my car  and that's when I saw it. 
I saw a homeless woman get on all fours, pull down her pants and underwear to her ankles, and then she proceeded to take most akward shit I've seen anyone take in my entire life. I just sat in my car stunned at the most bizarre shit birthing I had just been a witness of. I only came out of my frozen state when she just pulled up her pants and underwear and began to roll back to just get up and start to walk up the dirt path that gets you up to the levee. 

I could've shared the multiple times I've seen a homeless man try to fight off a cop through my works window's, or the times I've seen people shoot up in the parking lots, but I feel like it doesn't hold as much weight as to that experience.

"I'm totally with you on your second point tho I would clarify down from ""people"" to be more specific to Santa Cruz: there's an entrenched group of homeowners that are reluctant to build more housing or renovate old housing. The reasons why are not clear to me, i've heard the usual NIMBY stuff and concerns about the city being full of the wrong kind of people ""they don't Appreciate the town like I Can, my appreciation for Santa Cruz is Unique and Important""

Your first point is a little misguided in my opinion. I agree that in a macro view the price is decided by the pool of renters,,,but in a micro view of our particular situation we have the businesses and people that can build new housing focused on Silicon Valley commuters who have enough money to not care what the price of rent is. Santa Cruz housing is controlled by property managers and their companies, not the collection of homeowners and interested renters. Given that situation, I think the thing that will be most beneficial is rent control and intentionally building low-income rent-controlled units.

"On the second Sunday of November (that’s November 11th), the Santa  Cruz Mountains Art Center will be having a sale of pottery seconds.

What’s a second? It’s pretty subjective. You see, potters are pretty  picky people. So the color may not be what they wanted, or be different  from the others they made. Maybe the glaze dripped a bit. The pot is  smaller than they hoped. Or the lid is a little loose. It could be any  of a dozen tiny “flaws” that afflict handmade items.

Despite whatever it is the potter didn’t like, we’re pretty sure  you’ll think they’re beautiful. And we’re certain you’ll like the  prices! So come on down and take your pick. And thank those picky  potters!

**When:** Sunday, November 11, 11:00 am—5:00 pm

**Where:** Santa Cruz Mountains Art Center, 9341 Mill Street, Ben Lomond, CA 95005

"It's a false impression. Everyone I know here works hard for what they have. No one inherited anything. Most of my mature adult friends have housemates so they don't drown in housing costs. I just got priced out of my last apartment and had to move. My family decided to not give Christmas presents last year, so we used the money we saved to go to Mexico because we exchanged houses with another family and got to stay for free. So yeah, there's the international vacation!

With tweakers and thieves and crime comes NIMBYism. Couple this with high housing costs and our proximity to Silicon Valley and you should know that Santa Cruz will never be less NIMBY. Only more. You can complain about it on Reddit all you want, but SC is becoming more gentrified every day. Santa Cruz will become like Laguna Beach and then some other underrated town will become the new Santa Cruz. Welcome to coastal California!

White supremacy and social injustice? How are you thinking Santa Cruz differs here than anywhere else in California? Where specifically are you seeing white supremacy and social injustice here in a city where a 2BR apartment is $2500? Are people not getting out of homelessness in a city where a 2BR apartment is $2500? 

Maybe this town isn't the best choice if one wants to get out of homelessness and poverty? Maybe it's a good choice if one wants to just remain homeless and poor? And then bitch daily about how normal people are rich? That's gotta be forward thinking and healthy!

Bumper stickers are a hippy thing. Santa Cruz has hippies. Therefore Santa Cruz has bumper stickers just like Portland, just like Seattle, just like Berkeley, just like everywhere else in the US that has hippies. You're catching flak for it because you're trying to make it a Santa Cruz thing when everyone knows it's a thing everywhere. So you look like a clueless jerk when you denigrate it and then try to make it about us. Plus it's a form of self expression, and we're okay with that here.

tl;dr - You're not well received because you just talk unsubstantiated bullshit about people who like their city and you just sound like a clown from out of town who is jealous that hoodie wearing, neck tattooed people can make their own livings. If you want to be well received, find the positive in things rather than the negative. Why shit on people when you can elevate them instead?
