My moms friend is one of the instructors; she‚Äôs mentioned that most of her fellow instructors are super lovely people who are excellent at delivering the content.

"I had a chat with a diversified bus driver a few months ago. He was driving a split shift but after like 9-12 months he got enough seniority to work one shift. Job seems pretty chill as everyone who takes the bus have a purpose so you don't have to deal with shitty people

But also be realistic, learn to cook as food places are expensive. You are going to work long hours and probably on a 14 day stretch at once, but you do get a big break once every few weeks. It can get lonely sometimes so get involved in the community. Winters can feel long but I'm sure you know that ;)

Lots of upsides too. Job is pretty stable as long as you work a bit, the allowance you get every month is tax-free (i think) and can make it worthwhile to come here, lots of winter activities and summer activities available if you are interested, and lots of people here rent out rooms/basement suites so you can get settled down pretty quickly.",t2_be57v,alzhang8,0,1643559324.0,0,t1_huv7tgz,huv7tgz,True,TaraNova13,t3_scoqjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortmac/comments/scoqjj/bus_driving_in_fort_mac/,Bus driving in Fort Mac?,/r/fortmac/comments/scoqjj/bus_driving_in_fort_mac/huv7tgz/,2,r/fortmac,0,2

"I think you'll be alright with Diversified. I just moved here 3 months ago, but I came from an even smaller town from the NorthWest Territories, so I'm familiar with even harsher winters and remoteness.

You'll either hate it or love it here, no in between. I got a feeling the summers are going to make this place worth while. Get ready for the mosquitos in the summer though, they're supposed to be baaaad.

I will say, the sense of community up here seems to be strong. There's something about the North and living somewhere remote that makes people treat each other better... except for the bus drivers üòÖ

Anything that you can't find here is just a 4.5 hour drive away in Edmonton, and coming from somebody who grew up in a place with 19.5k people, this place has a lot more happening than what I'm used to.

The food scene doesn't have a great reputation here. Lots of chain restaurants and it doesn't seem to have lots of mom and pop places.

One good reason to stay away is Fort McMurray's drivers. Ontario motorists are clueless, distracted and rude, but I'm convinced Fort McMurray drivers are actively trying to kill me.

"Yeah camp job, 2 weeks in 2 weeks out. To be honest I am just happy to be leaving Yellowknife. It's like Fort Mac, but only 20k people and the closest place that is bigger than Yellowknife is Grand Prarie, and that's a good 12 hour drive if not more..

So having Edmonton ""close by"" will be life changing. Haven't decided if it's better to live in Fort Mac since the Edmonton novelty might wear off after a while and it saves having to drive for 4.5 hours twice in 1 week.

Edmonton is always there if you get bored enough, but it might be nice to just be home as soon as your 2 weeks is done. 

I've looked into real estate in Fort Mac, I heard it was worse than Yellowknife. It isn't worse. I'm not saying it's great for what the city offers, but where I'm from it's a lot worse, tack on an extra 100k for everything you see in Fort Mac, maybe more.

I'll have to make it there first and then make a decision, I'm just a but intimidated moving to a new place with no family. Thank you for the positivity, it really does help.

"You would get some good information on this by posting in the Fort McMurray Girl Gang page. Lots of the nursing students are female and would be in that group. 

Housing right now would happen in either Penhorwood or Clearwater Residence. Penhorwood is more family style and is more expensive and Clearwater is your traditional dorm style. If I remember correctly it's 4 or 6 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms and a shared kitchen space. The hall was renovated recently.

"I did a Certificate of Office Administration (2012) and later my Bachelor of Education (2019) at Keyano. I've been well positioned and well prepared for the job market in Fort McMurray because of it - and actually do not work as a teacher but still in public sector work. Their Business Administration program has some great instructors in it, and they do offer several options that ladder (Certificate, Diploma, Degree) so you have exit points if you decide a full 4 year program isn't for you.   


The campus itself isn't much for social life (in my opinion) because many people who attend Keyano live in Fort McMurray before attending and don't stay in residence/have their own friend circles outside of school. That being said, I met the majority of the social circle I spend time with (pre-pandemic) through my time at Keyano.   


They also have decent options for student employment at a fair income with flexible hours for school, the Academic Success Centre offers free tutoring, and they do have great scholarship opportunities. What you will probably find versus a larger campus is that you have less options for class times but the smaller class sizes are absolutely a benefit.

"the State of Local Emergency basically means that the municipality can leverage additional resources at the Provincial and Federal level for issues that are beyond their capacity to deal with alone. We had one during the wildfire, as well as one during the floods; this allowed the RMWB to get assistance dealing with the issues. 

For Covid, they are looking for the following:
>putting forward a request to Provincial/Federal governments for an accelerated vaccine distribution (our average age in Fort McMurray is 33 years old, making the current age restrictions difficult)

>arrange an urgent meeting with the Premier, Provincial ministers of Health, Education, AHS, Federal ministers of Health, Public Safety and Indigenous Services, the Prime Minister as well as Industry Partners and anyone else identified by mayor and council and/or Indigenous governments to identify possible actions to be taken to reduce our numbers and increase resources

So far as AirPort road in Fort McMurray goes, back in the day it was the place to test out your ride. Several generations of McMurrayites learned how to drive on the road.

Some learned wholesomely. Some not. Even 20 years ago it was frowned upon. But a few years prior...not the case. But there was relatively no one on that road back then. You could see for a long distance and there was less obstructions. 

You could easily slowdown before interacting with traffic. 

Less gravel trucks as well. The kind that kill you dead.

So either way.

"I did the course about a decade ago. The program itself has basically zero value, and is definitely not worth the money. What you are paying for is a *chance* of a co-op (if they are even doing them anymore).
     
About half my class got co-ops, and I think everyone was offered a job from those who got one *but* many classes after me did not get a job from their co-ops.
     
This is my opinion for sure, but the job is miserable. Long hours, beats your body up, shift work, bad culture, etc.
      
I left years ago. The literal only thing I miss is the pay.

As you eluded to in your post, do you really want to be entering the industry right now? I would be very skeptical of Keyano's own claims about employment.
     
Lastly, someone indicated that other mines use this equipment. That's partly true. Other mines use similar equipment around the world, but very few use this size of equipment.

"You know when you are flying in an airplane, at full cruising altitude, way above a big city, and you look down; look long enough and you will see glints and bright flashes like that as you fly overhead. That is sunlight reflecting perfectly in to your eyes off of car windshields and windows.

Well, the same thing happened here. The satellite found the ONE windshield that perfectly reflected the sunlight directly at it's camera lens at that particular moment in that particular spot.

"Best thing to do is find companies that operate in the patch, then which area you'd like to work in.
You have drilling, that's the start of it all so companies like 
-precision drilling
-Tervita 

Just to name two... Are a good place to look.
Then you have Wireline they send technology down to do readings on the drilled well.
-Weatherford

Is a company I know of but put in a Google search and you'll find more

Then there's Fracing.. they pump nitrogen and sand down the well to open up the porous rock that hold the oil
-Schlumberger
-Trican

Are some that I know might still be around that does that.

Then there's Well Testing .. they flow the well to clean out what the fracers put in the well and retrieve the product (oil) for the company and send data on what kind of well the company has. 

They you've got service rigs and coil tubing.

All of these services have labour starting points

"I could not agree with you more and I've been telling friends and explaining to them how more millionaires and billionaires will be created from this virus, oil price war and pandemic then any other event in the history of man kind.  My head is up and thank you for the pep talk I hope others read what you wrote.  This thread was started by someone asking how Fort Mcmurray was doing he said he heard we were becoming a ghost town.  I answered his questions with my opinion based on the facts that are giving.  It'd going to take time and a lot of time unfortunately to recover from this.  It's going to take the planet and each and ever person here time to recover  but it will come.  I'm using this as a reset button and I hope a lot others do the same because when this is over and we start putting our lives back together a new plan will be needed.
Oil was in an uptrend until the beginning of the year recovering nicely from the pull back of 2016. It's down 60% the same as another sector in the markets.  
Fort Mcmurray will survive this as ever place in the world and some will be effected more than others and some not at all.  My opinion is it's going to take longer for Fort Mcmurray and it will have to work a little harder but will get there in the end.  More things will go wrong that they need to learn from and establish a new game plan.  In the last 24 hours Suncor released it's first case of the virus getting in and that was so preventable.  A fly in fly out work tested positive in their camp.  This should not have happened with all the information and warnings giving.  Shame shame shame on Suncor for not sending those workers home earlier and putting a temporary stop to camp and FIFO.  This was a HIGH Risk that they took the gamble with that was so preventable.

"I know during the evacuation it was a big concern on how they were going to shut down the plants because they never had to do it before.  Then after it was the same concern on how will they get them back up and running.  Everything went well and there were no issues. 
My thoughts on not being in a hurry to restart if this is to happen again is based on living here and seeing first hand a slow bleed in the past 4 and a half years. 
This industry right now in Fort McMurray has a load of issues that are completely out of the hands of the CEOs to fix.  In life and in business you get knocked down you get back up.  Big oil in Fort McMurray have taken a lot of serious knocks. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be that‚Äôs it where finished our investors want us to start working in another and they walk away. I think it‚Äôll be idled down with maybe only 40% needed to return to work. 
They already got over 10 years of overburdened moved with the oil sand exposed. There‚Äôs minimal expansions being worked on and anything new has been canceled. I could see it being an executive decision to put there capital, resources and people to work elsewhere. There‚Äôs no expiration date on oil sands they can come back in 3 - 5 who knows how many years and start producing again.

"We'll be closer to ""ghost town ""vs"" boom town"" when this is over.  Time to face facts our oil is crap, low grade that needs a lot of upgrading the entire planet knows this and want the Oil Sands to stop producing.  Face it we don't have the world on our side here that has been made very clear in the last year.  The virus is creating more and more lay offs all over and l expect a lot of people that came back after the fire won't come back again.  They'll see it as a final red flag and move back to their homes or to a city with better outlooks.  The discounted oil price due to our Saudi and Russian friends that's just getting started.  I had 3 of my buddies get laid off this week and pack their bags and left.  If the virus does get into one of the camps or plants and the company has to do a complete shutdown with oil price the way it is don't expect them to be in a hurry to get it restarted.  The longer it takes to isolate and remove threat from this virus the more people will leave and not come back.  The smart ones never came back after the fire and I wish I had been smart enough to call it quits then and leave.  All my savings is invested here in the city in property so I'm the last person that wants to see it go bust but anyone who thinks it'll get better needs to step back and take your emotions out of the equation and look at the big picture.  I love this city and it has been very good to me and all my friends but that was then and this is now.  Ghost town yes it's close if the plants close down we got 5 years of reclamation for a limited few contractors then what?  We can go back to fur trapping which is where it all began or become the gateway to the North and bring back the ships and rail.  We got infrastructure and a new city started to offer new industry and sectors to locate here but most who are looking don't want to isolate to the North East corner on Alberta.  I'm not here to argue -- I've done that for the last 3 years I was Fort Mcmurray being the very best but our best is not what they're looking for.  It sucks for all the people that came here in the 90's and worked there butts of to raise families that expected to be retired by now.  They are truly stuck with their properties and all the upkeep put into it being undervalued where if they sold after paying of the mortgage some will still owe the banks.  I purchased property to live in July 2016 after the fire that property is down 48% this morning.  Think about that for a bit1  Think about 48% of your savings disappearing in less the 4 years.  I'll stay strong and I'll be hopeful that some miracle will come along and save our city but don't ignore the facts that are there presented to us over blind rage that the Leftist Liberals are out to get us but we will fight and become our own country and make oil oil oil and sell sell sell and we'l be back to boomtown in no time because that won't be easy and the future world doesn't want our oil.  Before I went to bed last night someone said oil was down to 8 dollars a barrel.  If this city is to be saved we need a solid plan put in place for recovery without the oil industry.  With this virus being on the provincial, federal and world's top agendas (Where it SHOULD BE) our problems are nothing.  If another wildfire came and destroyed this town again would you rebuild or take a lesser value pay out and walk away?

"I moved away from Fort McMurray 5 years ago, but Ryan Stubbs, now of K9 Clubhouse, was a fantastic trainer for my dog when he and I were there.

Franky was seriously reactive to both people and dogs when I first got him 2 years before moving for Fort Mac, and was ramped up after a cross country drive when I finally got to town. After some work with Ryan and his team, combined with regular homework, Franky and i both were better for it.

Amanda Nadon of Furever Friends pet sitting was also great, and I would highly recommend her. Again, Franky was not your average dog, and she was fantastic about spending quality time with him whenever I had to travel out of town (about 1-2 weekends a month when I was there) and would send regular daily updates.

Franky passed away this past fall, but I think of him every day and how lucky we were to have the people helping he and I. His Fort McMurray support team were a big part of his life and both Ryan and Mandy are people I'd highly recommend if they're still in town.",t2_8fu6a,cpstone1,0,1580690402.0,0,t1_fge3c1m,fge3c1m,True,[deleted],t3_exxvr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortmac/comments/exxvr9/new_dog_owner_dog_stuff_in_ymm/,New Dog Owner - Dog Stuff in YMM?,/r/fortmac/comments/exxvr9/new_dog_owner_dog_stuff_in_ymm/fge3c1m/,2,r/fortmac,0,2

So no one in town offers lessons (unless you already have your own horse to ride.) You might get lucky and find a free lease situation?

"Mine is technically a plug-in hybrid, which I think is the sensible approach to electric driving for most of Canada, at least until battery tech matures a little.

The battery easily handles all my daily use within city limits, saving me $100 to $150 monthly in gas at a probable cost of $12 to $15 in electricity.

The car accepts a charge at all temperatures. If you remote start when it's plugged in, the HVAC also draws current from the outlet to heat the cabin, which preserves battery power for driving. Electric cabin heating is very effective, and begins throwing warm air almost immediately on starting. However electric cabin heat also severely impacts battery range.

The gas engine comes into play only in a few scenarios:

1. You floor it
2. You engage ""EV-Later"" mode, which instructs the car to save the battery and burn gas instead.
3. It's fairly cold (say -25 or colder), the car has been sitting outside and the battery is thoroughly frozen.
4. You really crank up the cabin heat. This draws a surprising amount of power, so the car sometimes fires up the engine as a supplementary heat source.
5.

"I live in Fort Mac, own an electric car, and make a living off the oil industry. So here are some things to keep in perspective:

1. If every light vehicle on the road today moves to electric power, that only accounts for around 39% of global petroleum consumption. Cars are the easiest sector to clean up, but converting other petroleum-intensive industries (shipping, agriculture, manufacturing, etc) is considerably harder.

2. The global power grid can't support mass automotive electrification. If consumers switch to electric cars en mass, then power rates shoot up, new electrical plants get built quickly (which most likely means at least some fossil fuel generation, since nuclear plants take over a decade). And let's not forget that solar, wind and other ""green"" power sources still require some petroleum in their construction and maintenance.

3. World affairs right now are destabilizing. The single largest consumer of petroleum on the planet is the US Department of Defense. War demands a productive, stable, defensible supply of oil. If global politics continue to deteriorate, the oil sands will be a key resource.

4. When oil companies moan about low prices, they're only saying it's not **as profitable** as it was on 2014, and their investors are willing to leave some bitumen in the ground until we get back to $100 per barrel. The Big Five are still reporting quarterly profits in the billions, and there's no reason to expect that will change.

5. Regardless of which parties form government next Monday, more than $40 billion in new capital spending is already committed to projects in the oil sands.
 * CNRL is completing Phase 1 of its $1.4-billion Kirby North SAGD facility.
 * Imperial is proceeding with its $3-billion Aspen SAGD project, as well as the $560-million Kearl Expansion.
 * Titanium Corporation has proposed a $400-million Titanium and Zircon Extraction Facility at CNR Horizon, which would be this region's first significant foray into non-petroleum resources.
 * Suncor will build two cogeneration units at Base Plant to provide up to 800 Mw of power at an estimated cost of $1.4 billion.
 * Cenovus is proposing the Narrows Lake In Situ Oil Sands Project, worth $1.6 billion, but pending a recovery in oil prices.
 * Suncor has proposed the Voyageur South expansion, worth $4.4 billion, and already has regulatory approval on its $1.5-billion Meadow Creek East project.
 * MEG Energy is proposing the May River Project, amounting to a $10-billion investment over three phases.
 * Prosper Petroleum is working on their Rigel Oil Sands Project, worth more than $400 million.
 * Nexen is working in its $400-million Long Lake Expansion.
 * Cenovus and MEG Energy are each developing sites at Christina Lake, worth a combined $3 billion.
 * The Tek Frontier mine alone is expected to be 30% larger than Fort Hills and worth around $20 billion - double the economic activity of the entire wildfire rebuilding effort.

"You'll be fine.   


We now have random drug testing at Suncor so if you're in a safety sensitive position (Engineering would still be as they make decisions that affect the upgrader) so you would probably be included in that.   


It's a urine test and if you fail the urine test for anything (usually THC from what I hear) then you do the swab test. The swab tests anything in the past 48 hours. So if you smoked marijuana the swab will show your current limits that COULD be detected from the past 48 hours. It's the same system thats used by the RCMP. So long story short, if you're worried about losing this opportunity because you smoked at a party, relax.   


I'm pretty sure you will have to do a pre employment test but if you don't they will tell you. After that, it's all in a random selection. Maybe you will, maybe you won't However at least you can have some piece of mind knowing how the testing is done.

It‚Äôs unfortunate that cuts need to be made but the reality is profits (which have to be put back into the business in a part 9 co) probably gradually shrunk (not sure if they were ever profitable) and then turned into losses (I believe over $1mm annually.)   

As a taxpayer, I don‚Äôt see how continuing to run a deficit is a benefit to the RMWB and hearing CUPE lump all of us contractors as ‚Äúfly-by-night‚Äù is just insulting, especially when WBH supports many local small businesses for their trade and property services.  

These cuts were made by the private sector a long time ago because they don‚Äôt have the luxury of losing $1mm a year without having to answer for it.

So the RMWB doesn't directly exercise control over WBH, but it is a wholly-owned entity representative of our municipal government. As such, a poor decision affecting the community at large is a problem for everyone, especially the RMWB.

To your second point, CUPE's wording may be deceptive, but you're being equally misleading to claim local contractors will be hired. No one can claim this because *no one knows*. Contracts are generally awarded by tender, and the winning bidder could be from the far side of the moon so long as they meet the requirements.

"For a small chapter of 40-ish employees CUPE's PR budget has been formidable, probably even excessive. I don't see how the union ever intends to recoup their investment in advertising.

The RMWB's utter silence also isn't an effective countermeasure. To my knowledge we've seen no press releases, no public statements, and no debate or discussion.

So without the benefit of the RMWB's side of the story, here's how I tend to look at this issue:

Municipal leaders are answerable for the financial wellbeing of their government. That means looking for cost savings wherever they can find them. No one wants to see the city government overpaying for labour; someone in management found a cheaper way to get a job done and made a tough decision. 

But the RMWB failed to consider the economic return on investment. The union is absolutely correct in pointing out the benefits of hiring local; those locked-out employees live in Fort McMurray, paying taxes and contributing to the health of our community. 

And secondly, the RMWB failed to consider the optics of this choice. It's the absolute height of hypocrisy to hire fly-in contractors after loudly condemning CNRL, Suncor and others for the exact same behavior. It defeats and nullifies decades of ""hire-local"" messaging drummed into the private sector. And CUPE's highly-organized ad campaign has only heightened the embarrassment.

After careful consideration I signed CUPE's petition a couple of days ago. I feel the RMWB made a shortsighted decision that exhibits poor leadership, and it's time to walk things back a little.",t2_hvc0g,NuclearToad,0,1564707141.0,0,t1_evrfdss,evrfdss,True,zkb80,t3_ckujo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortmac/comments/ckujo8/wood_buffalo_housing/,Wood Buffalo Housing,/r/fortmac/comments/ckujo8/wood_buffalo_housing/evrfdss/,4,r/fortmac,0,4

"Not a landlord, but I can tell you what everyone else in town sees.

When I arrived in Fort Mac almost six years ago:

* My 7-km commute took up 30 to 90 minutes on a typical morning.
* I had to fight for parking for my tiny car on residential streets each night.
* If you went downtown for dinner with a friend at 8 PM on a Tuesday you'd have to wait 20-40 minutes for a table.
* 7 AM lineups at Timmys snaked through the lobby and out the front door. The Mounties regularly had to shoo away motorists who'd clog the street waiting to enter the drive-thru.
* Finding a 10' x 10' basement bedroom rental for $1200 monthly was a matter of social connections and quick timing.

I was in town more than two years before I saw my first ""for rent"" sign on an apartment block. I remember it rattled me a little, and it was really the first solid indication of a downturn. Now I think you'd be hard-pressed to find an apartment building in town without a sign advertising vacancies. 

Many places are offering incentives like freshly renovated units and new appliances. They're also discounting or waiving deposits to attract tenants. $1200/month will now possibly get you a 1-2 bedroom condo with underground parking and all utilities.

Having said all that, I'm pretty convinced we are seeing the beginnings of a rebound.
