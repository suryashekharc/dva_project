"I have lived in every kind of state, and I am here to tell you that St. Augustine is being ruined by outsiders, mainly local developers who have paid off the politicians that need to be tarred and feathered in the style of my ancient New England relative as they would have done to scoundrels, done for the benefit of Damn Yankees and asshole tourists who come here disrespecting the locals, disrespecting the environment, and trying to invade and take us over and turn us into a place like what they left despite their lies to the contrary.

St. Augustine is nearly lost to us now, over-run, over-developed, the old south and small town charm being turned into cookie cutter plazas and hotels and strip malls and shoddy mass housing projects built on top of drained swamp and formerly protected wetland that only exacerbates flooding every time we have a good nor'easter or occasionally close hurricane.

Since the turn of the 1980s when drug lords laundered their money in Florida after the vicious Miami gang wars and turned it into beachfront ""homes"" and condos up and down the coast, the \*&(\^%$#@! developer lobbies have gained far too much drug money laundering power and have it in their ambitions to clear-cut the entire state and turn it into one giant McSlab of concrete and blacktop and the locals be damned.

"Is this what you were talking about? Had to look through the responses, must have missed this one when you posted it. Therefore I apologize for my response to your second reply, I had missed this one. u/The_Spindrifter illustrated the numbers and economics between a need for unions and strikes fairly well in his responses to you. 

Now, if you actually want to discuss in good faith and actually look at  information from the opposite side, I'd be happy to show you the documented research I have conducted on the poverty wages the majority of Saint Augustine businesses are paying their employees, and how they aren't worth it, especially with the rise in gas prices and inflation of general goods. I can even list specific businesses that have been paying less than minimum wage to their employees who had to be informed that the minimum was no longer $9.25 by outside sources. In turn, I would be happy to see any facts and information you have that supports your perspective. 

The business owners and managers have shown no indicators of being willing to change on their own, especially the smaller businesses. Due to this, they are likely to lose everything, as bigger businesses will ultimately end up treating their employees better in order to actually have employees in a declining labor market. If they don't change, they will lose, and with them Saint Augustine will lose the private enterprise and charming local businesses that give it its unique atmosphere in favor of corporate abominations like Cinnabon of all places.

"No, it's just that if you are all of these things and ""have so much"", what the hell are you doing here? Seems like everything you own isn't making you happy at all, and worse you still turn a blind eye to the fact that you were exploited as child labor and your daughter is by your own admission being exploited as child labor. Meanwhile you are insulting people online who only want a reasonable wage compared to the wealth that they help generate for others. Who could have a problem with that? Hmmm....

You have all this wealth and businesses and say that you built it allll on your own but instead of either being out & about enjoying it, or enjoying it with your family, or actually you know, *working,* you are here bitching because a lot of the rest of us who worked equally long and hard and with more skills than you have, have nothing to show for it now of no fault of our own, and it also makes us highly suspicious of those who seem to have an awful lot and have very little work to show for it and are bragging about it here and yet turn a blind eye to how we have been slighted... makes one wonder why you blame us instead of wanting us to have it all jut like you, and we did work to earn it just like you allegedly did. We worked harder AND smarter and for our efforts saw real word wages fall while our productivity rose (cited by me earlier), watched corporations raise the prices of goods and services to achieve record profits wile cutting back on employees and cutting the benefits and pay of the remaining employees (also cited), and instead of being happy for us fighting back to take back what we should be rightfully getting--a fraction of what you claim to have--you're here dissing us for trying to correct an unjust inequity that keeps us from being equals for our efforts.

You seem highly sus. If you're telling the truth and you're that blind to what is going on around you it makes you look like an uncaring asshole. If you're lying then you're actually just like the rest of us and spouting BS and are to be pitied and ignored. If you're telling the truth and just being a dick about all of the rest of us fighting for what is our rightful slice of the American Pie of which you seem to have so much, it suggests that you might have a reason to be afraid, as if maybe you didn't actually earn it and your wealth was built on the backs of poorly compensated labor from which you reaped their reward and they gained nothing of real value in return, and you are worried about people wanting to level the scales and that means that maybe you might have to give back that which never really should have been yours in the first place. Maybe. Time will tell, but your total obsession with possessions and lack of concern about child welfare and exploitation is pretty telling and a sad tale at that. Go be an asshole somewhere else and let the rest of us take back what was always rightfully ours in the first place. 

Let me guess: if you are legit, you are one of those batshit crazy ""We're a family"" type employers that thinks they can get away with behaving like Thomas Edison in the 21st Century and do whatever you want and get away with paying the people who actually put you where you are the bare minimum because it's a ""privilege"" to ""work for \[you\]"" and they ""should be grateful"". Yeah that's going to come back to haunt you some day.

Me? I ""Went Galt"". The corporations of Florida don't want to pay  fair wage so I exited their system and made my own home businesses and it's good enough for now, but if I ever do go back to the corporate world I will expect that I will be *fairly* compensated for my labor, extensive experience and education that I bring to the table, and anything less than that is not acceptable. Meanwhile I am watching millions of my fellow Americans getting the shaft and why should I be mad at them for fighting back for their fair share? No, I join them in solidarity that employers are being unreasonable with their pathetic wage offerings and that collective bargaining is the only real option left on the table to correct these injustices.",t2_fxfuj,The_Spindrifter,0,1647035103.0,0,t1_i0aloj5,i0aloj5,False,EQandCivfanatic,t3_tb1dpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/tb1dpz/saint_augustine_workers_should_organize_to_join/,Saint Augustine Workers Should Organize to join the MayDay General Strike,/r/StAugustine/comments/tb1dpz/saint_augustine_workers_should_organize_to_join/i0aloj5/,2,r/StAugustine,0,2

"You're joking right? Just as recently as oh say 2020 they LITERALLY KEPT THE LIGHTS ON IN THIS COUNTRY with the bailout of actual PEOPLE with the emergency ""Biden Bailout"" that helped the average middle class and underclass persons pay their bills for almost a year after the Republican-caused Covid emergency tanked the economy and wrecked productivity with their absolute resistance to any attempt to contain a lethal virus that killed no less than 900,000 Americans and millions more worldwide.

The Democrats voted to give taxpayers back some of their hard earned money and expanded unemployment to try and help the millions of Americans that were laid off from their jobs without just cause by corporations that had and still are making *record profits.* It worked. The Republicans, however, voted *against* those life-saving medical and financial measures at every turn while simultaneously voting to give *corporations* trillions of dollars in tax cuts and bailouts!! Those same companies, still raking in the dough at taxpayer expense, have literally done nothing but screw over the American people at every turn both in wages and at the checkout lane.

Yes, actually the Democrats do love the middle class, their typical voter in non-southern states. So why is it that the majority of the Red states are sucking hind tit and have the highest poverty? Is it because red states are less educated and therefore can't make a living worthy by your decree of worth, or is it because the poverty is systemic, endemic, and deliberately imposed by the ""leadership"" of said states? Either way, life under Republican rule leads to poverty. On the above map the only reason Texass is wealthy is because of the oil money, but one only need to visit there to see the huge discrepancy between who do and do not have that wealth. Hint: it's not the middle class, and that's a Republican stronghold. The only reason Virginia has money is because of Washington DC: take away DC and the money would follow it right out. Sterling, Virginia only has money because of the local wealth attracted by power from DC being right next door.

"\*can be.

You cited one well known example while ignoring the context and known history of the following quote: ""Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.""

Have I seen abuses in the Unions? Yes, I absolutely have, and yet I still join them whenever offered. Why? Checks and balances for one, and to *undo the corruption* for another. The only way to change an institution is from the inside. Unions are just as problematic as the vile corporate overlords, but they are a necessary evil in some cases or just plain necessary in most where they have popped up. Why? because the people were forced to take a stand to protect themselves and empower themselves at points in time where others with power sought to increase theirs at the expense of others.

The corruption of Corporatism that is destroying America is the force that continues to make Unions necessary as a ways and means of protecting the workers.

"You don't seem to understand what a minimum wage really is: it's not the line the government draws in the sand, it's the amount, the bare amount, that a human needs to earn to survive *and somewhat thrive* while paying the bills. Honestly at this point I'm not even sure that $21 an hour is enough anymore with the current rate of inflation, but I cannot imagine anyone being able to afford working for less than that with rent at nearly $2,000 for an 800 sq ft apartment, groceries at outrageous levels, FPL and JEA jacking up rates and suppressing solar self-sufficiency, and all of this was before the Putin war gave the oil companies a pathetic excuse to jack up the price of gasoline to near Bush-era levels when they are simultaneously posting record profits.

""While the question of whether FDR meant for the minimum wage to serve as a ""living wage"" at the inception of the federal minimum wage can be reasonably answered, that does not resolve the debate over how the minimum wage should be applied today.

First, the very definition of what constitutes ""decent living"" supported by a ""living wage"" comes into question. Certainly, today's standard of living in the United States differs from that of the early post-depression era with all the modern comforts that a near-century of progress has brought about. What's more, in FDR's 1933 speech cited above, and other speeches given around that time, the context shows that his call for ""living wages"" is specifically put forward as a contrast to what he calls ""starvation wages.""

In full context, he says,

    In my Inaugural, I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By ""business"" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages, I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living. Throughout industry, the change from starvation wages and starvation employment to living wages and sustained employment can, in large part, be made by an industrial covenant to which all employers shall subscribe. [emphasis added]

The context demonstrates that his description of ""living wages"" and ""decent living"" is only that which rises above starvation and ""bare subsistence."" ""

The prices were higher under Bush for a considerable stretch, and your boy Drumpf was a Putin fellator and conspirator and Putin started this little kerfuffle that has allegedly caused the prices to rise, except for the whole part where it is solely the petrol companies jacking up the prices arbitrarily before the market even has time to be impacted.

There have been more job gains under Biden but that gets reported as ""sluggish"" somehow even when Drumpf's numbers were worse but got reported as ""strong"". You say very few laws should exist but the Republican'ts break as many laws as they can on a regular basis making them the Men of Lawlessness, especially the whole part where they tried to overthrow an ordinary democratic election on their own soil that they lost fairly, and then organized a treasonous raid on the Capitol and tried to assassinate the sitting Vice President and a State governor.

The only reason your kind want ""less laws"" is so you can be evil without responsibility or consequences, just like your spiritual father Satan. Biden hasn't done a single authoritarian thing: not one person ever went to jail for being a dickhead and not wearing masks in public during a lethal pandemic that killed 900,000 Americans and millions more worldwide, and the sad truth is that every single person who took part in that scumbaggery should be charged with manslaughter and sent to prison for life. THAT would be authoritarian, and damn you all you deserve it.

"Florida employers don't even want to pay minimum wage and they keep trying to get our congress in Tallahassle to pass a bill that would institute a six month ""training wage"" (haha ha!) that is actually lower than minimum wage, or as we really know them: slave wages. Then of course since Floriduh is an ""at will"" employment state, the companies will just say ""this person isn't working out"" and fire them at the 6-month mark and hire some new desperate slave for six months.

In short, corporations are lying \*and\* *screwing the American people every way that they can*. Some of the most profitable corporations in America are the ones least willing to pay their employees what they are worth and go out of their way to avoid giving real raises, health benefits, or anything even remotely approaching the profit sharing plans of the 1980s. 

American workers young and old are tired of getting their throats cut at home and at work over goddamned corporate greed, and that is why more and more young Americans are practically being pushed towards Socialist and possibly even Communist attitudes. Dear Republicoonts: you only have yourselves to blame when the revolution comes and you wind up being the first ones up against the wall for dispatch.

"Yea eating in the restaurant is totally unnecessary and a serious time suck so definitely do pickup. Just start eating it right away because it gets really soggy real quick in those styrofoam to go boxes. You can picnic at the Castillo etc. I’m genuine excited you are going. Everyone I’ve introduced osteens to has been blown away. 

Cut out reef and aia for food choices. I agree with other users opinions on those spots.

Here’s a hidden gem on st George street everyone misses. [The Shrine of St Photios](https://stphotios.org/)
The signage isn’t great so be on the lookout. It’s free and it’s a super quick stop. The shrine itself has whispering walls under the dome area. So if you whisper into a corner and have someone standing by the opposite corner they will hear it. Interesting gift shop. Cool little museum about Greek settlers of new smyrna.

"Allow me to explain the issue to you:

At the moment minimum wage in Florida is $10.00 per hour. The businesses in Saint Augustine take patriotic pride (with some laudable exceptions) in not paying their employees more than absolute minimum. They also decline to employ these workers for more than 30 hour work weeks, because they'd have to provide insurance if they did. So each of these jobs provides less than $300 per week, $1,200 a month, or $14,400 a year. 

Now you seem like the type that says, ""Well, they should get a second job or a better job."" All right, well, they can do that and work 60 hours a week for $28,800 a year. A better job isn't an option for everyone. Rents are easily $1,100-$1,500 depending on the part of the county for a 1 bedroom/1 bath. At minimum, one retail worker's entire job is enough to pay rent. The other job's income would vanish into increasing groceries, gas, and utilities. 

Even if our hypothetical person saved enough for a down payment (unlikely), currently the cheapest, crappiest houses are still in the $180,000 range. The end result is still going to being more monthly than rent at the rate prices are increasing.

So, my point? Where are the people who make St. Augustine a place to enjoy by working at the bars and attractions going to live? The county recently did a study that stated 64% of the workers in St. John's County can't afford to live here. The number is probably higher. Unless you're intending on working in retail with your spouse and three children, you're not helping. In fact, you're hurting as another consumer that provides nothing.",t2_y58ts,EQandCivfanatic,0,1646926492.0,0,t1_i047xno,i047xno,False,OTM0DTE,t3_tal2f8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/tal2f8/young_family_moving_to_st_augustine/,Young family moving to St. Augustine,/r/StAugustine/comments/tal2f8/young_family_moving_to_st_augustine/i047xno/,2,r/StAugustine,0,2

"If you like fried shrimp and don’t go to osteens you mega fucked up. Osteens is my go to recommendation for anyone visiting st. Augustine. They have been open over 50 years for a reason. theres always a 2 hour wait and getting there before open isn’t a fix because there’s still gonna be a line. so here are some best practices:

They are CASH ONLY. They are so good they don’t have to fuck with credit card merchant fees. 

They are closed Sunday and Monday. 

They have an atm on site but it charges a fee. 

If you don’t want to eat in the restaurant call ahead for pickup at the window and food will be ready usually in 15 min. You’ll want to be there when it’s ready so it’s fresh and not soggy. Eat it in your car OR I’ve seen many people take their to go boxes to the British pub which is like 2 doors down so they can drink and eat and play darts. 

If you want to wait you can go antiquing at the store next door and their PA system feeds into the antique store so you’ll know when your table is ready

If you want to eat in the restaurant and drink and play darts while you wait tell the lady at the window you’ll be at the British pub and she will call the bartender when your table is ready. 

I think they put up an outdoor tent and tables for covid so you might be able to sit out back and eat too. 

It’s a lot of food and you may want to take a nap after eating so don’t plan anything huge right after or just save osteens for dinner.

"Hey there, Local Realtor here!

St. John’s’ county in general is the #1 school district in the state, so regardless of where in the county, you will be good. But north side of the county like Nocatee definitely has among the best schools here. They’re a big reason why we have that ranking of best school district.

Homes off of 207 and 210 are still decently priced. I’d also recommend taking a look at the St. Augustine Shores/South area as well.

Depending on your price point, The Ponte Vedra area also has very attractive, particularly Nocatee, neighborhoods for young families.

"Well, we have a metric ass-ton of new construction going on if you're willing to wait a little while; try to understand that as it is, so many people have moved here already that there are waiting lists for apartments and they are cutting down trees and filling in swamps as fast as those \*&\^%$#@! developers can (with no impact fees because DeathSatanis wouldn't want to slow down the destruction of Florida for profit!!) so look forward to that nice sales tax increase we have coming in November to pay for all of this expansion since DeathSatanis made impact fees a no-no. Gott-damned developer lobby. 

Anyway, you're just going to have to get a good Realtor to try and help you out, but if you want a good laugh: 400 sq foot ramshackle shacks are currently selling for $300,000. - $400K for anywhere near downtown. There is another 120 year old, @ 350 sq ft shack currently being renovated around the corner from me and I fully expect it to sell for that same price. No, I am not kidding.

If you want pre-built try up around Bayard on over to the river, ghost light road and whatnot on over to Switzerland (the ""town"" of) and into Fruit Cove on down along 13. Look this isn't me trying to be an ass, there literally isn't much open real estate left in St. Johns that hasn't been priced into the stratosphere; like the other Yankee said, check the websites for ratings to see what schools appeals most to you but I have to warn you: the best schools in Florida are still 1 year behind the worst schools in NY. The education standards in Florida are *atrocious* and always have been, but they got worse after the 1980s. You're better off trying to get your kids into a private school and even that might be problematic now. Our population increased by 40% from 2010  - 2020, and another solid 20% from 2020 -2022, that is not a joke.

"if you like Asian food, I would always recommend @ corner sushi or Baitong.

Mojo’s Tacos is inexpensive and delicious, hands down the best Taco place in town. Super delicious, classic, amazing Tex-Mex.

Mojo’s Barbecue can get somewhat crowded, but is totally worth. Not a bad thing on the menu. Also, they have the best Macaroni and Cheese in St. Augustine.

The Floridian is SUPER chill, all in all a great atmosphere, and not usually packed with people. The food is top notch, and they can make practically anything on their menu gluten free.

Baitong is great for those who enjoy Thai food, and they serve sushi too. Menu items are superb, and the staff is friendly.

@ Corner Sushi is the best sushi restaurant, and even picky eaters can find something on the menu that they love. I specifically am fond of the JB roll, and the chicken fried rice. My parents have said that also give… *generous* pours if you’re into wine. 

Gypsy Cab is wonderful (though it can get kinda expensive) and I recommend you stop there if just to try their chocolate peanut butter pie.

"I grew up here in St. Augustine. If you're looking for local businesses and not chains that can hit that spot I have some suggestions.

St. Augustine beach: Stir it up (hippie lunch vibe right on the beach with amazing smoothies), Beachside Diner (great breakfast spot on the beach, but can be busy)

Downtown St. Augustine: Blue hen (amazing breakfast but very hard to get a seat) Uptown Swinery (new swanky place that has great ambiance and good food) CRAVE (best lunch in town according to my wife)

Vilano: Caps (obviously a must, it hits all the spots) Aunt Kates (Cheaper knock off of caps, but with the same view and the food is still good) Beaches (kinda kitchy but can be fun at night with the outside bar)

St. Augustine Night life: Sangrias (a bar with a wrap around 2nd story deck to people watch while drinking from an extensive sangria menu) Stogies (Cigar bar that often has live jazz bands and a very cozy feel, my favorite) Boatdrinks (Small little bar with fun drinks) Tini Martini (always packed but serves the best martinis, know for their godiva chocolate martini) Prohibition Kitchen (Hip place that has an alcoholic milkshake bar, can be very loud)

Honorable mention, personal favs: Cousteau's waffle and milkshake bar (named after the movie life aquatic, share a unique ice cream sundae on top of a hot waffle) Food Truck landing (or English Landing Marina, just a food truck lot if you are strap for time but want some fun) If you make it south near marineland, check out Bings Landing (Captains, a bbq joint where the owner used to work at a cheescake factory. two awesome worlds colliding)",t2_88brlop8,Gatibo22,0,1646857584.0,0,t1_i00m5ye,i00m5ye,True,kiggles7,t3_tabxt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/tabxt7/hidden_gems_for_meals_here/,Hidden gems for meals here,/r/StAugustine/comments/tabxt7/hidden_gems_for_meals_here/i00m5ye/,5,r/StAugustine,0,5

if your looking for weird entertainment, Ripley's (believe it or not museum) is by the fort.

Trust me, me and my fam have done this multiple times. we have even walked down before a hurricane!

"Welcome back, nerds!

How long has it been?  There's been some new arrivals (River and Fort).  And some old fav's lost (Mi Casa replaced with a *fucking Cinnabon/Auntie Annies.*..)

On to Nature:  Put Washington Oaks on the list.  There's also a great BBQ place down there called Captains, which is my favorite in the region (suck it Mojo).  In that neighborhood is a smaller fort you may not know about, Ft. Matanzas.   About 35 miles inland is The Ravines, which is nice.  If you're interested in getting wet, Silver Glenn or Salt Springs maybe, but they're maybe an hour away.  Fountain of Youth is kind of nature, though less and less.  To close out the ""nature"" bit, there's a Pretzel/Crepe shop on St. George Street called Ben's Pretzels that has downtown's best garden, hidden in the back.

On to Things You're Open To:  Drunken Horse, Michaels Tasting Room for fine dining.  Tradewinds, St George tavern, maybe Stogies, and most of those Anastasia Island bars are dive bars.  On Wednesdays at Colonial Oak they have a free\* improv show, which is pretty good.  Don't know much about comic book stores, but the ""Man Shop"" at Hypolita/George is, you know, a store.  A1A down to Daytona is a wonderful drive (and Wash Oaks is along the way).  There's fish markets all over the place, but a butcher i really like is the Chop House on Anastasia.

..hold on, let me refill my rum...

Personally, Stogies is my fav bar, Boat Drinks is the best rum bar.  Uptown Swinery has some interesting bloody marys, and might be a good breakfast spot.  The Fort tour is cheap and interesting.  Old Town Trolly is a pretty good.  We're up to three distilleries now, the most famous is below the Ice Plant.  Fancy drinks can also be had at Prohibition Kitchen, but it's quite crowded.  Cousteau's is an unusual waffle place, themed after a Wes Anderson movie.   Aviles Street is kind of off the main path, and has some really interesting little spots.   Alligator Farm is probably worth a visit.  Caps on the Water in Vilano beach is where you want to go if you think you can beat the record of - what is it? - 27 Dozen oysters?  But it's a good place to go for a sunset.  Barley Republic will sell you a liter of Guinness.",t2_kqpbg,mainstreetmark,0,1646354068.0,0,t1_hz9732n,hz9732n,True,SPECPOL,t3_t6422g,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/t6422g/10th_anniversary_trip/,10th anniversary trip,/r/StAugustine/comments/t6422g/10th_anniversary_trip/hz9732n/,9,r/StAugustine,0,9

"Yes and no, depending on how you look at it.

So, they are a ""rescue mill"". They pull  as many pets as possible from kill shelters and try to get them adopted as quickly as possible. This can be a good thing.

The bad thing is a lot of the times these pets are in bad shape. Trauma, health conditions, so on and so forth. They are often deemed ""unadoptable"" by the kill shelters for these reasons and often need specific considerations when you adopt them and SAFE won't really tell you about them nor do they have the time or resources to treat them themselves.

Source: I adopted a dog from them and she was in terrible shape. Untreated yeast infections in both ears, horrible trauma from where she had come from (a puppy mill situation). I had to spend thousands and thousands of dollars of my own money to treat her physical issues and hundreds of hours training some of her worst trauma issues and to this day she still has some problems. She's better than she was, when I got her she was a complete mess and couldn't even be touched without peeing herself and she's much better now.

But you are getting the broken, the unadoptables, the ones nobody else will take. Keep that in mind when you go in.",t2_4k6mb,Hasuko,0,1645908367.0,0,t1_hyk4a7l,hyk4a7l,True,mymychildren,t3_t262do,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/t262do/is_safe_pet_rescue_legit/,Is S.a.f.e Pet Rescue legit?,/r/StAugustine/comments/t262do/is_safe_pet_rescue_legit/hyk4a7l/,10,r/StAugustine,0,10

"**[Pittsburgh left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_left)** 
 
 >The Pittsburgh left is a colloquial term for the driving practice of the first left-turning vehicle taking precedence over vehicles going straight through an intersection, associated with the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area. In other locales, the practice is also referred to as a Boston left or New York left. It is a potentially illegal and controversial practice.

No one really knows anything about the individuals running and when it says, ""vote for 3"", the top three on the ballot win 97% of the time. The order for the ballot is by picking names out of a hat. 

Most people running for school board are unqualified. What does Joe the plumber know about how a school operates, or what it takes to run a classroom? Most who run do so because they have a personal agenda, an axe to grind or some sense of power to ""straighten something out.""

"I’m afraid that I’m actually not religious. I believe in ghosts and demons. But I don’t believe in Heaven and angels or any gods or goddesses. I do know though that I have a big ol protective wall up that I’ve always really had as I’m an empath. I don’t believe anything from this place followed me because I assure you that I wouldn’t let it. I also tentatively believe in crystals (well I’m on the edge but I collect them nonetheless). Even with all the spirits I have now the first thing I do is set down my ground rules. Also how you described it is exactly how I felt in that moment. I just remember sitting on that bed with an emf meter. I told the spirit if it wanted me to get off her bed then go to red. It immediately did. I got up and after that there were no more responses that I can remember. The last places I’ve visited as a haunted attraction was Penn Hurst. And even there I didn’t feel such a negative energy. I did get called a slut by a young spirit though lol. I connect a lot better with young spirits, which is why I think this place sticks with me so much.",t2_5c47hw5c,Apeiro_phobiac,0,1644729107.0,0,t1_hwqqfyl,hwqqfyl,False,Apeiro_phobiac,t3_sr7zdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/sr7zdn/please_help_me_find_this_location_details_in/,Please help me find this location!

"Ah, gotcha. You had me a bit concerned there as demons tend to stick to negative energy such as that room. I don’t even need to be in that room and I feel it. To describe it, it feels like a black hole of an image draining emotions out of the room. But also a bit like when you’re about to start a race but it’s a negative feeling like when you’re about to get punched. With that said, be blessed by a priest of your religion beforehand or ask for a small bottle of holy water. Depends.

"I’m a huge fan of the paranormal and love to investigate in my free time. I keep haunted objects and even as a child wanted to be a paranormal investigator. That being said of all the experiences I’ve had this one was the creepiest and barely anything even had to happen. It was just being in that apartment that had me unsettled.

"Okay so I went on a ghost tour of St.Augustine, Florida about three years ago. On that tour we went to the old jail, the lighthouse, an old cemetery, y’know the usual. But we also went to this apartment that was above some small bar. If I remember correctly the story behind this place was that the father was losing custody of his little girl so he killed his daughter and then himself. The picture I provided is all I’ve got, and it’s of the little girls room. I have hunted and hunted but cannot find the name of this place because it is hardly the biggest ghost hunting spot. I mean St.Augustine is the oldest place in America I think, half of the city is freakin haunted. Looking up anything above a bar just gives you a list of haunted bars. The websites for the tours don’t list any apartments. I went on the Ghosts of Saint Augustine tour and the ghost hunt, and only went to this place during the ghost hunt that was around midnight I think. I know it was really late. I even tried finding the murder case but it happened so long ago and it’s such a common thing that I can’t find anything. I remember the bar had karaoke and you had to climb up some stairs to a deck to get into the apartment itself. The bar had nothing to do with the haunting at all. This place genuinely was the creepiest place of the whole tour. It gave me such bad vibes I thought I was going to be sick. Please help me find the name of this place. I have also searched using the photo and got no results.
