It’s immaculate, sanitizing stations everywhere, literally everything you need for any type of workout (I usually go casual cardio and maybe some strength training, but my bf usually does all strength, weightlifting, etc. and we both love it), fantastic amenities (pool, sauna, massage chairs, tanning, basketball court, outdoor patio w/equipment, shake/smoothie bar, all types of classes, I could go on...), and the staff is always so pleasant.     

I used to go to Planet Fitness but I wanted more amenities and the customer service sucked, then I tried LA Fitness and it was a nightmare. Old equipment, rude staff, everything felt dull and like I had time traveled. Then I tried a local non-chain gym and my social anxiety kicked into high gear because I like to feel “invisible” at the gym so to speak. Finally landed at OneLife, it’s the same price (maybe cheaper) as LA Fitness for WAY nicer amenities and experience, and you can still gym hop. I actually feel like I’m in 2021 at OneLife lol high ceilings so I can breathe and it’s very open.     

I know that was a lot more info than what you asked for lol but I needed to chime in since I’ve felt this sting before.

"LA Fitness definitely has the most amenities of any gym in the area. Most of my well to do acquaintances have memberships there, but it's also probably the busiest in town.

If you're just going to use treadmills, ellipticals, and weights then pretty much any of the gyms in the area are going to be adequate and have decent sanitation.

I'd just pick one that's conveniently located to your house or office and go check it out.

Cross town traffic in Acworth/Kennesaw can be such a headache at certain times of the day. If the gym is only 5 to 10 minutes away, you're more likely to go.

My wife and I are introverts too - I'm of the outgoing and sociable variety, while she's the more traditional sort.

For the business I honestly have no idea. I've thought about laser engraving / printing or maybe starting a nonprofit of some sort. The thought of an alcohol-friendly Cuban Cafe has crossed my mind, but I'm concerned about the time commitment.

Marketing is very cool. I worked closely with the marketing department at my previous job and was jealous of how much fun they had.

I did have to call them to follow up on the giftcard or I probably wouldn't have received it.

The internet service itself has been really good. Way more reliable and consistent than Comcast service in the area. And even at $45 for the 100mpbs plan it was half the price of the Comcast plan we replaced.",t2_2bl0uct,Rawr_Tigerlily,0,1632248999.0,0,t1_hdqypud,hdqypud,False,ispIssues,t3_psnpu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/kennesaw/comments/psnpu6/how_much_are_yall_paying_for_basic_internet/,How much are y'all paying for basic internet?,/r/kennesaw/comments/psnpu6/how_much_are_yall_paying_for_basic_internet/hdqypud/,1,r/kennesaw,0,1

"Do you have an organization in mind that will receive your donations? They might have access to a facility already that you guys could piggyback on.

Everything I could think of has fees, but the lowest fee options are a Cobb County park pavilion and Cobb County library meeting spaces.

To reserve a specific park pavilion, they charge $10 for residents and $15 for non-residents (keep in mind this does not include city parks such as Swift-Cantrell Park, which is managed by the City of Kennesaw):

[https://www.cobbcounty.org/parks/parks-and-nature/picnic-pavilion-information](https://www.cobbcounty.org/parks/parks-and-nature/picnic-pavilion-information)

Library meeting spaces are $25 per event, and some have capacity for over 100 people. You'd have to double check if food and drinks are permitted at the site you choose. (A few even have attached kitchens... if I remember right Mountain View has one). I know I've been to League of Women voter events at library meeting sites and light refreshments were allowed and they also provided chairs and tables on site that were adequate for the entire crowd as long as they are requested ahead of time. You have to provide your own manpower for setting up and putting away the tables and chairs. 

The library meeting room policy says you ""can't collect donations"" at the time of the meeting, but you could probably get around that pretty easily or perhaps you could talk to a library official ahead of time to stipulate your group is doing a donation drive for a specific cause, and not for your organization itself.

"The obvious choice for views and the like is Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. You can see Atlanta from the top if it isn't too rainy. There are walking trails that don't go up the mountain as well, but you got to watch out for horses on those. The national battlefield is between Marietta and Kennesaw.

Another good choice is the Noonday Creek Trail. It starts on Bells Ferry and goes to the mall and beyond. It's a solid walking/biking trail.

If you don't mind driving a little bit you can pick up the Silver Comet Trail down near Smyrna. It's a rather substantial trail that goes all the way to Alabama, and hooks into a trail that goes all the way to Mississippi.

The ""Mountain to River"" program is trying to hook the Appalachian Trail to the Silver Comet Trail that would make the a massive, continuous trail that would take you from Maine to Mississippi.",t2_8z55c,A_Soporific,0,1627248733.0,0,t1_h6ilzix,h6ilzix,True,weekndofficial,t3_oriz86,https://www.reddit.com/r/kennesaw/comments/oriz86/best_walking_trails_views_etc_near/,"Best walking trails, views, etc. near Kennesaw/Marietta?

"Welcome!  
Kennesaw Mountain is a beautiful area with enough hiking to last a lifetime.  If you go out during sunrise or sunset there’s a strong chance you’ll spot deer coming out to eat.
McCollum airport off of Chastain has a restaurant that is pretty cool.  You can watch the runway while grabbing a bite.  The food is nothing to write home about… but you go for the experience.
Downtown Kennesaw, Acworth, and Marietta are all cute towns with their own charms.  (Breweries, coffee shops, etc…)
Hobbytown USA off of Barrett parkway has scheduled nights for table top role playing if that’s your type of geeky thing.
There is portal pinball off of Cherokee Street if you want to test your might at mashing buttons and mastering the power of the TILT.
Sappy axes in Acworth will suit your axe throwing needs (there are a few places around but I haven’t visited any yet…)
If you head up north a bit into Pauling county there is Qualusi vineyards.  Wine, food trucks and large fields are open to the public. (I know you’re 20, but if you enjoy drinking  I’m sure that you can either bring your own booze or ask a friend to order…)
Swift Cantrell is a big park that many people enjoy,
Lastly smith Gilbert gardens is a hidden gem.  Think Atlanta Botanical Gardens but only in our back yard :-)

">Town Center mall’s manager has a message for local shoppers: The Easter Bunny is returning for photos in April.  
>  
>That’s noteworthy because it means the mall and its stores will be open for business, just as they are now, said mall manager Marie Moore.  
>  
>Town Center went into foreclosure this month when its mortgage holder, Deutsche Bank, unsuccessfully tried to auction off the Kennesaw mall’s $200 million in outstanding loans. The bank took possession of the property.  
>  
>That could be viewed as a positive development, said Moore. Deutsche Bank hired CBRE Group to handle the mall’s management and leasing, and the national real estate company can breathe new life into Town Center, she said.  
>  
>“We now have a new vision and a dynamic company behind us,” Moore said Wednesday.  
>  
>It won’t be easy. The pandemic has pummeled shopping malls, as shoppers stay home and buy goods online.  
>  
>North Point Mall in Alpharetta was taken over by its lender this year. The owner of Mall at Stonecrest near Lithonia fell behind on loan payments last year.  
>  
>Town Center’s Sears, one of its original tenants from 1986, closed last year. Its three remaining anchor tenants — Macy’s, JCPenney and Belk — have either closed stores in other parts of the country or filed for bankruptcy. Town Center reduced its operating hours last year, though that was partly to help tenants cut expenses, Moore said.  
>  
>Moore said she and CBRE are trying to turn things around. She said she’s talking to potential tenants.  
>  
>A Taco Bell will open soon at the mall’s food court, and Kokee Tea will move into the former Teavana location. Moore said she’s accepting suggestions for other new stores.  
>  
>Moore declined to provide figures on the mall’s revenue or average daily foot traffic, but she said foot traffic has been improving steadily.  
>  
>A COVID-19 testing facility in the mall’s parking lot helps drive foot traffic, and a coronavirus vaccine center may open inside the mall this year, she added.  
>  
>Moore plans to schedule more events like an upcoming car show and the Center for Family Resources’ Parade of Playhouses, which raises money for homeless families.  
>  
>There’s also the Easter Bunny, whose 2020 appearance was canceled due to COVID-19. Moore hopes this year’s visit will show the community that Town Center is still alive and kicking.  
>

"I actually can highly recommend Stonebridge Church, I've been going there a number of years and I have to say there is an extremely intentional approach on leadership to avoid lifting up politics or align the sermon with ""topical"" political ideals but to rather focus on how Jesus calls us to live during politically tense and divisive times. Throughout the entirety of 2020 I have never been more proud to call this church my home church seeing how they intentionally sought to love like Jesus throughout all the turmoil and frustration of 2020. We aren't perfect, but I can't imagine them having been more intentional throughout the turmoil of the year. And it wasnt just about avoiding politics but that we have something even greater to focus on that shoukd transform every area of our lives and no matter where we fall on the political spectrum that we need to be sure we are looking at politics through the lense of Jesus and His word, not the other way around. 20/10 would recommend. We are located right by Kennesaw Mountain. Online and some social distancing options are available. DM me for more info.

"The mall isn't *that* bad. The physical structure is in good shape and while occupancy is down it's not remotely close to dead. While somewhere between 1 in 3 and 1 in 4 malls will fail in the next twenty years, Town Center is likely to survive this round of debt restructuring.

If it does go, however, then we could really use a TOD. A Transit Oriented Development is something intended and designed to be walkable with regular bus routes in and out in 15 minute intervals.

We might not even lose a lot in the way of overall retail space if we condense the parking into a couple of decks instead of all the dead space of the parking lots. So, I'm thinking first floor retail, second story office space then 3-5 of apartments or condos. Have a substantial park and either an office tower or something and it should be a nice little package.

"Cobb County Public Schools are routinely ranked among the best schools in the State. Those of East Cobb are slightly more prestigious, but that comes with a massive price tag in real estate.

The further North and West you get the less well run the schools get. That's not to say that the schools in Cartersville are terrible, just not ranked nearly as highly.

"I’ve lived in Kennesaw since 2001, but I’m quite familiar with Cartersville as my dad lives there. 

I think Kennesaw is a wonderful city and expect it to become it’s own “nook” like the way Woodstock has become and what Acworth is doing right now. It’s also better access to Atlanta and other metro communities.

I graduated from KMHS (went to McClure Middle School) and had a wonderful time there, but North Cobb is also a wonderful school. Both are “magnet” schools. KMHS’s program is math and science while NCHS is international studies (please someone correct me if I’m wrong)

Cartersville is a fun city as well. Lots of great restaurants and the city likes to host events downtown. It is further away from Atlanta which is a downside for me. Not sure how the education compares to Kennesaw/Cobb County.

"Generally speaking, it's only trespassing if you make it known that you don't want them there. There's a limited presumption of people being able to use unfenced land up until they are asked to leave, so if everyone is fine with it then it's fine.

If you don't want them there then you can ask them to leave. If they refuse to leave then you can call the police to remove them. It would be a bad idea to try to force them to leave yourself in purely practical terms.

Getting a physical survey is something that should have happened when you purchased the house. If you don't  have a physical survey report then you should get one at some point. The things that sellers say should not necessarily be taken at face value and while the county map is generally accurate it can be a couple of feet off.
