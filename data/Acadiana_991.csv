"The culture war came to Lafayette by way of these fucking assholes. “All the cool kids have culture war, we see it on TV, we want it too!  Hey mom, can we have culture war?”

“Oh stop, we have culture war at home.“

Culture war at home:  assholes rousing the rabble to ban books about queer shit from the library.

"So, what is happening?

Lynette Mejira is a library activist that has long been pushing back against the Library Board of Control.

This activism well known, she was invited to participate in a sub-committee of the Library Board involving members of the public and board members regarding the creation of Northeast Library.

Landon Boudreaux today emailed her to inform her she was now being removed form the committee, NOT to punish her for exercising free speech, but for saying bad stuff about the board (specifically a Current article whose beginning I screen caped and posted as pic 2).

Stuff she's been vocal about since before being put on the special committee.

So, does Landon have the power to remove people from his special sub-committee? Sure. Is it a dick-head move?

"No worries, glad to help. This stuff can be confusing sometimes because there's not always consistent terminology used among the various coffee shops. Like the term ""iced coffee"" technically just means cold coffee served over ice, while cold brew is one specific method of making iced coffee (as opposed to making it as a double-strength hot coffee first and then diluting with ice). So you might find some places that just list it as ""iced coffee"" on their menu, while it is actually made with the cold brew method. 

It seems like cold brew has become the more popular method in recent years, so there's a good chance that if a shop serves iced coffee but they don't specify how it's made, it probably is cold brew. Of course, asking the barista should (in theory) help, but even they might get tripped up by the lingo sometimes if they are not one of the more knowledgeable ones.  


And of course, when it comes to confusion of lingo in the coffee industry, Starbucks is often a major culprit ha. I used to work there. For the longest time, they used a hot brew method for their iced coffee. It was only w/in the last 10 years that they started offering cold brew as well because they realized how popular it was becoming. But a certain segment of their customers really liked their original iced coffee, so they just do both.  


The drip-style iced coffee you might also hear referred to as ""Japanese style"". Then to further confuse things, shops like Reve might also over a ""Kyoto style,"" which uses this apparatus that looks kinda like a big hour glass. Ice is placed in the top chamber and then it just slow drips through coffee grounds below as the ice melts.  


So yeah, welcome to the wild world of coffee terminology lol.",t2_9d18jyv3,gashgoldvermilion,0,1648217580.0,0,t1_i22fe6h,i22fe6h,False,Mrs_Anthropy_,t3_tnk92v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Acadiana/comments/tnk92v/cold_brew_coffee/,Cold Brew Coffee?,/r/Acadiana/comments/tnk92v/cold_brew_coffee/i22fe6h/,3,r/Acadiana,0,3

"I’m not sure if you’re trolling or not but this World Cup was given to a very corrupt nation who has never been known for soccer. They don’t even have a real team.  On top of that, the tournament had to be moved to the winter to make up for the fact that it’s ungodly hot there in the summer. This move will hurt all of the leagues around the world for various reasons but the biggest controversy is that the stadiums were built using literal slave labor. Thousands have and will have have died before the first game even starts. I’d personally have a hard time trying to watch the cup while reconciling the fact that it was only possible there because of all of the slave labor/migrant worker exploitation and abysmal living conditions for these workers who have their passports confiscated upon arrival and aren’t allowed to leave the country to return home without their employers permission. Most go home in a body bag. Most Olympics and World Cups come with their fair share of corruption, and many construction projects have a few accidental deaths associated with it but this here in Qatar is on a whole new level.

"You have several things working against you on your whiskey hunt here in Lafayette.

1. Whiskey is highly sought-after by the general public. It's not some hidden secret.
2. The oilfield companies here spend thousands of dollars entertaining customers. Having a hard to get whiskey for a customer is crucial.
3. Whiskey is heavily allocated by the distributor. New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Lafayette get the bottles in that order. With New Orleans getting the Lion's share.

You're not getting a rare bottle from Marcellos. They have their ""list"" of customers who spend money. Ambassador Wine and Spirits has a literal list behind the counter. There are a thousand names on it, but they do actually call you if you're next. Champagne's and Nunu's know what they're doing. Champagnes actually sells at secondary prices in their glass cabinet. One of the people at Champagnes actually recommended an expensive/shitty bottle of whiskey to my wife to give me for Christmas. They're shady. Nunu's keeps bottles for their oilfield customers and regulars tucked away. Both liquor managers know what they have. The smaller stores, the good stuff never goes to them, or it never makes it out of the manager's office.

Albertsons gets it, but unless you have a relationship with the liquor manager you're not getting any. You may get lucky if you go in at an off hour and get the assistant. Rouses gets it, but they know what they have. The key to Rouses is to pick one with a liquor manager who simply does not care, or go when the guy isn't there and have some poor sob look in the back. Rouses on Johnson has a glass case with some of the ""rarer"" whiskeys. Secondary prices.

In my opinion, the ideal situation would be if an Albertsons gets a new liquor manager at one of their stores, and they have no clue what they have.

*The footage, which was recorded by another Vandebilt student, was shared on social media, and the school started an investigation that included the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office, he said.*

*The name of the student, who is white, has not been released.*

"Good for you. I never pressed any charges against my assailant…his cousin is the sheriff— and I just didn’t think I was worth it at the time and I wish I had so he wouldn’t do it to someone else. I don’t even much care ab what happened to me- I dodnt want him doing it again, so you absolutely did the right thing. I had to really work on forgiveness but once I did…it set me free. Forgiveness is freedom for your heart and mind, not theirs. I’m sure you know this. I just want to encourage you to try and be better from this..not bitter. You’re only hurting yourself while he goes on living without a 2nd thought of the repercussions of his actions(assuming). Take your power back.

The greatest revenge is success and… forgiveness.

"In my experience dogs are easily bribable. I live on some acreage and have ducks/geese/chickens that free range. I’d love some livestock guardian dogs (since they aren’t liable to eat my birds lol) but they are usually pretty friendly towards people, even strangers. My geese are an amazing warning system however, I know when anyone drives up or even just walks past my house lol. They aren’t attack geese tho so they are basically useless outside of just being intimidating and loud when people come by. Anyone who wants to get past them can. I AM super worried about having a gun on my person with a (now five year old) in my care, so I dunno what I will end up doing. I was thinking that just brandishing an unloaded weapon should be enough for most people to get the fuck off of my property tho.

"Thank you so much for being on the lookout for him. If y’all had not suggested the groups y’all did, I’d have never been in contact with his neighbor. His neighbors friend was assaulted the same way by this guy so he really wanted him gone. His neighbor had a criminal history (I believe assault on an officer was one of his past convictions) as well and the police were very cautious about going in the neighborhood because of that. The neighbor offered to beat him with a baseball bat for me if he wasn’t arrested but I was like “nah prison would be worse and don’t be getting violent on account of me, the dude doesn’t deserve to DIE because of what he did.” This guy really went above and beyond for me though as he sent photos of police in his neighborhood who then LEFT (due to the officer responding being female who ran his plates and saw his criminal history) and I was able to call the police and say “yeah that’s absolutely the right neighborhood.” They hooked me up with the arresting officer and she waited for backup and then arrested him. Then, because the officer who had taken the original report had to run in the middle of our meeting, they sent him back a few days later to sign the victim notification papers, which I am extremely grateful for as I am genuinely concerned that this guy will have a grudge against me after spending time in prison for what he did to me.

I posted it here and got some suggestions for groups to post it in via Facebook, where one of his neighbors who absolutely fucking hated him, was ecstatic to not only identify him, but to send photos and videos of his arrest. He kept me updated the whole time as to his location and I was able to direct police to his house. I had to eventually delete the post I made here about it, however, because someone used the video to find my address and send me Google street view photos of my house. Weird.

"The thing is, if it still works like it did when I was regularly hiring off-duty LEOs for various duties, you don't just reach out to some rando cop and offer him/her \*official\* off-duty work. IIRC, they \*can\* take opt to that kind of off-duty security work, but when they're hired directly, they can't wear their uniform or firearm or badge and they can't do anything that's part of the scope of work for a cop in uniform but NOT for anyone else.

To get \*official\* (uniform, badge, firearm) off-duty LEOs for work in the scope of what they do (security, traffic control, crowd control), you have to go through the BRPD. The BRPD sets the rate of hire/pay and they assign cops to the duty who've signed up to do off-duty work. The organization who hires the off-duty LEOs then pays BRPD directly and BRPD pays their officers. They can only be hired to do things police \*already\* do and there's a serious limit to the hours they can work, what they can and can't do, etc.

I'm NOT a particular fan of the police, but I've hired plenty of both plains clothes security and off-duty LEO security and they're very different situations.

- Just because we aren’t sure of the exact number of defensive uses doesn’t mean we can say they don’t exist. We can also look at some city’s with the most gun control in the country and see extraordinary amounts of gun violence.

"Mask mandates are being dropped precipitously across the country.  This lady might be dumb and dishonest but she isn’t alone in being annoyed.  It’s funny to watch all of these mandates, driven by federal guidance, getting repealed before the congressional midterms.  You can guarantee that someone is reading the polls and coming to the conclusion that even blue voters are tired of the mandates.  Changing realities of the pandemic outside of the mask debate are also driving those decisions.  The people stuck on the culture war aspect, whether pro or anti mask, will probably be consistently wrong in their arguments even if their conclusions align with continuing changes in guidance.  And that’s been true throughout the pandemic.  A lot of people made crappy pro-mask arguments that were wrong even if their conclusions aligned with policy.  Don’t get mad when guidance aligns with this crazy lady’s opinion even if she remains consistently wrong.

In fact, the best way to be consistently wrong even if you happen to land on the right conclusion, is to follow political culture war nonsense.

"Omicron really changed things, mask mandates are being dropped for reasons outside of their direct effectiveness.  The disease being generally milder and conferring a good immunity after infection (for the previously vaccinated/infected, exposure is low risk and it’s essentially it’s own booster) really incentivized a shift to a herd immunity approach that was absolutely unthinkable just a year prior when the world’s immune systems were completely naive to the virus and we didn’t have vaccines or effective treatments.  Those circumstances have changed dramatically, and even though masks have always worked to some extent and continue to work, those facts are just not as important.

"Don’t forget that doctors are also fallible human beings that are subject to groupthink and authority worship too.  Not that it necessarily applies to the core arguments in this thread, but it’s not safe to always assume that the majority is always correct.  Especially when there is a huge political element at work plus a novel situation with high stakes and limited information available.

Even CA is quietly dropping mask and vaccine mandates, which tells me more than any amount of jawboning from authorities.  Idiots argue about whether masks work (of course they do, to some extent, especially if implemented correctly).  Intelligent people move past that argument quite quickly and instead discuss the actual prudence of policies including other external factors beyond “is the sky blue” and “do masks work”.  Increasingly there is a consensus even among the solid majoritarian bloc of people who agree masks work, that they are no longer necessary as a public policy.

"I know this is reddit and redditors are notorious for seeing a blue link and just saying ""sounds good to me"" you should probably be aware that the reason that numbers varies so heavily is due to a lack of data on the matter. As it stands its pretty contested in that range and the paper continues to raise the question of if the defensive use of fire arms offsets the occurrence of fire arm related suicides, however thats a whole other can of worms. It does however continue to say with what little data we have on the matter it seems the defensive use of guns rate seems to match the offensive use of guns rate however this data relies of extrapolation of data which can be unreliable. In addition it doesnt clarify that defensive use of firearms prevented an offensive use of firearms, but this is also likely due to the nature of these encounters.
