"When I say checked, I mean I called the T mobile store and I also contacted online reps, not by using the website availability checker. The dude stated, ""T mobile 5G home internet is not available in Altoona.""

The online rep also stated that the cellular towers are different from their 5G in home internet towers.

So what the heck is going on lol. There'd be literally no incentive for you to make this up, but there'd be no incentive for the people who I talked to not to have me come in and make a purchase, unless they just didn't feel like dealing with people.

If it's true T-Mobile can bypass what the eligibility website says, then I'm kinda hoping Verizon does the same, they offer significantly faster speeds up to 1 gig down,  but typically 400mbps for their 5G in home internet, but if they can't, I'll definitely stop by your store.

"T-Mobile Home Internet is most definitely in Altoona, as I’ve personally sold countless boxes of them!

They are 5G Gateway’s, that run off the network of the towers. As long as you have a reliable signal at your home address (3-4 bars), you’d averagely be getting 50-70mbps.

In store, we have ability to bypass what the “eligibility” website says, as it was only created to not overload the network upon its initial release last January.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"Here is my take: there is a college here that has been expanding for several years. It also fairly close to State College, where they have awful overpriced housing for students as is tradition.  

A large number of houses were built here to hold multiple families for the railroad about 120 years ago.  I’m talking houses that have four bedrooms, a furnished walk-up attic, a full downstairs living area and a full basement and yard, sometimes for less than 100k. I think that if you cater to the right folks (college students, healthcare workers) you could find some success. I think for the area I wouldn’t charge more than 600 per resident.  If you buy a house and are able to partition it off into 2-3 apartments, you will be giving a fair rent and making decent money.  Really depends what on how much you pay for the property.

If you are doing this though, do not be one of those turds who landlords over property and moved off to god knows where and let’s it fall apart, forgetting their responsibility.  The city will come after you, they’ve been doing a very good job the last year about taking charge of the landlord neglect that has plagued this area.",t2_yfl9i,Snax_Attax,0,1628084244.0,0,t1_h7ocflf,h7ocflf,True,IG-Obselite,t3_ouckl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/altoona/comments/ouckl9/renting/,Renting,/r/altoona/comments/ouckl9/renting/h7ocflf/,2,r/altoona,0,2
"Chains are extremely rare in Western PA; I don't know anyone that currently even has a set living in the area; I left mine in Seattle. It's not like living out west where you get 10 feet of snow in the mountains and police checkpoints to go over a pass.

Plows generally keep up with the snow accumulation on maintained roads. You'd be fine, 99% of the time, with a good set of all season tires that meet the state minimum tread depth. You get a rare storm two or three times in the average winter where it's best to just avoid going out until it passes and road crews catch up but those are going to be the windy low visibility days where I doubt you'd be skiing. Dedicated winter tires are beneficial but not necessary most of the time.

There are pockets where you get a lot of wind or ice.. main roads will have digital signs warning you (Cresson summit, for example), back roads keep an eye on snow drifts. Ice is rarely a problem due to all the chemical they put down, mostly just be cautious if you haven't seen a truck for a while or when it's actually freezing rain.

About two weeks ago my friends and I heard something very loud as well but it was around 6pm. It definitely wasn’t a gun or fireworks. My neighbor happened to be outside as well and heard it as we all looked at each other in confusion. I can’t remember what his exact words were but he seemed to think it was something to do with the railroad. Unsure of what part of pleasant valley you live but we head the noise coming from over near the building they’re now renovating next to The Grand Palazzo/Jaffa area. My fiancé says when they link train cars together it’s very loud but I don’t know why that’d be happening in the middle of the night unless you’re north towards the Juniata shops as they work third shift.

"That's an amazing observation. I do that quite a bit. It may be most helpful to listen. I think it's more common for older people to use dialect words, but this isn't as common in younger people with expanded media exposures.

For me, one of the most notable things I've noticed is the way southwestern and southcentral Pennsylvanians tend to ""mush"" words together. Someone above mentioned contractions, but it goes a subtle step father than that. ""get over here"" becomes ""gidover'ere"" while something like ""can you"" becomes so compressed that it can sound like ""Q"", so that asking ""can you run down to the store"" can sound like, ""Q run down tooda store?"".

"There are a couple of things that me and and my friends have noticed as far as Altoona accents go. A friend who works in radio was teased for his accent when reading ad copy. The guys at the station said he was an obvious ""Altoid"".

The first thing is an over-emphasis on hard-""R"" sounds. ""Wash"" becomes ""wersh"", ""creek"" becomes ""crick"", ""color"" becomes ""keller"". All with an over-emphasized R-sound.

The other thing is a ""flattening"" of the vowels. ""O""s, ""OU""s, and ""A""s sometimes flatten out and blend into a weird ""A/E"" vowel sound. I don't have the vocabulary to describe vocal things correctly, but that's the best I know how.

Overall, it's not an overpowering accent. If you use local jargon you'll probably depict it in a way nobody would really question.

"As someone who moved to this area as a teen, it's definitely a Pittsburgh accent with no Philly influences. The word I struggled most with with ""yinz"" (I've not heard a Philly-ish ""youns"" here).

There is a varying level of how thick said accent or word use is. People who have been out of the area, say for college or who aren't natives, have a lighter version or it only slips out on certain words. For example, my husband pronounces ""color"" as ""keller"" but has few other tells.

"So Altoona definitely has more of a shared culture with Pittsburgh than Philadelphia. I wouldn't say that people have a strong Pittsburgh accent, but using the Pittsburgh accent/vernacular as a reference isn't a bad start.

I don't think the vocal inflection is nearly as strong in central PA as in Pittsburgh though. The guy reading the rainbow poem isn't a bad example of inflection, which I think is pretty neutral (although maybe I would since I grew up there). In some parts of rural Central PA, you almost get a little bit of Appalachian twang mixed in there, but, again, the inflection is not quite as strong. I would say that vowel sounds are a little blunter, if that makes sense. So we say ""crick"" instead of ""creek,"" or ""warsh claws"" instead of ""wash cloths,"" or ""iggle"" instead of ""eagle."" And people often drop the g in ""ing"" words.

A lot of Pittsburgh vocabulary is familiar to me--things like slippy, dippy, redd up, crick, and spicket, but there are notable exceptions. For instance, I don't think people say ""yinz"" here, which is obviously the iconic Pittsburgh word. It's more like ""yuns"" or ""youns"" in my experience. And I've never heard someone call someone a jagoff or jag here.

And there are some prominent features that I think are worth mentioning that I don't really associate with Pittsburgh:

* Dropping ""to be"" in infinitives might be the biggest one. ""That dish needs rinsing"" instead of ""That dish needs to be rinsed,"" etc.
* Past tense words are often improper: ""seen"" instead of ""saw""
* Adding 's to store names, e.g. Sheetz's instead of Sheetz.

This article is pretty accurate, I think. I don't recognize everything on the list, but much of it I do!

"Altoona has plenty of nice areas. It depends a lot on the block you're on. I've lived near the Jaffa Mosque, near the campus, near the hospital, in East End, and in Greenwood. I've never felt unsafe in any of those neighborhoods.

Honestly, the rough areas are all either super-obviously rough areas, or they are housing projects.

I would say Altoona is a great place to rent because most of the renting in Altoona is individual people who are renting houses, not big companies who own large rental structures. The price is usually reasonable and it's a fairly cheap area to live in.

I concur with whoever said south of the hospital is better overall - I have family deeper into the city and, growing up, I watched their neighborhoods get worse and worse, filling up with transients and drug dealers.

"I used to live on the border of a rougher neighborhood. Generally speaking, stay away from the hospital. The further south, the better, in the Altoona area. The prices of rentals are fairly reflective of the quality of the area. 

I lived in Hollidaysburg growing up, so I don't think it's as good a value as it's reputation implies. If safety and security are paramount, look for a fence and secured parking. Just like anywhere else, it only takes a handful of A-holes to ruin a nice little area.  If you have kids to worry about, I will recommend Hollidaysburg schools. Altoona has bigger capabilities, but students can get lost in the crowd, and the sheer size of the student body will mean that there's going to be trouble somewhere.

Also, some of the real estate places manage apartments.

I noticed you dropped 4 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

"Bullshit.  All bullshit.  Not how masks work AT ALL.  Not P95s, which is not even close.  They filter mosture (which the virus rides on) out from the air YOU are breathing.  They just jack shit to filter what you exhale...it fact, they just blow more moisture into the air...and potentially, the virus with it.  Most of the p95 have an exhale valve.  That REALLY does absolutely nothing at all to filter out the virus.

Second, and more bullshit from you, evictions were stopped in the relief packages passed by Congress.  It was all suspended.  But that CAN NOT go on for long without very serious consequences to both micro and macro economics.  SOMEONE has to pay the bill.  The rent pay the mortgage, mortgage pays the bond, bond pay interest.  Break that cycle for too long and you destroy the economy.  That happens, it makes this pandemic look like a joke (it is anyway, but for arguements sake).

Just what exactly do you want the government to do?

Short of the China method I already pointed out, they did just about all that could be done.

Idiots and morons blaming Trump for doing nothing just show how stupid they really are, especially when that bozo Biden gets on stage and lists the things he would do, and low and behold...Trump was ALREADY doing them....

"Well first off, that's not how the masks work. It's been repeated over and over again and somehow people still don't get it. The mask DO NOT protect you from getting it. They protect you from spreading it. This is why surgeons wear them during surgery. They aren't afraid of catching what's in your body. They are afraid of potential spreading  germs and bacteria into an open wound. 

Second, the reason we've had these shut downs are because people aren't taking it seriously. If people would have truly took the proper precautions throughout this entire pandemic, we would be a lot better off now.

"The issue “being responsible for yourself” is translating in this moment to “doing whatever I want”.  If you were traveling down the road at say, 20 mph and a child ran in front of your car, you would hit the brakes.  Sure, 20 mph isn’t that fast.  They would get hurt but the likelihood of them dying isn’t that great, right? It’s not like you’re driving 100 mph after all.  But you still would have hit the brakes, because one, it is the right thing to do.  But that isn’t enough for some people so we’ll just add that if you don’t, you will have to face consequences.

When people ignore basic precautions, like wearing a mask or keeping your distance, you may not have to face consequences but you might be forcing someone else to face the consequences of YOUR actions.  I GET IT.  We’re bored, we’re sick of it.  I like to go out to eat sometimes too, but do it with the precautions.

"If you would like a real answer, it is because of the way electoral districting is structured that majority popular votes don't result in legislatures that reflect those votes a lot of the time.  It also depends on who is ACTUALLY voting.  The left, for all of their rhetoric and activism, has historically not gone to the ballot box as consistently as conservative voters.  Part of this is because conservative voters are older, often retired, or can afford to take the time off to vote.  My assumption is that if you are older you SHOULD be more financially stable, allowing you to do that.

Younger voters and non-white voters also have much less faith in the electoral process than conservative voters.  The fact is that the majority of this country leans center/left, which you can see when you look at the numbers overall for the last 20 years: the last time a conservative-leaning presidential candidate won the popular vote was in 2004: Bush Jr. second term (an incumbent AND a wartime president, during the strongest patriotic movement in this century).

It hasn't always been that way, but the conservative side of the aisle has serious issues with how they are perceived, due in no small part to openly courting racist groups, widely supporting corporate interests over those of their constituents (a problem throughout congress) and touting a regressive ideology (let's go back to how things were) rather than a progressive one (let's work to make things how they should be) that not only doesn't resonate with new voters, but actively repels them.

Anyway, hope that helps.  Personally, I could never move to China because Mandarin is really hard to learn, it's a hassle to get a decent hamburger, the traffic is terrible...the list goes on and on.  My point is, just because someone has progressive leanings does not mean they want to literally live in communist China where they run college kids over with tanks.",t2_55r933tl,Evening_Post_CC,0,1609145162.0,0,t1_gh9uvaf,gh9uvaf,False,[deleted],t3_kdilr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/altoona/comments/kdilr7/the_contact_information_including_facebook/,The Contact Information Including Facebook & Twitter For The Seven Pa Representatives Who Signed Onto The Texas Led Lawsuit To Overturn The Election.,/r/altoona/comments/kdilr7/the_contact_information_including_facebook/gh9uvaf/,1,r/altoona,0,1

Yeah it basically started at the beginning of the pandemic. The owner said masks weren’t required in his restaurant. Not a great look but whatever. Then he doubled down and posted an egregious sign in front of his restaurant spewing the asinine rhetoric about masks impeding on our freedoms as Americans and that the flu is more deadly etc. super dangerous. THEN he banned masks from being worn in his restaurant going as far as not serving people who wore them. Terrible look from a business owner during a pandemic but what proved to me that he is a miserable awful person was his replies to his post about the masks and such on Facebook calling those who support the mask mandate ‘retards’.

"From this list, I would high recommend The Knickerbocker, the Athenian Cafe, and the Allegro (if you like Italian). I would recommend double checking the menus online, maybe with a phone call as the Knicks menu rotates. It's a bit more of an upscale pub fare environment.

"Thanks for the link. That's helpful for future reference. Nothing next week while I'm in, unfortunately.

It just so happens that I saw the punk band Black Flag announced today that they're playing a show in Altoona on a Saturday night in May, which is both coincidental and very surprising given the band's status. I'm not reconsidering waiting until then to go. Only thing is school wouldn't be in session then, but not sure how much of the college student body actually impacts anything here in town (I assume most students are also only freshmen or sophomores before transferring to Penn State'd main campus).

They are also super nice when you talk to them.,t2_3t504mvx,llove111,0,1567733862.0,0,t1_ez84a9j,ez84a9j,True,WhyOfCourseICan,t3_cdzvi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/altoona/comments/cdzvi4/whats_the_best_option_for_internet_in_our_area/,What's the best option for internet in our area?,/r/altoona/comments/cdzvi4/whats_the_best_option_for_internet_in_our_area/ez84a9j/,2,r/altoona,0,2

"The other thing was the entire time I did UE back then, I had a promotion for $3 extra per delivery up to 33 trips/$99/week. That ended in the summer. So it’s not as profitable for me to do UE right now.
