"Pretty sure the Hillsdale / Saratoga cams are still off, I had been caught before and I would’ve been caught more than once since. (I swear I’m safe, they’re just way too reactive).

Kind of unrelated to city stuff but in a similar vein: northbound 280 between Edgewood and the 92 interchange is notorious for ticketing with spotters - one CHP will sit atop the vista point and report speeders to a cop who’s lower and able to catch up quickly. The important thing to know here is the cop ticketing you has to hold evidence. Ask to see the speed gun, if they can’t produce it they have nothing. They will bait you by asking questions e.g. “I have you clocked doing 85 over the hill back there, does that sound right?” Don’t answer that. 

I’d be delighted if the cops worried less about these big intersections where literally nothing serious ever happens because there is so much time to react to indiscretions, and put some more effort into making it scarier to blow a stop sign on two lanes in a residential neighborhood. I feel like it’s pandemic related somehow, but people just ignore stop signs all over lately.

"What makes Millbrae Ave. so bad (they got me, once) are the traffic cameras. Most of San Mateo County has gotten rid of those; though, I recall reading something about one city reconsidering that.

"I live on Hacienda between 37th and 39th.  No ambulance noise at all.  The annoyances are:

\- Hospital has a lot of outdoor machinery (trucks, air conditioners, construction) that creates a lounder-than-usual backdrop of white noise.  We don't hear it much because of double-paned glass.

\- Weekday traffic.  The hospital doesn't have enough staff parking, so 9-5 M-F the neighborhood parking fills up.  Some of the staff parking in front of your house are pretty grumpy too.  After 5 and on weekends it is clear and empty.  

\- Trash from the hospital.  Visitors and staff leave litter, and because the streets are empty on weekends, some folks dump furniture and large trash.  I usually call hospital security to sort out bad problems, and they're pretty good about it.

\- Construction.  The hospital is perpetually under construction, which leads to street closures and other issues.  Specific inconveniences never last long, though.

Other than those issues, the neighborhood is great.

"In short, yes.

Female, late 20s. Living with another female of similar age. I've lived around here for the past 5 years.

I currently live about 4 blocks away from that dot in a ""green"" zone. I used to live in a ""red"" zone a few blocks away, closer to downtown. I feel equally as safe in this apartment as I did in the last, in terms of location. My last one didn't have an outside building door and I do now, which makes me feel a lot safer.

There are reports of property damage all the time (e.g. broken in cars, stolen packages, bikes/strollers taken off porches etc). Very little personal experience with any of this. Except a package taken once.

We run/walk around here all the time with headphones in during the day. Much more afraid of cars than I am of people around. I feel fine walking around at night. But wary enough to always take my phone or leave the headphones behind. I try to take one of the bigger streets (e.g. San Mateo Dr) if it's late.

Both apartments are nice and azara is a brand new build. I’ve lived in an apartment near and love the area. One thing to be aware of is the train noise but it only passes by once an hour. It doesn’t bother me at all and it’s more white noise. The apartments have amazing noise cancellation so not a problem if windows are shut. If it does bother you consider somewhere a bit further away.,t2_qy32j,sillybunbuns,0,1644171089.0,0,t1_hvu7qs8,hvu7qs8,True,jas532,t3_slsgo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanMateo/comments/slsgo7/san_mateo_apartments/,San Mateo Apartments,/r/SanMateo/comments/slsgo7/san_mateo_apartments/hvu7qs8/,4,r/SanMateo,0,4

"I am not sure the bike lane is the panacea you think. I used to live in Central in Redwood City. Very similar demographic to that area of San Mateo (having grown up there). Jefferson Ave. has a bike lane. And lots of chalk outlines of poor cyclists. You know what actually worked well? Stop signs scattered on the side streets to slow down traffic on those streets. I biked there often and never had issues. That’s really the issue - speeding cars. It’s one of the main reasons I went to city meetings advocating for more traffic lights on Jefferson, especially at intersections used by kids to cross street to go to schools. You need to slow down the flow then riding in the street doesn’t feel so unsafe (nor does it take away parking).

In my opinion converting to one way and having parking protected bike lanes is good long term advocacy and something I will be advocating for, but it will take more time and this project has been called for for over 10 years by the community. People on bikes need safer places now because people keep on dying on Humboldt and Poplar. The parking removal comes out to ~8-10 spaces per block. It's just a large project area over many miles, so 214 spaces sounds like a lot.

"I'm sorry about your experience getting hit multiple times on your bike. I don't think they can build a garage on that land because it may be slated for housing or more school buildings in the future. But even if a garage were built, over time it would fill up with cars as the neighborhood continues to grow, more people would rely on cars because it would be more convenient, and we will get back to the same problem that you described above. On the other hand, if we make biking easier and safer and more convenient, so that more people aren't afraid that they will get hit by a car, more people would choose to bike or walk or take transit, and fewer people would drive. They would have an alternative. Getting to reduced car ownership frees up space so that the people you described, people who really have to rely on multiple cars, can more reliably find parking.

"Parking is a practical concern with practical parking policy solutions that the city is analyzing and recommending solutions to. But I would just point out that people who are biking are currently the ones getting screwed, because every square inch of the street is being used for parking or driving even though this neighborhood has some of the highest biking rates in the state. Is that fair? For low income cyclists to continue being hit and seriously injured in the neighborhood because people parking don't want any parking spaces taken away, regardless of what parking policies the city tries to implement? Another thing I'd say is that you can't improve the parking situation without getting more people out of their cars to free up parking space.

I live in this neighborhood and use a bike to commute. I have been hit by a car riding my bike 3 times in that area so I support these policies. However the parking situation is already also complete out of control. You can’t walk a stroller on the sidewalk due to all the vehicles pulled all the way up on to the curb. Permits are needed to stop the non residents/illegal auto repair shops/homeless squatting that are currently cluttering many of the sidewalks.

"Agree with everything said so far. Assuming work keeps you in San Mateo most of the time, I'd like to recommend Kaz Grill for a Teriyaki Chicken bowl (togo only) and picnic in Central Park - perfect for a quick local lunch break and it crosses off the Japanese garden and Rose garden in San Mateo. If you have time, 

Otherwise definitely take advantage of our location in the Bay Area. SF has the stereotypical touristy things (pier 39, fisherman's wharf, embarcadero, union square, chinatown, golden gate park) and some beautiful museums. Stanford is a go to (great art museum, large campus, plus ya know it's Stanford). UC Berkeley requires crossing the bridge/a longer Bart ride but also beautiful campus. Half Moon Bay for the beach and artisan/indie shops. Along Highway 35 has some great open spaces for hiking. San Jose is also close by.

"I'll leave the restaurant recommendations to u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt.  Two of San Mateo's best treasures are the [Japanese Garden in Central Park](https://www.cityofsanmateo.org/3319/Central-Park-Japanese-Garden), for a quick visit and great photos, and [Sawyer Camp Trail](https://parks.smcgov.org/sawyer-camp-segment), for a longer (but easy) walk and incredible views, photos, animal sightings, etc.  

Close to San Mateo is [Filoli](https://filoli.org/), a historic home and gardens, which you might enjoy especially if you've been to Ireland.  It was originally built for the daughter of William Bourne, and the location was chosen based on its similarity to Muckross Estate -- the nearby Crystal Springs Reservoir resembles the Lakes of Killarney. [https://irishculturebayarea.com/filolis-irish-connection/](https://irishculturebayarea.com/filolis-irish-connection/)  

If you do go to the coast, as many have recommended, consider driving south, and then east, for a hike in the [Purisima Creek Redwoods Preserve](https://www.openspace.org/preserves/purisima-creek-redwoods).  There are easy or strenuous hikes available, and lots of redwoods.  Be sure to look for [banana slugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_slug) alongside the shady side of the trail.  

Also on the coast [Sweet55 Swiss chocolate](https://www.sweet55.com/) on Hwy 1 at Kelly Ave. (check their hours before you go).  Or cross Hwy 1 to Three Amigos and get the (cold) shrimp cocktail, which is served in an enormous bowl and is just amazing.  It's more like ceviche but it's called a shrimp cocktail on the English menu.

"My San Mateo restaurant and bar recommendations:

Chico’s Taqueria on 25th for birria and other good tacos.

For a family-run cal-mex style restaurant, La Fonda de San Mateo is very good and a uniquely North American take on Mexican (the restaurant is owned and run by a family where the Mexican father runs the show  his brother is the cook, his wife is German (and now retired), and the kids are servers.)

ramen Parlor has the best ramen in the area though there are a few good options.

Pho Element on El Camino is newer and does great Northern Vietnamese-style pho (lighter, less sweet, not as many warm aromatics in the broth).

Chef Zhao Bistro on El Camino has the best Sichuan food in the Bay Area, in my opinion.

For cocktails go to Pausa (also good pasta and charcuterie) or the newly opened Wunderbar.

Wursthall for a CA take on a German beer hall (disclosure, I’m no longer affiliated with the place, but I was partner/chef at wunderbar and wursthall.)

Backhaus has easily the best bread and pastries in the area. If you want to see what sourdough in the Bay Area is like, this is where you should go (disclosure: I am also a financial partner here but have nothing to do with daily operations).

For pizza go to Pazzo in San Carlos. The owner is from New Haven and worked for some of the greats there. It’s the best New Haven-style apizza I’ve had outside of new Haven. (And New Haven is the best pizza town in the US per capita).

Windy City has surprisingly good and authentic Chicago deep dish if you want to give that a try. For Neapolitan I’d suggest Rise or Delfina. 

Old Port Lobster Shack does east coast-style lobster rolls and fried whole belly clams. (I don’t know where else to get fried whole belly clams in the Bay Area). They can be hit or miss but typically really good and those are very uniquely American specialties.

Jersey Joe’s on El Camino a little south of San Mateo has great cheesesteaks, another American thing.

Dash has the best sushi in the area for my money. They get weekly shipments of fish from Tsukiji so you’ll find interesting fish that most other places won’t carry.

For dive bars, the Swingjng Door is a true dive. I don’t know what they’re doing through pandemic (I moved mid-pandemic) but they used to have karaoke downstairs Wed-Sun, a trivia night, and dueling pianos upstairs a couple nights a week. They also low key have the best fish and chips in the area.

For burgers, I’m biased, but the smash burger at Wursthalll is mine and very good, I think. It comes with crazy crunchy triple-cooked potatoes.

31st Union is a nice casual farm-to-table locavore restauran with good wine and cocktails. (Edit: CLOSED)

For beer, Wursthall has 31 taps and a wide selection of local and imports. Fieldwork over in Bay Meadows has a great outdoor beer garden with bocce. It’s also near by a Blue Bottle if you want to try some third-wave specialty coffee. The ice cream shop there (Tin Pot Creamery) is also good.


For local stuff to do, my favorite things were the Japanese garden in Central Park, trips to half moon bay (you’ll need a car and at least 5-6 hours to make this worth it), driving up La Honda to grab some (not great) food at Alice’s Restaurant, looking at the pretty trees, then continuing on to the Dutch Goose in MenlonPark for their deviled eggs, LA hot sandwich, and a good beer. 

Biking or waking song the bay trail from
San Mateo to Coyote Point is gorgeous, and if you get to coyote point at low tide, you can check out the sea life in the tide pools that come out.

There are lots of great hiking trails around the area though, so take your pick.",t2_7hryw,J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt,0,1643568360.0,0,t1_huvvh2b,huvvh2b,True,LordofCookies,t3_sg9uma,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanMateo/comments/sg9uma/visiting_san_mateo_for_7_days_what_should_i_visit/,Visiting San Mateo for 7 days.

"Coyote Point is nearby and has a nice view up and down the peninsula much of the time. Crystal Springs reservoir is a good place to go walking to experience a feeling of being surrounded by nature without going too far. The serene lake, trees upon trees on the other side. Chilly but a wonderful place to watch the sun set.

If you have but one free afternoon, I'd recommend seeing San Francisco from the Fort Mason area. You get a view of the Golden Gate and Alcatraz. Just a short walk away is the Maritime Museum, which is free (and very small) and offers some cool local relics from the era of naval trading. Eat at Boudin to experience San Francisco sourdough.

Philz and Blue Bottle for coffee.

For Burmese, Mingalaba in Burlingame.

Some great Japanese and Hawaiian takeaway from the downtown Japanese supermarkets.

Caffe Fiero for a great Italian lunch and coffee too

Foreigner Cafe is a really good brunch spot

Backhaus has excellent pastries and bread

Rise has pretty good pizza

Irish bar, try O Neil's. Nearby is a German beer hall

For Burgers, definitely hit Jeffrey's

Sandwiches, try the Spot or Ike's

"In California, real estate tax on a parcel of property is limited to 1% of its assessed value. This ""assessed value"" may be increased only by a maximum of 2% per year until, and unless, the property has a change of ownership. 

On top of that 1% base you'll have city and county bond measuresfor schools and stuff like that sprinkled througout right now those total an additional 0.1% of the original assessed value and then like $100\~ in fixed taxes for stuff like mosquito abaitment and some other bonds. 

So if you budget for 1.2% of the purchase price every year it'll give you a good idea if you're ok.

"I wouldn’t live there but I understand the desperate situation the homeowners face. I guess if there’s nothing else, go for it. It’s too close to freeway for me. Don’t like the air and too much noise. Get something west of El Camino or just make the leap into Foster City if you wanna be by the water. 

I haven’t spent much time there lately. Back in 1970’s, when I was just a kid I used to walk down to Parkside Plaza and buy little candies from the grocery store. It used to be an Alpha Beta Grocery store and I’d get Lemon Drops and Big Chew Bubblegum. 

I was never fond of that general area for a living space. I wasn’t even fond of where we were when we did live in San Mateo (1611 Van Buren St). Back then, there were gangs and it didn’t feel that safe. 

As far as OP’s prospective home, I know there were a lot of older homes in those parts and I always thought the area was kind of seedy, but it’s probably changed. I only recently learned that the old San Mateo Airport encompassed a part of that neighborhood.

I don’t live in CA anymore, but if I did come back, it wouldn’t be San Mateo. Not sure why you picked that city. I’d pick Fremont, or some place like Belmont or San Carlos. 

The only thing that area of San Mateo has going for it are the schools. Apparently, my former High School (Hillsdale High) is a model for other High Schools.

"Another Beresford area runner! 

The key for me has been running below Alameda most of the time. Hacienda is very flat and so I’ve found 24th-Hacienda-Hillsdale-Alameda to be a nice 2 mile loop. Easy to crank out a couple of those.

Another good flat run from here is around the San Mateo event center. If you cross el Camino at 25th you can go get on Saratoga and run a couple types of 1.5+ mile loops through the bay meadows area. 

It’s also fairly flat in Baywood-Aragon. Alameda is hilly to get there from here, but consider Alameda-Crystal Springs-Franklin St-Maple St for some (somewhat rolling) variety. Borel Ave connects back to Alameda on foot.

And the Hillsdale HS track is open to the public a lot of the time too.

"Yes and no! I feel like Coyote Point, and most of the Bay trail, tends to be colder and windier than any other part of San Mateo. The reason I like the park, especially on weekdays, is that it’s pretty secluded and not that many people go out there. I really like going by the cliffs and just enjoying the scenery of the Bay. Maybe it’s the nostalgia that the park holds for me, but I like just walking through it, sitting at different locations with some food and a book!

"Welcome!   

Not sure what area you're in (east like near Foster City?  Northeast like North Shoreview?).  Most of these recs are for downtown.

Coffee shops (I'm more of a tea drinker):  3 Bees Coffee (downtown), and there's a Philz and  a Blue Bottle downtown too.  

Cafe:  you didn't ask, but Foreigner Cafe (downtown) is great for breakfast and lunch.  They do serve dinner but I've never been for that. In the North Shoreview area (possibly closer to where you live?) there's [Kingston Cafe](https://www.kingston-cafe.com) \-- recently changed ownership but the Yelp reviews look good.  

Dog park:  Seal Point Park, which is off east 3rd Ave, right by the bay.  There's a big dog section and a little dog section, all dirt (no grass) but a lot of room to run.  

Restaurants:  I don't think there are any completely plant-based restaurants in San Mateo.  [Onigilly](http://www.onigilly.com/) is a take-out only restaurant downtown (near the railroad tracks) that has a lot of customizable options.  Wursthall has some nice vegan options on their mostly-meat menu.  

Trails:  if you've lived locally you probably already know about Sawyer Camp Trail, which is paved so it's not exactly hiking, but it's a beautiful location.  Within San Mateo there's Sugarloaf that's not a huge area but has some steep hills and a marvelous view.  Not too far away is Pulgas Ridge (in San Carlos) that has trails, and a big section that's off-leash for dogs.  

Farmer's Market:  there's the big one at College of San Mateo on Saturdays (year-round), and a small one on 25th that's on Tuesdays from May-October.

Belmont is also a great area, fairly close, with nice parks.  It doesn’t have a real “downtown” (neither dies FC), but it’s got nice shopping areas and remains close to San Mateo and San Carlos’ downtowns.

Redwood City is a bit further away from Foster City, but no other city has built more apartments in the recent years, so you might get a great shot at a newer place with better amenities. I think it has the best downtown on the peninsula, and two hospitals right there.  Don’t know about the schools.  The downside is distance from FC (15 minutes in good traffic, 30 with congestion) with complicated transit options, but biking is possible.  It’s also one of the more crowded cities with a lot of traffic going through.",t2_bo6u0,BruteSentiment,0,1640661088.0,0,t1_hq8cg12,hq8cg12,False,Stephanie243,t3_rb3rc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanMateo/comments/rb3rc0/pls_i_need_agents_looking_for_a_4_bed/,Pls I need agents - looking for a 4 bed,/r/SanMateo/comments/rb3rc0/pls_i_need_agents_looking_for_a_4_bed/hq8cg12/,2,r/SanMateo,0,2

(Fun Fact: to ultimately get out of Foster City by car, there are only five roads, and you have to take a bridge over water with them…it’s essentially an island.)

101 is the freeway that runs down the peninsula, and is one of the two major arteries between SF and San Jose.

"Yeah, as a near lifetime FC resident, I’m not sure where the bad fog reputation is…that’s more on the ocean side of the peninsula.

The bigger thing about FC is that it is a bit costlier than other cities, and it’s more house-focused than apartment/rental focused, though there are some in the city and nearby area.

If your work is in Foster City, I’d warn that there is no city roads to drive between the two due the the nature preserve at the slough.  You’d have to get on 101 to go between the two, which can be a bit of a hassle at times.

"Please don't - you're more likely to fall in love with Calif than not - although it may take a while.  I've lived on both coasts which is partly why I knew about the school bus thing- where are u coming from?  One thing you probably won't miss nor will the children is the need for snow suits!  They'll love being able to be outside most of the year.

Although I suspect the big shocker will be the density of housing even in the 'burgs.  House prices have shot up remarkably in the 10 or so years- and they weren't cheap to begin with.  Since land is so valuable new housing (like some of the apts. mentioned) would be a bit of a shock if you are used to a single family home with lots of private yard around.  There are homes with yards - but fewer and fewer and they're a lot smaller than the ones I remember from some areas in the east.  Then again, less yard work to do ;)

The pay off is remarkably great weather year round, no shoveling snow and lots of diversity in food and people (hope you value that).

"Rental agents aren’t as common here as they are in the east coast. Unless it’s a time saving measure, you won’t need one to do a proper search. You also don’t need one in order to sign a lease. 

For rentals, check craigslist, facebook groups (there are quite large ones devoted to Bay Area rentals), Nextdoor and Zillow rentals. 

Rather than thinking about areas to avoid, you will be more constrained by your budget and should check out each place in your price range. Out of curiosity, I checked the 4+ rentals nearby on craigslist and they’re running from $4995 to $6200.

My brother lives in Foster City. He bought a 3BR condo near Harbor Cove in 2012 for $620k. Today it’s worth close to $1.4M if not more. 

Based on my personal experience I could care less what people say about the appreciation of condos and townhomes. 

I recently purchased a 2BR condo in Las Vegas and I didn’t hesitate about it for 1 second. My purchase was made in Feb for $248k, it’s been 8 months and one of my neighbors is currently asking $350k for same size.

"You're right block-by-block, but honestly anything east of San Mateo and south of Poplar to third is old, super-dense, and majority slumlord-owned rental properties. True North Central. Any surrounding area is generally better except west of Norfolk between 3rd and Lodi. 

Walnut Creek to Pleasanton is comparable pricing/square foot and lower crime rates. Also anything Mill Valley and north, or along the coast from Pacifica to SC. You're not going to see anything much better on the bay proper, although there are some nice areas of the Oakland Hills/Rockridge/Piedmont/Montclair and up-and-coming from Castro Valley/Berkeley North areas. You can still find decent starter homes in those areas under a million.

Not to rant, but a lot of it is the slumlord aspect of the rental economy. Tons of non-permitted ADU-style rentals, multiple families in a 2 or 3 bedroom, and lack of enforcement of the existing renter-protection laws because the tenants are scared to make a fuss.

"Yes, the eucalyptus and other trees impact the roads, but in a broader sense the roads are bad on the peninsula and in San Mateo for many reasons: they are expensive to repair (due to high labor prices courtesy of the labor unions), poor budgetary management by the Department of Public Works, and decades of de-prioritization of maintenance from a funding perspective. Ironically the Bay Area generates more tax revenue than anywhere else in the country, and also has the worst roads.  Here are more details:

"If you can get service from them, Sonic is the best locally. They use a direct fiber line (not coaxial) so they may need to drill a hole through your wall, but they provide a modem free of charge. They offer gigabit for around $40/month and they support Net Neutrality, something that larger providers don't do. But they don't have TV service.

If you can't get Sonic or want TV service, look into Wave. We had them for over 5 years. They are significantly better than Spectrum/Cox/Time Warner/etc. and cheaper. They have good packages and decent customer service. They used to be a lot better when they were called ""Astound"", but then they were acquired/merged with Wave. They use the same introductory pricing model as the big providers (e.g., a promo rate that expires after 6 or 12 months) but no contracts.
