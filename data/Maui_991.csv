"Hi! I'm from the Big Island but have lived on Maui for about a year. I'd visited before, and my sister lived here for a few years, but I had never spent substantial time here.

First thing, Maui is MUCH more expensive than the Big Island. The housing here is actually ridiculous. And yes, it's harder to get away from tourists, and perma-tourists, those people who live here but are sort of, like, permanently on vacation. On BI it's pretty easy to stick to areas that are mostly residential with normal people going about their normal lives, but here almost everywhere you go will have people in ""vacation mode."" Personally, I find this exhausting.

That being said, Maui has a lot of beautiful spots and I am enjoying my time here. We've made some good friends and have had fun seeing how Maui is different than the Big Island. And it is nice to have a Whole Foods for when you need weird ingredients and a Barnes and Noble for browsing books. Plus, Maui is so much smaller that we spend a lot less time driving.

But honestly, we are here for work too and are actively applying for jobs back on the Big Island. First, it's home. Second, we are tired of paying well upwards of $2000 a month for an apartment the size of a shoebox. You practically have to promise your first born child and we will never own so much as a condo here. It feels unstable and scary and makes living off the grid in the yurt next to my Dad's house look like a great option.

Of course, none of this is Maui's fault, it's just some garbage that it's currently going through. Honestly, I think the best thing that could happen to Maui is for it to become less trendy.

"Hey!  I can recommend some great beaches that are easy to get to and have shady spots to stay cool and get out of the sun. 

I call this beach moms beach cause I take my MIL there cause it’s easy to get too unfortunately the recent flooding in Kihei has made it not as good but still a nice spot to chill. 

It’s in Kihei it’s called Mai poina beach park.  It’s right past sugar beach.  If you go towards the end there is some great spots to park and the beach is right there.  Bring some chairs and there is shady spots available.  Early morning is great here. 

Another great spot is papalaua beach park(ukumehame). There is a perfect spot to park in the middle near the pay phones and the porta potty. Look for the yellow lifeguard floaty and there is a perfect sandy entrance spot to the beach right to the right of it.  Fantastic beach to setup at. Lots of shade and pretty easy entry and exit. 

Haycraft park.  In maalaea at end of hauoli street.  If you have a handicap placard. Park in handicap spot. Get here pretty early and there is some good shady spots to setup.  

Kanaha beach park. There is some really nice spots here. Go into the last parking lot at the end of the road heading to kanaha.  Right before the bike path. Park near the handicap spot and the handicap bathroom. Walk straight from there. Fantastic beach with shade and easy entry and exit. Has bbqs available and showers.  Really good spot to just relax.  Best on weekdays. Weekends get busy. 

Dm me if you need other suggestions or better directions. 


Also highly recommend Iao park for bbqing and chilling. Great spot. 

Here is a picture of the beach at kanaha from today.

"Check out the lawn by The Mana Kai Maui / Five Palms restaurant. Lots of friendly people, and nice palms for shade.  

Look for beaches with lawns and shade, for your condition. 

If you can / would have a dog, consider adopting one that you can take on walks or to the beach. The right pet can be a massive people magnet.

You could also volunteer for your favorite local causes: that's a way to meet lots of people.

Is there a lupus support group on the island? Another potential source of connections.

Figure out what you're passionate about, and then find activities that align with your passions.

If you're not sure there's a need, pick up the phone and call someone at the organization you're interested in and ask them who you should talk to.

Maybe join an exercise class at the aquatic center. Maybe get a gig, like pettsitting? Maybe volunteer to help people on the phone.

The islands, like life itself, are full of almost unlimited opportunities to help others and thereby make our own lives richer for having done so.

"Property tax suggestions:
Primary resident condo/homeowners 0.0%,
2nd home 2.0%,
3rd  5%,
4th 20%,
5th home and up 25%. (Think Larry Ellison who maintains over 2 dozen PERSONAL residences on Lanai. This is in addition to the over 500 homes he owns in Lanai City, or Oprah who also owns dozens of homes on Maui as well)
Vacant land 0.5% (unless occupied by landowner in tent, RV, other structures or used for genuine agriculture purposes. Than 0.0%.)
Apartments bldgs, condos or homes that are certified & occupied long term rentals .5%
Timeshares hotel and vacation rental properties that the owners do not live in 5%.
On new sales- Any primary resident property with a value 300% of the county median home/condo price shall pay property tax on 1% if values above 300% of median. 
Say median home price is 1M. Your Home is worth 3M, tax would be 0.0%. If your home is 4M Your tax would be 1% of 1M =10,000usd.
This would avoid someone with a 20Musd primary resident home paying 0.0% property tax. Again, new sales only. We don’t want to tax Auntie out of her family house she grew up in just because it’s sitting on the beach and now worth 20M. These properties would still be 0.0% until a new sale occurs. We would have to phase all this in over 2-5 years so to avoid a rash of foreclosures by those that could not afford the new tax structure.
IN THE END  the simple human with ONE primary residence home, condo or land would pay NO property tax. All certified long term rentals would be .5%",t2_a0rbrh7e,Buy_Physical_Silver,0,1647548376.0,0,t1_i12blm1,i12blm1,True,InsultsRntHarassment,t3_tf29a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/tf29a1/maui_council_urged_to_raise_tax_on_second_homes/,"Maui council urged to raise tax on second homes, short-term rentals to raise money for affordables | Maui Now",/r/maui/comments/tf29a1/maui_council_urged_to_raise_tax_on_second_homes/i12blm1/,1,r/maui,0,1
"Good explanation

> one thing that pops to my mind is liability if someone gets injured on your property.

In most states that is only something like an abandoned mine shaft (they are hugely dangerous).  If the property is in natural state, and a trespasser trips on a rock, tumbles off a cliff or is hit by a falling rotting tree -- all events that occur in nature -- it is not deemed the property owner's fault.

If there is a building on the site and a trespassers walks by and a wall falls and hits him (shoddy construction) -- well, yes, that is lawsuit justification.  And how often does this happen?  It is mostly in Hawaii where property owners have to freak out about liability from people traversing their property -- that's because the Legislature caved to Hawaii's personal injury attorneys and allows  all sorts of ridiculous personal injury lawsuits.",t2_16uqw4,Markdd8,0,1647548256.0,0,t1_i12ba32,i12ba32,False,Weekly-Chocolate-805,t3_tdh9md,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/tdh9md/dont_block_emergency_access_gates_mahalo/,Don’t block emergency access gates Mahalo,/r/maui/comments/tdh9md/dont_block_emergency_access_gates_mahalo/i12ba32/,1,r/maui,0,1

"Most teachers don't stick around here and wouldn't be able to afford a house if they were half the price they are now. I've also read that teaching is hardly a ""long term"" career like it used to be. Some travel nurses are doing 80-100k per year and that is still not enough to buy a home here.

Telling a local that can afford a second home/property not to buy is ridiculous. How do you know they aren't using the rent money to put their children through nursing/teaching degrees? Or plan to give it to their children?

No matter what, Maui will always have housing issues going forward. The larger issue that needs solved is the fact that the entire financial paradigm is set up to mostly benefit the 1%. Mauinow says 70% of homes were bought by non-owners, but they won't follow up and find out how many homes were bought by investment corps. Make no mistake, the cost of housing is going up because mega corporations are buying everything. There is absolutely 0 politicians in Maui addressing that, and local and federal representatives are absolutely in servitude to this corporate syndicate.

"The weather, the cost of living including rent is rising rapidly of late so who knows when that'll plateau, depending on which part you go to the people vary massively. For instance London is not friendly or pleasant, everyone is miserable or just plain dismissive while the small country towns are very welcoming and community is valued. On the plus side taxes and deductables are deducted automatically by most employers, healthcare really is free at point of service (prescriptions require a contribution in some case) and everything is convenient in terms of delivery or collection.

"Some important quotes from the article:  

> ""About 70% of purchases in 2020 were non-owner occupied, second homes, Hawaiʻi Information Service said.""

and 

> StormoGipson added that she receives questions on out-of-state homebuyers, whose purchases have increased in recent years. A state report said 38 percent of homes last year were bought by offshore buyers, with many from Canada and California.

So assuming that nothing dramatic is happening with how they record off-shore buyers, there is still a significant percentage of local buyers who are purchasing second homes as investment properties.

"Being raised in Hawaii and have lived there for the majority of my life, one thing I understand about Hawaii: it is a place of neverending love and aloha but there is pain too.

In case of racism, treat other people the way you want to be treated, human nature is universal, no such thing as"" born  and raised"" vs "" new comers"" , I haven't run into any problem with the locals, let along its a place with huge number of mixed ethnic people, japanese.. Filipino.. korean.. chinese.. native hawaii..black..white.. its a true place that prove people of all color live together harmoniously.

Sounds to me like you just wanted to lash it out for whatever shit youve gone thru, be more specific and maybe we all can help.

And more importantly, I can do my best to make it a better place, for a short time, because I was here.

When we got here, we were blessed to meet some other malihini with common interests (dogs) and they have become our on-island ohana.

"Some people are asking why there is a gate. I looked into this a little bit, and what I gathered is as follows. Note, I’m making assumptions on a very small amount of information, so I’m likely incorrect on some parts. 
- The end of the road where everyone used to park appears to be a private parcel, based on the latest County tax maps, zone 3 sec. 8 plat. 01. Which means everyone used to park on someone’s private property before the gate was installed.
- The end of the road is called out as an access easement, so the end might be a private easement and not a County road. Therefore the owner may be within their rights to install a gate where they did. Even if they are required to maintain beach access for the public, there’s no requirement to provide vehicular access for the public.
- I saw someone mentioned there was a homeless encampment there. If the point is actually a private property, other than the issue of rubbish, one thing that pops to my mind is liability if someone gets injured on your property.

"NOT WORTH IT.

Last fall, I was running 3 cars here.

It seemed like great, easy money at first - but then, supply caught up with demand in early '22.

And I had one vehicle rear-ended in early August which was a total nightmare, as I had to search almost 3 months before I found a body shop on the island who'd even agree to take on the work of repairs.  And then, that body shop didn't color match the paint well, so it's a noticeable repair. Lastly, I'm pursuing a lost rental income claim against the at-fault party's insurer.

Honestly, I quit - because it was too much of a distraction from how I REALLY make my living, and the rental prices plummeted.

Being off island, even for only 1-2 mos, you'll have to have someone physically here managing the rentals - service & maintenance, cleaning, questions, problems, etc. - which will take a good cut of your profits.

And it opens up a personal liability for you.  If something happens while the renter is driving the vehicle and someone is injured or killed?  Get ready to be sued for most or all of what you have, financially speaking.  Rentals should always be owned by an LLC, for asset protection.

What kind of car?  High-end, luxury sports, or something uber-desirable (like a unique ride: a Jeep, 'vert or 7-8 passenger van)?  Summer demand does of course run high, but if it's just a run of the mill sedan, it might cost  you more in headaches and time than you see in profits generated. On Christmas eve, I was able to rent a car for only $25 a day, for 1.5 weeks, at one of the major rental companies at the airport.  That's how LITTLE demand there was at Xmas/NY.

And in my experience, many renters (especially of average vehicles) are not careful with a rental car - unless, it's a VERY high end vehicle and you've covered yourself in the rental terms and/or via deposit (which means NOT using Turo to run your rentals).

There is damage and wear and tear to be expected, and it may be greater than what you'd put on it.

It will almost certainly be greater than what would happen if your vehicle was secured in a garage or under a car cover in your absence.

It’s just the same problem in California as why is everybody rich wants the beach for themselves and now you have these large subdivisions or groupings of mansions in front of the most beautiful beaches and security guard everywhere watching you like you cannot go anywhere for peace anymore unless you go far into the valley. I even one day was sitting at the beach and this couple from Ireland came to talk to me cause I’m a local sitting there so they start asking me questions then they start walking behind me down the beach and I see a security guard passed me towards them the security guard and the Irish couple start walking back and as they walk back past the security guard is telling this couple that the beach is private land and believe me I told the Irish couple to stop and so did the security guard and I yelled that security guard so far away I hope he quit his job for telling people they cannot be on the beach that it’s “private”! Like the beach that I slept at I still had two jobs some nights I would have to put all my clothes into a backpack or a trash bag so my work clothes would stay dry and I would just sit up in my swim trunks in the rain at 4 o’clock in the morning waiting to go to work at 6 am.. and just to get off of this beach I had to walk a quarter of a mile all the way around this grouping of mansions. One morning I was late for work and I tried to walk through the mansions I had a security guard chasing me between the houses yelling at me telling me I’m not allowed to be there.. I said other than why are you gonna fence off an entire quarter-mile along the beach So if I want to be over here I have to walk all the way around? And she said yeah unless I live though she doesn’t even recommend I go to this beach..

"Did you see the big disclaimer at the top of that article that starts with 'EDITORS NOTE' and it is followed by a retraction?

If you follow that link and read more about the retraction, it says, in part:

'A big problem with this study was the peculiar interpretation of the results by the authors. Their results, given in log copies per mL, show that surgical masks reduced median viral emission by 27.5% and cotton masks reduced median viral emission by 80.4%. Just the fact that a reusable cotton mask was more effective than a manufactured surgical mask was news worthy by itself. Instead, the public was misled to believe the masks were totally ineffective.

It is hard to understand how the authors deemed that an 80% reduction of viral emission constitutes an “ineffective” intervention. With 80% reduction of viral emissions writ large, tens of thousands who have died of Covid-19 might be alive today. Cotton masks have never been promoted as 100% effective, not even N95 masks are. So setting that up as a rigid pass-fail metric was misleading and has endangered public health by obfuscating important degrees of efficacy.'

Now that prices are up I'm speaking to a different realtor to get me a much better price. It's my home and I'm not going to sell it cheap. I'd rather a family buy it not an investor.

"Thank you for the response.

But the streambeds pass right under Iao Valley Rd. in cement tunnels and continue on the other side toward Iao stream. These streambeds are sizeable, deeply-cut gorges. They are major drainages and large volumes of water have clearly flowed through them and emptied into Iao stream historically. So if water is no longer flowing in those deep drainages on north side of the road....Why not?

The water coming down those waterfalls is not absorbed into the soil, most of it remains on the surface flowing through deeply etched drainages and emptying into Iao Stream. I have hiked up many gullies further up Iao Valley, up to distant high waterfalls, and even when there is just a very small volume of water flowing, it always finds its way down its gully and empties into Iao stream.

If water is not reaching the stream, then that's unusual/abnormal. Maybe the water flowing down the falls was a sudden flash-flood burst and the water just hadn't reached the lower part near the road...and if I had waited a while it would have arrived.

"It’s a sign of globalization that isn’t necessarily permanent. I agree it is sad, but a common phenomenon that occurs on the mainland as well. It’s reversible, but it will take time as productive assets are developed and repatriated locally. No one — not even the most obnoxious mainlanders — wants for Maui to become just like Los Angeles. Despite the current discouraging trend, as long as we make efforts to equip Maui’s people with forward-looking skills and education, in the long run we can preserve local values. Our world for better or worse is a global collective and Maui, like many resource-rich locales, has been no doubt exploited. But this does not need to end with a tragedy of the commons.

"I think that is a serious mistake. The UK is extremely expensive, highly taxed, and worst of all a very class based society. They also made the mistake of following the populism route and in a fit of aggrieved petulance similar to our 2016 election opted out of Europe, which has not gone well for them nor will it go well in the future. It also means fewer work options if you have a UK passport as you can no longer work easily in Europe. I actually know a couple people who ended up leaving the UK, one before and one after Brexit. Both thought it was the best thing they ever did. To me going from Hawaii to the UK is leaving one sinking ship to hop on another one. 

On the topic of college, your kids will not be able to ""go to school for whatever they want,"" it doesn't work that way. Everyone in the UK has to take GCE A Level Exams in their equivalent of high school. These exams - with grades and extracurriculars - are used to determine whether your kid gets into university or not (at all) and then which university depends on their scores. So if you have kids that are very by the book, excellent students, great at taking exams, willing to put in years studying for a do or die set of high-stress exams that literally determines their entire future, then this is a good system. But if your kid is not like this, then basically they get permanently kneecapped at the age of 17 or 18.",t2_e5qrtny0,TakeMeToTheShore,0,1646845685.0,0,t1_hzzrssn,hzzrssn,False,xPhantomx482,t3_ta29ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/ta29ud/i_feel_so_sad_that_i_cannot_afford_anymore_to/,I feel so sad that I cannot afford anymore to live in the place that I was born and raised,/r/maui/comments/ta29ud/i_feel_so_sad_that_i_cannot_afford_anymore_to/hzzrssn/,15,r/maui,0,15

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"For Maui  
  
The Road to Hana can be done a few different ways. Some people drive it and really explore the stops and hikes and whatnot. One potential issue there is that some rental companies really don't want you driving the rest of the way around the back side of the island on the questionable roads and would prefer you to drive back on the same road.  
  
When we went, we did a tour company that took us to a few stops including the 7 sacred pools. It was pretty OK and this way we were both able to enjoy the sights instead of one person white-knuckling it on the drive :P We don't have any real inclination to do this again. It was cool but you can get some similar views and experiences but at the Iao Valley which is accessible from Kahului and the road north of Lahaina towards Nakalele blowhole. Also Kauai in general is very lush so if you're going to Kauai as well, it's kind of a ""take it or leave it"" on the road to Hana. For me anyway.  
  
On Maui, there's lots of free or cheap fun to be had by just going to the beach with some snorkel gear and a couple boogie boards, all of which are cheap rentals from various companies which are basically everywhere you look. Two big names are Snorkel Bob and Boss Frog. Also on the free / cheap side of things are the aforementioned Iao Valley and sunrise at Haleakala summit, which is a short 90 minute drive from Kihei and super cold.  
  
If you do wish to spend some money it all kind of depends on what you're looking for. For us we get a lot out of snorkel excursions, where they take you out on a boat to a nicer place to snorkel than is easily accessible from shore. Molokini is a popular spot and is 100% amazing and unreal. Depending on the time of year, whale watching boat tours are super worth it as well. We also like hitting up the aquarium at Maalaea while we're there. We spend some money at Maui Brewing Company for sure... We've been to a Luau (Old Lahaina Luau) and it was a good time but expensive. Kind of a one-off experience for us.  
  
Surfing Goat Dairy does a pretty cheap tour where you get to feed baby goats and try a lot of great goat cheeses.  
  
For Kauai!  
  
We've been there once and the big attraction for us was obviously Waimea Canyon. Gorgeous stuff, and free! We did the Smith Family fern grotto river boat tour which was pretty cool. Honestly we just kind of cruised around checking stuff out. Didn't spend too much on activities. Honestly after the canyon our 2 big attractions on Kauai are food related... Puka Dog in Poipu and the Saimin Dojo in Kapa'a.

"I haven't had an unforgettable restaurant meal on the beach here in a while, so if the beach is involved, I'd do a picnic situation. Maybe a smorgasbord of poke from Tamura's? Foodland in Pukalani has a new fancy foods section, or Whole Foods always has a good selection of cheese. ($$$, of course.)

Sunset walk on the beach at Kihei, followed by a nice sushi meal at Isana? I've enjoyed some nice views from their window seats in the past. 

You could also drive out toward Kaupo, snag a bottle of wine at MauiWine, park along the side of the road somewhere and enjoy the view. There's not much out there so it's pretty much BYOEverything, but the views on that side are incredible.

I do second the rec. below about Hotel Wailea. Had dinner there recently along the rail upstairs and it was gorgeous. It wasn't cheap, but the food was good, some of the best I've had on island recently.

"Hi! All good for random replies :)

We love staying in the Kihei area very near to Kamaole I and II. In that area you have a short walk to 3 very awesome beaches. This area is fairly convenient to Lahaina, Kahului, Maalaea Harbor, and Paia.  Lahaina (and Kaanapali to the north) is a popular place to stay but it's less convenient to visit the rest of the island. 

We are currently planning our next trip and looking at Aibnbs in the location I mentioned. We have done a split trip before and stayed a couple nights in Kaanapali to check out the NW portion of the island before staying the rest of the time in Kihei, which felt like coming home. 

We have stayed in Kauai before as well but only once. Happy to lend you any advice you need. We stayed in the Wailua area but the beach there is not really what you'd be looking for. Poipu is probably the place to be.
