"Hello I live pretty close by there, and have had a couple of the places numerous times so I'll give you some of my thoughts on a handful of the places there. Most of them are Taiwan style bubble tea, with a couple swinging more towards fruit based flavors and others more tea based, and some even having unique things like serving it in large jugs or making their own caramel.

Chatime and Coco are the safe bets if you want just a solid variety of decent stuff. Chatime would be better for milk teas and Coco would be better for more fruit based fresh drinks imo.

The Alley is one of my favourites and I like it for their fresh ingredient drinks, their handmade toppings such as tapioca, and their strong selection of milk tea drinks (I like the taste of tea coming out strongly in milk tea).

Xing Fu Tang, Yi Fang Fruit Tea, and Mochi Mochi all have unique takes on what they do; XFT makes their own caramel, Yi Fang focuses a lot on both fresh and syrup based fruit drinks, and Mochi Mochi serves stuff in larger jugs. Those are nice and if you can bare the line they're all good.

Outside of those differences most of them are pretty similar in my opinion, and people just go to the ones that have nicer decor or have an outstanding prior reputation. I only ever go to the Alley or XFT nowadays if I'm in need of bubble tea, and even then that's not too often for me. Any place you see a good amount of people is pretty good.

Marathon Tea is vastly different from the other bubble tea places as someone else mentioned, in that it's a Hong Kong style diner moreso than a tea place. Good milk tea and HK style lemon tea there.",t2_13y53g,1999hondaodyssey,0,1648241864.0,0,t1_i244eqf,i244eqf,True,6seed,t3_tnm44v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scarborough/comments/tnm44v/any_experts_here_on_all_the_tea/,Any experts here on all the tea?,/r/Scarborough/comments/tnm44v/any_experts_here_on_all_the_tea/i244eqf/,3,r/Scarborough,0,3

"Huh, interesting about the profitability aspect.  I do wonder about the leasing/property costs in Toronto vs Edmonton though which I suspect has a major impact on the balance sheet.

I'll admit to a dirty secret; I'm not a big fan of bubble tea, mostly because it's just so loaded with sugar.  I don't know how people can pick one up on a regular basis.

Note to OP: if you do go to a HK style cafe (cha chaan teng) like Marathon or Phoenix you should try at least once to order a ""yiin yerng"".  It's a half and half blend of strong tea and sock strainer coffee dosed with evaporated milk and sugar to your taste. I can't necessarily say that it's objectively good, but it's a unique option that's so quintessentially part of the old school cha chaan teng experience and the different types of fragrant bitterness softened by the evaporated milk plays off well with a lot of the dessert bun options, like the aforementioned pineapple bun.",t2_146u1u,stoneape314,0,1648237057.0,0,t1_i23slci,i23slci,False,6seed,t3_tnm44v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scarborough/comments/tnm44v/any_experts_here_on_all_the_tea/,Any experts here on all the tea?,/r/Scarborough/comments/tnm44v/any_experts_here_on_all_the_tea/i23slci/,2,r/Scarborough,0,2
"I don't disagree but they asked for 3 things to compare so I tried to pick three that are variations on a theme, basically milk tea.

Actually, bubble tea is just a really profitable business.  My friends own a couple franchises in Edmonton and business is steady with low costs after the initial investment and renovations.  Businesses get in trouble when they get into high competition areas (like finch/midland) without an established brand behind them or something particularly noteworthy (cheap prices or unique drinks).  I live down the road and saw a number of no-name bt places open and close in bridlewood mall.

"HK style cafes really should be in a different category than the tea places though, they're almost more like diners than bubble tea/dessert places given they offer a lot more food options.  And then i would say the Taiwanese ""traditional""-style tea and dessert places are also separate from bubble tea, again because of wider selection of offerings.

I don't have any evidence to back it up but I'd guess half the bubble-tea places are some sort of money-laundering/real estate parking operation given you don't need any substantial refit like you would for a type of operation that requires an actual functional kitchen.",t2_146u1u,stoneape314,0,1648234996.0,0,t1_i23nkx1,i23nkx1,False,6seed,t3_tnm44v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scarborough/comments/tnm44v/any_experts_here_on_all_the_tea/,Any experts here on all the tea?,/r/Scarborough/comments/tnm44v/any_experts_here_on_all_the_tea/i23nkx1/,3,r/Scarborough,0,3

"I have family that lives there and has since 2001. The building is nice. But it is starting to show its age. But it is nice still. The amenities are nice, they have 2 pools(in and out) 2 hot tubs inside with the pool. Saunas in each change room. A room with 4 billiard tables. A ping pong room. Gym, 4 BBQs, squash court, tennis court. And 2 party rooms. I know they used to have a small restaurant in the club there but I think it’s since closed. They have a small library and a study room. As I said the place is nice but it’s aging as it was built in the early 90’s. 

I’ll say this though but you know the wind out there today? How it’s gusting at like 80. Well it feels like that almost all the time in the front court. It’s like a wind tunnel is created by the building and the wind just whips around in there all day. Even on days where it seems calm out. 

Also it being close to STC is nice cuz you can walk there no problem. Plus it’s so close to the 401. It’s a decent location for where it’s at.  The condo fees are in the 7-800 range at this point so there’s that to consider as well.

Edit: cuz I reread your post I didn’t really mention the other stuff. The residents seem to be mostly Asian or Indian. Not that I care but that’s the demographic. But everyone there seems like they just keep to themselves for the most part. We haven’t seen any pests inside the building but my family is in 88 and not 68 so who knows.

"Lol. Okay, I'll be a rat asshole. Punch is a moron. But he's managed to maintain some bullshit PR stuff that still brings in people still, mostly newly arrived Sri Lankan Tamils and Tamils with poor credit. He has enough contacts in banks to push through and get mortgages approved for those people by faking T4s, providing future gauranteed rental income letters of tenants to be etc. He lives in a new infill dead-end street between Warden anf Pharmacy, North of Sheppard.  He's married with dumb spoilt kids.. Hahah.. He then rents out an empty bungalow on Wickson Trail just east of Neilson, and bangs tamil wives who come to showings with their hubbies. He's got a sense of humour though. We would be drunk after a club and call him at 3am and pretend to be husbands of the women he'd banged. We'd threaten to kill him. The first time was a laugh for us. The 2nd time he was onto us, and somehow always managed to get whomever was doing the bit that night to offer him advice on where to best pick up cougars or married women to take to his slampad.  One of my friends then told him all the action was on the internet. That got him crazy with passionate drive..  He was filled in on Ashley Madison.com etc..   And it continued.   I stopped paying attention to the conversations.. But a few of my buddies really were charmed by his imbecilic stupidity, combined with his wealth, total lack of any morals, values, empathy for others, his insanely crazy unbelievable self image along with his raging hormones, and rapist like horniness... And just kept talking to him because they were in disbelief that this idiot hadn't been killed or maimed or put into a coma by someone yet....

And yah.. If he or his people come across this and say I'm a liar, then let's head to court and you can refute my claim, and I'll bring the boys out for a little reminiscing, in front of a JP and a camera I guess.

And don't send threats. I'm from old Malvern. And I'm old. But I'll come see anyone anywhere at any time if they wanna deal with me on the assumption I'm a liar. I'm not. So, obviously you're the liar or representing the liar. So you're a weak loser. The money you'll get to come see me would be better accessed, if after you got it, you tell him to fuck off, and then go directly home. Better plan, eh! You're smelcome.

"Having a serious peanut allergy myself, I typically avoid eating at restaurants and like you contact restaurants in advance to find out their allergy policy. I find that some East Asian restaurants don't use peanut/other tree nuts.

Someone mentioned cross contamination and I can definitely relate to that. A few years ago, I was having lunch with friends at a restaurant in downtown. I warned the waitress numerous times that I have a peanut allergy and to omit peanuts from my dish. Somehow, my food was cross contaminated in the kitchen and I ended up in the ER 2 hours  later.

&#x200B;

* Lucky's Chinese restaurants has two locations in Scarborough and the last time I ordered there (2 months ago) I was told by staff they don't use peanuts.

"While people here have good things to say, and they should.   You'll be living not far from amazing views of Lake Ontario.  It is worth mentioning the history of Kingston Road leading up through that part and why it has a reputation as such.  There is a motel strip and in the past lots of drug dealing and prostitution would take place there and along Kingston Road. It would pull in certain people from the area and the high rise buildings.  You should be fine as long as you don't get tempted into partying, drinking, sex and drugs.  Drug dealers in the area (and it has improved with legalization) would be armed.  The area that often had reports of senseless/drug related shootings would be Eglinton/Markham, which is not that far.  I used to walk in the area at night, where Lawrence meets Kingston and while I never had a real problem there would be people trying to hassle or hustle me and just be out right crazy.  This was 10 years back, and the area is improving.  I have thought about living in the area.  Walking down Galloway to the lake is amazing as is the ravine that leads to Scarborough University.  And it's worth noting that that part of Scarborough used be the vacation spot for Torontonians of the past.  I think if you take a wider look, you'll find that you live in an amazing place with incredible breadth of people and enough to explore for as long as you decide to stay.  Just don't get involved with people that gave it a bad rap.  Place is so much more!

Also, unfortunately, what left a bad reputation, from the late 80's, is the Scarborough rapist, which turned out to be Bernardo.  He would scour the neighbourhoods there.  However, so many people have made the area their home  since and the community is strong and organized.

"I played music in a Catholic church, picked the hymns and guided the choir for several years. I also sang in a few church choirs, some Catholic, one did a lot of Hillsong Worship hymns

Churches have hymns that serve different purposes. Eg. in the Catholic church, there is the ""liturgical calendar"" eg. throughout the year, they sing different types of hymns. Christmas carols before and after Christmas, special hymns for Easter and Pentecost. Evangelical churches sing about their relationship with Jesus and the Holy Spirit. 

So the hymns serve specific purposes and you can't add new hymns unless they fit in in some way, eg. if you add a few fresh Christmas hymns, that's cool.

To form an interfaith Bible choir, you would need someone to lead the choir and people to attend. The person leading it, it would have to be something they are interested in. Typically church choir directors are paid for their time.

""Extra-scriptural hymns"" are the bread and butter of churches. Many Catholic hymns are based in scripture but a good chunk aren't. For example: Here I Am Lord https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZK-5v9gMTI is based on Isaiah 6:8 and 1 Samuel 3:4. Do you think this works for you as a scriptural hymn? The author has paraphrased the scripture though. 

>You see, I have PTSD and MDD and presently live in a shelter with others many of whom likewise have suffered traumas, sometimes even religious traumas. One Christian friend had witnessed sectarian violence in a civil war in Ethiopia. One female resident told me how her mother had joined a cult.

>As a result, some are wary of religion but still want to learn more about religion but in a safe environment that respects their boundaries.

I am sorry to hear about that. Maybe Metropolitan Community Church would fullfil your need for a safe environment. https://www.mcctoronto.com/about-us/

Also look into non-denominational bible study groups. 

>There was a religious program at the shelter, but because it was a bait and switch (I.e. advertised as a non-religious program and then the Pastor would shock us with an hour of preaching), even Christian residents stopped attending in anger. He also sewed further distrust in religion among residents, including some Christian ones, who'd already experienced religious traumas.

I am sorry to hear that, that sounds so inappropriate for a pastor to do that, and he knows he's speaking to people in a shelter. I'm sorry that there was not a compassionate person who respected your needs. 

>That is what initially gave me the idea of some kind of interfaith group. Due to my own limited resources , I then thought to promote an interfaith Bible choir since:

I immensely enjoyed singing in choirs, both religious and non-religious. There's something amazing about singing together, it bonds people together, it probably gets the good chemicals flowing in your brain to make you feel good about yourself.

Maybe you could separate your need for singing, from your need to explore scripture, and get your 2 needs met in 2 different groups. I suggest finding a community choir that is supportive of someone in your situation. I don't know if choirs are currently rehearsing in person though right now due to COVID.

>    A church would presumably appreciate a non-Christian who could help Christians and seekers with religious traumas connect with a church while also learning a useful stress-management skill.

You could always ask. You would need someone with a vision. Typically a church choir's energy is directed at the music for the church services. 

>I could just take courses for myself, but how would that benefit others? 

Think of it as an investment for the future. And an investment in yourself! Maybe at some point you could lead your own choir, or lead a small group of friends in song and worship. 

>Furthermore, it seems odd to me that a local church would want to teach me to sing anything but scripture.

There are many amazing hymns that don't include scripture, eg. Amazing Grace and Shine Jesus Shine. Also churches need music that suits the seasons of the year and their worship service structure.

>That said, I don't profess the Christian Faith myself and so maybe don't understand Christian culture to fully understand the dynamics at play here.

"I don't know whether you're Christian yourself, but I just thought that for missionary purposes, a church would have an interest in promoting an interfaith Bible choir as a way to encourage non-Christians to sing the Bible.

I even have some non-Church-going Christian friends  (also with little musical talent) who'd also expressed interest in this.

I've sometimes invited some of them to local churches since they didn't feel comfortable going alone. But since I felt uncomfortable with extra-scriptural hymns, I'd stopped going and so would they.

You see, I have PTSD and MDD and presently live in a shelter with others many of whom likewise have suffered traumas, sometimes even religious traumas. One Christian friend had witnessed sectarian violence in a civil war in Ethiopia. One female resident told me how her mother had joined a cult. Even in my case, my dad was molested as a choir boy in the Anglican church and my wife, now ex, had pointed a knife to her stomach threatening suicide because I refused to convert to her religion.

As a result, some are wary of religion but still want to learn more about religion but in a safe environment that respects their boundaries.

There was a religious program at the shelter, but because it was a bait and switch (I.e. advertised as a non-religious program and then the Pastor would shock us with an hour of preaching), even Christian residents stopped attending in anger. He also sewed further distrust in religion among residents, including some Christian ones, who'd already experienced religious traumas.

"Seems to have good reviews.  A storage place that's shady would not last long and make bad press.  It's a relative new one too. 

There is a new storage building that got built at Morningside just north of 401. I was shocked to see such a big building built just for that.  It says to me the market is hot for storage.  So maybe they're competing against that new one.  

The idea of storage is first month or so is an extremely good deal.  People often keep their stuff in storage for much longer than they thought. So getting you in is the most important. 

And once people get familiar or comfortable with one, they tend to go back to it.

"I used to work on my assignments at McDonald's, late at night.. Late night is the least busy and you're guaranteed to claim a booth with a plug. Tim Hortons and Starbucks is a hit or miss. They have very limited seats that are close to plugs and less table space, in comparison to a booth.. You would have to know the location and time it accordingly. There's also a dog-friendly brewery across from Home Depot, by Ellesmere/Warden.. it's fairly quiet and chill. Not many people know about that place. Their seating area is picnic benches and couches, but the couch area only has a shared coffee table. They sell beer and a few snacks, like girl scout cookies- but they don't have a food menu. Although, on certain nights they have a food truck in their parking lot. 

I definitely want to go back to finding a quiet spot with guaranteed seating close to a plug, so let me know what you've tried so far that was successful!

"Or you can look at it this way.
Like many of the layers of bureaucracy in government offices, a large percentage of uniformed police officers are not really needed for the purposes that they've convinced taxpayers they're there for.

They don't stop crime. They usually get there after the crime has occurred. They dont solve crime either, since usually non uniformed, more qualified people (detectives) do that. 

Similarly, many middle management/supervisory positions are just there because taxpayers are fleeced for those positions to exist. Those people usually put paper into a file, stamp the file. Then the file moves across 5 desks, then gets to where it's actually opened and dealt with. 

The Administration (Upper Level Management/Boards/the Chief etc.) in the Toronto Police Service, as an example, know full well that those individuals are just fillers to keep the budget bloated. Because that's in their mind constantly, there is actually an unspoken disdain for the frontline police officer. So often, when the budget is tight, or money is spent elsewhere, the uniformed officers, as part of their duties have to go contract their services outside and bring in money from elsewhere to ""pay themselves"" in a way.

So, they sit at 4 way stops near month end and ticket unlucky drivers. Really not serving and protecting is it?
Then they also create ""high risk"" places that can be mandated to have at least one or two officers present. Like LCBO stores in Scarborough. Or nightclubs where serious brawls have occurred. Or sports events. Or high school cafeterias during lunch time like they did back in the 90s in Winston Churchill and W.A.Porter....lol.
And the organization has to pay their salaries.
Which is funny. Since they're already getting paid a salary by their employer, the taxpayer, via the TPS ... Lol

So cops are essentially double dipping.

It's amazing how no one even questions that obvious issue. Cops are on a salary. If their presence is required at a high risk place to prevent something from occurring - isn't that essentially what they normally are paid to do anyways. That's what the police are here for right? To keep the public safe. The public have already paid for it. why should people pay for it again when cops are required at individual events.

Lol...

"I don’t think we do.  Not on the roads anyways.  I ride nearly every day and have done so for decades.  I’m fine with the roads out here as they are for cyclists and I don’t want further impediments or obstacles to our vehicle traffic on main roads.  Why would I?  Why would anybody but a small percentage of people out here want to?.  This isn't a high density community where the average age is younger and where the amenities or our workplaces are all close together.  You need a motor vehicle and a clear road car to fully function in this part of town.  Just drive up Morningside to see how well that has worked out for drivers when you restrict things for cars.  

I will take dedicated off road bike trails though.  Something like
-  one continuous stretch along the lakefront from the mouth of the Rouge to The Beaches would work, and 
- rip out the sidewalks on some main roads and put in some kind of wider multipurpose pathway with separation between cyclists and pedestrians with improved signage at intersections to warn drivers and  non drivers of the potential conflicts.

The Ellesmere East of Military trail is just the easiest but lazy way to spend money.  The portion under the bridge and Kingston road to Port Union would require a massive overhaul of design and study since it's already cluttered there.

"East of Military trail to old Kingston road? Doesn't need to go through Highland Creek on a dedicated lane.  That's what this discussion and topic is about.  Only the GO buses will go through there.  The rare 95 that goes East of Military Trail will need to pull over and stop at the normal bus routes so wouldn't benefit from this bus lane. 

GO bus can take normal route without a dedicated lane.  Can just go up Morningside or Conlins and go east on Sheppard to Kingston road to Durham (it's a Durham bus route) which is also rarely crowded there going through meadowvale. 

The Highland Creek portion is East of Military trail so their complaints are legit and not really needed there.

From military trail to highway 2/Kingston road there is barely any traffic. Having the separated lanes would be unnecessary. It’s like the dedicated morningside lane north of Kingston which makes no sense and just causes horrible congestion for other drivers. On Eglinton I see moronic express bus drivers camp in the middle lane instead of the fully open dedicated red bus lanes. The cops should hand out tickets for that too.,t2_5l1x9iqx,TimelyTiger,0,1637336654.0,0,t1_hl9l372,hl9l372,True,kmosdell,t3_qqcvbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scarborough/comments/qqcvbv/a_dedicated_busway_in_scarborough_may_be_exactly/,A dedicated busway in Scarborough may be exactly what the region’s transit needs.

"I mean… i see a lot of locals hyping it up here, but as a local myself, I have to be honest. Everything people seem to be pointing too as a plus is actually outside the area you referred to…. I live in the West Rouge area, but the morningside/Lawrence /orton park area is a very different pocket. Of course there are problems anywhere, but due to a very high concentration of low rental and community housing buildings, there are a lot of problems here. Check it out for yourself and do some research. Scarborough golf club and Lawrence alone has seen three shootings in about two months, just at that one corner. Danzig had a few shootings recently too. If you looked at that entire pocket, there is constantly crime. There are also of lot of drug users and people struggling with mental health in the area too, which can be totally fine, but sometimes, it leads to issues, certainly more so than other areas.That McDonald’s is a hub for issues. The building at the corner of morningside and Lawrence has constant issues, as well as the townhouses on Danzig. The schools in that immediate area tend to score very low and are very poverty stricken (Galloway road, Martin de porres, st Margaret, west hill elementary, west hill secondary). Some also have a huge turnover rate due to the high level of transient people (plus the motels in the area too). With all that being said, there are some lovely areas just outside of this particular spot in west hill (guildwood, west hill, highland creek). There are also some beautiful parks and trails close by. Lots of shopping in walking distance. I prefer to live a little further out from that pocket though…. Some people claim if you “keep to yourself you are fine”…. But if you have ever been walking to your car or on a walk doing your thing and witnessed a drive by, you will realize that that’s not always the case…",t2_eb1l6yfo,cayykayy,0,1637122012.0,0,t1_hky43f6,hky43f6,True,curiousdog12345,t3_fexjf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scarborough/comments/fexjf2/morningsidelawrence/,Morningside/Lawrence,/r/Scarborough/comments/fexjf2/morningsidelawrence/hky43f6/,1,r/Scarborough,0,1
