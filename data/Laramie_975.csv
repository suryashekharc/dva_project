"Plenty of sunlight which I love, but the winter here is obnoxious cause it won't just snow, it'll snow then melt then freeze. Constant icy roads as I'm sure you've heard with roads like I80.

Welcome to Wyoming. If you can afford to start investing in cold weather gear, now, while it's starting to go on clearance, I would highly recommend it. It's easy to get sucked into a lack of sunlight and exercise, which can lead to depression. Stay warm, stay active, stay social.

"I lived in Laramie for 3 years, moved to Cheyenne last summer when we bought a property. Last semester I made the commute to Laramie 5 days a week, down to 2 days a week this semester. There’s definitely days where you’re not getting through, the conditions on I80 and Happy Jack Rd look wildly different than the conditions in either town. Conditions up there can also change in a moment. There’s been times where I’ve checked the cameras before leaving and it looks fine but 30 minutes later the roads are white out. I drive a Ram 3500 truck with 4wd and good all terrain tires. It’s a dually which helps in the wind but makes it tougher on the snow. 

The two towns definitely feel different, Laramie is much smaller with a lot of out of staters (college students/faculty and tourists that go out to the Snowys). Cheyenne feels so much larger due to how spread out the town is. I’d say it’s a lot more blue collar. We live a little out of town which I prefer. 

Rental market is high in either town. It is hard to find a pet friendly rental in Cheyenne, especially if you don’t want an apartment. I’d say that you’re looking at around $900 for a duplex type situation and around $1,300-$1,800 for a full house. I’ve seen rent posted as high as $2,400 for larger houses. You can get lucky and find a good deal but it takes some time. In Laramie you have a lot of apartments, and what houses there are are usually priced pretty high since most of the college kids have roommates to split the cost with. I think it’s a little easier to find a pet friendly rental in Laramie than in Cheyenne. 

Definitely join the local Facebook groups for help with finding a rental. What is your budget?

">Empty semis get blown over, never passenger cars / trucks.

One thing I will say...and this is from personal experience...is that there are times when the roads are icy enough and the wind is blowing hard enough that even passenger vehicles can get blown sideways off the road.  It's a vicious combination that does happen more often than you'd think.

I recall one winter where I got stuck on a bad stretch of 80 before they closed it.  Traffic was crawling at like 15 mph and the crosswinds and ice were so bad that passenger vehicles (including my car) were literally getting blown sideways into the ditch.

"On the other side of this coin, Laramie is dry enough for long enough stretches (we only get like 11"" of water per year, and most of winter falls within our dry season) that I find snow tires to be entirely unnecessary here.

If you have FWD or AWD and a *good* set of all-seasons or ATs...and you take care of your car and aren't an idiot....you're fine.  There's no cure-all and everything has caveats.

The only people that have genuine problems are people that drive RWD cars on bald or super cheap tires, have shitty alignments and worn shocks/TREs/etc., or try to drive their lowered sports car through 3' snow drifts during the one or two bad spring storms we have.

"Laramie is great, but I would never want to do that as a regular commute. There are some side roads (someone mentioned Happy Jack, there's also 210 to the north) that may be open when the interstate is closed but do not count on them being particularly safe or passable.   


I80 in general between the cities can be sketchy half of any given year, and weather conditions are notoriously erratic compared to the forecast. You may also have calm conditions and clear roads in town, but then the high prairie itself may be sheet ice and extremely high winds. I had to head down to Denver on Friday morning for a flight and 287 was solid sheet ice with a half dozen cars off the road before 8am. I was in a 65 doing about 25-30mph in 4wd with a lot of lateral sliding and movement on 3PMSF tires with good tread.   


Even if you can telecommute when the weather is bad and the employer understands it, that's still a hell of a lot of mileage driving some not great conditions (The Buttes are pretty rough in the mornings if there's any ice left on them from overnight) with a lot of aggressive semi-truck traffic. I had a 75 mile round trip commute when I was in Denver working for Frontier Airlines, and it was pretty disheartening have to get fuel like 2-3 times a week.

"Eh, locals shoulder their fair share of the blame as well.  Lol.

Housing in Laramie is a complex situation in general.  There has always been a shortage of houses (as opposed to apartments, duplexes, etc).  Most of the new construction focuses on complexes and townhouses because that's what most college kids tend to go for; additionally, a lot of landlords make quite the profit splitting houses into separate units.  Also, some of the kids with richer parents get houses bought for them while they're here, and they end up splitting it with roommates.

Also, as time has gone on, a lot of the smaller/private landlords...who tend to be the ones with houses...have been either getting out of the market entirely, or at least handing over management to real estate/management companies (who are notoriously stricter about application criteria....credit checks, no pets allowed, etc.).

It's extremely difficult for even locals to find actual houses that aren't on a shared property anymore.  Add any kind of criteria to that (pets, fenced yard, garage, etc.) and it gets even worse and more expensive.

What little I have heard of Cheyenne isn't much better though, although it's for different reasons.

Also, you should probably know the best bet to find a place to live here is through Facebook.  Both the standard FB marketplace and local rental/real estate groups on FB are where you're going to find the most available properties.",t2_7uyw8et8,SquishyPotato117,0,1645465824.0,0,t1_hxuv7iq,hxuv7iq,False,Apart_Neck_764,t3_sxz1md,https://www.reddit.com/r/laramie/comments/sxz1md/question_about_commute_to_cheyenne/,Question about commute to Cheyenne,/r/laramie/comments/sxz1md/question_about_commute_to_cheyenne/hxuv7iq/,9,r/laramie,0,9
"Laramie is crazy expensive for housing (due to landlords snatching up houses and using them as rentals for the university).

The commute is 46-60 minutes, weather dependent (that is when it is open in the winter), further the summit can and will close in the middle of the day so it would be a disservice if you go into work then get locked down in Cheyenne when home is in Laramie.

We traditionally get crazy high wind speeds through the area just off the summit on the Cheyenne side of the slope, this Sat was gusts of 60 mph!!! I was white knuckling the drive calling myself nuts for having thought it wouldn’t be that bad to finally attend a meeting in C. that I’ve been putting off all winter… I-80 is mostly a 2 lanes on each side and you will spend lots of time behind semi trucks trying (and mostly failing) to pass each other. If you think you can speed between the towns be aware Wy state troopers are usually on the road between the two (as opposed to other cities where I have seen one cop in the last 20 YEARS…). Also, you might think the worst weather is in winter- lol, heck no! Spring is when we get the worst weather, usually over spring break in mid to late March. We have also experienced snow days in June (one of my profs three years ago now) was snowed into her ranch between the two cities so we had a snow day a week into summer semester.

You will need a car that is heavy and low profile with 4 wheel drive and space in wheel well for chains, there are times where light cars are not allowed, high profile car/trucks are not allowed, chains are mandated, and the snow in Laramie on the side streets never gets plowed so you need 4wd JUST to get out of your parking spot (as we mostly don’t have off street parking).

"I'm the wrong demographic (parent of UW students and also a long time Laramie resident) to answer your (very good) specific questions but wanted to chime in a bit.

Laramie is close enough to all kinds of outdoor recreation that you can get to within 15 - 45 minutes in either direction. If you only have a short amount of time, you can even just drive or bike) to the edge of town and get in a decent dirt trail run or tame mountain bike ride. 15 - 20 minutes will get you up to the Happy Jack area (also lots in the area surrounding it) for a challenging run, bike ride, or hike. Also lots of close camping to get away quick on the weekends. Sub in skiiing or snowshoeing for winter. 

30-45 min drive gets you up to the Snowies for a change of scenery from the Happy Jack/Vedauwoo (rock climbing) area, which offers all of that same stuff plus downhill skiing. 

I personally haven't heard anything terrible about any of the Greek life here and am grateful for the community service activities that they provide. I would think that either Greek life or the dorms would help you establish a good friend group on campus, so I don't think you can go wrong with either.

It looks like you've already gotten a couple of good responses, and I hope you get a few more.

Good luck with your decision and all of your future plans!",t2_908zlfju,Newtonsmum,0,1642790602.0,0,t1_htmsaeg,htmsaeg,True,CurrySeed,t3_s5x1po,https://www.reddit.com/r/laramie/comments/s5x1po/perspective_out_of_state_student_questions/,Perspective Out of State Student Questions…,/r/laramie/comments/s5x1po/perspective_out_of_state_student_questions/htmsaeg/,2,r/laramie,0,2
"Unfortunately, I had just moved up here from Denver and was so focused on my own issues that I wasn't paying attention to what was going on in Laramie. I was a late 20's person at the time, so a bit older than the people involved.

I moved up here to live with the man who would soon be my husband. We were part of a group of friends who were fairly recent graduates of UW, so mid to late 20's. To me, it felt a lot like I imagine it still is today for people that age - we all got together and hiked, camped, rode mountain bikes up at Happy Jack, had wine tasting parties, dinner parties, met at the bars and drank beer, went to concerts and festivals, etc. We all lived close enough together and close enough to downtown that we usually walked or rode our bikes when we got together. No one in our group was particularly political or activists.

(Side note: our group smoked a lot of cigarettes back then. Everyone quit a few years after that. Also, most of us smoked weed on occasion. None of us had kids yet.)

There was one gay couple that we hung out with, but because they were older than we were, they were sort of on the outskirts of the group. I really don't think it was because they were gay, just because they were older and in a slightly different phase of their lives. Anyway, they were very cool and in our group they were just another couple. Two of us had gay parents and it was no big deal. It may have been enough to raise eyebrows when you first mentioned it, but no one really cared. More like, ""oh, that's interesting.""

I do remember that there were media trucks everywhere and it was a genuine circus in town. At one point, I was frustrated with streets being blocked off due to the media/protests/etc and was like ""good grief, WTF is going on around here anyway??"" and a friend was incredulous at my cluelessness and said, ""haven't you heard? There was a terrible murder a few days ago.""

There was/still is a ridiculous divide in this town over the case. I've not read the books or kept up with the actual case. What I do know is that, as an ""outsider"" who'd just moved here, it made Laramie feel not very welcoming. It felt like a part of Laramie doubled down on defending it's hometown trash and instantly hated ""others"" (myself included, due to my age at the time and the fact that I'd just moved up here from Colorado) and another part of Laramie rallied against that (in a very positive, uplifting way, but it was still edgy).

I can't speak to the fairness/unfairness of the trial, sentencing, or anything related, but I do know that *no one* deserved to die like that. *No one*.

Also, I've lived in Laramie for over 20 years after moving up from Colorado. It's a nice little city in the middle of beautiful country. Recreationally, there's a lot to enjoy here, both summer and winter. Between Wyotech, UW, and the community college, Laramie has a youthful vibe and good restaurants and bars.

"There is no one way any group was treated here. Just like any community we had pockets of hate, pockets of love and outsiders lumping us together as one group of people who all thought whichever way fit their narrative. One thing I will say is that as someone who lived here, was going to UW when all of this happened, and who has watched lots of outsiders profit from making this event about either homophobia or meth, I am not sure you will get the whole story on here. I frequented the Fireside back then, and I had run ins with the two meth head murders and I think there homophobia was meth fueled. They don't represent us, and neither does Matt, who seemed like a sweet kid. We are as diverse as the people moving through our community, and so is our thought. I will say that, like all of America, it wasn't as accepting to be anything back then. I had friends who were gay and outside of our friend group they were not comfortable sharing their story, and anyone who says that they would have felt different outside of Wyoming is not being honest about the time period. Sure there were pockets of acceptance, but for the most part it was acceptable in the mainstream to be more homophobic than not. I guess the one thing that I would like to get across is that we have not seen an honest representation of what really happened yet because it has become so publicly important to the scripted political narratives of outsiders. Matt was gay and I think he died because he was gay, but from I know about the two meth heads they would have easily entered into gay activities for meth. This is the complex part that is left out, they would do anything for the drug, and they were filled with hate, so maybe this is part of the reason they hated him so much when they met him. Did Matt want meth, I don't know, honestly I wouldn't be shocked if he did, but I don't think he did meth at all. He just met two dudes who wanted to were evil in that moment, and who knows why except them. Good luck, and hopefully you show the complexity of human nature rather than the sensational narrative that we have seen thus far.",t2_awwzd3uq,RonLaramie,0,1642542638.0,0,t1_ht8fsfq,ht8fsfq,True,[deleted],t3_s77gkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/laramie/comments/s77gkz/the_laramie_project/,The Laramie project,/r/laramie/comments/s77gkz/the_laramie_project/ht8fsfq/,19,r/laramie,0,19
"1. I was a rangeland ecology major for a while, which has some pretty similar coursework. From what I’ve experienced the professors are very dedicated to what they do and are very knowledgeable. Can’t speak much about jobs/internships since I changed majors. 

2. I’m in a fraternity here. Most the frats here aren’t “frat” if you get what I mean, more so just a group of guys. Most aren’t that big either, mine is around 20 people right now. The Greek community is pretty small compared to other schools. Like nobody’s asking you what frat you’re in besides other people in Greek life. I might be biased but I would highly recommend you join somewhere. Feel free to dm me if you have any other questions about Greek life!

3. I’m an out of state student from the Midwest. Most the out of state students are either from Colorado or California but there are lots of people from the Midwest here as well. People here are extremely friendly!

4. I’m also a big outdoorsman and there are tons of students here who are also outdoorsy. Weather permitting, you can most the time. I’d recommend you come here with something with four wheel drive. Winters are pretty harsh.

"If you just avoid the roads during/right after snows you should be fine. 

But it's worth mentioning some real world examples:

* Sometimes on weekday mornings 22nd can get backed up from the top of the hill going downhill towards the middle school. Imagine you are sitting on the incline on a red light on hard pack snow that's melted and frozen a few times. Your mustang could struggle.
* If you park on the side streets near the campus, you could potentially get stuck. A lot of those older streets are crowned so the sides slant away where ice accumulates. 
* If you wish to drive out of town on I-80, it can be an intimidating experience on crappy roads with 18 wheelers cruising around you. You'll get a greater measure of confidence at least having snow tires if there's a sudden change in front of you and you need to react.

There's also limits on how much baggage/""stuff"" you can bring along on SR and LL, though I've heard it's inconsistently enforced.  Etc.

"If it's in the evening (between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M.) Tuesday through Saturday night, Snowy Range Taxi is by far your most dependable (and usually cheapest) option.

Beyond that, it's pretty hit or miss with Uber/Lyft and even moreso with Laramie Taxi.

Nothing beyond all of that, unless you're staying at the Hilton (they have a shuttle).  Saferide/Laramielink still doesn't go to the airport iirc.  If you're renting a car from Enterprise and it's before 5 P.M., sometimes they'll pick you up (but it depends on if they have an extra person on hand).

Hope that helps.

"I know that this is an older post, but thought I'd add my $0.02. 

I work at UW (and I've worked at 4 other colleges/universities). I and have been on multiple search committees at multiple institutions. 

This may not be helpful (I see that you work in HR), but re-typing out the information from your resume/CV into the HR portal is more helpful than you may think. Before I had been on a search committee, it always annoyed me when an online application asked me to re-enter everything that was already on my resume and cover. BUT, the UW HR portal is particularly annoying to use, so I appreciate being able to see the information right in the portal. It's also an opportunity to expand on information that you may have cut from your resume to save space. 

The hiring process is pretty intense from the search committee side:
You have to determine a numerical process to weed out unqualified candidates (for each required/preferred element, you assign a numerical value). 
This rubric must be approved by HR before we review a single application.
Once the search closes, you have to plug in all applicants against that rubric and give each a numerical score. 
You then determine who will be invited to an interview based on their numerical score. 
HR reviews your planned interview list. 
You have to prepare your interview questions in advance (questions must be approved by HR), and all interviewees must be asked the same base questions. You're allowed to ask additional/follow-up questions, but you must ask the base questions of each candidate. 
Depending on the job you're applying for, you may need to have a second (or third) round of interviews. 
After each round of interviews, you have to submit feedback to HR for approval before you can proceed.

"Don't. Being the most liberal city in Wyoming isn't saying much at all. You will always be on the fringe and seen as different. College is so much better if you are in a place you can thrive. I guess if you have some reason that you are certain that you will return to a small conservative town after college, maybe it's acceptable. But if you ever been to a large city you will hate it. You will have no opportunities - not just because of your orientation, but because there is nothing there. It's a school for locals and if you don't want to be in Wyoming for the rest of your life, you're not doing yourself any favors by going to a place like this. And, unless you're family owns a lot of land in Wyoming why would you want to be in Wyoming for the rest of your life? There is nothing to do at the University besides drink and watch football on Saturdays. There's so much more to this world. And you are at an age where you will quickly adapt to a big city even if it feels overwhelming now.

"So my anxiety has talked me out of most of these things but I’ve thought about it quite a bit! I’m in my early thirties too and have very few friends here. Most of what I’ve considered just puts me closer to people I could be friends with but then I’m not quite brave enough to follow through and make conversation haha. I’m not sure at what point making friends became difficult! Feel free to message me if you want to chat about Laramie more. 

Some of the things I’ve considered:
*Take a college course that’s interesting / creative
*Yoga / workout classes
*Join hiking/outdoors group (Trail Sisters) 
*Attend community events (there are tons - live music, open mic, sports events, street dances, farmers market, fundraisers, karaoke, craft fair, marathons, etc.) 
*Book club through the Public Library
*Volunteer (animal shelter, soup kitchen, food bank)
*Community Sports (if you’re into that sort of thing)

As for having a dog...good luck.  Laramie is *notoriously* difficult to rent in with pets....and even when you find places that allow it, some of them charge outrageous deposits for it.

"So firstly, renting houses is extremely difficult in Laramie even for locals.  It then gets exponentially worse if you have any requirements (fenced yard, garage, pets, etc.).

Students usually rent apartments or units in duplexes/quadplexes, or they share houses with other students who have a lease (or whose parents bought them a house here).

Also, I don't know if they've changed the rule or not, but at least until very recently, first year students were required to live in the dorms (with a few exceptions).

Anyway, like any small town, traditional ""realty"" sites like that have never been the greatest for the Laramie rental market; tbh I never even think about them.  The vast majority of rental business in Laramie is done on Facebook, on both Facebook Marketplace and on various ""Laramie Rentals"" type pages.

"Bit of a hijack here, since I can't actually speak to the OP's specific question.

I use to do Biolife here in Laramie but quit years ago for a number of reasons. 

* The payment card they gave me often had $0 money on it (aka thanks for nothing). Going back and trying to sort it out ended with ""apparently you already spent it, too bad."" Basically, it's a scam.
* They often had ""specials"" that never panned out. Too many loopholes that meant my particular appointment/donation ""didn't count"". BS.
* I finally noticed that I was feeling exhausted for days afterward (not surprising) and decided that the recovery time wasn't worth it. You also won't recover as quickly from colds/flu/recreational injuries as quickly as you would have without donating. If you're a student, watch your attention span and ability to study/retain information - it's noticeably worse after donating plasma.
* Do your own research into how this place (not just the Laramie location, but nationwide) treats their employees and you will be disgusted. In the past few years there's been a lot of attention given to Amazon not giving their employees breaks (including bathroom breaks), well...BioLife is the OG of this nonsense. It's not uncommon for staff to decide to wear adult diapers since they can't get breaks when they need them. I'm not sure if that's the case for Laramie staff, but I couldn't in good conscience continue to support this company's work culture.

Which sucks, because donating plasma is a good thing.

1) It's a fairly small town (population-wise)....with more than enough transit options to meet demand (especially in the evenings/on weekends)


2) Related to #1, the actual demand for more transit options in Laramie has never been as high as a vocal few claim it to be...and it hasn't noticeably increased over the last few years.  (I say this as someone who has worked in the industry here for 10+ years, and my wife has for almost 13.)


3) This is really only viable 4-5 months out of the year


4) It comes with its own list of problems and nuisances because in the end, people are gonna people


5) A lot of people who may, upon initial glance, be in the target demographic group for this will probably still stick to bicycling, as it has other benefits [such as exercise] and less hassle.

Of course. Like a lot of college towns Laramie has many great qualities and bad qualities. I think the great qualities outshine the bad qualities here. I've been here for a bit of time so I've had time to experience the ups and downs. But wherever you plant yourself make sure you also water yourself. The only reason why the other side of the fence is greener is because the person in charge of that small patch has been cultivating it for a long while. I've camped in Gunnison area and thought it was a really nice area but also really far away from everything. If you havent already I highly recomend visiting Laramie and spending some time here. Do the same with Gunnison.

">maybe I'm overreacting but I've seen that the last year the snow wasn't the greatest, at least until late in the season.

That's generally how our climate works here; early- to mid-winter is actually part of our dry season.  Our wet season is late winter through early summer; our major snowstorms are usually in the spring.

Considering that, some years are worse than others, and the timing varies a little bit.  Generally the mountains around here have had decent snowpacks for several years though, and until very recently our immediate area had escaped most of the drought conditions that have plagued other parts of the state.

In general, you'll find plenty of ski-able areas for several months out of the year; just a bit later than you're used to.  I've never heard of it affecting UW's ski teams too much.

"You will get the best education here at UW. I have known many people that went through the Kinesiology program and are thriving in their respective careers. The thing with WC in Gunnison is that its in the middle of nowhere. Gunnison is a beautiful area but its also tiny town. 6k people. Laramie is about 30k people, about 2 hours to Denver. We are an hour from Fort Collins and 40 minutes to Cheyenne. Laramie is a great community with lots of awesome things to do outside of classes. Laramie has many great hiking areas near by. Im sure there are great places to hike in Gunnison. Laramie may have a bigger population but the town feels a lot smaller. Also if you want to go into Atheltic Training then get involved in the Atheltic Programs at UW. Lots of oppertunities for someone like yourself at UW. There will be more opportunities for you to grow in all areas of your life in Laramie and if you get plugged into the community you will learn so much about yourself and meet some amazing people that I think truly care.   


The big difference is going to be the size of classes. UW will be a little bit bigger. You might have to work harder to get the help and recognition from your teachers. It might not be as hands on at UW. But I think for the money, as well as everything else, UW and Laramie are a better oppertunity. As far as snow dont let that stop you. Some winters we get tons of snow. Others not so much. Check out the UW Nordic Ski Team if you havent already.

"Sounds like you're in the same situation as us. We fight this battle every day in the summer. Here's are what we have to do in order to ""only"" sweat our asses off every single day in our apartment that's routinely 83+.

* Open every single window you are able & & put a cheap box fan pulling air in through it.
* Get up as early as you possibly can & get the fans pulling air in all the sliding doors/windows while it's cool. We're up no later than 6am solely for this. Close everything when the temp gets to the temp of your place or the sun starts shining in the windows.
* We have a massive swamp cooler & it's just not really enough to compete once the temps are this high.
* Block out the sun with blackout curtains, like others mentioned. The lack of clouds here will heat your place up quickly.
* Also, drink way more cold water than you think you need. Since humidity is so low here, you might not realize you're sweating because it evaporates so quickly.

Also, get a head start on things...leave windows open at night and kick your fans on early in the day so you aren't playing catchup.

"No matter where you go, you shouldn't be paying tuition as a grad student in the sciences. Your way should be paid with a teaching or research assistantship. You'll also get a modest stipend.

Usually the best way to find an assistantship is to communicate with professors whose work you find interesting to see if they have funding available. If you have a faculty member who has funding and is willing to hire you, the application becomes a formality. You can also find graduate assistantships posted online. This job board is a great place to start - people across the US post here (I found my MS position here 20 years ago! ): https://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/

You don't necessarily need previous research experience to get into grad school, but it doesn't hurt. Experience as a research technician for someone is a great way to figure out what you like and make connections. It can also be pretty fun, though it usually is short term work. The board above also has postings for technician jobs (as well as grad positions, faculty jobs, and other ecology/wildlife jobs).

If you can get some experience in a research lab during your senior year, that'd help too. Ask your professors and see if your school has a job board. It doesn't have to be directly related to what you want to do, but if you can pick up skills it always helps.

Are you aiming for a masters or phd? I seriously recommend securing funding, either way. You don't need 2-6 more years of debt. In a program like zoology, most people first find a lab that does work they're interested in that can fund their education, usually through TA or GAships.

"It was known as the ""Chang House"" named after the original owner who had it custom built. It supposedly housed an indoor pool and a motorized ceiling/skylight that could be opened to let in direct sun and weather in the pool room. I'm not sure the history behind the owner...the closest I could find that *might* be related was a UW professor of architecture named Bin Chang from Taiwan that built the first apartment building in Laramie at 815 Ivinson. That could be a sheer coincidence of last name.

My sister was loose friends with the caretaker of the place after it had fallen into disuse and he apparently helped our family out a couple of times when we were in a tight spot. I'll ask and see if she knows anymore details that aren't 90% speculation.

edit: My sister doesn't know anything about the motorized ceiling, so that's just hearsay. However there was also a large indoor koi pond and waterfall. In addition, when the property was built, there were zero electrical outlets installed on the exterior of the building, which provided the maintenance guy (who my sister confirms she was friends with) some challenges when he was assigned the task of buying thousands of dollars of Christmas lights and decorating, only to discover no way to plug them. There is also an extensive basement and possible sub-basement, making the place nearly twice as big as it looks from the outside.

Also, Chang (no first name known) was an entrepreneur that owned businesses and properties all over the world and had numerous residences in the US and multiple rental properties in Laramie.

The house was eventually sold to UW.

">If your driving over a 1000 miles a week for your job you should buy a better car, have your employer buy you a better car, find a different job or make your employer pay for the repairs.

Or reassess the way you drive, lol.  We also put about 1000 miles a week on our business vehicles (and have for well over a decade) and don't need ""constant repairs"", nor do we seem to have OP's apparently chronic problem with every shop in town.

As someone who has been involved in auto mechanics and commercial driving for nearly 20 years, I can tell you that when someone needs ""constant repairs"" and has chronic issues with *multiple* mechanics, 90% of the time it's something about the way they're driving/treating their vehicles.  A lot of people are entirely oblivious to it, but many...if not most...people are *hard* on their cars/trucks.  *Especially* if it's work-related.

Also, OP, the problem with backyard/shadetree mechanics (as they're called in our industry) is that they often do even shittier work and cut even more corners than even the shadier shops.  I can't tell you how many times a shop...or I, myself...have had to come in after the fact and fix some whack crap that Bubba Smith did in his garage.  Not to mention they have less liability, often no relevant certifications, and 99.9% of the time, no insurance.  Add in WyoTech's student policies, and there you have it.

That's not to say there aren't shadier/shitty shops, or that good shops don't have bad days/jobs.....but this whole thing is kinda suspect.

Fwiw; I'm an in-house mechanic for a local business and have worked with a lot of the shops in town over the years.

"As othera have mentioned, your chosen fields are pretty safe, tbh.

But big picture-wise, yea the state is having a rough go of it.  Energy (fossil fuels specifically) is mostly what powers our economy, and that's been going downhill for a while.

We're a landlocked state with an extremely low population, rough winters, and not a lot of financial resources to gamble/invest into infrastructure or big economic opportunities.  We primarily depend on our natural resources.

Budget cuts and restructuring have been the primary topic of discussion at the state level for many years now, and the University is often a casualty of those discussions.

"Snowy Range is by far the closest, about 30 miles from Laramie.  It is a small, laid back resort.  Nothing extreme, but they can get good snow, and they build out a little terrain park.  It is usually not too crowded.

Then your best bets are probably Steamboat and Winter Park, unless you want to head down towards Denver, then treck up I-70 to the mountains.  I tend to avoid that direction because of the crowds on the weekends.

If you get a Snowy Range season pass, and buy it early, like during the summer, you can add on 5 days to Steamboat with no blackouts for $189 extra.

Sorta. There are some developments happening but they slow and are south of town and in West Laramie mostly. The houses that are being developed are also exceeding $250k which isn't great for small families. Nothing yet on the north side of town. Demand is only going to go up unfortunately. Its a prime place to live and raise a family and good location to the mountains and Colorado. You have to be quick and make friends with the real estate agents. Its also an old town so all the shanties need to be modernized or torn down. But that costs people more money and if you can rent your 200+ year old Shanty to some semi broke college student on their parents dime for $500+ then your living large. Lots of shady landlords that take advantage of people and cause major issues here. Laramie is so transient so people are always coming and going. Rental prices are too damn high as well. Also the City of Laramie and The University of Wyoming are in a constant war of who has more control over the city and the rights of the residents. Its a shame because this city has a lot of potential but allows UW to walk all over them. The University has way too much control over this town and it needs to change like yesterday. More people need to stand up against this power struggle. The unfortunate thing is UW will always have more control over the city because their connected to the State.

He's not somebody I would personally do business with regardless of product or quality thereof.  Lol.

I just refrain from commenting on the quality of his internet because I don't have any factual knowledge of it specifically.

(Other than one random conversation in which he, presumably in his own weird way of trying to get my business...spent quite some time trying to convince me that speeds were nearly irrelevant when talking about the quality of an internet connection and what a household needs.  Which is true in *certain* aspects, and it gets complicated... but I think he's a bit out of touch with modern internet needs and demands, particularly when it comes to heavy gaming/multimedia households.

"Don't ad hom me.

1- Facts and statistics are facts and statistics, and the general population cannot, will not, and should not function beyond certain levels of caution indefinitely or forever.  There will always be at-risk people and threats to them; you of all people should know that.

2- Not that I owe you any explanation (and I'm not going to divulge details), but my wife is a public service worker who engages with hundreds of people per week.  She *also* has multiple severe medical conditions that put her at extremely high risk...many of which most people don't even have to consider a possibility until they're *at least* twice her age.  Ad homs and appeal to authority fallacies will get you nowhere with me.

3- My grandfather died of COVID.  Again, don't ad hom or appeal to authority me.

As others have mentioned, if you are at such an extreme risk, why are you shopping at downtown stores for non-essential items?  Just so you can come on Reddit and trash a business for disagreeing with governmental mandates?

Lastly, disagreeing with governmental mask mandates is not the same thing as refusing to wear them, denying others the right to wear them, or not believing in their efficacy (the same thing can be said for things like vaccines).",t2_7uyw8et8,SquishyPotato117,0,1617232654.0,0,t1_gsyxz5b,gsyxz5b,False,[deleted],t3_mhgpo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/laramie/comments/mhgpo6/the_bent_rusty_downtown_laramie/,"The Bent & Rusty, downtown Laramie",/r/laramie/comments/mhgpo6/the_bent_rusty_downtown_laramie/gsyxz5b/,2,r/laramie,0,2

">we're bouncing back up.. again..

Except we're not really.  There has been a slight uptick in cases over the last week or so, but it's far from concerning...and overall the epi curve has remained relatively stable for nearly two months.

[Source](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/) (Epi curve graph can be viewed by both county and state.)

&#x200B;

>many businesses and people just not taking this seriously at all, reason why

Do you have any empirical evidence or proof that the aforementioned slight uptick in confirmed cases is *directly* caused by local business and citizens are ""not taking it seriously""?  Have you personally interviewed all of those recently infected and taken stock of all of their situations?  Or are you just bloviating based on anecdotal evidence and your preferred narrative?

I think some of you are so used to negative news regarding COVID that you're finding it impossible to let go, even when actual data is encouraging AND the last several predicted ""huge surges"" never materialized.

We're almost at the finish line.  A temporary increase of what, 10 cases a day on average, *statewide*....that's consistently offset or outpaced by recoveries...is not cause for pessimism or alarm.  And there is zero empirical proof that the entirety, a majority, a plurality, or even any of them were directly caused by businesses or individuals ""not taking it seriously"".",t2_7uyw8et8,SquishyPotato117,0,1617229907.0,0,t1_gsyssyt,gsyssyt,False,[deleted],t3_mhgpo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/laramie/comments/mhgpo6/the_bent_rusty_downtown_laramie/,"The Bent & Rusty, downtown Laramie",/r/laramie/comments/mhgpo6/the_bent_rusty_downtown_laramie/gsyssyt/,2,r/laramie,0,2

Since then, business has continued as usual.  They have a large contigent of ardent supporters, a larger amount of people who don't care either way, and a small amount of people truly irate about them (most of whom never shopped there anyway).

">it's about time someone tried something different in Laramie

It should be noted that lots of different things like this or similar to it *have* been tried in years past.  They just fail miserably. (Not this specifically, but yea.)

Just like certain restaurants/food chains or whatever else....if Laramie doesn't have it, there's typically a reason for it.  Laramie can't sustain a lot of things that people ""want"", and in many cases has already had it and it didn't work out.

By all means, I wish any business or event (or series of events) or anything else all the success in the world here.  I just get sick of the mentality that Laramie doesn't have certain things or a certain level of diversity because no one has tried, or no one has been genius enough to think of something before, or we're all uncultured swine, or whatever else.

I moved to Wyoming from Southern California 5 years ago for my undergrad and then stayed for grad school. Wyoming is very cold and windy but we don’t get a lot of snow and it’s always sunny.

So I believe you’ll get about $1800 per month for your assistantship. Housing in Laramie is pretty cheap. You can get a decent 2 bedroom for about $800. Although some PhD students choose to buy a house because it is 5 years and often a mortgage is cheaper in Laramie.

"Hi! Congrats on law school! And here's the obligatory ""Go Pokes!"" hahaha.

For places to live- Alight (was the Verge when I lived there lol), the Pointe, and The Quarters are all geared towards students and are pet-friendly. The pointe is the biggest and nicest, the Verge is ok (it has a pool but unless you're there over summers, you won't exactly get much use out of it) and the Quarters is.... affordable. The Verge is a 2 or 3 roommate place, the Quarters and Pointe are both 4. The uni does have some housing, and you can find lots of rentals on Facebook. 

Things to do- Half Acre is great, and the Outdoor Program is such a gem! They rent all kinds of outdoors equipment and do some guided trips/ events that are really affordable for students, and a great way to pick up new skills. 

Happy Jack and Vedauwoo are super close to town and a great place for a walk with the pup. For a slightly longer drive, the Snowies have some great hikes but the road closes very early so you'll have to do them by September! Medicine Bow Peak is a must do. Curt Gowdy State Park has a hidden waterfall you can hike to/ in.

The downtown farmer's markets are super cute, but they also end early... I spent a summer in Laramie and that was when the town was the most fun imo so if you're moving early you'll get to take advantage of it.

Best spots on campus- the Williams conservatory, especially in the winter for a spot of warmth and greenery. The STEM building for quiet studying. I liked to visit all the buildings, some of them have nice study nooks that aren't as jam-packed as COE can be. In non-COVID times sometimes there's shows at the Arts & Science auditorium on campus, I caught Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats and a cool circus thing. The museum (in the building with the T-Rex in front) is pretty cool too, good for a quick study break. 

Food- Sweet Melissa's!! Late night pizza at the Crowbar. Thai Spice. The giant breakfast burritos at Prairie Rose. There's actually a ton of great places to eat and I didn't get to all of them in the 2 years I lived there haha. 

I think I've written you enough of a novel, so I'll end it there. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to reminisce lol, I hope you enjoy Laramie!

"The thing you need to understand is that no one really knows, ever, how long the roads are going to be closed. We get this question a lot, but the answer is always the same.  They ""could"" reopen by X time...but they might also not be.

Recently, under a bit of public pressure, WYDOT started providing ""estimated"" reopening times on their website when possible...but those are just that: purely estimates.

There are a number of factors that get considered: road conditions, current weather, forecasted weather, availability of maintenance equipment, personnel, priorities, etc.

Something that people also need to consider is that even if/when the roads do get reopened, that doesn't mean they're in perfect condition...and there's a lot of bottled-up traffic that starts moving.  This often leads to more accidents and further closures.  Sometimes it can take nearly a week for things to actually get back to normal after major storms like this.

According to WYDOT's site, most roads are ""estimated"" to initially reopen late this afternoon.  Others are still listed as ""unknown"".  And that is entirely subject to change.

&#x200B;

>There is no snow falling and its not sub-zero temps. C'mon WyDot get it together!

Just, no.  Let me stop you right there.  Those are far from the only factors to consider.  There are 2 to 6 foot drifts for miles in some areas, which takes a lot of equipment and manpower to clear.  Drifts like that often also require the use of rotary plows....which we have fewer of and take more time to utilize.  Additionally, the wind is far more of an issue here than likely anywhere else you've been or are used to; it contributes to continual drifting and also creates nasty low-visibility conditions, particularly on I-80.  (The wind is the primary reason for road closures throughout the winter in Southeast Wyoming. Yesterday, many plows had to stop plowing because there was zero visibility and it was too dangerous for them to continue).  Also, just because it's fine in one spot or where you're at doesn't mean it's that way for the entire stretch.

Welcome to Laramie (and Wyoming in general). But please...don't be that guy.  Things are the way they are for a reason, and that reason is not generally WYDOT being ""incompetent"".

"Things like laws and mandates tend to be hierarchical with tbe lower jurisdiction having to meet the *minimum* level of the higher jurisdiction. A good example is minimum wage the federal government says it is at a minimum 7.25, a state can set it higher, Colorado is 11. 10 and a business can have their minimum wage higher than that, think Costco.

The state covid guidelines were the minimum restrictions that had to bd in place, but literally everyone is allowed to put higher, better quality restrictions in place as they see fit. This includes county (Rec Center), city governments and businesses.

The state relaxing its mandates is not a call to say everything is great its more of a decision not to govern and to leave the choice to throw everything out the window or not up to the individual entities in the states.

My personal opinion is that while masks aren't comfortable all the time they are the last thing we should be rolling back or we risk a resurgence. But even if we don't have a resurgence it's not because of the governors plan or rollback, it will be despite of our governors failure to govern according to medical recommendations.",t2_plmbtc8,Veristitalian_,0,1615572408.0,0,t1_gqpqo67,gqpqo67,True,[deleted],t3_m3lenp,https://www.reddit.com/r/laramie/comments/m3lenp/laramie_rec_center_and_mask_mandate_march_16th/,Laramie Rec Center and Mask Mandate March 16th???,/r/laramie/comments/m3lenp/laramie_rec_center_and_mask_mandate_march_16th/gqpqo67/,2,r/laramie,0,2

"Every business and establishment can set their own rules. Based on the nature of a gym (increased respiration, shared surfaces, tighter quarters), it makes sense to keep these restrictions in place a little longer. Vaccination is dramatically affecting the ability of this virus to spread, so it’s only a matter of time before things go back to normal. FWIW, I didn’t renew my rec center membership this year because it seemed too risky.

Anecdotally, it’s worth noting that people are still making bad decisions. We run a tax program at the United Way and someone came in with a fever of 102.8 degrees the other day. We sent them away and told them they had to reschedule. This person was willing to risk everyone’s safety to do what they wanted—caution be damned.  Without proper precautions, we would have done this person’s taxes and let them sit in a gym with several other people for close to an hour! Viruses are opportunistic and spread when we let our guard down.

We’re not out of the woods yet. Be diligent and respect those that are being cautious. Gordon did not make this decision to drop the mandates based on scientific consult—he caved under political pressure and peer pressure from other states like Texas (that made decisions that weren’t based on scientific reasoning).

"You are saying two completely contradictory statements here ""I understand it is an by owner basis for the business to decide the rules"" then proceed to complain that you do not have access to certain services and have to follow the rules they have clearly set. This is a business and has the right to create their own rules and remove any services they see fit. The best thing you can do is vote with your wallet, if you do not like masks nor mask mandates, find a gym that does not have that rule. You cannot truly think that a contract for a fitness center should have had a ""Pandemic mask wearing clause"", 10 years ago when you started going to the rec center right?
