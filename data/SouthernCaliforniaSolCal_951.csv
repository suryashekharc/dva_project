"The membrane gets taken out. So there is just the tiniest fraction of what does need to be treated for destruction.
PFAS are measured in Parts per trillion. That means we are talking about limits like a sand grain in an Olympic size pool.
Obviously it would not be effective and efficient to target all that water with high energy to destruct that little amount of PFAS. Also the GAC systems generate 1000 times more Harzardeous PFAS waste than BioLargo’s AEC that needs to be stored or destructed (whatever is preferred or demanded)

"Do you know anything about the ground water in the low desert/Coachella Valley? Underneath the soil, some 25-30 feet underground is basically a lake/river of water that this desert sits on. This water is pumped into reservoirs or aquifers owned by the local Indian Tribes and the local water districts. This is a myth that the desert is hurting for water because they are not. A matter of fact golf courses, use reclaimed water to water their courses and have recently have removed large sections of their grass. So people who blame the desert for the water shortage, need to look elsewhere for the mismanagement of water resources for the state of California. For example the last big storm in Southern California. I watched Los Angeles news, as the LA river was flowing with millions and millions of gallons of water flowing into the Pacific Ocean. That water should have been flowing into reservoirs for use at construction sites, and other projects requiring water in Los Angeles County.

"Many of these responses are pure shit. I recommend visiting Riverside. It has classic socal vibe (mural laden historic downtown, fun shop fronts restaurants pedestrian mall etc), rolling hills and nice Mountain Views, and an improving and high ranked university (UCR). I go to the beach twice a month (and I live on the east side of riverside, so you could cut your drive by 20 minutes living on the west side). It takes me 55 minutes regularly, sometimes being as short as 48 minutes or as long as 1:15 to get to the beach. Disneyland is 45 minutes away. San Diego is 1.25-2 hours depending on traffic. 

The weather is nothing like Phoenix. People here are talking out of their asses. Riverside averages 94-96 degree highs in the 3 summer months, with lows around 63. Phoenix averages 108 highs wirh lows at 77. incomparable.

"When I moved here from Chicago last year a coworker who also made the move told me SoCal has the worst drivers in the country.

She wasn't wrong.

I think some of it has to do with never worrying about slick roads on a regular basis - in dry weather you can always expect the breaks to work, and you'll never side on a curve. This leads to the most concentrated amount of ""gotta be in first"" tailgating and aggressive driving I've seen in an area. 

But that theory is just part of it. I have no real understanding of why no one here seems to understand how a 4 way stop works, or how to merge when entering the freeway. It's like half the drivers are oblivious that there's others on the road, and the other half are severely overcautious because of past trauma from said oblivious drivers. 🤷‍♂️

There is no such thing as affordable in so cal.

"I chose to move to Carlsbad to be close to work but managed to get a 1 bedroom that is a 5 min walk from the beach for $2,120. You won’t expect to find much cheaper than that, and for a 2 bedroom, I’d say my area is probably a minimum of $2,500. I would avoid the super cheap apartment complexes unless you’ve seen them in person. You truly get what you pay for and you may find it annoying to see the kind of neighbors you’ll have in the cheaper apartments. A lot of families shove 3 people into a 1 bedroom or 5 people into a 2 bedroom. Also the noise levels are likely to be a lot higher.

"Do you have limitless parental funds too? 👍Rent in a inland OC apt, for a 2b2b is $2200. Cars are not a luxury item, and neither are your insurance payments. Limitless parental funds will lease you something snazzy for $1000 a month. Gas is $5 a gallon here, even if it's $1.25 back home. In the summer, using no A/C, no lights, no chargers, your electric bill will be $300. Sick of sitting in your hot apt., you head to the beach...with 3 million other overheated people. Although the beach is 15 miles away 😆, it takes you 90 minutes to get to the sand, after $20 for nonexistent parking. Margaritas on the beach is worth the $100 if you're a light drinker.

"It’s not the heat. But if I were you, and I had a choice of living in the rural IE, or in Vegas or some other larger desert city, I would move to Vegas, or anywhere really. Austin or Miami even before the IE. Reason being, Hemet and Menifee  and Perris have *nothing* of that Oceanside vibe you’re looking for. You visited one of the wealthiest and most sought-after communities that people with an L.A. salary can’t afford, and you’re trying to find the same in one of the most economically depressed regions in So Cal. Which you can barely afford. You’re not going to have a good time here because those $5/gallon are going to burn a hole in your wallet as often as you’re going to want to drive to the beach. I mean suit yourself, break down your established life and come here, where you don’t know anybody and are at the bottom rung of the financial ladder. That is never a good place to be, and So Cal is an especially bad place to be poor. I wouldn’t do it and last time I read over the responses, the most enthusiastic comments were along the lines of “You can make it work” and that should tell you something.

"Hemet isn't that bad its gotten better in the last few years, but they are lacking in above avg schools, good healthcare, and overall sense of community and civic pride/ community events is low. Cow smell is in the outskirts of town tbh, and meth is a problem in all rural areas of California not just Hemet. There will be more homeless in Hemet than in Menifee or French Valley because there is a small family shelter in Hemet, but know that homelessness is a problem throughout the IE. Oh yeah, there's also a lot of registered sex offenders in Hemet, look it up [National Sex Offender Registry Search](https://www.nsopw.gov/en/Search/Results) . The first results I found in Hemet with the address of City Hall, : *"" RESULTS 283 records from 3 jurisdictions matched your search for Address of 445 E Florida Ave, Hemet, within a distance of 3 miles. ""*

French Valley/Winchester are good/avg/safe (schools meh), and the houses are nice out there but you're pretty far from the freeway. It sounds like you'll want to take road trips/day trips, so let me tell you living close to the freeway and driving back in to the IE it makes a big different to take the 215 and exit right into Perris/MV than taking the 215 and then drive 15 more miles to get home to Hemet/Winchest/FV, its so tiring to drive. Menifee is alright, nothing to brag about and you'll likely have to drive OUT of Menifee to do most errands (shopping, hobbies, nightlife). Menifee is the runt of the litter that gets to tag along with all these other cities just mooching off their resources, if Menifee wasn't surrounded you may as well live in Desert Hot Springs cuz Menifee is boring, hot, and dry. Menifee also has bad traffic off the 215.

Moreno Valley is the biggest city you mentioned so far, it has more businesses, things to do, culture, more govt offices/resources, its closer to city of Riverside to (good night life downtown R) but MV also has neighborhoods that are pretty sketchy, rampant crime, homelessness, bad schools, etc, so you'd have to do more neighborhood specific type research for MV because it is so diverse. It also will have the worst traffic of the cities listed (Temecula close second) because of the 215/15/60/91 freeways connecting.

Yucapia is pretty rural but the houses seem affordable, and their downtown area is up and coming still small tho (also racists).

Murrieta and Temecula have the best schools of the cities listed. But don't be fooled, there's a lot of drugs and crime in Temecula and Murrieta, those cities have more money so they can keep it on the down low. T has problems with human trafficking, GTA, drugs, Murrieta cops have been considered racist by a lot of people I know. Idk how to describe Murrieta, maybe its like ""New Money old lady Karen"".

Oh, and.... don't live anywhere east of Beaumont...

> About 46% of California’s land area — or about 48 million acres — is owned by federal agencies, such as the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, according to a Chronicle analysis of local, state and federal public land ownership data. Much of the federally owned lands are for preservation, recreation and natural resources, according to a Congressional Research Service report.

> Across the U.S., four federal agencies — the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service — own the majority of federal lands. That is also true in California, though the Department of Defense owns a large share here as well.

> The Forest Service owns and manages the most land in the state with about 20 million acres — about a third of all forest land in the state — and is crucial in how California copes with wildfires, including by providing fire protection and prevention.

There is a ""farmers market"" which is a food court that has outstanding food. There is free live music on weekends. They have a fountain with a water show which easily rivals any other I've seen around the world. Possibly because its set to 50s-70s music with a lot or Sinatra and classics. Hike to Griffith Observatory. Grab a hot dog at Pinks before heading home.

I'm hesitant to suggest Mission San Juan Cap but it's a lovely place and the last time I was there (been going since I was a kid, so... 40+yrs) they had a chapel open that I've never seen before, with the indigenous paintings restored. In fact, there are at least two other missions IIRC, San Gabriel and Fernando Rey de Espana, that fall within the area you're discussing.

Institute of Contemporary Art

"My spouse worked in “The Industry” (sound editor) while we lived in Riverside where I also worked (as urban planner where, among other things,  I studied regional traffic patterns extensively, fwiw). 

     He mostly took the MetroLink train out from the Riverside station to Union station in Downtown LA where he had to change lines to get the rest of the way to Burbank. (Many studio jobs are in Burbank; also a bunch in the Culver City area which is even farther away.) This worked ok … BUT! The trains do NOT run regularly on nights, weekends & holidays. And doing POST production, many times he worked overnight shifts so reels would be ready during daytime for producers & such to review them. So, the trains didn’t always work out real well. And the drive is hideous tho it’s “only” 90 minutes long IF you’re working nights & driving opposite of rush hour. (Many many people live in “cheaper” outskirts of LA and drive in for work, meaning communtes up to 3 hours EACH WAY every day. Sadly, this is NO JOKE!!!) 

   So, IF you guys pick Riverside, plan on a MINIMUM of approx 2 hrs EACH WAY for your daily commute to Burbank (whether by car or train) and easily at least a 30-min commute (possibly 45) each way for your GF to get to school in SB. (Traffic bad in BOTH directions, E and W, between SB & Riv regions).
   It will pretty much SUCK but is considered “livable” by So Cal standards… So it just depends on what standards of “livability” are important to you guys.

    As for the city of Riverside CA itself— it’s a great town with a LOT going for it as far as places in the “Inland Empire” go, imo. A little of everything & conveniently located in the center of it all (unlike, say, Temecula was down to the south). Be sure to take your GF to a nice lunch or dinner at Las Campañas at the Mission Inn! (Great Mexican food in an incredible lush courtyard of the INSANELY GORGEOUS Mission Inn Hotel in downtown Riverside AND shockingly affordable menu too! SO win-win!!!)

    ANYHOW, as with ALL places — and especially in So Cal, every city has it’s “good” areas and “bad” ones. You’ll kinda be able to tell just by eye driving around. (Do you see lots of trash & graffiti? Bars on windows? Abandoned cars on lawns? etc? Or are lawns kept up, kids playing safely on the sidewalks, nicer cars in driveways, etc.) If you can’t look in person first, another good tip is to check the city’s police website for their crime maps. You’ll be able to get a good “general” sense of the “safer” areas (ie, higher & lower crime areas) via the maps. A reasonable proxy. I used this method for figuring out where to stay (hotel wise) my 1st trip to Chicago. Maps worked quite well for that! 

Spouse & I also did same when we leased an apartment in Oklahoma (sight unseen!) prior to setting off from Riverside on the 2-day drive when we relocated here 5 years ago. After a lifetime (over 40 yrs) in So Cal, I can’t say I miss it that much… it’s not the Golden Land of my childhood:  the population has tripled since those days but the number of roadways & freeways (& beaches, Disneyland, & all the other wonderful things that make So Cal so enjoyable) have NOT. I find I do not miss the CONSTANT traffic & CONSTANT CROWDS at all!!! (I fo miss the great restaurants & farmers markets, that’s about all!)

OK, well, sorry to ramble. Covered a lot. Didn’t mean to sound daunting— if you treat LA like NYC (i.e., it takes the same level of commitment to live here despite our wayyyy more casual rep!) you’ll be ok. It’s totally doable. Can even be fun. Definitely worth trying. Hope this helps?

"If you live in Upland or Claremont, Metrolink (regional heavy rail) becomes a viable option for getting to Burbank, downtown LA, and even Hollywood via the Red Line.

Both are also right up against the mountains, which are spectacular on a clear day. There is even a ski resort at Mount Baldy, which is 15-30 minutes from Upland, depending on where you are.

"We moved the other direction from SoCal to NC. Lived in SoCal for 30 yrs. Grew up and went to college there. We lived in San Bernardino, Riverside, Redlands, and Corona. You might want to consider moving to Corona. It’s close to the 91 toll lanes into LA and 241 toll road to Irvine. Corona to Loma Linda commute won’t be too bad, 30 mins. Rush hour into LA from Corona starts at 5am thru 10:00am in the morning and 2:30pm to 7:00pm in the evening. Carefully consider this before you move there! It’s not fun. It’s a real drag. Also, tolls are expensive and you will pay them each way. Most people live inland, so they can afford housing; the trade off is a longer commute. It’s not unusual to have 2.5 hr commute each way from Riverside to LA. My dad drove it everyday when I was growing up. Visit the area and drive your future commute over a few days during rush hr.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Some insane feedback in here and people busting your chops. LA is aGreat city and has tons to offer.

The good Chinese food is in San Gabriel Valley not Chinatown (though China town is getting better).

Definitely branch out with meet up groups. If in the entertainment industry, UCB is a comedy theater where a bunch of people learn craft and form communities. 

The Indie music scene is largely in highland park, silverlake, and echo park.

Take surf lessons before trying to surf. 

Have him ask specific questions about neighborhoods either here or to a local before coming. There are neighborhoods that are downright dangerous and others that are very safe. Same goes for figuring out your commute. Things look closer than they are in terms of drive time, what takes 40 minutes in Chicago can take an hour.

Griffith Park is great for hiking.

Cheap and delicious Japanese food is in Torrance.

Dating apps have a lot going on on them here.

I moved from the Midwest almost twenty years ago and never looked back.

For Chicago food:
There’s a portillo’s in Buena Park, a Gino’s East in Sherman oaks, and if you’re going for deep dish at an LA based spot skip Masa and go to doughbox instead.

For meeting people I’d look based on your interests hikes, music scenes, creative outlets, people are doing it all here, so that’s a good way to start.",t2_8923n,Pulsewavemodulator,0,1638696089.0,0,t1_hnb1hny,hnb1hny,True,D20_Buster,t3_r8yd2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/socal/comments/r8yd2d/my_brother_is_moving_from_chicago_to_southern/,My Brother is moving from Chicago to Southern California for a job.

Hope it’s not discouraging though. SoCal is very diverse with really good people. We never get harsh winters which is also good and the things to do all year round is almost never ending.

Other than that he's moving from one blue area to another, he should feel right at home. 🤷🏻‍♀️

https://me21.mysequire.com/recording?session_id=c2e5f283-e7ef-4037-87f4-acfc5674ab1c

This presentation had a good explanation from the CEO about how AEC functions. Super cool concept to just fully isolate the PFAS to massively reduce waste output as well as not require much energy compared to passing the water through the membrane. Being able to just run it across and only target PFAS is a huge deal for solutions providers and water treatment facility operators.

5:15 start: ""Every engineering firm that is of any substance is in the PFAS business. So why can we win? Well, because we created an innovation to compete with incumbent technologies that’s better. Better how? Well I’m going to show you that, but better in smaller environmental footprint, more economical, less waste disposal, solving some of the incumbent problems that are not being served in that market. That’s the technology in trials with 2 of the leading customers, arguably in the globe.

What we discovered, is we can take a device. We create a cell, an electromagnetic cell. We flow water through this cell, and what happens is that electromagnetic current actually creates an attraction to its opposite charge. So it turns out, we can migrate the PFAS in a flow of water across a membrane, and the membrane is a very small footprint, not through the membrane, but across. As it flows across, it is attached to the membrane like fly-paper, that’s a good analogy. The scientists? Not sure they like that (explanation), but that’s the way it works. Why is that important? It allows for selective extraction.

That means we can isolate the PFAS molecules, this ‘contaminant of the decade,’ commonly associated with non-stick coatings, sold for 35 years. Do an internet search, you’re going to be amazed if you don’t know about PFAS. It is a huge problem, and it demands an answer, and we’ve got a great answer. So why is our value proposition so significant? Lower cost, available in a wider range of water sources, and ultimately our environmental footprint is a fraction of the incumbents.”

Since this presentation, the EPA has signaled their intentions to regulate PFAS laden waste as HazMat, so the waste advantage that AEC has over incumbents should become significant in the future. What the CEO doesn’t fully specify in this specific presentation is that AEC generates 1/1000th of the waste of incumbent technologies like carbon.",t2_3uojw2gf,julian_jakobi,0,1638075034.0,0,t1_hmd4qou,hmd4qou,False,julian_jakobi,t3_r1fdm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/socal/comments/r1fdm7/californias_biolargo_discovers_how_to_purge_water/,California’s BioLargo discovers how to purge water of forever chemicals (PFAS) linked to cancer and birth defects,/r/socal/comments/r1fdm7/californias_biolargo_discovers_how_to_purge_water/hmd4qou/,1,r/socal,0,1

"I'd say it's clearly just plain ignorance.  
  
I don't personally find it inherently offensive, because it's not 100% purposefully tying to create a worse stigma. It's just ignorance. Just dumb people doing dumb things and marketing it like dumbasses. Because they are ignorant. Not because they are dumbasses.  
  
Schizophrenia is probably the most misunderstood of mental illnesses and traditionally deals with the craziest of stigmas that don't properly represent the community as a whole.  
  
No one is helping us fight for awareness on these issues. No one is spearheading a movement.  
  
Plenty of people who deal with plenty of shit, are represented. And the country is evolving to no longer misrepresent one another due to political correction. The LGBT community got it. We can too.  
  
You can't blame idiots for being idiots. At this point there needs to be a serious conversation about schizophrenia and its stigmas. Society knows very little about schizophrenia. So until we make an effort to be understood. We will always be misunderstood.  
  
It's why I want to write and produce my own reboot sequel of ""one flew over the cuckoos nest.""  
  
But this one is about a con artist who pretends to have schizophrenia to scam the government and recieve disability money, and ends up being institutionalized and fucks himself hard-core. All for money.  
  
But then it shows 100% the realities of people who do have schizophrenia. And the main character. Just like in the original film. Ends up befriending everyone and doing a ton to improve their lives in the institute.  
  
Because he realizes that while he doesn't suffer from schizophrenia. He does relate to all these people who do. And there's very little that does differentiate them from him.  
  
He's just as crazy as they are. Showing that everyone is crazy. And that you don't need to have schizophrenia to be fucking insane.  
  
Spoilers, the main character ends up being lobotomized via tons of drugs that don't help him and instead ruin his brain because he does not need them. Thus. Technically killing his true self. He is never taken seriously. And all his progress is considered a ploy to get discharged by the doctors.  
  
So the docs in the film totally abide by traditional stigmas for the illness.  
  
The main character got institutionalized because he lied and tried to pass himself off as schizophrenic using the stigmas as examples. The movie is all about the stigmas, and how society treats those stigmas.  
  
If we had it the way it should be. He'd never be institutionalized because they would have known he was lying. The fact they didn't know he was lying is because they believed the stigmas.  
  
So then a chief like character rolls in to end the main characters suffering because the dude is so broken he will never leave the hospital.  
  
The idea for the film is mostly about breaking down the barriers and stigmas that most people have on schizophrenia. The main character is the bridge that allows the normal viewers to deeply consider their feelings about an illness they really never knew much about. And relate. The doctors play the role of society. Which impose more upon those inflicted without knowing much about it.  
  
There's gonna be a nurse ratchet which again represents the whole of society that doesn't wish to understand and instead continue to feed the stigmas. Again the main character represents our own inner selves. Who recognize we wish to be better people and not condemn others for something we knew little about.

"That's a good question about why we don't take care of our poor, and you'll get a different answer depending on who you ask. Ask a for right leaning republican and they will say that it's because those poor are too lazy to become rich. Ask a socialist and they'll say it's the nature of capitalism to keep the poor desperate and devalue their labor. Ask someone in the middle and you'll hear that it's a variety of reasons, but primarily that there isn't the political willpower to do anything about it.

Ask me and I'd say that the rich don't give a fuck about the living conditions of the poor, and they hold all the power to make any change to the broken system we have now.

It's certainly not about how rich we are as a nation. Countries much poorer than us treat their poor much better than we do.

>War on the Taliban,past presidents wouldn’t stand up to their oppressive ways,and accepted their ignorances. 

This isn't really the truth of it. We trained and equipped the Taliban to fight the soviets. We then went back under Bush, without a proper plan, to remove them as it was now effecting us directly. We continually meddle in middle eastern politics and then blame other countries for the mess we left behind. We made this mess, but had no plan to clean up after ourselves.

"If they moved here they would truly be an asset, and would help make amends for what we have done both over there, and at home with migrants from Mexico recently.

Migrants are almost always net contributors to a society. It's a win win if we help these desperate people out of a desperate situation. This is what America is supposed to be about. A land of immigrants adding to the melting pot of American culture.

Frankly, we fucked it up, if we're not able to fix it we should be making it a priority to minimize the damage to the people effected by our multiple attempts to meddle with their country's politics.

"You think these refugees have any power over the level of incompetence of their army? It's easy to be born in America and point at everyone else's army and say it's crap. I'd remind you though, that our army was also over there, and also failed to beat the Taliban. Why would we expect the afghan army to do better than the most powerful military the world has ever known?

The only reason the Taliban were in power in the first place is because we went over there and trained and equipped them to fight the soviets in the 80s. The reason the Taliban are so well equipped and trained is that we equipped and trained them.

The things you love about America would be gone overnight if the Taliban took over, just as they are now gone for these Afghans. It's easy to point at the victims of a war we started and call them cowards for wanting some level of safety and stability in their lives, but you must see that we have at least some responsibility to help these people we've spent the last 40 years messing with.

No one should hold an attachment to a piece of land to the extent that they'd risk their lives and those of their families to stay there.

"Well, just to give you an idea of scale here, the 6.7 Northridge quake woke most of us up in the Inland Empire, but nothing was damaged. At the time, I had a collection of little ceramic figurines on my shelf, too. By contrast, the 7.3 Landers made a few of them fall over.

All this is to say that things are spread out. If an earthquake were to close LAX, chances are Ontario and probably John Wayne would still be open.

There is a ton of stuff to do, and if you want to go to LA or Orange County, it’s an easy drive.

There is also a train called the Pacific Surfliner that runs to LA with pretty good frequency, and some trains even continue on to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. It’s a great way to see the SoCal, it’s affordable, and you don’t have to sit in traffic.

"Native San Diegan here. For context I just moved back August 2020 after 5 grueling years in Boston. We came with no furniture and used Greyhound ground service to ship several boxes affordably... all of which ended up completely destroyed by water and dirt (theory is the route from MA > CA dragged them through a storm down in the South). 

Apartments in San Diego go FAST. If you see something you like, you'll want to get the application process started immediately. 

In Downtown/East Village area expect to pay at least $2000 for a studio apartment. The good news; a car isn't required in this part of town as plenty of things are within walking distance. We negotiated our rent (on a 2 bed 2 bath) down to $2550 (it was listed at $2700) because we only needed 1 parking spot. 

A few affordable neighborhoods off the top of my head include Mission Hills, Solana Beach (getting into North County territory), parts of La Mesa (towards East County), and University City. Ocean Beach is a cool, artsy/hippie neighborhood you two might enjoy (expect to pay at least $1800 for a small apt). Pacific Beach is fun but too expensive for what you get IMO... with many apartments lacking AC... 

In general, I recommend looking WEST of the 805 and NORTH of the 94. 

Start applying for jobs now. Companies take their sweet ass time during the hiring process then employees usually have to add 2 more weeks on before they see their first paycheck. I don't know what your savings situation is like but expect to pay first and last month's rent and a security deposit up front when you sign a lease. It's scary how fast $7500+ can disappear (if you have a pet expect to pay an additional security deposit-- ours was $1,000). That said, I work in marketing and in my own job search I've seen a decent amount of openings for people with your skillset (video editing, photography, you listed a few more in another comment); many seem to be open to remote candidates.

Gasbuddy is a good app/website to check local gas prices. Also great if you enjoy constant disappointment seeing a gallon listed at $4.30 or more. 

If you don't mind the heat (and a decent amount of traffic), consider Temecula. It's grown a LOT in the last few years yet still remains affordable. It's a little over an hour north of San Diego, home to 40+ wineries, Pechanga casino, lots of golf courses, and a cool Old Town. 

Yes it is expensive (tbf Boston rent was more costly for substantially less) but it's hard to put a price on perfect weather, friendly locals, and ample happy hour deals.",t2_76tyqrp2,jadedhelena,0,1626982282.0,0,t1_h65vqhy,h65vqhy,True,The-Cosmic-Potato,t3_op0e52,https://www.reddit.com/r/socal/comments/op0e52/advice_on_moving_to_socal/,Advice on moving to SoCal?,/r/socal/comments/op0e52/advice_on_moving_to_socal/h65vqhy/,3,r/socal,0,3

"So Cal rocks….  Most of it.  Stay out of LA country….   San Diego is where I’d live if money weren’t an issue.  Honestly in my opinion the best bang is the Temecula area….  It’s a little cheaper, great schools, safe, and the commute to San Diego/LA isn’t terrible if you have a fast pass to take the express lanes.  They’ve got a bunch of legit wineries and good local restaurants/bars.  The pandemic caused prices to shoot up due to LA/San Diego folks relocating here….

"If you want affordability in the housing/apartment price range for what you get,check out Riverside County;not as extreme weather conditions as the Hi-Dessert and surrounding cities;seems more jobs are located closer to the entertainment industry in the field that you specialize in…Hollywood and Los Angeles…but then you are paying out BIG $$$’s to live closer to the movie industry…Riverside County is way cheaper than Los Angeles/Orange Counties by far..and closer to the beaches,prices go thru the roof,just for rent and gas…if commuting doesnt bother you,as said earlier check out Riverside County cities…High Dessert is 🔥HOT🔥 most all the time…and Palm Springs is even ho🔥🔥ter and very expensive to live in…out in the San Fernando Valley might just be the area that suits you the best,still can be expensive tho…45-1 hour drive to Hollywood or Burbank studios…good luck and do the best you can while staying with friends before the BIG move…👍",t2_cka3a854,ThickNHard4u2c,0,1626963358.0,0,t1_h64nn0z,h64nn0z,True,The-Cosmic-Potato,t3_op0e52,https://www.reddit.com/r/socal/comments/op0e52/advice_on_moving_to_socal/,Advice on moving to SoCal?,/r/socal/comments/op0e52/advice_on_moving_to_socal/h64nn0z/,3,r/socal,0,3

"Get some trees, there's lots of smog, wear a mask, there's lots of smog

I'm near LA 

Look at water safety/contamination, from the tap & your local waterway/access ( beach, rivers, lakes)

Air quality, LA has thick air that changes the color of the sky

Vehicle density, cities aren't loud, cars are

Avoiding these constant stressors are worthwhile investments in your wealth (well-being+health)

Im in long beach, there's a subreddit, see the subreddits for the areas you're looking at

Consider what you value

Like I'm rooted here, I'm interested in using industry to repair what I recognize as needing repair

You're possibly not interested in doing some citywide changes idk (you do you!), weigh your values - the types of volunteering options, city features, specific laws, like Kern county ain't down with ganja growing

Drainage for monsoon season every 3-4 years

Horticultural zones & horticultural zone maps

So I'm in 10b, there's no freezing any time of year

See what temperature you & partner enjoy, it's getting toasty with the global warming, how long are you planning to stay in that horticultural zone? The temperature may change

There's like 3 seasons that are suggested, winters are getting warm
