So we rented when we lived there. Expect to pay 1000+ a month for about anything average. You have a north hill which is more by the airport. It was just called north hill 😂 which has more apartments and such smaller houses street type neighborhoods they are nice. U have the other side which is the more trailer park area people tend to say they are bad but I’d still keep my cars locked and stuff. Then there’s the valley which is more by oak park and stuff. Any house around that area will have been flooded so look out for that. The more u get out of town the bigger and nicer houses get. We lived in a flooded house that was redone. They all were of course. It was super nice for 1500 a month. 3 bed room 3 bath 2 living rooms a gas then a wood fireplace. The valley kinda ranges from nice to kinda not so good houses. Some of them still look kinda flooded out looking. I lived about 2 minutes from oak park and never had a single problem with anything nothing ever got stolen. Left keys in my car tons of times left stuff in the yard and never went up missing. When we lived on north hill on a road called skyline we had are truck broken into but they only got some change and left a electric tire pressure gauge 😂 so it was worth it. That place was closer to a trailer park. I would stay away from north hill tbh. It’s got kinda worse over the past few years. There was like a shooting right next to Lewis and Clark school once. Which was about 3 blocks from my house on skyline at the time. There’s also other small towns that’s are super close if you’re more into the country type houses like dirtroads and stuff there should be plenty of options I’d think. It’s been 7 months since we left and like 2 years the last rental. We actually had to move out of the skyline house bc the original owners wanted it back gave us 30 days we got a bigger house cheaper house payment in less then 30 days I know I said a lot but I wouldn’t want to move somewhere and not like the spot to I tried to give you some advice that I took on while living there 😂. Also if the lights yellow it’s still green they run them lights up there and suspect to do 25-30 on Broadway on Sunday that’s cruising day. Got nothing else to do took me about 3 months of driving to learn the whole town it’s got everything you need x2 or 3 like three McDonald’s 3 taco johns 3 DQs 2 Hardee’s and some other new stuff food is alright. Mall has some good Chinese food and the one by the Verizon store is my favorite. The lady is awesome she gives you free samples if you’re just waking by. And a whole bunch. There’s more and more stuff popping up fast. I’d say there’s probably new stuff but ima stop talking now I could go all day I actually miss the place a lot. I’m in North Carolina now and would rather freeze in the negative 20 weather but I wish u best of luck and if you have anymore questions feel free to ask me,t2_dkb9jrtt,Background-Rip-8298,0,1642026440.0,0,t1_hser2p6,hser2p6,False,Sujenke,t3_s1mgmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/s1mgmy/moving_to_minot_but_having_some_trouble_finding_a/,"Moving to Minot, but having some trouble finding a house…",/r/minot/comments/s1mgmy/moving_to_minot_but_having_some_trouble_finding_a/hser2p6/,2,r/minot,1,2

"MINOT — The North Dakota Supreme Court will allow a man accused of drunken driving to withdraw his guilty plea to the charge.

The court recently reversed a North Central District Court judge's refusal to suppress some evidence in the DUI case against defendant Michael Anthony Boger.

He was stopped in November 2019 by a Minot police officer who said Boger failed to have his rear license plate illuminated. Boger argued in court the officer's own body camera footage showed the license plate was actually illuminated, the Minot Daily News reported.

The officer claimed that it only looked illuminated because of the reflection of the lights from the police squad car and a nearby gas station.

Judge Doug Mattson denied Boger’s motion to suppress evidence in the case and Boger then entered a conditional guilty plea to driving under the influence, his third offense within seven years. The conditional plea was with the understanding that he would be able to withdraw his plea if the Supreme Court ruled in his favor on appeal.

The high court ruled the body camera video clearly shows that Boger’s license plate was illuminated and the officer did not have probable cause to stop the vehicle, so the evidence must be suppressed.
The case will be sent back to the district court to allow Boger to withdraw his guilty plea",t2_7nk7s,simonBarLover,0,1630022749.0,0,t1_hahr18b,hahr18b,False,simonBarLover,t3_pbyxy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/pbyxy0/why_isnt_the_cop_identified_here_and_will_he_face/,Why isn't the cop identified here and will he face false info charges?,/r/minot/comments/pbyxy0/why_isnt_the_cop_identified_here_and_will_he_face/hahr18b/,2,r/minot,0,2

"Posting from an alt account because I don't want to geographically dox my main account.

I think as far as MSU goes Pioneer hall won't resemble much of what you'd be typically worried about as far as annoying party animals go. I lived in the male dorms at 18 at UND, and that was pretty unbearable, but the upside to doing meals and being able to walk to class everyday was maybe barely worth it imo.

I went back to MSU at 23 and met my now wife (who was in the speech path program) in a night class there. She was an RA in the all-female dorm, but we attended a bunch of student functions based out of Pioneer Hall for older students and it was always very chill compared to my other college dorm experiences.

Advantages to living on campus are reduced travel times, which in winters is great because of the snow. You will actually make it to class on time and not have to worry about warming up your car, de-icing, bad roads etc.

Advantages to living off campus... You might find something cheaper. Maybe closer to restaurants,  groceries or work. More privacy depending where you are. Less rules or people watching over you.

It's really personal preference. If you can afford to rent a house or nice apartment, you might like it more.

"Avoid the wyatt. It’s small and we were super unimpressed when we toured. 

Check out the chateau apartments. Some units have a washer and dryer and others don’t so be sure to ask. If you get a unit without washer and dryer they do have laundry facilities in the building. The property is secure and is in a nice area of town and right next to a grocery store. Also the “pool” at the Wyatt is so small we asked if it was a hot tub while on the tour. Chateau has a much larger pool, and workout facilities. I always felt super safe living there. You can also request a garage that’s attached to the building so you can go straight from your garage to the secure part of the building without having to walk outside at night or in the winter.

The hills and curves are just more concerning. When I was in high school, my auto body class started one day with the teacher putting up a livestream from the local news. They just set up a camera in a curvier road after snow melted and refrozen (so hella icy). It was just people going sliding around the curve and I’d bet most of them were from the area so they knew how to drive in the snow and ice. I went spinning on the same road because I hit black ice. Obviously, being black ice, I couldn’t see it until I was suddenly backwards. Luckily, it was very late and nobody was around. 

Sometime around that same time, at least one semi jack knifed on north hill, but I think a second one did too because I definitely remember a friend calling or texting me (i graduated in 2010, so cell phones were still pretty new for teenagers to have) to tell our teacher she was probably going to miss class.

"Housing - don't be afraid to look outside of Minot. Burlington is only 10 minutes from town and the same drive distance from base. House prices drop 10K as soon as you get out of city limits. Not sure about rent but I imagine it follows the same logic. 

Wives and Winter - just make sure they've got cold weather gear. You've lived in the midwest you know how brutal it can be. Be honest. Don't sugar coat it. And have some fun when winter comes around. My wife's from Florida and hadn't seen snow before coming here. Go be kids and make a snowman or something. It helps more than you'd think. 

Jobs - There's 3-4 vet places in town if I remember correctly, but honestly I can't help you there. Good luck.

"Hi!

The housing market is moving at a pretty brisk pace right now tbh. 

My wife and I are both from north here, and I think the best way to acclimate to the area is just to be here honestly. 

There are several vet clinics close by, so hopefully a job won’t be too much of a problem for her. 

Early November isn’t bad at all, maybe starting to snow then, maybe not but definitely cooling off from summer.

"Hi there, 26f born and raised in Minot. This might be kind of long, I have a lot of feelings about this city.  


Dating is going to suck tbh. Not a lot of women are single, and a lot who are are single for a reason. You won't have a lot of luck on tinder, but maybe if you try going to bars(avoid Sports on Tap/Top unless you're just looking for a hook-up) like The O, The Dakota Lounge, and The Spot, you'll have some luck. The ones I've listed are pretty popular with a wide variety of people that go, so it's not all just dirty dancing with no real interaction.   


Winters are sometimes manageable, but we can easily get snowfall that sticks around from October to April. Don't expect it to warm up until mid May usually, and when it gets hot, it's hot. It was 100 degrees F just last weekend and now it's stormy and 60 degrees F. There's almost no spring at all, it maybe lasts like a week and then it's hot. Fall is maybe a couple weeks as well, our main season is predominantly winter. Make sure you've got at least a good shovel and winter clothes and you'll be fine.(I also hope you drive a 4 wheel drive vehicle, the roads can get pretty crappy before the plows get to them.)

As I said I was born and raised here, and there's pros and cons about smaller city life. The cons outweigh the pros for me, but if you're a white male republican who knows anything about farming and guns and hunting, you'll fit in just fine. Racism is rampant and it's even made national news, so there's that. 

Are you planning on renting an apartment right when you get here? There are many rental companies in town, I would personally avoid IMM and CPM. IRET(I think they've changed their name but you should still be able to find them if you google that) is pretty decent to work with and so is SMC. There are some homes for rent as well, but maybe look for private renters if you want to go that route, you'll get a better price. 

There's a Facebook page called Visit Minot that has pretty good basic information, and they'll usually share events that are happening in the city. I believe they have food recommendations as well, so it's pretty helpful for newcomers. If you like live music and pubs, try hitting up Ebeneezer's. It's a good time and they have friendly staff and great food!

All in all, Minot is what you make it. Take time to find events that interest you, and you'll find people that you share hobbies with. You can easily make life-long friends here! Just be yourself and don't be afraid to be social. You can message me if you want any more insight, but I think I gave you more than you need haha.",t2_5nr8hy2o,howareyanow1206,0,1623439533.0,0,t1_h1frvw0,h1frvw0,True,[deleted],t3_nx3lk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/nx3lk7/considering_moving_to_minot_at_the_end_of_the/,"Considering moving to Minot at the end of the month, what should I expect?",/r/minot/comments/nx3lk7/considering_moving_to_minot_at_the_end_of_the/h1frvw0/,4,r/minot,0,4

"Hi, 
I’ve lived in Minot since I was 4 and I can tell you I’ve seen lots of older people meet the love of their lives here dating is definitely an option I recommend going to bars that’s where you’ll meet most women your age.  

The winters can differ like this year wasn’t bad at all the winters have been getting better we didn’t get much snow at all until late December and the snow cleared up pretty quick. We usually get snow in October and it can last sometimes till April it really depends on the year our summer months are usually may, June, and July it can bleed into august but by September it’s usually fall and chilly. One thing to keep in mind it can get really windy, and the storms can be pretty bad in the summer hail is often mentioned especially this summer all over ND. But a tip for weather if you are ever driving on the highway and the weather gets bad in any way rain, snow, etc follow the truckers they know the roads better than anyone they know the right speed to go for our weather. 

I was originally born in Minnesota a big town and we actually moved onto a farm when we moved to Minot we were thirty minutes away from Minot it was a hard change even for me at the time and I was 4 Minot can get very lonely it’s also quite boring not a lot of a extra activities to do but if you are looking for people to make friends with I recommend Facebook groups, bars, online dating apps, and jobs we have people from all over up here because of the military base. 

But Minot is a very good town to settle into its relatively quiet you don’t hear about huge things happening in Minot. Also our community is very nice and almost everyone knows each other so once you start to making friends you will meet a lot more you just gotta throw yourself out there. Also even see summers are worth it Minot is surrounded by lakes you could drive to that have great cabins and all that I personally recommend sakakawea amazing lake and they have lots of fun things to do and watch.

"We moved to Minot from Portland Oregon and it was a big adjustment. There are quite a few grocery stores and a few large ones like Cashwise, Target and Walmart. 

If your a foodie there isn’t a whole heck of a lot of places to eat compared to a big city but the places listed above are all really good and pretty solid. There are also a lot of chain restaurants like Olive Garden and Applebee’s.  

If your outdoorsy I would say you probably will like Minot a lot. If not you’ll want to find other activities to keep yourself busy. There are gyms, the mall and even a paint your own pottery place in town. 

People are pretty nice although I did notice some more racism than I personally was used to. I think it’s mostly the old assholes who you should keep your eyes on. 

Things are much slower paced there. Don’t expect super quick service at a restaurant and while big stores are generally open late the smaller mom and pop shops do tend to close a little early. Not really a big deal IMO.

The winters weren’t too bad as far as I was
concerned but I know a lot of people hated it. You’ll probably have to plug your car in to prevent it from freezing but most of the time in the winter i wouldn’t even bother wearing a jacket because I’d go straight from my house to my car to where ever I was going and didn’t spend much time outside.

"Dating life is absolutely atrocious. Between the high amount of men on base and the town, you outnumber women by a significant amount. If you’re gay, it’s even worse odds of success. 

Winters range from mild (only the -30s with mild snow) to wild (-60s with windchill, multi day snow ins/blizzards). Summers are not bad, sun stays out a lonnnnng time. 

Want to adjust from a large city? Start buy dropping any expectation of “big city” convenience or life style. Shit tends to close early, things in general tend to move a bit slow, and restaurants aren’t really anything to write home about. However, Ebeneezers, Buffalo Wings and Rings, Starving Rooster, and JL Beers were all staples of mine. I am also extremely fond of the Tap Room, and of course the Lamplighter. 

Sportsman’s loft is fine for guns, Spartan is pretty decent too. Motorcycling is hit or miss each year. Definitely go to teddy roosevelt National park, and go out to Sourris national wildlife refuge for some close by hiking/meandering. I knew plenty of people that fished as well.


Minot is what you make of it. It ain’t big, but it ain’t small. You’ll find open minded and small minded people in roughly equal numbers.

"I would stay away from the property managers IRET. I think they might have changed their name recently. Probably because they have been threatened to be blacklisted by the base before. 

North Hill is as close to the base and ""in town"" as you'll get, though it's not a long drive to get to work and you have a grocery nearby on north Hill too. Property management is usually in charge of snow removal and they are pretty quick to plow. 

I lived on North Hill (Apartment) and south of 83 by Walmart (Townhouse - also a decent area) and they were slower to plow and remove snow in that section. I had to dig out my car a few times to get to work because they were taking too long.

"Hi there, Minot native here. I grew up out in the country north of town and went to school on base up until high school, but my mother was a music teacher for many years and she really enjoyed her time at McKinley(northeast side of town) and Perkett(northwest side of town). a good place to start out living would probably be on the south side of town; there is a brand new elementary school, plus you're nearby most shopping and dining options, and there are a lot of apartments in the area that are good for families with or without pets.

I personally worked for SMC property management for multiple years and rented thru them during my time with them. I am also related to the owner, and he tries to do his best for people and keep prices fair. I'd check to see what they have, or look at IRET(I believe they rebranded to a new name, not 100% sure what they call themselves now) as they have places right near the mall. I would personally avoid CPM and Bulldog Properties and 1st Minot Management. IMM seems to be decent as well, but every place will have negative reviews depending on the customer. There might be some private renters in the area as well for more private places like 4-plexes or duplexes, it's always worth it to look for one of those.

We had a mild winter this last year, but the city workers work sometimes 36 hours straight trying to get the major roads open and clear so people can get to work. Integrity Outdoor does personal/business snow removal, they always do a good and quick job. Just get a decent shovel or two for your driveway and sidewalk, and you should be good to go!(Having a 4 wheel drive vehicle doesn't hurt either lol) I hope you enjoy your time here!",t2_5nr8hy2o,howareyanow1206,0,1622648179.0,0,t1_h0bogsl,h0bogsl,True,[deleted],t3_nqe2h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/nqe2h5/move_to_minot_likely_advise_please/,Move to Minot Likely - Advise Please,/r/minot/comments/nqe2h5/move_to_minot_likely_advise_please/h0bogsl/,2,r/minot,0,2
"Howdy. Moved to Minot just about a year ago. Live in the ""north"" section of town around the airport. I would avoid the trailer park up there but everything else is really nice - soccer complex, softball fields, and grocery store plus bank. The middle school Ramstad is also really nice on that end of town.   


We're using IMM and have read some really bad things about them. I haven't had any issues. They've always been very fast to repair anything that needs done. Rent did go up from year one to year two. Seems they're the biggest ""management"" company around town.

"For kids, the West side of Minot has what's considered the better (or snobby depending on who you ask) elementary school districts. McKinley and Sunnyside are considered the low income parts of town on the East side, but the staff that work there are great which means they won't be too bad off if you lived in that part of town either.

Since you're bringing up property management companies, I'm guessing your plan is to rent? I'm not much use in this area since I've never rented from a management company in town. I guess just look at Better Business Bureau reviews and maybe Yelp to see what people think of them.

Snow removal completely depends on how fast the snow falls. If it's 20 inches over 12 weeks ata fairly consistent rate or with unseasonably warm weather, there's no issue. It's when we get dumped on with 8-12 inches in 24 hours that you need to think about leaving for your destination an hour early or just staying home. Just pay attention to the forecast and familiarize yourself with the emergency snow routes and you should be fine.",t2_etyvw,Ed_Radley,0,1622615502.0,0,t1_h0ab2ae,h0ab2ae,True,[deleted],t3_nqe2h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/nqe2h5/move_to_minot_likely_advise_please/,Move to Minot Likely - Advise Please,/r/minot/comments/nqe2h5/move_to_minot_likely_advise_please/h0ab2ae/,0,r/minot,0,0

"> If you believe the BLM movement advocates racism, looting and rioting, you obviously haven't been listening to their message. 

I have been paying very close attention and there have been numerous examples.  

In Chicago a BLM speaker advocated for looting and the Chicago BLM tried to bail arrested looters out of jail.  In Louisville the local BLM Movement threatened a Cuban restaurant owner with mafia-like extortion tactics if he didn't pay them ""protection"" money.  In Seattle BLM protestors told white people to leave their houses and surrender them to black people.  Also, the BLM movement backs Critical Race Theory which advocates racism, such as the Robin DiAngelo book which advocates a white version of ""original sin"".  Those are not isolated incidents, just the ones that made the most news.

>They want equal treatment that isn't based on their skin color. They also want to put an end to unjustified police violence that they face due to their race. 

I'm all in favor of equal treatment under the law and police reform and I agree with the literal meaning of the phrase ""black lives matter"".

Unfortunately, that's not primarily what the BLM Movement is advocating.  It's just a small part of what they are advocating and the overall message is one of racial collectivism and racial identity and advocacy of rioting and looting.

You might want to believe that the movement is a benevolent movement advocating for individualism, individual rights, and rational police reform, but unfortunately it's advocating racism and has corrupted the message and sentiment of the phrase ""black lives matter"".",t2_a1w9a,WhippersnapperUT99,0,1599836570.0,0,t1_g4tvn33,g4tvn33,False,JohnDesan,t3_iqidj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/iqidj3/minot_city_highlight_reel/,Minot City Highlight Reel,/r/minot/comments/iqidj3/minot_city_highlight_reel/g4tvn33/,-2,r/minot,0,-2

"I can understand people not wanting a special interest flag being hung up on public property.  As soon as one group gets their flag displayed, every other interest group is entitled to have their flag put up and displayed.  It isn't the government's position to decide which group gets to express speech on public property and which ones do not.

Under the First Amendment opponents of LGBTQ are entitled to have their message displayed too.  If a BLM flag is raised then a Confederate flag also needs to be approved, etc.  It's the exact same issue as having a monument erected to the Ten Commandments on public property.

The best way to deal with this is simply for no non-governmental flags to be displayed on government property.  If people want to display LGBTQ or Confederate flags or whatever they should use flag poles at their own homes or businesses.

"I think there's a lot of ""grass is greener""especially with the apparent availability of opportunities and ""big city life"", especially for young adults who want to distance from the same people, places and family that grew up around.

"My experience with Minot, has been pretty positive. I've come across some very friendly people. Then, there are ""THE OTHERS.""  THE OTHERS exist in every locale. So, no surprises there. If you're into shopping, you will find that the stores you're used to aren't here... unless you're into JC Penney.  Not too many national stores or restaurants. It's very peaceful in Minot. There is the occasional loud vehicle, train, or plane. But, you learn to tune them out and enjoy the constellation, the quiet or even the singing birds. It can be a little on the lonely side, but you should be fine on the Air Force Base. 
We do get some pretty harsh winter's. And like the poster above stated, layer your clothing and you should be fine. You want heavy duty outerwear, don't worry about trying to look attractive. You just want what will keep you warm. Insulated socks, undergarments, hats, and gloves are imperative for your winter safety here.

"Don’t worry. You’ll be fine. If you work outside you’ll need layers. Get some Under Armour and you’ll be good. Hunting and fishing is common. And winters vary tbh. Sometimes we get bad storms, but honestly Bismarck, ND always gets slammed and we are usually okay. There will be bursts where we will be very cold for 1-2 months, but besides that it’s just winter. And being from Alabama you need to learn to drive on ice if you haven’t already. If people are going slow follow suit. Even if you have 4wd it does not mean 4 wheel stop, sometimes you need an ungodly amount of time to slow down. But the people are good. Just don’t be an ass hat and people will help you out be nice. It’s also a pretty conservative town and everyone gets along just fine. ELE (everybody love everybody) exists pretty heavily as well, as there is not a lot of issues with people around here. Just be nice and people will reciprocate. Hell even the game warden I run into town is cool as shit. I honestly love it here and came here for college a few years ago, and I don’t want to leave.

"With good all-season tires and a bit of patience, it's an unideal but totally acceptable vehicle. You don't be the one blasting through the snow right after it falls because you've got some to be, but if you can wait for the roads to be cleared, you can get around. A few pointers-in warner climates they tend to water down your windshield washer fluid which means it'll freeze into a block of ice and be unusable, make sure to use it all up before fall and put some good low temperature antifreeze/wiper fluid in there without any water. Also, a bag of that really cheap generic unscented kitty litter is a necessity in your trunk for the season, if you get stuck in a small amount of really slick snowy ice, pouring that down under and in front of your tires can be super helpful. Additionally, a basic emergency kit and a blanket are a good call, if you side off the road and are waiting for even an hour in a turned-off car in the coolest parts of winter, you can legitimately be in a full emergency fast.

"Hello Everyone! 

Just found out I will be moving to Minot around the end of the year after living (being stationed) overseas for the last 3 years. I am an avid fisherman so I decided to use ND fish and games resources to compose a list of all of the available public fishing locations in the counties that encircle Ward county. Attached to the list is a description that contains a list of the most common fish in the lake and a status of its fishery. The link underneath each is a topographical map of the body of water so you may see the contours, size, and shape of the lake so that you can more effectively target fish in different seasons. I don't know if anyone fishes avidly but I figured a compiled list could be good for the community. Also, if anyone wants to make a new fishing buddy I don't know many people in Minot so it would be cool to meet someone who can teach me how to Ice fish. I hope this list helps.

"I would honestly avoid IMM if you can. I didn’t rent from them when I had pets but they constantly entered our apartment without notice and getting any maintenance done was like pulling teeth. I haven’t heard any good things from others that have rented with them either. 

I currently rent from CPM and have a Great Dane with no problems. They said they have a weight limit but I asked and they allowed him, so that may be an option for you. I paid a larger non refundable pet deposit of $500 as opposed to the $250 it was normally. I can’t find anything saying what breeds are or aren’t allowed though.

"My wife says the best bet is to befriend a local if you move here. She's a nurse and on her unit they have an unofficial ""adopt a Floridian"" program, since they have a few from there who were a little culture shocked when winter hit, haha. Also, we actually have a good number of California transplants, so no worries on finding hot sauce ;)

You get a mixed bag about going out in the cold, some people will, but most will try to stay inside. You don't get used to it in that it's still cold, but you learn to handle it just like anything in life. Heat can be expensive sometimes, especially  if it's electric, though if you live in campus I think that mitigates it. You definitely wouldn't turn your heat off in the winter, though you could bring it down while you're out of you don't mind it being chilly when you first get home. If you turned it off you would be risking a frozen pipe bursting.

Something the Floridians didn't know, you'll want to get a good ice scraper for your car before winter, I prefer something long handled with the brush on the back.

I think overall Minot folks are generally friendly, with a lot of the typical Midwestern vibe, though just like everywhere, people are people, some are good, some are jerks, and sometimes someone's just having a bad day, so what can you do?

I can say that MSU is a pretty solid choice, especially in their main line options, as far as quality of education vs cost. They really have some pretty good faculty for being such an inexpensive university.

Like you said, there isn't really much night life, but as long as you're aware going in at least you aren't being surprised. There's still stuff to do, but not as much and sometimes you have to get creative. There's also cultural and nature stuff in the state to visit, especially when it's nice out.

Coming in August or early September, the weather should still be pretty nice, so you'll have time to adjust before the cold begins at least. If you're not coming up till January for the spring semester, then get ready for a big contrast, haha.

That's all I can think of at the moment, I know I didn't answer every question you posted. If you have any other questions just ask and I will answer what I can. I wish for you the best in whatever you choose and in your future whatever that entails. Also, if you did move up here and need any help, my wife and I would be willing, as I'm sure will lots of pale around here.

"Congratulations! We're not originally from here but have now lived in ND twice. The winters truly do suck and last forever. I don't identify with the common political sphere in my area and I think we're the only family in our town that doesn't go to church regularly, so I definitely feel like an outsider in those aspects.

"Pretty much born and raised in Minot, and have taught in the school system for 12 years.  

Minot is exactly who you are.  There are few distractions, miles of open prairie, kind (if xenophobic, mildly racist) people, and quiet in intimidating amounts.

The schools are solid, especially elementary.  Teachers work hard and are paid decent (I say this only from personal experience).  The job carries some respect, here, still, so your kids will be in good hands.  

Check out the Southeast part of town, if you're looking for apartments.  Some massive complexes there, and they overbuilt during the oil boom so you could find a decent apartment pretty easily.  However, you could probably just as easily find a house to rent.  Make sure you don't rent anything sight unseen, as many houses in the valley flooded in 2011 and were flipped, but what looks pretty in pictures might have some rough shit going on behind the walls.

Honestly, I love it here.  It gives me time to think, it's a great place to raise kids (I have a 10-month-old, so still in the raising process), and there's plenty to do if you so desire.  Just prepare for a faaaaaaar more conservative populace than you're maybe used to.  Pretty old-fashioned, but not like horse-and-buggy...more like meat-and-potatoes-and-homophobia.

"Well, the whole town is kind of off the beaten path. It's a small town, but the general public is kind. Some neighboring towns (2-4 hrs away) are known for their methheads, but if you don't go looking for it you probably would never notice. They've done a decent job with keeping public areas maintained, and there are nice parks. The fresh produce selection is pretty lacking in the grocery stores, because most goods have to be shipped in from Minnesota, but otherwise the selection is fairly normal. If you can't find something in town, then you'll have to drive to Bismarck (1.5-2hrs away) or Fargo (3.5-4 hrs away), or order it online. There are a lot of small families there, especially on the Air Force base, and I hear the schools are decent, but I don't have kids so I can't say for sure. Lots of churches, if that's your thing, and I have found a mix of both amazing people and not so amazing people. There are several small public lakes, lots of fishing, good outdoor sports opportunities.

Prepare for cold. In winter highways sometimes are shut down completely due to high winds and snow, and with winds often at 30mph with 50-70mph gusts, you'll need some good warm weather gear. But the shops are aware of this because they have a lot of people from all over coming in and out, so they are generally stocked well with good coats and the like. Consider putting a block heater in your car before moving so you can be ready for winter.

"Minot is... well I wish you surround yourself with good friends and find your niche. I’ve been here (due to the Air Force as well) for two years and I think this place still sucks.

You’ll get tired of the 3-4 decent restaurants and then crave the food and service you have at your home states. Nothing compares to what this town offers. It sucks. If you’ll be here for a while, maybe having a remote start will good for you to look into. We don’t have them, but some people invest in Winter tires. Our all weather tires get us through winter just fine. The housing market is a joke; way over priced for homes that look like...renting is tricky. I’d go off base if you can afford it, but on-base housing is nice. You’ll be within distance to the commissary and BX. Also, getting to work for your husband won’t be bad of a commute on those winter days. You will get people telling you that it’s what you make of it, but when you try very hard and still hate it—know that it’s still very valid to feel that way.

">Move on base ASAP base housing is much much better than off base IMO. I was there from 01-07.

Respectfully have to disagree, and you were here 13 years ago... a lot has changed. I got here in 2014 and was put in the dorms (on base). In 2016 I moved into a ""ready"" house in base housing. The dishwasher didn't work (and wasn't fixed for another month), the door going from the house to the (uninsulated) garage had a gap all along the bottom big enough to fit a pencil through, the sliding screen door for the back door contantly popped off the rails, dakrat holes everywhere in the yard, most doors in the house wouldn't fully shut, there used to be a ceiling light in the main living room (I know because there was a plastic cover in it's place, but I was told by Balfour Beatty that I would need to **pay out of my own pocket** for a ""licensed electrician"" to come out and install it (screw that noise), and they took married rate BAH despite me being single, and took every penny of it, every month (I'm now in an apartment in town, and even though I have to pay rent, electricity, and more fuel for my car, I'm still saving money). In March of last year (while I was deployed), they sent an email saying my roommate and I needed to be out of the house by 1 July because the whole section of base housing would be torn down. After pulling teeth with them, my roommate finally got them to extend the moveout date until shortly after I got back. During our moveout inspection I had to pay an extra fee due to the satellite dish that a previous roommate had installed in the yard, and that the satellite company wouldn't come to pull out, and that Balfour Beatty knew wouldn't uninstall it. Fast forward to today, and the whole section of base housing is still standing, but empty. I drive by the house every so often, and less than a month ago, they finally got around to ripping out the chain link fence in the backyard.",t2_ru8cifx,JustHanginInThere,0,1586108611.0,0,t1_fmifmp9,fmifmp9,False,nikkiimyers,t3_fv0b2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/fv0b2m/here_i_come_minot_lol/,Here I come Minot.. lol,/r/minot/comments/fv0b2m/here_i_come_minot_lol/fmifmp9/,3,r/minot,0,3

"Follow the, ""Things to do in Minot,"" page, if you have Facebook. Minot has many events for most things, pending of course, on your taste. Now unfortunately, most events are garnered towards bars, and individuals who are over 21, so there's that. Minot gets the State Fair, which tends to bring in more popular country and rock acts, for about a week. 

Plenty of lakes and cabin sights, within an hour +/- drive. 2 movie theaters, plus live theatre at 3 different venues. If you're a fan of local shopping, downtown is where it's at. 

Minot has 2 semi-pro sports teams, in baseball and hockey. The zoo is great for an afternoon. Waterpark in Roosevelt park. Other great parks include; Oak, Polaris, Bison Plant, Black Butte, Radio City, and the walking path by Souris Valley Golf Course (Can't remember that name) 

There is a mall. Restaurants, well, Ebz is most popular. Starving Rooster, SRB, Mi Mexico, also quite populer. There is not much for 5star establishments. Mainly American, Asian, and Mexican. 

I dont kbow much for living on base, but I do know that taxes in Minot are pretty ridiculous. I would recommend, that if you wish to buy a house, get one in a small town near buy, but that is just me. 

If you look, chances are you will find the friends you want here. You will probably meet a**holes in this town. Not to offend anyone, but there are many of those.

"From a visitor (every year or two):
 - Oak Park is a surprisingly nice place to walk.  And I haven't even visited it in the summer yet.  (Stumbled across it in December.)  It has a spectacular Christmas display each year.
 - The Scandinavian heritage park is quite pretty and nice to walk around.
 - Souris River Brewing makes some pretty good craft beer and has some really good food, too.  I go most times I'm in town.
 - There are a couple of competent local barbecue joints now (besides Dickey's which is a chain but not bad)
 - Mi Mexico is much-more-than-competent Mexican food
 - JL Beers is really good.  I've not been to the Minot location yet but it's really good in Fargo.  Intend to try it in MOT.
 - Have passports?  Once life is more normal again, Regina, Saskatchewan is only 4 hours away (north via US 52).  Lots of great restaurants, CHL junior hockey (Regina Pats) (just one notch below NHL) and CFL (Saskatchewan Roughriders).  If you've never experienced the CFL, it's quite different from the NFL but, I think, in good ways (bigger field, more motion, better timing rules).  Remember, your dollar is worth about $1.35 Cdn.

 - outdoor activities: the Scandinavian heritage park just off Broadway south of downtown is surprisingly interesting.  A nice place to take your family for a walk.  The church is amazing.  It's closed in winter but you can at least have a good look at it from the outside.  // There's a really nice walking path around Oak Park along an oxbow of the river.  It's a decent length of walk and fully paved.  At Christmastime, there's a really nice light display here too but you missed it.

There is a third barbecue joint - Monty's - but he's not open Sunday or Monday so I might have to make him my lunch stop Tuesday before I leave for home, if I'm going to try him.

I am using the same screen you are now and I know what you mean, but I don't tend to push for ultra.

The catch? They only have two days to put it together!

"Well welcome first of all.  If you check the sidebar you will find a bunch of links to the main property management companies in town here.  They are by no means the only places to rent from but they are probably the largest.  Rent here is pretty high from my experience.  We experienced a flood in 2001 and then the oil boom up here which further screwed up the housing market.  There are tons of places to rent here but most of them are over price IMHO.  

Employment....you will find work.  I don't know much about the field you are in right now but if you are willing to work you won't have an issue finding a job here.  Check out jobsnd.com for a place to start and get an idea of whats out here.  

I am guessing the biggest difference will be the cold.  Winters here are pretty harsh.  Make sure you have proper cold weather gear.  Dress in layers for the winter.  Decent tires on your vehicle and a emergency kit at all times.  Speaking of which.  There is no public transportation here to speak of.  We have taxi services and Lyft now though.  

PM me if you have anything specific you wanna ask or post it in here.  I will answer as best I can.",t2_4bw5b,Shayughul,0,1555381412.0,0,t1_ekzon58,ekzon58,True,[deleted],t3_bdo4ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/bdo4ki/help_for_a_soontobe_msu_student/,Help for a soon-to-be MSU student?,/r/minot/comments/bdo4ki/help_for_a_soontobe_msu_student/ekzon58/,3,r/minot,0,3
