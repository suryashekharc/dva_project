Like many people said, go to/from the office you’re working at and your hotel via car and it’s fine. I’ve spent a lot of time all over Houston and generally felt fine on the major roads in Greenspoint, but would never go into less trafficked areas or get out of my car. 

Unless the office you’re visiting is right by the hotel, I don’t understand why your company would have you stay there. There are so many nicer areas nearby where you can safely walk to get dinner. Greenspoint isn’t one of them.

If you’re able to, check out The Heights. There are some really wonderful restaurants and bars there. The Woodlands is nice…but to me it’s just like a smaller Bellevue. Nice, but everything is new and overly manicured.

I'm a heavy smoker lol but you can usually find a plug in Houston easily. 

Pm me when you get to Houston and want a plug. 

 I work as a software engineer and can send you the number of someone who you can buy from. Depending what side of town you decide to situate yourself in. 

Like I mentioned I stay at the Hanover  Hermann park. Which is close to downtown. 
 
I have a plug who is far in the Northside (you'll need a car to get there) but I also have someone by the southwest side of town. ( Youll probably also need a car to go there lol). 

If you try to get your own plug weed is usually 10/g or 15/g don't overpay. Carts are anywhere from 25-45 depending on how many you buy.

"Same thing at nearly the same location about three or four years ago. Got off 45N near UH, turned left at Elgin and pulled into the left turn lane to turn left on Spur 5 and was behind an HPD car. We were both waiting for the light to change when he suddenly turned left through the red light. The lanes he crossed on Elgin come down a short rise, meaning he couldn’t see if anyone was coming and they wouldn’t see him. No lights, no siren. He sped off on Spur 5 and the light changed for me. I was so pissed I raced to catch up with him when he caught the next red light. I pulled into the lane next to him, honked, and he rolled down his window. I read him the riot act for full minute shouting: 

“Don’t you EVER do that again! Just because you can get away with it isn’t an excuse! You could KILL someone!” 

I was surprised that he actually started apologizing to me. The light changes and he sped off.

I’m a white guy over 60 and was wearing a jacket and tie and driving a nice car so I guess he took me seriously. I know there are far too many other folks in this city who wouldn’t dare assume they could tell off a cop and not wind up under arrest … or worse!

"I worked in the green point area off imperial valley for about 3.5 months when I first moved to Houston.

"Yeah so I have worked with cops of all kinds for two decades on various projects.  Close friends with city police, metro, sheriffs dept folks etc from fraternal outfits, at least up until recently.

My experience is the exact opposite.  City police, at least outside of the hyper caffeinated dipshit newbies (who are truly useless to society) are much more reasonable and down to earth.

Metro, sheriffs dept and small town cops?  Good lord.  I have never seen the level of punisher sticker poser bullshit in my life.  I mean you’d expect some, same as a mall security guard will strut like a rooster, a person who does traffic stops all day long, well you’d expect a wee bit of, you know - that same sort of shit.

But it has gotten to the point of absurdity with them.

City police like HPD don’t “patrol” anymore, there isn’t the budget.  They go from call to service to call to service.  Sure lots of that is barking dogs but plenty of genuine violence too.

Makes them not be all psyched out over pot or whatever.

But a small town cop?  Good lawd, stand back - got a kingpin here with a vape pen, high adrenaline!

And that roll your eyes vacuous shit at the core of most of them I’ve ever met.  So very rare you meet one that not just values but exudes true benevolence and humility, particularly the ones under 40.

"Greenspoint is called Gunspoint for a reason.  I spent the first 12 years of my career working in the area and it was worse than people said.

It has been 10 years since I worked there, but since I left, the area has had catastrophic flooding and has experienced the loss of almost all major companies (Exxon, Noble, Southwestern, McMoran, Anadarko, etc).  The loss of these oil companies has resulted in the loss of supporting hospitality businesses.  

In my time in Gunspoint, I saw a body being buried in the woods by my office, I saw a porn shoot being filmed in the middle of the street, had a co-worker car jacked and murdered leaving our parking garage, had a co-worker run over a kid trying to carjack him, and had a co-worker raped by a local in the women’s restroom in our office.

"Yes, plan prices have increased. Even though the PUCT lowered the TDU rates on March 1, the average rates are much higher than last year.

While [powertochoose.org](https://powertochoose.org) is the free and official website of the PUCT, do not look just look at the ordering of the providers/plans but view the fact sheets and look for the lowest energy charges. First, the data displayed on Power To Choose may not be accurate. I've file several complaints against providers where the PDFs shows different averages that what's displayed on Power To Choose. And when the TDU rate (CenterPoint in our area) changes on Sept 1 and March 1, some providers can take days/weeks to update the facts sheets.

I've created [findbestplan.com](https://findbestplan.com) that shows the data from the facts sheets and allows you to compare. My website also calculates the average rates for 500, 1000, 2000 kWh versus relying on the fact sheets which can be wrong.

Here are some options. 3 month is the cheapest, but risky because your contract will end in summer when the rates/plans will be higher.

But if at some point, say with nursing home care you must pay for, in your final years your estate dwindles. You're demented so cannot update your will. You die with only $1.2 million in the bank.

He asked if I'd like to take it to court and I wish I actually said yes. After I immediately got out of the car walked around the gas station building and saw the sign that was clearly marked one way.

My buddy's HCSO and I personally have had far more positive experiences with them and state troopers. State troopers generally bang the pinnacle of law enforcement around here. HPD and tow truck drivers are ridiculous and I don't expect much from them ever.

I highly recommend getting a dash cam And I also highly recommend sending in footage like that to both the complaints department and Twitter. Contrary to popular belief there are actual consequences that occur that are very inconvenient to the officer and question.

"That was how that conversation began!  I brought up Kelly Thomas, that poor schizophrenic man who was beaten to death for literally just being unresponsive by two cops.  It's on video and one of the most tragic things I've ever seen in my life listening to that innocent man who didn't even know why any of this was happening pleading for his life while they just Gestapo'd him to death with batons.

His response was not inspiring.

Nor the fact that both police officers were found not guilty in the most overt case of attempted murder I've ever seen.

Only the one who was accused of murder was even fired.  The other got to keep his job.

"“Y’all are dumb.” -proceeds to mention an outside county. Plus, they are only legally allowed to run red lights if they are responding to an emergency. Cops should be just as responsible as civilians with their government vehicles. They should be required (when not in an emergency situation) to drive the government vehicles just like their privately owned vehicles. Just because they are in a battering ram doesn’t mean they are somehow in any more of a rush than you or I trying to get to our next destination. Cops are a joke (in this sense) because they are just as criminal as any other person. Any one of them handing over a citation for running a light is hypocritical at that point. When cops start disregarding their own rules is when they need to get regulated. Too bad most of the time that’s just paid leave. Need to be off the force once they start bending their own practice.

I'm sure I'll have my own experiences with them as I live here longer, but thus far I'd have to say it's been a relatively neutral thing. I've had good times, like going 15 over on 59 and a cruiser just flashed their lights at me and let me go. I've had bad experiences, like slowing down all of 610 during the actual fluid morning rush by driving in the middle 20 under just to peel off to the shoulder for a wreck at the last minute, knowing full well without his lights on we'd have all gone by

"Police here are terrible. I was recently harassed by the Montgomery police department back in June because I asked someone for a ride to a gas station  at a Yacht Club parking lot in Walden/Lake Conroe. I didn’t know asking someone for a ride is illegal and grounds to kick someone out of a “property” by the lake. The Montgomery police website even talks about treating everyone with compassion and respect... LIES. You should’ve seen the way they were talking to me. The manager of the Walden Yacht Club mingles with the police and other corrupt people of this county and I used to work there too. They’re so corrupt. Rich people and police from the county go there to eat and drink. That manager is also having sex with employees in the bathrooms of the facility and it’s so gross. I put in a complaint on Google reviews exposing this corruption and one of my ex-coworkers called me claiming that I was lying. I’m not lying. Everyone would know about this and not intervene. It’s a violation by the workers and to the workers there. That yacht club isn’t a porn studio — children frequent there. I find it so gross that you’re the manager and you’ll be walking next to everyone you work with acting like you just didn’t have sex just a few minutes ago and ditched the team for your own sexual pursuits to have sex with other employees. I quit that job and they didn’t even pay me, but I still live across from them. That manager mingles with the cops. He’ll be commemorating events for them at the Yacht club so it’s all just “I got your back if you got my back, bro” bullshit. It’s corruption. I know half of the people here and half of them are protected by cops while they break laws left and right.

While I've had plenty of neutral and several good encounters with cops, the reality is them being normal respectful good people is not worthy of praise, it's worthy of their position. Citizens should respect each other, and do good, that's why we have laws.   


Cops are citizens as well, but to another posters point that's why they usually don't live in the community they work.  So they don't feel that way. 

So the force doesn't get points for being normal people, and they do lose points for the shit heads.  That's completely normal, and a good reason why people don't have trust in them.

"I live right there. The bridge was supposed to be worked on this year, but an inspection last week found something that required it to be shut down immediately. I actually didn’t know it was supposed to be worked on. Anyway, it is going to be raised because it was one of the main reasons my neighborhood flooded during Harvey. The water hit the bottom of the bridge and it flooded behind it into the neighborhood. The work is expected to take months to do. They decided that they are going to go ahead and get started now. One of the best things about that neighborhood is that it doesn’t have any access to 1960. People can’t cross Cypress Creek to go north from 1960 unless they are using the northbound feeder road or go all the way west to Kuykendahl. It keeps my sleepy little neighborhood very quiet even though I can get on 45 in less than two minutes. The first couple days of the closure were nightmares because people were lined up like 300 cars long snaking through the neighborhood. Cars were also driving really fast on side streets to detour. It was awful because we don’t have sidewalks and a ton of kids walk to school right there. It seems to have calmed down a whole lot. I suggest avoiding Cypresswood businesses unless you plan to stay on Cypresswood and head west to get to the Target or Best Buy or whatever. People liked using the feeder but that was always dumb.

Don’t believe this is a thing in Houston, so they just go right through it. This happens in a lot of other cities as well and it’s a per-agency policy. Another commenter mentioned that they may turn on their lights briefly to cross and then turn it off — this is the same thing but provides more visibility into what they’re doing (i.e. they have a reason why they’re running the red, like responding to something).

"Yes, that makes sense.

I just watch out for certain things in big public projects that say that the project is a vehicle to funnel public money this way and that way so someone's cousin gets a cut. The video is beautiful.

Is this the best way to spend our money? What are our goals? Reducing rush-hour traffic? Making Houston more attractive to potential individuals and businesses who might relocate here? Being able to host the Superbowl (goal of the first light rail line)?

To help people of modest means who otherwise are greatly pragmatically limited in where they might work, considering costs of car ownership and ease of public transportation use?

Sims Bayou, generally not flanked by wealthy neighborhoods, was a regular flooding nightmare for ever. After Allison, major projects addressed this. In Harvey, Sims never got out of its bank. This is a community project that helped out those with modest means to help themselves.

I see the attractiveness of being able to easily get to downtown events. We like to ride the light rail to go to the Rodeo, from out here in my middle class suburb. Thanks, Everyone, for your hard-earned tax dollars at work! So, my question is: what problems is this proposal solving? and how high is that on our priority list?
