Unless the office you‚Äôre visiting is right by the hotel, I don‚Äôt understand why your company would have you stay there. There are so many nicer areas nearby where you can safely walk to get dinner. Greenspoint isn‚Äôt one of them.

If you‚Äôre able to, check out The Heights. There are some really wonderful restaurants and bars there. The Woodlands is nice‚Ä¶but to me it‚Äôs just like a smaller Bellevue.

I'm a heavy smoker lol but you can usually find a plug in Houston easily. 

Pm me when you get to Houston and want a plug. 

 I work as a software engineer and can send you the number of someone who you can buy from. Depending what side of town you decide to situate yourself in. 

Like I mentioned I stay at the Hanover  Hermann park. Which is close to downtown. 
 
I have a plug who is far in the Northside (you'll need a car to get there) but I also have someone by the southwest side of town. ( Youll probably also need a car to go there lol). 

If you try to get your own plug weed is usually 10/g or 15/g don't overpay. Carts are anywhere from 25-45 depending on how many you buy.

"Same thing at nearly the same location about three or four years ago. Got off 45N near UH, turned left at Elgin and pulled into the left turn lane to turn left on Spur 5 and was behind an HPD car.

"Yeah so I have worked with cops of all kinds for two decades on various projects.  Close friends with city police, metro, sheriffs dept folks etc from fraternal outfits, at least up until recently.

My experience is the exact opposite.  City police, at least outside of the hyper caffeinated dipshit newbies (who are truly useless to society) are much more reasonable and down to earth.

Metro, sheriffs dept and small town cops?  Good lord.  I have never seen the level of punisher sticker poser bullshit in my life.  I mean you‚Äôd expect some, same as a mall security guard will strut like a rooster, a person who does traffic stops all day long, well you‚Äôd expect a wee bit of, you know - that same sort of shit.

But it has gotten to the point of absurdity with them.

City police like HPD don‚Äôt ‚Äúpatrol‚Äù anymore, there isn‚Äôt the budget.  They go from call to service to call to service.  Sure lots of that is barking dogs but plenty of genuine violence too.

Makes them not be all psyched out over pot or whatever.

But a small town cop?  Good lawd, stand back - got a kingpin here with a vape pen, high adrenaline!

And that roll your eyes vacuous shit at the core of most of them I‚Äôve ever met.

"Yes, plan prices have increased. Even though the PUCT lowered the TDU rates on March 1, the average rates are much higher than last year.

While [powertochoose.org](https://powertochoose.org) is the free and official website of the PUCT, do not look just look at the ordering of the providers/plans but view the fact sheets and look for the lowest energy charges. First, the data displayed on Power To Choose may not be accurate. I've file several complaints against providers where the PDFs shows different averages that what's displayed on Power To Choose. And when the TDU rate (CenterPoint in our area) changes on Sept 1 and March 1, some providers can take days/weeks to update the facts sheets.

I've created [findbestplan.com](https://findbestplan.com) that shows the data from the facts sheets and allows you to compare. My website also calculates the average rates for 500, 1000, 2000 kWh versus relying on the fact sheets which can be wrong.

Here are some options. 3 month is the cheapest, but risky because your contract will end in summer when the rates/plans will be higher.

"I once got in an argument in the middle of an intersection with an HPD officer who insisted that him and the rest of traffic were not driving down a clearly marked one direction street while everything on my block was under construction. 

More times than not on that street I would end up blocked in by cars on both directions because the signs say one thing and people disregard the signs.

He asked if I'd like to take it to court and I wish I actually said yes. After I immediately got out of the car walked around the gas station building and saw the sign that was clearly marked one way.

My buddy's HCSO and I personally have had far more positive experiences with them and state troopers. State troopers generally bang the pinnacle of law enforcement around here. HPD and tow truck drivers are ridiculous and I don't expect much from them ever.

I highly recommend getting a dash cam And I also highly recommend sending in footage like that to both the complaints department and Twitter. Contrary to popular belief there are actual consequences that occur that are very inconvenient to the officer and question.

"Police here are terrible. I was recently harassed by the Montgomery police department back in June because I asked someone for a ride to a gas station  at a Yacht Club parking lot in Walden/Lake Conroe. I didn‚Äôt know asking someone for a ride is illegal and grounds to kick someone out of a ‚Äúproperty‚Äù by the lake. The Montgomery police website even talks about treating everyone with compassion and respect... LIES. You should‚Äôve seen the way they were talking to me. The manager of the Walden Yacht Club mingles with the police and other corrupt people of this county and I used to work there too. They‚Äôre so corrupt. Rich people and police from the county go there to eat and drink. That manager is also having sex with employees in the bathrooms of the facility and it‚Äôs so gross. I put in a complaint on Google reviews exposing this corruption and one of my ex-coworkers called me claiming that I was lying. I‚Äôm not lying. Everyone would know about this and not intervene. It‚Äôs a violation by the workers and to the workers there. That yacht club isn‚Äôt a porn studio ‚Äî children frequent there. I find it so gross that you‚Äôre the manager and you‚Äôll be walking next to everyone you work with acting like you just didn‚Äôt have sex just a few minutes ago and ditched the team for your own sexual pursuits to have sex with other employees. I quit that job and they didn‚Äôt even pay me, but I still live across from them. That manager mingles with the cops. He‚Äôll be commemorating events for them at the Yacht club so it‚Äôs all just ‚ÄúI got your back if you got my back, bro‚Äù bullshit. It‚Äôs corruption.

That opportunity turned out to be HPD, and suddenly he was the happiest guy ever. His FB was pics of him smiling, working out, having kids, etc. When I've talked to him, I've heard how scary it is to deal with ""the blacks,"" and most recently how he's going for a higher level promotion because it's too hard to police with all the eyes watching for police infractions.

While I've had plenty of neutral and several good encounters with cops, the reality is them being normal respectful good people is not worthy of praise, it's worthy of their position. Citizens should respect each other, and do good, that's why we have laws.   


Cops are citizens as well, but to another posters point that's why they usually don't live in the community they work.  So they don't feel that way. 

So the force doesn't get points for being normal people, and they do lose points for the shit heads.  That's completely normal, and a good reason why people don't have trust in them.

"I live right there. The bridge was supposed to be worked on this year, but an inspection last week found something that required it to be shut down immediately. I actually didn‚Äôt know it was supposed to be worked on. Anyway, it is going to be raised because it was one of the main reasons my neighborhood flooded during Harvey. The water hit the bottom of the bridge and it flooded behind it into the neighborhood. The work is expected to take months to do. They decided that they are going to go ahead and get started now. One of the best things about that neighborhood is that it doesn‚Äôt have any access to 1960. People can‚Äôt cross Cypress Creek to go north from 1960 unless they are using the northbound feeder road or go all the way west to Kuykendahl. It keeps my sleepy little neighborhood very quiet even though I can get on 45 in less than two minutes. The first couple days of the closure were nightmares because people were lined up like 300 cars long snaking through the neighborhood. Cars were also driving really fast on side streets to detour. It was awful because we don‚Äôt have sidewalks and a ton of kids walk to school right there. It seems to have calmed down a whole lot. I suggest avoiding Cypresswood businesses unless you plan to stay on Cypresswood and head west to get to the Target or Best Buy or whatever. People liked using the feeder but that was always dumb.

"Yes, that makes sense.

I just watch out for certain things in big public projects that say that the project is a vehicle to funnel public money this way and that way so someone's cousin gets a cut. The video is beautiful.

Is this the best way to spend our money? What are our goals? Reducing rush-hour traffic? Making Houston more attractive to potential individuals and businesses who might relocate here? Being able to host the Superbowl (goal of the first light rail line)?

To help people of modest means who otherwise are greatly pragmatically limited in where they might work, considering costs of car ownership and ease of public transportation use?

Sims Bayou, generally not flanked by wealthy neighborhoods, was a regular flooding nightmare for ever. After Allison, major projects addressed this. In Harvey, Sims never got out of its bank. This is a community project that helped out those with modest means to help themselves.

I see the attractiveness of being able to easily get to downtown events. We like to ride the light rail to go to the Rodeo, from out here in my middle class suburb. Thanks, Everyone, for your hard-earned tax dollars at work! So, my question is: what problems is this proposal solving? and how high is that on our priority list?
