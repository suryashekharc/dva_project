"If you are young and looking for a very greek life/sports bar I would recommend the Corner Club. It is a lot calmer during the day with a bit older crowd, and has trivia on Tuesdays at 8pm I believe. On weekends it is elbow to elbow and very loud, but the outside is nice if you want to drink and smoke which you can't really do at any other bar in town. Once you have left the college age range like me i.e. 21-23 it isn't as much fun and people aren't that friendly. 

If you are looking for food and pool Mingles has large crowds and I think 14 pool tables usually busy with college students during the school year and during the summers in my experience a bit more country. I find it a bit hard to go there by yourself as there contrary to the name not a mingling outside of groups. People are very much so sectioned off into groups at their tables, but can be a blast if you got a decent group to play pool together.

If you are looking for a dive bar and live music/karaoke Johns Alley has those things. Usually at least one band will be playing on the weekend if not there is karaoke on Wednesdays. It is very packed on weekends depending on the band, but is definitely a dive bar. A lot of the people in there are usually service industry or locals on most nights. College students in my experience don't really go there very often unless a band is playing or if they are doing a birthday run.

If you are looking for beer I have heard very good things about Pour Company. A lot of grad students I know really like it, I believe it is a lot calmer than other bars and is more so a taproom.

If you are looking for craft cocktails Nectar is good but is only open late Friday and Saturday, is more so a restaurant during the day with limited bar seating. Very good drinks but 3 of them will put you about 25-30 dollars in the hole.

I can't really speak about the Dirty Goat, I have only been there once on a dead night. Nor Hunga Dunga nor Moscow Brewing.

As well, I would stay away from Tapped as it is owned Christ Church members, if you are unfamiliar with them I would suggest you do some [googling](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/doug-wilson%E2%80%99s-religious-empire-expanding-northwest), or look around on this subreddit.

Edit: Since you are looking for bar games I would recommend either Mingles or Johns Alley. Along with pool Mingles has 2 dart boards and buckhunter. Johns Alley has two boards as well a pool table though regulars usually hog it, ping pong table, shuffleboard, buckhunter, and an arcade machine that I have never touched.

"Seeing as to how there's no answers I'll try to give you my limited insight. I was a Jimmy John's driver for three years while attending u of I (graduated in 21) so I'd go to that motel fairly often to deliver. Compared to the Hillcrest the clientele seemed pretty reasonable, never saw anything to concern me. People answered the door fully clothed, never saw any signs of car break ins, tipped reasonably etc. That part of Moscow shouldn't be too unsafe (I don't think there really are many unsafe places in Moscow) and for the most part isn't near party houses though if you get back into A street there are definitely a few. Hopefully somebody who's stayed there can give you more info, but figured some response was better than nothing!

Apartment Rentals used to be Apartments West ---- the most horrible bunch I've ever seen.  They rented in both Moscow and Pullman but were based in Moscow.  We rented a place on Valley Rd across from some university owned apartments near the playfield.  Mold was rampant.  Drains froze regularly because no insulation.  Crappy single pane windows sweated like mad.  Mainenance crew was nonexistent for any calls.  They also owned these old shacks they'd rent out (no one would call them houses) and they gave them these Greek names like Cnossis or some crap.  I'd be hard pressed to think they've changed.,t2_7kuhjhts,Mosiedog,0,1645743561.0,0,t1_hyb1pe0,hyb1pe0,False,Gently_55,t3_su6zua,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/su6zua/great_rental_companies_ones_to_avoid/,Great rental companies?

"Palouse properties is the least nightmare-ish rental company in town, out of all the companies. They can still be pretty predatory sometimes if you don't advocate for yourself.
My wife and I have rented from just about every company in town over the many years we've lived here. 

Palouse properties is your best bet quality-wise, but get EVERYTHING in writing. That company screwed us out of $1000+ using shady practices a couple years ago. Do not agree to anything verbally, and make sure your unit is safe before moving stuff in, as there are no showings before signing a lease due to the pandemic. Last year Palouse properties scrubbed the mold off of the walls of a unit before we were given the keys. We were not told about it, and they straight up accused us of being dirty people when we started complaining about the giant moldy wall. We had to break the lease because I'm immunocompromised and that plus mold can get really dangerous really fast. We had to threaten legal action to get them to let us leave without charging us crazy amounts of money. 

Like I said, Palouse properties is the least bad company in the area, but protect yourself while working with them, and stand up for yourself. They are not used to people advocating for themselves, because they mostly rent to college students that don't know better yet.",t2_bsdgoigc,iamdrawingablank34,0,1645107740.0,0,t1_hxb6ob1,hxb6ob1,True,Gently_55,t3_su6zua,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/su6zua/great_rental_companies_ones_to_avoid/,Great rental companies?

"For all practical purposes, all the unopen downtown spaces require substantial updates. Some remodeling has been going on for a while. Other properties changed ownership this calendar year.

When updating/remodeling property, going from 'let's move this wall' to 'we had to re-plumb, re-wire, address drainage, and reinforce weight bearing walls' takes nearly nothing and is very expensive.

Since it’s a large church that’s been here close to 50 years, obviously its members own all kinds of property.

"You have no idea how many insane accusations there are. I think the simple reason here is that a lot was going on, minds were very much made up ahead of time, and no one called to ask… I saw a few people online who were there in person chime in, but they were immediately “shouted down” in the comments and told they were lying etc. 

But the quote you just posted really kind of speaks for itself. I think it wasn’t Doug Wilson directly, but one of his daughters who talked to Tri Stage ahead of time, and yes - masks were the subject of conversation. 

I also think that conversation wasn’t made explicitly public because that tri state employee would perhaps get in trouble in the aftermath. I doubt that would still be an issue, but I wouldn’t name her still just in case if I knew her name. 

But one thing I can personally testify to is that tri state was among the kindest stores about masking until that exact moment. The employees were bewildered themselves! So it was very reasonable to basically “thank them” for being compassionate to people who couldn’t or didn’t believe in masking to allow them to shop by supporting them.

"I'm only going by what's in the article, and certainly she was facing complicated health challenges. 

The article says: 

> It’s not clear whether Ripley would have survived had the services she needed been available.

> “Maybe she would have lived, maybe she wouldn’t have,” Eiselein said. “But she didn’t even have a chance.”

With the clear disclaimer that I'm not a physician or have any medical training, it sounds like what she needed was CRRT, Continuous renal replacement therapy, or KRT, Kidney Replacement therapy, from the article, which says: 

> What she needed now was an intensive-care unit bed that provided continuous dialysis, said her father, Kai Eiselein – something Gritman does not have.

It looks like CRRT is something that a percentage of Covid-patients require.  [Here's an article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.604182/full) in a peer-reviewed medical journal about strategies for optimizing CRRT during the pandemic, which notes: 

> The unprecedented surge of nephrology inpatients needing kidney replacement therapy placed hospital systems under extreme stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

So yes, certainly, this wasn't an otherwise healthy person who just needed some kind of minor care.  On the other hand, it seems very credible that the care she needed was unavailable because (likely unvaccinated) COVID-19 patients were using up the available ICU beds with CRRT capabilities in the region.",t2_3gddl,AtOurGates,0,1643650132.0,0,t1_hv0n8y8,hv0n8y8,False,AtOurGates,t3_sgroll,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/sgroll/patient_dies_in_gritman_er_unable_to_find/,"Patient Dies in Gritman ER, Unable to Find Specialized ICU Care During COVID Surge",/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/sgroll/patient_dies_in_gritman_er_unable_to_find/hv0n8y8/,3,r/MoscowIdaho,0,3

To add to this: he's a born again Christian. Sucked in by a Bible study that basically paid his way out of alcoholism -(sounds like that's ati a problem though).

His rental company has changed names a few times due to the absolute shit reviews it has recieved from angry tenants—a while back his brother took off with most of the money he made from the rental company cause, you guessed it!

He's known for not taking care of rentals and making new tenants pay for the shit they recieved and not giving back their deposits. In short, he's a slum lord. In my opinion, he's one of the worst— walking around saying he's a Christian when he's a pos. 

One of his businesses (Sliced I think it was/is called) had a trans (f to m) employee who basically held the business together. To this day he calls them by their dead name, refuses to use they/them and goes out of his way to do so. 

A while ago his wife (and him) publicly said they were pro-lifers on Slice and biscuit's Facebook page. Not only that, they basically called anyone who is in a situation where they may need an abortion sluts/whores.

"We've attended Trinity Baptist (not Trinity Reformed) for the past year and have very much enjoyed the balanced approach from leadership. They are very much a standard SBC group from what we've seen. The sermon style seems generally sequential and expository if that matters to you; it does to us. I would say, overall, that the tone is reverential concerning the scripture, conservative in systematic-theological approach, but also moderate in terms of theological differences. 

Theological example: they observe the Supper every month on the first Sunday. We have some ecclesiological convictions that restrain us from observing with them, but they aren't pushy. Nothing but kindness and respect (which we try to maintain ourselves).

"Have you looked into a Potlatch permit? I think they’re expensive but if you have one you can take your atv a lot of places. I’ll bet it would be great for snowmobiles too because they own a ton of clear cuts and if there is timber there is pretty much always a network of roads on their land from the last time they clear cut. There is also a network of ohv roads at the base of the Palouse divide, accessible from the highway in a few spots or a few miles in on gravel roads (Strychnine creek road has a big parking area but I’m not sure how close you can get in the snow). You could also unload at Moose Creek res and go up the divide. Another network of back roads starts just outside of Bovill if you take a left right before the rv park and head out East Fork road toward Bob’s creek. Lots of private land down low but it’s sort of a back way in to the upper basin area outside elk river.

"Our aquifers are very heavy in iron and manganese. Fe & Mn are not considered dangerous to health by the EPA and have no maximum contaminant level.  One of the aquifers we draw from, the Wanapum, is the most shallow and quickest to recharge. It is also the highest in iron and manganese. The water we draw from these wells is filtered to remove most of the Fe & Mg. Our other aquifer, the Grande Ronde, is not quite as high in these two minerals  as the Wanapum, but we do not filter the water from these wells. The Grange Ronde is a much slower aquifer to recharge.

All that aside, FE & Mg settles out in our water mains. Occasionally, use of different water sources or some other anomaly will disrupt the general direction of flow in the water mains. When this happens, the change in direction of flow will disrupt sediment and you'll experience ""brown water"". The best thing you can do is to let your water dept. know where the disturbance was. They keep track of this sort of thing and it use useful information.  Also, let your water run for awhile and it should clear up. Sometimes, it takes longer for the disrupted water to either move past your service line, be used, or for the contaminants to settle out again.",t2_jk1wq,WillyPete81,0,1642218851.0,0,t1_hsq0ist,hsq0ist,True,VectorFoo_,t3_s4a7od,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/s4a7od/brown_water_is_back/,brown water is back🤦‍♂️,/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/s4a7od/brown_water_is_back/hsq0ist/,15,r/MoscowIdaho,0,15

"I like the Bridge Bible Fellowship. I went there as a teen, in the early 2000s, who used and drank, and they were very nice and accepting, non judgemental.  I became a believer and found God with their help.   They're also non denominational, and just use the Bible.  Im not entirely sure who the pastor is at this moment,  but they have different elders speak which keeps the message fresh.  It is a very relaxed, fun, environment.   First Sunday of the month is communion.  Church starts 10am, they might have have early service for students (or whoever) at 8am. 

I just really liked them, because I started out a non believer, and thought any believer was judgemental.

">You want the pedophile to change. But not the homosexual? I understand why: you believe one is wrong, and the other not. Think about that. 

I have thought about it, and reached the same conclusion that modern society has: homosexuality is not a sin, it is not harmful to those involved nor harmful to society. You disagree out of what you think is love for your fellow man. To see them delivered from sin. But that, right there, is not truly from love; it's selfishness and the desire to control people.

>Just the sins you think are sins? What is sin anyway? 

Sin, to you, is what *your* religion defines as sins. That's it, sins are what a religion defines them as. Other religions will have different definitions of sin. People without religion will look for the harm sins cause to those involved. If they don't actually cause harm to anyone, why does it need to be considered a sin? You believe that is because they are sins, and that's the end of it. But that's just the problem: _you_ believe, but others don't. Sins are what you define them as, and everyone else is wrong  *This is the height of selfishness*. Others must do as you ask because you say so.

>What I do agree with is that we should obviously support the victims of sin. And we do. I know quite a few, though you wouldn’t know their story from looking at them today.

"This right here is why I can _never_ agree with your beliefs. Forgiving pedophiles is all well and good, as long as they actually are reformed and the church _supports_ the victims of those pedophiles. Tend to the needy first, then go after the perpetrators.

""Hate the sin, forgive the sinner"" is not a healthy way to build relationships with anyone, let alone your friends and family who are gay. The bottom line is there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. There isn't anything that needs reforming or forgiving. You say you love and welcome all ""sinners"" into your church?

">""It's either immoral to determine guilt by fabricating motivations, or it’s not.”   


Um, Marcus, are you ok? Have you been following the dialogue in this thread at all? Since you insist upon using fallacies and non sequitur responses for things we’ve already covered, let me recap for you: 

* It appears at face-value, on multiple accounts, that what CC did to Bloom was done in bad faith. 
* If it wasn’t done in bad faith, CC was still in the wrong for how they treated Bloom—inconsiderate, garish, and obtrusive as it was. This is called a “best case scenario.”

Let’s say we live in the same apartment complex. You decide to host a special and solemn event in your apartment, like a funeral wake or a Bible study. I know this because you posted a flier about it on the apartment bulletin board. Interestingly, I also decide to host my own event at the same time as you’re hosting yours—a kegger on the sprawling complex lawn. I invite 300 college students, who all show up, ready to rage. You and your friends can barely hear each other talk as we blast music and party right outside your apartment window.   
  
Did I do this out of spite? Maybe. After all, I’d overheard you tell some of our neighbors how I bought out your much-needed parking space to hold my second leisure vehicle, and I don’t like being painted as the bad guy. But, who knows if it was spite or not? Maybe I’m just a fun-loving guy that wants to party! The point is, it doesn’t matter. Either way, I’m being a shitty, obnoxious neighbor, and you and your friends have full right to be disgruntled about my behavior.   
  
So, returning to your statement quoted above. No, you do not have to be privy to my personal motivations and the deep inner-workings of my mind in order to say that I am guilty of being an inconsiderate neighbor.

Bloom announced their event, which was an hour after the CC event. CC immediately reached out to assure Bloom we would be cleared out before 3pm when their event would begin (CC had a permit from 2-3 I think).

Bloom has been fine about all this, and very cordial with the college and CC. It’s random people on the internet inserting their theories into it because they hate our church and think we’re “taking over Moscow.” So apparently “no singing for us,” and if we do it’s an act of aggression… sheesh.

"Based upon everything I’ve read, **I think this was 100% the case**. Any pretense that it wasn’t was lost when Kirkers started mocking and taking pictures of Bloom’s closing sign in the window and shouting that “Champions is next!”   
  
Here’s the thing: We’ve known since [Nov. 16th](https://www.facebook.com/bloommoscow/photos/a.1674494099296436/4546073865471764/) that Dec. 5th was going to be Bloom’s last day of service. But Foucachon (on his “Moscow Report” Kirker propaganda page) maintains that Bloom scheduled their final event *after* CC scheduled their caroling. This simply doesn’t appear to be true. On Facebook, the earliest date I can find for a listing about Christ Church’s upcoming caroling event is [November 30th](https://www.facebook.com/events/654867339010255/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%2252%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22[%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22share_link%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22share_link%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22invite_link_id%5C%22%3A1116419132515250%7D%7D]%22%7D). That’s the *same day* [Bloom posted](https://www.facebook.com/bloommoscow/photos/a.1674494099296436/4592011817544635/) about their final day’s official plans, which we had otherwise known were coming since mid-November. The Facebook dates are relevant here because this is by far the main location where all this information-sharing and scheduling is taking place. So, what gives, Foucachon? It appears at face value like lazy ""reporting"" (if you can even call it that) at best.   
  
Either way, this was a horrible thing for Bloom to have to deal with. Imagine attempting to run your business' last service while the organization shutting you down stages a cacophonous victory lap right outside your window and only points of business ingress/egress.   
  
It’s cruel and unnecessary. They could have easily moved somewhere else, like City Hall, where they’ve posted up many times before.

"Ok, I dove in.  Here are the lowlights. 

This is an interview with Mike and Kathryn Church (Mike is a Deacon at Christ Church, the owner of Kestrel Realty, Kathryn is the owner of Kathryn Church Designs, a graduate of Logos and NSA, and the daughter of Tom Garfield, former Logos teacher and Superintendant, and the current owner of Heritage Arts Academy), and Andrew Crapuchettes (Elder at Christ Church, Founder and former CEO of EMSI, founder of ""It's OK to be racist"" job board Redballoon, and developer of the new Edington housing development going in across from the Arboretum).  

* 05:15 - Crapuchettes compares New York, Seattle and Portland to East Germany. 
* 05:20 - Crapuchettes says he didn't use a .com domain because com sounds like communists, and ""we are not communists, we are people who work!"" - This is a joke, but illustrative of how anything Doug Wilson and his followers brand anything they don't like as ""communism"" (or more recently Marxism).  
* 05:45 - Crapuchettes: ""Unfortunately, in Amerca today, if you just hire someone off the street, there's a good chance they're going to be a total whiner, especially if they're young and a Gen X or a Gen Z [...] those people are probably going to be a whiner, and that are going to be in your HR department all the time talking about all the things that they really wish that they have, and they don't [...] I want to hire people that are going to focus on the work that needs to be done, and not on all of their snowflake-based complaints""
* 07:10 - Crapuchettes: ""The war for labor is over, and labor has won. You have a systematic government overreach with has caused people to lose their desire to work, or they've been told they're not allowed to work because they don't have the right vaccination status.""
* 10:10 - Crapuchettes: ""I have many thousands of people who follow me on LinkedIn...""   (Not particularly relevant, just, awesome for him to show us how awesome he is.
* 10:40 - Crapuchettes tells the story of a poor persecuted employer who says, ""If they knew my Christian beliefs, I would probably be fired. And it would be for another reason. But I know that that would happen.""  (This group seems to get really confused about what a protected class is and isn't a protected class in this country. Also, love to portray being ""a white male Christian"" as being the most persecuted people in the world. No one suffers more discrimination.) 
* 10:55 - Crapuchettes: ""I've gotten lots of messages from executives around the country who said, I love what you're doing. But I can't like what you're doing if you know what I mean.""  (News alert: many executives are shitty people who would like to exploit their workers)
* 10:58 - Crapuchettes: ""I start getting messages from people, a guy in Florida in particular who works for the Florida government. He said, hey, do you have a list of non-woke businesses because I want to not only work for them, but I want to invest with them, and I want to shop with them.""  (Just to be clear, ""Non-Woke"" is code for ""allow racism and harassment"")

Here's the bit I'm guessing /u/NoCultID is referring to: 

* 11:50 - Crapuchettes: ""I've talked to a number of individuals who are tired of having their money parked in mutual fund. And they say, hey, are there businesses in my community in Moscow that I can invest in with the business that I care about and with people that I care about rather than just parking money in the markets for them to use it for nefarious things.""
* 13:11 - Crapuchettes: ""Editington is the name of the housing development, and it's named after a battle where Alfred the Great beat back the Barbarian hordes to save Christian England. So that's where the name comes from. And the sword and the sword and the whole thing. Yeah. White Horse and King Knight, whatever.
* 19:22 - Crapuchettes makes his same .com / communist joke again, in case we missed it the first time. 
* 21:04 - Crapuchettes: ""We are now at almost a quarter million people have been on Red balloon in two and a half months looking for freedom, right? For freedom, for their work. Freedom where they're going to go. I actually talked to a sorry I'll mention a competitor briefly, but Conservative Move is a huge company based in Texas, and all they do is help people facilitate moving them from blue States to red States. And they have 400 agents, and they help them sell their house in New York and buy one in Tennessee. And it's a concierge service for Conservatives who are sick of it.""
* 22:00 - Crapuchettes talks about ""employee freedom"" which he says liberals stole from conservatives, and promotes Redballoon's employer pledge, which is: 

> By registering for RedBalloon’s Job Board and/or Marketplace services, you as an employer commit to neither discriminate against your employees’ personal beliefs, infringe on their constitutional rights, invade their medical privacy, or make vaccination a condition of employment. Thank you for standing for freedom - for your business, for your employees, and for America.

That's basically it.  I'd like half-an-hour of my life back.  

TL;DR:  Crapuchettes would like to help other people exploit their workforce, bring investment money into Moscow for ""non woke"" businesses and get lots of people to live in his housing development that's a clever reference to Christians defeating ""barbarian hordes.""",t2_3gddl,AtOurGates,0,1638906061.0,0,t1_hnmo45x,hnmo45x,False,NoCultID,t3_rait2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/rait2i/i_guess_the_cult_thinks_we_are_the_barbarian/,I guess the cult thinks we are the Barbarian Hordes they need to vanquish?,/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/rait2i/i_guess_the_cult_thinks_we_are_the_barbarian/hnmo45x/,4,r/MoscowIdaho,2,4

sure, new st andrews might distribute some lunch business downtown..... people don't go to new st andrews though who aren't students there, and as most of the people that go are students, they're probably not spending a lot of their time downtown shopping.

 Alpaca crias are not usually born later than 2 in the afternoon. This is because in their native habitat, it is key for them to dry off before the cold mountain night starts.

"Been putting off making this post, probably because it's a frankly bizarre rant that no one is interested in hearing...

Someone remarked a few days ago that the hippie culture of Moscow has a kind of live-and-let-live attitude, and that that was part of the problem. That's definitely true, and I've thought that same thing myself on many occasions. But I think the problem is a lot deeper than that - essentially, the leftist elements of Moscow that are most opposed to CC are allergic to entrepreneurship, and therefore have no way of countering the accumulation of capital by CC members.

Much like the socialists/anarchists/hippies, Doug is a revolutionary (though he would hate to hear himself described that way). He doesn't seek to take control of the state, he seeks to supplant it. In his ideal world, the state might exist, but it is minimal. Instead, the most influential institution in people's lives is the church. People are educated by the church, justice is dealt by the church (see Natalie Greenwood and Steven Sitler for examples of what that would look like) and your standing in society is determined by your standing in the church. Unlike leftist revolutionaries, however, he believes there is a route to take this power within the system as it exists: by his followers taking power in the form of accumulating capital. Probably one of the few claims Marx made that holds up is that an individual's relationship to capital can heavily influence their social relationships and perspectives.

While NSA graduates are starting new businesses, the aging hippies and lefty UI students are talking about... doing what exactly? Boycotting? Forming communes? I know because I've moved in these circles. At the end of the day, no one gives a shit about those who turn on, tune in and drop out. Even if your communal non-profit organic alpaca farm or whatever works out, who cares? You'll never be able to compete with those who are trying to make money when a building downtown comes up for sale. And the NSA graduates who aren't starting business are instead going to UI and getting degrees that will allow them to work as well-payed professionals. I don't care how many pieces of duct tape some dumb hippies stick over Doug Wilson's bumper stickers, money talks and until Moscovites start putting it where their mouths are CC is going to continue taking over Moscow. End of story.

"Most of the ownership is actually through CC members, not the church. This creates a difficult situation.

"I get real uncomfortable choosing where I do businesses based on the religious beliefs of the business owners. 

I also see some very strong distinctions between an organization led by Doug Wilson, and a more traditional conservative church. 

On the one hand, you have Doug who is a white nationalist neo-confederate slavery-defender, openly advocating for (and supporting) the spread of disease in our community during a pandemic, who revels in calling gay men ""faggots"", and trying openly trying to take over our local government and replace it with a theocracy. 

On the other hand, you have people who might have a different perspective on some religious and political issues than I do, but aren't being dicks about it. 

When it comes to Doug, and people who support him, I'll happy to vote with my dollars to support other businesses in town.

"Yep. Their MO is to get a tenant to pay a really high rent *and* to contribute substantially to the ""improvement"" of the property, with Matt Becker acting as his own ""contractor,"" employing laborers that he's ostensibly ""rehabilitating"" (forcing them to study the bible, paying them very little, etc.). Then, when the tenant can no longer make ends meet, the Beckers have an improved space that the newly defunct tenant has paid them to improve, on top of very high rent. Who knows all the write-offs and tax-dodging and likely even money-laundering they're doing, but it's gotta be a *lot* and it's why the ""improvements"" never stop. I've always wondered why tenants would subject themselves to this shit show (there's a sucker born every minute, I guess), but yeah this helps explain the constantly revolving door.",t2_dmv98nlw,dei0242,0,1638465203.0,0,t1_hmybvy0,hmybvy0,False,crazyidahopuglady,t3_r794a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/r794a4/wtf_another_amazing_restaurant_being_screwed_over/,"WTF, another amazing restaurant being screwed over.",/r/MoscowIdaho/comments/r794a4/wtf_another_amazing_restaurant_being_screwed_over/hmybvy0/,22,r/MoscowIdaho,0,22
