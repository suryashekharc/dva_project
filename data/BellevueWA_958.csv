"When I last used metro in 2019, it was horrible. The park and rides would fill up so quickly that if you weren't there by 7:00am, you'd have to illegally park at a nearby business and hope you didn't get towed. If you did luck out and find a parking spot, you'd often return to find your vehicle damaged.

Plus if you were on the road that early, there wasn't much traffic yet anyway, so it only took another 15 minutes to complete the drive downtown, vs 30-45 for the bus.

The return trips were just as bad. If you tried to go home at peak rush hour and caught the bus near Mercer, often it would already be full and you'd have to wait 30-40 minutes until one came by with capacity.

"I think downtown Bellevue is a nice small city for what you described, you can walk to Safeway for groceries and maybe bike to Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods (driving is more common because of the hills), lots of restaurants and cafes in walking distance, and a beautiful downtown park great for walking or people watching. It’s very safe and clean compared to Seattle. There’s the occasional sighting of a homeless person here or there but you won’t see tents or encampments like they have in Seattle. In the past year I’ve seen about two homeless people in downtown Bellevue, whereas going to Seattle I have seen tents and homeless people on every single visit.

There are a few distinct areas of downtown Bellevue: the office area (basically all office buildings like Bravern, City Center, etc, this is the part that feels most sterile and I’d avoid living there); the shopping area (Bellevue Square, Lincoln Square, Cinemark; a bit more lively and upscale but pretty boring stores like Macys, Crate & Barrel, Container Store); and Old Bellevue/Downtown Park (I think this is the nicest area to live, has a small college town/historic vibe on Old Bellevue Main Street with good restaurants, coffee shops, boutique stores, and it’s right next to the park!)

The architecture in downtown Bellevue is a tiny bit like downtown Chicago but on a very very small scale; from downtown park looking towards the high rises, it’s like 0.1x scale of Chicagos millennium park with modern high rises in the background. No historic architecture. The vibe is nothing like New York. Pretty much everything closes by 9pm on weekdays. If you want vibrant nightlife like clubs and bars or just cool restaurants open late, you might need to find that in Seattle.

"I am serious, I had several neighbors car stolen and cops told them they found the car on the road but couldn't engage. So they just let them go. As soon as anyone starts driving your car, cops cant do anything about it.

[https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.116.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.116.060)

(1) A peace officer may not engage in a vehicular pursuit, unless:

(a)(i) There is probable cause to believe that a person in the vehicle has committed or is committing a **violent offense or sex offense** as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, or an escape under chapter 9A.76 RCW; or

(ii) There is reasonable suspicion a person in the vehicle has committed or is committing a driving under the influence offense under RCW 46.61.502;

So unless it was a violent crime or sex offence, or DUI; if a cop sees your stolen car on the road, they CANNOT stop the car, criminals can just run and cops will leave them be.

"It's possible to live without a car here but things to keep in mind:

If you have a bike and are very physically fit OR you will become very physically fit. We live in Lake Hills; my wife works on Northeast 8th and 108th.

People living in the Crossroads area or Overlake neighborhood will have similar elevation changes. We're about 4 miles from our house to her office. Here's a topographic map that'll give you a rough idea concerning hills.  https://en-us.topographic-map.com/maps/na3/Seattle/

Alternatively we do have a bus system. Depending on day and time it can work but don't expect Boston or NYC convenience. My wife can catch a bus a few hundred feet from our house. It'll drop her off about a block from her office but it'll take 25 minutes to get there assuming the bus isn't full which it was before the pandemic.

"Bellevue has homeless but we also have several shelters. Additionally our gov't has a much better handle on how to deal with homeless people. We're rather welcoming of nearly anybody in our city as long as they follow laws and other social/societal norms.

If a tent goes up our police will take the person to a shelter. If the person refuses a shelter they're given the choice of jail or leave the area.

Bellevue has crime but it's very minimal. We've lived in ""the shady part"" of Bellevue for 20+ years. About a decade ago we had some porch pirate issues but the cops found the shit-stains and the problem was dealt with. Currently there's a catalytic converter theft issue but we also have a lot of resources going into finding the perpetrators and stopping the problem.

Some people do equate minorities or poor people as a problem; this is far from true around here. Poor people live here despite the really high cost of living. Main reason is people here are willing to work their asses off so they can live in a safe and well ran city. Our schools are great with fantastic teachers. All the police I've chatted with are super nice people with good heads and even keeled tempers.

**What types of training do Bellevue Police officers receive?**


There are multiple stages of certification and training required to become a police officer. The first stage is Basic Training for Peace Officers through the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission (CJTC).  This academy is for entry-level or new officers and covers a variety of topics throughout the 720-hour curriculum.  The basic curriculum can be found here https://cjtc.wa.gov/, but covers topics such as criminal investigations, criminal law, procedures, people in crisis, use of force, firearms, and patrol tactics.  Built into those curriculums are topics such as implicit bias, unbiased policing, and use of force.  If we hire an experienced officer, or lateral, from outside of Washington State, they must attend a two-week equivalency academy at CJTC. 


This equivalency academy instructs them on Washington State-specific laws and procedures.  


The second stage of training required to be a Bellevue Police Officer is the 227-hour in-house curriculum designed to reinforce skills learned in the academy and topics specific to the City of Bellevue. **This training includes department expectations of officer conduct, ethical behavior, unbiased (anti-discrimination) policing, constitutional law, use of force, firearms, de-escalation, department policies and procedures, and our culture of community policing and engagement. **

 
The third stage is our 16-week Field Training Program. The new officer is assigned to various experienced Field Training Officers to ensure they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform at the high level we demand as a police officer for the City of Bellevue.  After successful completion of field training, the officers continue to be closely monitored and evaluated until they have completed their probationary period, which is usually one year.  


**Our officers are also required to attend annual ongoing training each year. **


**The minimum in-service training required by the state of Washington is 24 hours; however, most complete many more than that.**  Part of this ongoing, annual refresher training specifically addresses unbiased policing, implicit bias, ethics, and use of force.  The minimum 24-hours must also include successfully completing the state-mandated annual Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) course through the WA State CJTC.


**Are officers trained to de-escalate altercations?**


The Bellevue Police Department does require officers to de-escalate.  They are trained to use verbal de-escalation tactics and continue to do so as long there is no immediate threat to the officer or innocent bystanders.  Additionally, having multiple officers respond to calls can be an effective de-escalation tool we use.  We train to use time and distance along with verbal commands.


**De-escalation is incorporated into our yearly in-service, scenario-based training.  These are developed and taught by our certified instructors and are meant to reinforce de-escalation tactics.**

  
All our officers are trained in a state-certified program called Crisis Intervention Training.  After the initial 8 hour or 40-hour training class, we also attend a 2-hour refresher class every year.  Officers also can request trained mental health professionals to respond to scenes when their expertise would be beneficial.",t2_x3yuf,rcc737,0,1647012841.0,0,t1_i0915bx,i0915bx,False,QurGe,t3_tbc6q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/tbc6q6/angry_dude_on_top_the_stoplight_near_chick_fill_a/,Angry dude on top the stoplight near chick fill a on 8th & 116th.,/r/BellevueWA/comments/tbc6q6/angry_dude_on_top_the_stoplight_near_chick_fill_a/i0915bx/,3,r/BellevueWA,0,3

"Airplanes take off and land into the wind. As the wind direction changes, ""flow"" at an airport changes. Taking off and landing into the wind reduces the take off or landing distance needed on the runway.

Winds in the summer are predominantly out of the north, so planes take off to the north before they turn towards their destination.

Winds in the winter are predominantly out of the south so planes are taking off and landing towards the south.

Rain or other precipitation doesn't change take off or landing direction. Winds do shift and cna change in the middle of the day, so airport operations change as needed. 

Check out flightaware.com, flightradar24.com, or globe.adsbexchange.com to see details about any airplane you can see.

"When Tulloss at A.L. Humphrey House swung his baseball bat with both hands at the Chinese woman's head 500 feet from his shelter, could he be thinking along a similar line?
Reality is wherever I go whoever I deal with people will complain. So much shit happened in my life because people in America don't want to help me. So fuck you I'm swinging!

La Quinta isn't entirely incomparable to Humphrey House because while it's permanent supportive housing, it's designed to be low-barrier, for single men or women with mental, addiction or behavorial issues, and *not* for families with children. The county may not even do criminal background checks. 

It's not a ""safe injection site"" pe se. But one thing is clear so far: that drug use inside the doors are allowed. The drugs don't grow out of thin air, they have to be trafficked and sold, yeah? Would anyone say that there won't be dealers hanging around then? Or do dealers Amazon-deliver with drones nowadays?

Is it then farfetched that the parents are worried about drug issue spreading in schools? Tell me that schools have been immune to drug abuse in America?

Alternatives were proposed such as using the hotel for Mary's place, or for a subsidized senior housing, or for eastside's homeless students etc. Anything that can reduce children safety and drug addiction concerns while still helping those in need. The county bereaucracy simply rejected all with no explanation why single men and women with issues have to live close to schools and daycares while seniors and homeless children should not.

The county deflected on criminal history check and insisted that they will do their own ""screening"". Do they distrust criminal record data? If so, How do they expect local residents trust their guts feeling? Would a normal person want to live in an apartment building with a repeat offender next door? If not, why would a homeless citizen need less? Why do they not deserve living in a building with usual background checks based on data instead of guts feeling? They are already vulnerable.

Throughout this process, the county shows no willingness to address any of the concerns nor desire to be responsible for safety outcomes.

You know why things don't get built in America? It is because of the same irresponsible mindset: fuck you I will do this because I can. And I will not be held accountable if what I do ends up hurting people, so for the heck of it why not? And why would I pause for a second to consider failsafe plans if things go south I go my ways anyway?

It's easy to condescend on NIMBY. But it's a false representation. You can do shit in the backyard, but can you commit to clean up? Not just say ""I will"" but be *really* committed, like, if you fail to clean it up, you feel the same pain as the people you fucked with. 

No politician ever is accountable for any of these social experiment failures. They shit; they move on to grab more power. Some random persons got attacked? Who cares. We don't even talk about it because shit happens. Wasted taxpayer dollars? Don't even mention it.

If one day people can grow up, take responsibility, so the residents whose lives, children, prosperity are 100% in it can feel like the politicians and the social experimenters are in the same boat with them, have the same incentive in cleaning up their own shit, then people will want to work with you; then there won't be as much mistrust and uncertainty; then things will be done; then homeless people will get real help they need because people can finally work together rather than against each other; and we will finally have some success track record to feel good about instead of merely chanting the same old ""we need to solve the crisis"" line over and over again after 10 years of the crisis worsening year over year, simply by blaming your way out all on NIMBY.

I don't know you. But if something I've tried for 10 years has consistently failed so bad that I have not a single good track record to show people, I might take a step back and see if maybe working ""with"" people instead of ""fucking"" them might give a better overall result.

"It is very easy to troll or put label on someone on the internet without truly try to understand the difference between dream and reality. The dream is that we want everyone live in harmony. Homeless and people who have homes all deserve the right to live safely and happily. The reality is you need to know how to do this safely. Homeless population is vulnerable and some (maybe a small number of them) are in trouble and in addiction and need constant care. Kids are also vulnerable. The reality is we need to maintain a balance. How to help homeless population and address safety concerns need to be well planned.

I would not mind if this is built next to my office or if I live close to it if we understand what the safety plan is. If city and county could tell us what are safety measures they are going to put into place to ensure safety of the kids AND the safety of vulnerable homeless population in the hotel, we would love to hear them. Unfortunately we heard none from the city or the county. No plan, no background check, don’t know who will manage or how to manage this facility, don’t know what is the criteria of site selection. They just rush into spending tax payer’s money before funding expires. If this is such a grand thing to do, why would they hide from everyone about it until a whistleblower leaks the information?

"No wonder the politicians were rushing so fast to kill off the Houghton Community Council though HB 1769, which overturned the votes of the overwhelming majority of HCC voters in last November's election, and stripped those HCC voters from ever having the right to vote on the issue again.

Houghton already had the most low income housing in all of Kirkland, and the Community Council suggested that low-income housing should be spread equitably though all neighborhoods. But Mayor Penny Sweet disagreed, and wanted to concentrate low-income housing in the farthest corner of her city from her own home.

So Mayor Sweet got her husband - Representative Larry Springer - to ram HB 1769 though the legislature in a short legislative session where it is difficult to mount a defense.  Now Kirkland can dump all of its state-mandated low income housing and homeless shelters into a single neighborhood far away from the political donors.

Mayor Penny Sweet and her husband Larry Springer are Republicans masquerading as Democrats.  I hope they both get primaried by progressives!

EDIT: To be perfectly clear, I support King County's efforts to provide homeless shelter, transitional housing, and supporting long-term housing to people without housing.  I also support the creation of massive amounts of low-income and middle-income housing.  My disagreement with Springer and Sweet is that I believe that ""poor people"" should be able to live in all neighborhoods, rather than piling us into one area where we can be abused and ignored.",t2_di46b,laseralex,0,1646384372.0,0,t1_hzao8yp,hzao8yp,True,BellevueNews,t3_t64k9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/t64k9u/king_county_buys_la_quinta_inn_suites_in_kirkland/,King County buys La Quinta Inn & Suites in Kirkland to become homeless shelter,/r/BellevueWA/comments/t64k9u/king_county_buys_la_quinta_inn_suites_in_kirkland/hzao8yp/,2,r/BellevueWA,0,2

You wrote this morning in your Bellingham post on this same topic that these people won't put your denial in writing. If they refuse to do that then your case isn't denied, it's pending. 

>With DSHS I tried to submit a civil rights grievance 5 times in 12 month period and the never investigated any of the grievances.  The last time was 12/10/21 and they said I would hear back by the end of the week and I still haven't heard back.  They are required to respond in X number of days and resolve in X number of days.  Nearly 3 months is not reasonable.

You're shooting yourself in the foot. Each time you file a new grievance you reset the clock unless you can clearly show the additional filings are for additional and separate grievances. If that's not clear (for example you copy/paste your grievance like you did this posting across all WA state subs) then the agency will only look at the most recent one. You appear to be complaining about the agency's ability to respond to your case vs actual discrimination. I don't mean to belittle what you are going through but your best approach is to reach out to your state representative in both houses and push for those agencies to get more funding, or find a private attorney to take your case. Non profit and advocacy groups will only take cases they deem highest priority and if yours doesn't qualify and you can't find a private attorney to take it on then you literally don't have a case unless you file yourself, but without a legal background that is almost guaranteed to fail.

I wish the best for you but based on your other comments in other threads you're approaching it from a point of enforcement instead of advocating for resources, and your lack of patience is harming your own case.",t2_32r1u,doubleohd,0,1646073344.0,0,t1_hyt5ljq,hyt5ljq,False,BachelorPOP,t3_t3ev66,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/t3ev66/im_trying_to_address_systemic_disability/,I'm trying to address systemic disability discrimination by state employees and contractors in WA.

"I think I was pretty clear when I wrote: ""I'm looking to connect with anyone in Bellevue or WA state who has faced similar systemic disability discrimination and/or others willing to take action to address systemic disability discrimination in WA"".

Example, if a disabled person requested for a reasonable accommodation for their disabilities from a state entity or one of their contractors and the entity didn't enter into an interactive process, didn't lawfully accommodation, didn't lawfully deny, etc. 

Example, if a person who faced disability discrimination and filed a civil rights grievance and the civil rights grievance wasn't lawfully handled (investigated/resolved).

I think you might have misunderstood something.  My concern is employees aren't putting the denials in writing which is required by law. 

I'm not talking about filing lawsuits.  

The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of Civil Rights is already considering investigating DSHS due to the response I gave them last week.  They asked me at the beginning of February to answer 3 questions for them.

"You write so much but say so virtually nothing. What are you looking for? You give no example of systemic discrimination, or describe how anyone would recognize if their case is a symptom of systemic issues. Give examples.

How much time have you invested in all these outreaches vs asking for supervisors of the employees you describe to address the issues you claim to have experienced? Based on your profile you appear to be demanding these investigations but also admit state employees won't document their discrimination in writing. I'm registered as a state vendor in WA and I can tell you the every day state employee is not astute or savvy enough to avoid these kind of ""gotcha"" claims. They just don't care.

If you feel you have been wronged or discriminated against by a state employee go to their supervisor first and use lack of follow-through as a basis to file an individual lawsuit against that state entity.

Things to do in Portland: Donuts (I like Blue Star but there are a few other famous ones), shopping (no sales tax so anywhere is fine).

Both cities also have nature/ourdoorsy things to explore but they are probably nicer in the other seasons.

Peony outing at Pure Peonies farm

Public · Hosted by Bel La, WA Plants, Flowers and Mushrooms Free, Sale and Exchange and WA Plants, Flowers and Mushrooms Free, Sale and Exchange

Saturday, May 21, 2022 at 8:00 AM – 11:00 AM PDT

[Everson, Washington](https://www.ci.everson.wa.us/) - About 20 minutes northeast of Bellingham.

Let's go support a local business and enjoy beautiful flowers.

We'll head to the farm early in the morning as it's a long drive, the farm is about 3 hours North of Bellevue. We can meet and carpool, and those who live closer to the farm can time yourselves to meet up with the group there. Ideally we want to be there by noon. 

The farm has more than 200 varieties of peonies. We're free to take pictures, do a little picnic, etc. Bring cash if you want to buy hand cut peonies or peony plants. Maybe a small cooler filled with cold beverages, sandwiches, and sides to enjoy on a blanket right at the farm. And possibly a tripod, or we can help take pictures for each other.

Please make sure to wear masks inside the cars if you carpool with others and practice safe COVID protocols to ensure your and everyone's safety.

There’s plenty of space to not be in anyone’s way while still enjoying our time there. 

You can leave anytime, spending a few hours is never enough for your eyes and soul but your feet might scream at you. We'll likely leave around 4PM.",t2_x3yuf,rcc737,0,1644771106.0,0,t1_hwsnopg,hwsnopg,True,fgurubunnies,t3_sq95lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/sq95lh/heres_one_that_everyone_can_attend_although/,"Here's one that everyone can attend, although outside of Bellevue.

"The bike map is really useful. Take note of the roads in red - these have fast-moving heavy traffic, and people are not expecting or looking out for bikes (or pedestrians) on some of these. Crossroads is especially treacherous. If you're new to riding in a city and/or just want to avoid traffic, you can generally find safer routes, but they may take you a bit out of your way. For travel across the lake, the 90 and 520 bike lanes are great and heavily used, especially in the summer. Downtown now has protected north-south bike lanes on 108th on both sides of the street, but 4th and 8th are terrible for getting east-west.

As others have noted - visibility is really important. Hi-viz neon jacket or shirt, back light, helmet light, and even side or tire lights that are visible to drivers coming towards you at a 90-degree angle. If you're in the dark and rain, you can be almost invisible without these.  

Except for some of the recreational cycling routes like the Evergreen-Overlake-Lake Washington Blvd route that is really popular on weekends, I don't see tons and tons of cyclists out on the city streets here, so it just helps to be aware that drivers may be less used to (and aware of) cyclists than say Seattle proper. Though I bike commuted for years in Seattle and it was often not great or safe experience there, either.  

In summary, be aware of your surroundings, stay lit up, keep safe, and find routes that work for you.

"I just rented a house in 98007 for $3350. If you can stomach 3k you can find a small home.

Before this I lived in the Park Highland apartments. Similar to any other cookie cutter apartments but it was nice bc those apartments border the botanical gardens which have trails and a little coffee shop. With utilities I think it came to $2600 for a two bedroom. A one bedroom will be around 2k I imagine.

Yeah... sorry, it's an expensive area! If you're living alone then just rock a 1 bedroom. But at $2600 vs $3350... this house is about 3x the size plus a garage, around 2500 sq ft I think. We got a bit lucky though, it's an older house, nothing fancy, but most houses this size are around 4k. For 3k you can find about a 1500 sq ft place. It's hard to find a place when you don't live here though. One option is to find a standard apartment online and plan to break the lease, which will cost you a month's rent, but that would probably be cheaper than doing month to month.

"This will be tough over here because you're in the suburbs, so most people are older and paired up in couples or doing the family thing.

The best bet for making friends anywhere in the PNW is to go to ongoing things like outdoor recreation clubs, volunteer positions, etc. People here aren't like in the south or the midwest where invites to a BBQ are extended the first time you meet.

"I am very sorry that there was retaliation between you and your employer, that your claim was denied with ESD, and most of all for the impact that it had on you and your family and your son.

I inferred from the question about accountability that you have mostly moved on from the disqualification with ESD, unfortunately the only subject in the multitude of issues you are facing that I can effectively help with.

In the off chance that I have not understood the nature of your reply in that you want to and are willing to discuss the disqualification and possible actions that could lead to solutions:


>They also denied my claim because they said I worked for DSHS

Who was your employer from whom you separated when you made your initial claim filing for unemployment benefits?

Generally speaking, ESD must include a selection of laws under which the disqualification was invoked, for which I have made a troubleshooter to locate those laws on the letters:

"I would like to know how my claim of retaliation was never approved or sent to L & I. This was after August when I left my career as a paraeducator because my employer was not connecting or making an effort to complete the corrective action from my first state complaint to OSPI. The retaliation by a previous action of mine (reporting harm in March 2018) had reached epic proportions and I believe was the reason the district was not connecting my son. At the same time ESD department was rampant with fraud. At the time that my claim was up for decision, ESD was shorthanded and had national guard assisting. Were they assisting on making decisions as well? They also denied my claim because they said I worked for DSHS. When I no longer was employed, I signed up to be my disabled sons personal care provider. I was exempt because I was taking care of my own son whose minutes were paid out of his personal care plan. Denied from the most mis-managed (just inching out DSHS) state agency in Washington State. My case should have had eyes on it and been referred. Instead, I got no unemployment for the entirety of the pandemic. I had to use what little I had in my 401K to get us moved out of state where I am still trying to connect my son to his supposed federally protected education. Its been over 700 days since he has seen education, services, or peers. He turns 20 next month. Was 17 at closure in Redmond, WA. I am losing hope fast he will be reconnected in KY. Where if he was, I could file a complaint with DOJ and possibly go back to work. But never in education again. Not after what I have seen, my Autistic son has been through and not after watching colleagues stand silent to it all. This should have never happened to my son and I have had to remain persistent in advocating for justice for him in a county of bad actors-key communicator networks -mismanaged agencies and places that say one thing and do another behind close doors. When will accountability come to Washington? King County? Remond? My son and other disabled students like him.

"Not really.

This article is worse than the Seattle Times one it attempts to criticize.  Rather than invest the time in directly countering the concerns raised by the times it instead does character assassination against the paper.

The editorial referenced is here: https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/legislature-should-reject-plan-to-upend-single-family-zoning/

The crux of the Time's reasoning isn't that upzoning is bad, its that unless additional controls are added to get developers to build affordable housing, you just get developers catering to the high end of the market.

I don't think will be the case, but it could be a problem and is one worth legitimately discussing instead of telling me that a paper endorsed George Bush, someone who hasn't been relevant for nearly 15 years.

The Time's uses actual data in it's analysis of Seattle, something that the Urbanist doesn't address.  One example is below:

> Among the 224 market-rate projects that were subject to MHA’s requirements in 2020, 219 chose to pay fees, while only five agreed to include some affordable housing, yielding 21 on-site units. The program raised $68 million in fees.

That's significant and may indicate that the change in housing prices in Seattle might be due to other reasons, like the pandemic.  The Urbanist simply says that the 68 million in fees is a win, it doesn't show how many actual affordable houses were created as a result or where those fees went.  I did some searching and couldn't find any serious data.  

[Similar projects](https://projects.seattletimes.com/2022/seattle-king-county-homeless-promises-outcomes/) in solving problems where housing is a solution are decidedly a mixed bag though.

Given the overhead costs in our government, its likely only a fraction of that money made it's way to somewhere impactful.

Anyways, that's a lot of words to say the Urbanist's article is trash and that's why it deserves the downvotes.",t2_aodbl,gettingoutaccount,0,1643582676.0,0,t1_huwxneg,huwxneg,False,[deleted],t3_se3f5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/se3f5t/seattle_times_wrong_again_siding_with_exclusion/,"Seattle Times Wrong Again, Siding with Exclusion and Housing Scarcity",/r/BellevueWA/comments/se3f5t/seattle_times_wrong_again_siding_with_exclusion/huwxneg/,0,r/BellevueWA,0,0

I'm with you all the way and adding:

My 2nd major back in college was journalism. It took less than one semester to ""nope"" the hell out of that mess. Before starting on actual journalism classes we had to have 2 semesters of basic college grammar/writing. Journalism 301 (might have been 201; really can't remember) started in on fact gathering including interviews. We were taught that we are employees first who's job is to capture the biggest audience possible. This is accomplished by using facts wrapped up in adjectives and adverbs along with some well placed ""could be"" and ""can happen"" along with ""might go this direction"" type crap.

Part way through the semester I went home and chatted with my dad. He had left the journalism industry in 1986 and still had a considerable amount of knowledge regarding how it worked. So my moral compass was being pushed to the breaking point while in class, he threw that compass on the ground and stomped on it.....and that ended my desire to go into journalism.

"Yeah I've heard that as well, super rich people don't mind giving money away, they just don't want to give it to the government. Valid perspective. And there are a lot of good rich people who do good things. Like Bill. We'll see about Elon.

But I would love to see some more statistics on this. Because I've also heard that estate planners have one heck of a hard time bc people identifier with their money in their old age and tend not to give it away. And the government comes and takes their 15% anyway and the of the idiot children don't lose the money or spend it on the dumbest things, their children do. I forget what the stat was but it's large, maybe 99% of fortunes are lost in 3 generations. But also... that's when we were talking millions, I think today's billion dollar fortunes are somewhat unprecedented.

No, nothing about money is black and white. I don't think that most people understand that it's an invention and created out of thin air and then dispersed through this elaborate system called the economy and government. Currently, we end up with large concentrations of it by some individuals. Fair or unfair, good or bad, hard to say. Better than the gulags. And at the moment nobody can pay to live forever. We don't have to guillotine the rich, we just have to wait, and when the day comes where Bezos or Elon kick the bucket, everyone gets a free steak dinner and then it's back to business as usual.

It's easy for me to say ""tax the 51st million at 80%!"" but then everyone who makes more than 50 million might take up residence in Luxembourg or Dubai or wherever. Not a simple problem at all.

I agree that higher tax brackets could potentially be a good thing, but maybe it just causes people to put more effort into cheating on their taxes in practice? Also, many rich people are philanthropists anyway, which may be a more effective use of the money (especially as the government is notoriously inefficient and wasteful). e.g. Bill Gates's foundation has benefitted humanity greatly - but if that money had gone to taxes, maybe it just means a bigger military budget or something.

"I'm not a ""kill the evil billionaires! We'll all be rich!"" type liberal. But it looks like they got him for the max 40.8%. Which is just 5.8% more than people that make 200k+. 37% for about 500k and up. Yup that's a lot of taxes. But there should be a couple more levels, at 5 mil, 10, 50, etc. If tax revenue stayed the same, then all those lower levels (the middle class) could pay a little less. So I'm not an ""off with their heads! To the gulags!"" type but I do think the uber wealthy could pay a little more on their 21st or 101st million.

Also it looks Elon paid peanuts these last couple years. It's like this 11 bil payment is a (rather expensive) publicity stunt. Could he have avoided that if he had made some type of investment?

I was born in the 70s. Growing up I consistently saw TV and newspaper reporters seek out the stupidest, least informed person, the most sensational and poorly timed misfortune, to get a headline.

I wouldn't speak to a reporter on anything. They just want to make a fool of you.

From the interview:

""But you don't know EVERYTHING.""

""No, of course not. But we used best practices for the research...""

""But it's possible you are wrong.""

""It's unlikely that this research...""

""Do you think you don't make mistakes?""

Etc

We've all seen interviews of this type. Nobody wants to talk to someone like that.

In fact I left the public sector in part due to the sheer lack of moral support from my community. I didn't expect to be lauded but at every turn we constantly were berated as wasteful idiots in the press.

"For 2k you can probably get a bigger place. Honestly if you don't want the amenities of these Big Brand corporate apartments, you can get a much better deal if you forgo the gym / ""meeting common room"" or whatever else these places have that are rarely used (and being immunocompromised you may not like using this stuff anyway).

If you are okay paying big bucks and getting kinda ripped off by these corporate apartments, then the safest bet if you must get one sight-unseen is to go with them, but keep an eye out for condos that are rented by an owner (usually through a property management agency) for later. You can also rent these big corp apartments for a shorter term if you want and then move earlier.

Crossroads is definitely cheaper and poorer but I'm willing to bet the link provided below is primarily domestic violence / altercations between people who know one another.

With that said based on your personal preferences I would recommend downtown. It's quiet, great transport directly to SLU and less dense.

"A few answers...

1. Tech is driving the value of homes. Of course you also have MANY successful companies based here (Costco, T-Mobile,  Starbucks and many others). It should be noted that unlike Texas that has an endless opportunity for urban sprawl, the water and mountains limit sprawl dramatically. Buildable land is hard to find. I live South Bellevue where it's not uncommon for a 1k beat down rambler to sell for 650k as a tear down to put 2 new houses.

2. I grew up in Bothell. It's a very nice and safe community going through a massive growth phase.

3. $85k is on the low end of where I'd say you'd be comfortable on the Eastside. While we have no income tax we do have 10%+ sales tax on the Eastside. Be prepared to have nearly everything you consume be more expensive in the area. Restaurants, fuel, automotive repair etc will all be higher than Texas.

4. Traffic. Beware that a drive from Bothell to Bellevue can take 30-40 minutes each way during rush hour. Ensure you take the commute time into consideration where you choose to live.",t2_65i2t4vt,Development-Alive,0,1642915891.0,0,t1_htugku8,htugku8,False,slp2be7,t3_sab5iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/sab5iw/what_salary_do_you_feel_is_needed_to_be/,"What salary do you feel is needed to be comfortable on the east side of Seattle (Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland)?",/r/BellevueWA/comments/sab5iw/what_salary_do_you_feel_is_needed_to_be/htugku8/,3,r/BellevueWA,0,3

"A lot of what you're asking depends on what you consider comfortable. Apartments for $2,000/month with dogs will mean my neighborhood and the surrounding area. Look into Lake Hills, Crossroads and Overlake for places. [Here's a map](https://bellevuewa.gov/city-government/departments/community-development/neighborhoods/neighborhood-improvement/neighborhood-enhancement-program/neighborhood-areas) of different neighborhoods. While these are cheaper areas the city is very nice.

Housing will be a major expense but other things to keep in mind are gas prices (currently $4/gallon) and food. I drive an econobox around 15k miles/year; $2,000/year gas cost. Before my current car we had a F-150 and spent around $5,500/year on gas. Insurance is actually very similar between the two. Annual tabs run about $600/year.

Costco sells frozen chicken breasts for $2/pound if you get a 10 pound bag. Safeway, Fred Meyer and other major retailers are selling 15% fat hamburger for $8/pound. Fresh produce is spendy (I just paid $6 for 1 pound of strawberries, organic was more expensive). Walmart has good deals fairly often but their meat is terrible. If you're into bulk items, can enjoy beans and rice and don't eat much food won't be a concern. I'm feeding two teens and spend a bit over $2k/month at grocery stores.

Entertainment is variable. Movie tickets run around $12-$15 depending on theater; pop and popcorn will set you back $15. Eating out starts around $8 for an inexpensive bowl of Pho; $16 (per person) for a sit down Red Robin style place and over $100/person at higher end places. 

I did design work at Boeing when I moved here. My wife was doing development work on Office at MS when we met back in 2001. I'm a stay at home dad and she's still doing dev work but at a different company. She bought our house in 1996 with her now ex-husband. 

Given a $80k/year salary you could own a condo in a couple years if you're frugal and really try to put a down payment away. A single family home might be a bit of a stretch but there are a lot of pretty nice condo's in the high $200k to mid $300k range.

Not to be nosy but I'm going to assume you're coming here with an offer from some place like the school district, maybe Kindering Center or Seattle Children's Hospital. Our SLP ""retired"" from Kindering Center when she built up enough of a private client base to live off it. While business taxes are pretty stiff around here for people like her it's still a lot better pay than elsewhere. Many insurance companies pay for private therapy.

"Having lived in this region for 20+ years, I feel the same way. Cat Conv thefts rose 1600% in the past years and only now the WA leg. wants WSP to do ""something about it."" But you know how the WA leg. got involved at all? A WA states representatives' church vans got hit with cat conv theft. Isn't that sad that it has to impact a WA leg. before they consider even acting on this? Last year, they were all about useless bills limiting police powers and such, meanwhile criminals took it as a sign that WA is lenient on crime. This was obvious that a massive rise in crime is the end result. And CA GOV Newsom went to the rail yard where thieves stole a bunch of packages destined to Seattle... how is it that only now they are thinking about it and scratching their heads.

My only hope is that if we raise some awareness, voters can effect change by picking candidates that do their job seriously for all the people, and not only to cover their own butt, or follow stupid/useless fads that only serve a small part of the population. Crime impacts everyone. Similar to what happened in Seattle when progressives lost to more strict on crime Mayor, etc.

P.S. I've literally been in conversations where people say INSURANCE will cover it, which it does, sometimes; but your rates GO UP. In Seattle PRICES have went up.
