I don't know any ICT5/6 from Apple that doesn't own a 2 million dollar+ home.

For an ICT6 a 200k refresher vesting over four years is nothing. 200k vesting in one year is more like it. For an ICT4 200k vesting over 4 years is likely and I think ICT5s have something like around 380/400 vesting over 4 years as refresher.

"Corporate landlords tend to have set prices for all standard units and will have a price increase schedule. Small-time landlords tend to value long-time renters. My experience thus far has always been a rental increase at a corporate place, and always at least one non-increase when I've actually met the owner. My experience is only my own and my sample size is small.

A big enough organization has staff to deal with issues, and a big enough organization is always dealing with issues. For them it's 100% business. Someone isn't paying? Lawyer is already on retainer, lawyer will file for eviction on the dot per state and local law, sheriffs will show up on the dot per state and local law, and a work order will be filed and executed to turn the place around. It might cost a bit more or less but if it's run professionally it's by-the-books, all according to state and local law; if not, they'll fuck with you for money and dare you to sue them; either way they don't care.

If you've actually met the owner, they have a stake in the game that isn't purely business. In the same way that a larger business needs to allocate capital, a small-time owner needs to allocate their personal time and mental energy. A large landlord is bound by access to capital and demands of returns on that capital: if you take a company that has a thousand units and double their collateral and double their access to credit, they'll buy another thousand units - all being equal - and hire more people to deal with them. On the flip side, any person who deals with units themselves has only so much time and energy to deal with issues; you can double their access to credit and they may do nothing with it because they don't want to (or cannot afford to) move from being hands-on to hiring people for every problem. So for those people, being a non-problematic tenant is lovely, because they don't have to spend any of their most limited resource on you. In return, it would behoove them to leave a bit of money on the table, since it's not their most critical resource. They don't always, but they do often.

It's kind of similar to credit card issuers - people will claim that banks love folk who only pay the minimum payment and carry a large balance. On first glance, it works out - a person who carries a $30k balance and pays 19.9% interest is a lot more profitable than a person who carries no balance and pays no interest, using their card normally. But on a deeper glance, the bank backing a credit card needs to manage risk of default; the cash on hand they need to have for their internal risk models and external auditors and regulators to be happy is far higher for a person who carries a large balance and pays the minimum. For the same risk profile, they can have thirty people who carry no balance, and their usage fees charged to vendors will add up to a lot more than interest from one person. A small-time landlord would prefer to make $15,000 off ten people who require a certain amount of time and effort, than $2,000 off one person who requires the same amount of time and effort; they'll try to cultivate many very low-effort tenants than deal with riskier tenants who pay modestly more.

Of course all of that no longer applies when you deal with slum-lords who don't bother fixing anything anyways. They don't give a fuck. Learn your state and local rental rights. Read your lease. Your state and/or city will almost always have a government-funded, free-for-you resource board to help you fight for your rights. Many states have treble-damages clauses when the landlord is uncooperative and/or passes deadlines.

"I went to a public school in San Jose and I feel like our school was \*less\* competitive than the average Bay Area HS. 

My senior year, our graduating class did a survey and published the results in our school newspaper showing where we intended to go after HS and the numbers were something like this (all numbers are rough estimates just to make a point of the demographics):

Ivy league university: 1

Stanford: 2

UCLA: 7 (I was one of these. Go Bruins!)

Cal: 19

UC Davis: 4

Other UC school: 7

SJSU: 47

Other CSU: 29

Out of state university: 12

West Valley: 127

De Anza: 278

Other (no university, work, etc.): 89

The vast majority of our graduating class was looking at either community college or no university at all. It was actually a minority of us who were looking at 4-year universities. Now, many of those community college attendees may have planned to take their general education courses before transferring to SJSU or other universities, but I feel overall, there was some immense pressure on some students to really do well and go to a good college, but that was a small number of us. 

However, with a lot of social media trends, I feel like there's definitely some selection bias going on here and you won't hear about kids who don't feel immense pressure to succeed. Those experiences don't make for very interesting video shorts.

"I live in Santa Cruz - I‚Äôve been stuck in this apartment for more than 7 years lol.  I could rally the tenets but we are genuinely terrified since the new management took over about 3 years ago- if we mail our check (I do bill pay so it‚Äôs deducted from my account and tracked) they don‚Äôt ‚Äúcheck their mail box‚Äù and if we do mail it in for this reason, we get 3 day or quit notices- they force us into paying on line.  It‚Äôs been incredible.  

The last time I mailed it- it happened to fall before a holiday like Christmas or thanksgiving (I made a post I can scroll back in my profile) because funds are already deducted with bill pay I think nothing of it.  I get a 3 day or quit posted up, then they all leave the office a few days early for the holiday- then it was a holiday weekend.  My bank showed it was delivered I show management this but they say too bad, cancel the check with the bank (quite the big deal with the credit) and pay on line or else.  So I do (I‚Äôm out now 2x because the credit took a bit to come through over the holiday weekend.   Anyway then literally A MONTH LATER they finally check the mail.  They then try to cash the check they had me cancel saying they never got it- then tried to evict me again (I also paid that months rent online too I wasn‚Äôt behind) but they tried to cash the canceled  check.  I had to spend hours trying to get ahold of corporate yet again to show them ‚ÄúI sent you check number xyz on 11/30/2020 (or whatever it was) you claimed you didn‚Äôt receive it and had me cancel the check as you can see here‚Äù thank GOD I take screen shots of literally EVERYTHING because the whole experience has traumatized me.   

Beginning of this year my husband had a major medical issue where he was hospitalized for a few weeks.  I was meeting with neurologists and living in a hospital parking lot for a week.  Meanwhile at home my garbage disposal exploded and I explained to the land lord I won‚Äôt be home I‚Äôm at the hospital, explained my husbands life altering and threatening medical issue, I made sure there was access and there was no property damage while giving access to repair.  I forgot to make my payment for the first time in literally 7 years I was actually late.  Sure as shit on the 6th day I came home from the hospital for a shower and change of clothes and had a 3 day or quit on my door.  I was literally fuming.  I was technically one day late and my landlord totally knew of everything in detail because I had to work out access for a major repair in between thinking I was saying my last goodbyes to my husband.  

I was told by an ex employee of the corporate office it‚Äôs how they legally evict people that have been in there forever (mailing checks) to churn apartments for higher profits- they pretend like they don‚Äôt get the check and just never check their mail- then pop on 3day or quits in hopes it lands on a door over a long weekend / whatever and the person can‚Äôt double pay the funds or isn‚Äôt knowledgeable enough about how to dispute it with the bank.",t2_138ip7,Canonconstructor,0,1648262740.0,0,t1_i25dans,i25dans,False,txiao007,t3_tnu41v,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tnu41v/national_median_cost_of_rent_jumped_17_since_last/,"National median cost of rent jumped 17% since last year, hitting a new record",/r/bayarea/comments/tnu41v/national_median_cost_of_rent_jumped_17_since_last/i25dans/,3,r/bayarea,0,3

"Public high school in Cupertino. Felt like my experience was extremely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Only remember your typical teenage challenges, nothing crazy. Didn‚Äôt feel like it was an insane or toxic amount of academic pressure. Getting into a good state school (Cal, UCLA, UCSD, etc.) seemed generally achievable without extraordinary measures as long as I put in the work. Ivy or Stanford was a stretch but I was aiming for the good state schools anyways for financial reasons.

I think in terms of a pressure cooker environment, family is a huge part of it, much more so than anything about the schools itself. For a lot of East and SE Asians in the area there‚Äôs a huge cultural aspect and pressure from the parents.

I‚Äôm from a middle class family and was a decent academic performer. My parents were generally pretty relaxed and put a lot of trust in me when it came to academics. Felt like my friends and schoolmates were also middle class, no extreme wealth inequality that was obvious, at least. Student body wasn‚Äôt terribly diverse. Majority white and Asian.

This was 15 years ago though so things may have changed dramatically since. It wasn‚Äôt until I was an adult that I realized how well-resourced my K-12 was and that the quality of public education I had access to was not the norm nationwide. In facts it‚Äôs pretty abysmal in most places. I feel really lucky to have gone to the school I did at the time I did.

"> and no longer have to worry about rent increases.

Congrats on being a home buyer, but I feel like these stories completely miss the point and they're upvoted for headlines and for % increases. [Rent today is just around or a little below pre-COVID times](https://www.zumper.com/rent-research/san-jose-ca).

I'm not disputing that rent is high in the Bay Area, but headlines of increases or dramatic negative effects get all the coverage here, but hardly any celebration or fanfare made when rents dropped 20-25% during the pandemic. My point is these year-over-year increases get a lot of coverage, but zoom out. What matters is how bad is rent today compared to 2019.

"These statements are there before the one you take issue with:

> Tuesday during a criminal case in Solano County Superior Court that he and another officer in Concord came up with the idea for officers to bend their badges following a shooting. 

and

> Tribble clarified during his testimony Tuesday that the practice was not specific to fatal shootings and badges were bent for any officers who were involved in shootings. 

and

> Tribble bent the badges belonging to Komoda and Officer David McLaughlin following a 2016 incident when they fired into a vehicle. He testified that he also bent Officer Josh Coleman‚Äôs badge and that Coleman bent Officer Zach Jacobsen‚Äôs badge in late 2017 or early 2018. Jacobsen shot and killed Angel Ramos in 2017 and was involved in another shooting along with four other officers later that year, but Tribble did not recall specifically which shooting Coleman bent Jacobsen‚Äôs badge for.

and 

> Coleman disputed Tribble‚Äôs account in testimony later in the day saying that he did not have any knowledge of badge bending after Tribble bent his badge following a shooting in 2013. 

I don't see how the emphasis is on modification of the badge.

"Raising rates won't do anything to resolve the supply chain shortages we're experiencing, it won't increase housing inventory, and it won't reverse the trillions of dollars congress distributed to avoid a recession during Covid. Raising rates too aggressively could compound those factors and make the impact of the Russo-Ukrainian war worse.

The recession that followed the oil shocks in the 70s was made considerably worse by bad policy decisions to raise rates too aggressively. We shouldn't repeat that mistake now.

Edit: I will add rates should have never been this low. We should have raised rates and corporate taxes during the last 10 years during the booming economy so we would have more tools in our tool belt to fight recessions.

"I Finally got to that snartasset article. This bothers me...

>Older millennials take a hit on the West Coast.¬†High *income taxes* are nearly unavoidable for many adults between the ages of 25 and 44 who live in Portland, Oregon and some of the *biggest cities in California*.

Ca doesn't have significant city/local taxes.

So if they are saying that millenials in ca cities are paying high income tax, they are talking about *highly paid* millenials.

But the article groups them all together, as if millenials in Iowa earning $45k should be compared to millenials in LA earning $250k.

People pay higher income tax, on average, in San Francisco because they earn more, not because taxes are higher there than in Amador County.",t2_k1mhyi77,MrsMiterSaw,0,1648253338.0,0,t1_i24u6j8,i24u6j8,False,bearsoski,t3_tnddqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tnddqe/bay_area_native_balanced_view_of_our_little/,Bay Area native - balanced view of our little bubble we call home,/r/bayarea/comments/tnddqe/bay_area_native_balanced_view_of_our_little/i24u6j8/,1,r/bayarea,0,1

"> The testimony provides the clearest look yet into the practice of badge bending.

Vallejo Sun needs to do better job in writing accurately.

It's not ""the practice of badge bending."" 

It's the practice of officers of the law celebrating that they fired their service weapon while on duty.

Which isn't something to celebrate. Which is why there are no awards handed out simply for firing one's service weapon, or even being in a situation in which one needed to fire one's service weapon. 

Look at how these guys act like overgrown children reducing police work to schoolyard cops and robbers play:

"I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that. Maybe my previous response was oversimplified.

I think most types of industries trading in specific goods have pockets of fraud/theft/etc.

I mean, people shoplift 70-cent candy bars from stores, and it‚Äôs common and well-known. Does that mean that trading, selling, and/or creating candy bars is automatically a path that will lead one to get caught up in fraudulent activities as a means of income? Not necessarily.

I think you can point to fraud in almost anything, but there‚Äôs also a lot of legitimate economic opportunity in almost anything if one knows where and how to look.

Granted, there are some things like consumer electronics, which is a combination of both high value and highly commoditized (an iPhone has the potential to bring utility to a much larger percentage of people than a golf club), so the market is bigger, and thus it‚Äôs easier to get stolen items off one‚Äôs hands and easier to blend in anonymously in a larger setting. So flipping consumer electronics, it‚Äôs very hard to make good money while concurrently keeping oneself clean from all the fraud and other stuff going on, there‚Äôs a lot to lose, and not as much to gain (since profit margins are lower)

But most other goods, there are ways to get into it where it‚Äôs mostly just honest ordinary people looking for a convenient way to buy what they want for personal use, or it‚Äôs something that a person needs for their occupation (mechanics need tools and parts, gyms need workout equipment, offices need printers, electricians need light bulbs and switches and wires, etc etc)",t2_ehy237c5,Baller_of_ballers,0,1648242854.0,0,t1_i246rc5,i246rc5,False,thedoggfather408,t3_tnvkdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tnvkdo/work_with_only_a_hs_diploma/,Work with only a HS diploma,/r/bayarea/comments/tnvkdo/work_with_only_a_hs_diploma/i246rc5/,1,r/bayarea,0,1

But if someone is selling you a bicycle at a yard sale for $5-10 that is literally at their home address that you can see with your eyes and has been posted on Craigslist and Facebook, do you really think the seller knowingly stole it or knowingly received a stolen bike? Do you really think someone fencing stolen bikes would choose a public yard sale with their private home address visible, on public social media outlets with their home address visible, as the platform by which to sell stolen bikes?

Compare that to some guy on a city street corner trying to sell the bicycle for $30-50.

Same goes with electronics.

It‚Äôs really about the context and intent, more than any broad generalization.

I‚Äôve found a way to make a good living income for myself. But economically-speaking there‚Äôs nothing much to lose.

You could spend $20 at a few yard sales, and if it doesn‚Äôt work out, you lose $20.

You could also spend $30,000 on a UC four-year tuition and bachelor‚Äôs degree, and when it turns out that it doesn‚Äôt really make much of a difference for hiring decisions in your industry, and you would‚Äôve been either hired or rejected regardless, well that‚Äôs a loss of $30,000.

If you spent money on a degree and it gave you more value, monetary or otherwise, to where it was worth the $30,000 or $5,000 or whatever amount, then I‚Äôm happy for you.",t2_ehy237c5,Baller_of_ballers,0,1648239732.0,0,t1_i23z7tb,i23z7tb,False,thedoggfather408,t3_tnvkdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tnvkdo/work_with_only_a_hs_diploma/,Work with only a HS diploma,/r/bayarea/comments/tnvkdo/work_with_only_a_hs_diploma/i23z7tb/,2,r/bayarea,0,2

"Hmm. Using made-up numbers here just for convenience:

Let's say we have a one square mile area in which 5000 people live, and fifty crimes happen annually, or one crime for every hundred residents.

Let us say that we also have another one square mile area in which 50,000 people live, and 500 crimes happen annually, or one crime for every hundred residents.

Both of those two areas have the exact same per capita crime rate, but you are far more likely to be a victim of crime in the second area because there are far more crimes being committed. I don't think saying 'It's just math' is actually supportive of your point at all. 

The truth of the matter is that statistics are clear, in that dense urban areas have a far higher crime rates than sparsely populated ones too.

"I find most mom and pop landlords don't find going aggressive on rent increases worth it, especially if they don't have scale to take on vacancy.

Much better to have a good tenant that pays rent on time. If the rental sits vacant for just one month, that is 1/12 or 8% lost right there in annual income. You need to increase rents at least 8% to make it worth it. Worse if it's vacant for more than a month.

"""Simone Manganelli is a Muni rider who, as former member of the city‚Äôs civil grand jury, examined the project‚Äôs delays last summer in a critical report. He plans to take the first BRT ride. 'I‚Äôm really hoping that, despite it being a really long, drawn-out process, that the city will see the benefits,' he said.

""Conclusion
Given the importance and prominent visibility of the corridor, the Van Ness Project has been
watched closely by the public from its beginning. The ongoing delay in project completion
and the multiple reported completion dates have damaged the public‚Äôs confidence in SFMTA
to keep its promises. It is understandable that a project of this magnitude and complexity
would take many years to plan and construct. But the missteps during the planning and
preconstruction phases that eventually impacted construction adversely affected users of the
roadway as well as residents and businesses along the corridor.
The Jury identified multiple missed opportunities to predict the cost and duration of the
project accurately. Mistakes that happened early in the planning and design phases were
compounded as the project progressed. While it is true that the unexpected condition of
the underground infrastructure is the primary cause of the delay, more work could have been
done to anticipate what actually lay beneath the surface, and much of the delay could have
been avoided.
Although it is too late to correct these deficiencies on the Van Ness Project, the City should
take steps to ensure the same mistakes do not occur in the future. The Jury‚Äôs findings and
recommendations are listed below.",t2_ipwq8anr,BadBoyMikeBarnes,0,1648238079.0,0,t1_i23v3v7,i23v3v7,True,BadBoyMikeBarnes,t3_tnxkd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tnxkd6/it_took_27_years_and_300_million_will_sf_van_ness/,It took 27 years and $300 million.

Let's talk about this. Do you think you're just more exposed personally because you're better positioned yourself? Most of us are seeing a decline in diversity in things like culture, no matter how you define it. 

At times we've seen the region benefit from the infusions, and new money was giving back to the arts or investing in new restaurants. I don't see that right now, it's more of an exit strategy approach, or the money is going into politics instead. Things like the lack of mid priced menus is painful, since you also mentioned restaurants. Small business is struggling. The cost to go out is prohibitive for many people, and the desire doesn't seem to be there either.

Not to mention all the neighbors that sell home made tamales, enchiladas, pupusas.  
The weather is overall great. I remember asking my parents and grandparents if they would move back to their home country for retirement and what struck me was their answer, ""To visit yes, to live maybe not. It's so hot back there.""

> In the 60s and 70s how much housing was developed absolutely was a large factor in reducing prices.

In the 60s and 70s much of that development was not for landlords, between section 8, coops and the fact that capital was not as concentrated, there was less money to be made in landlordism.

It wasn't the quantity of housing, it was the fact that it was a viable alternative to private rent that had the most impact, this is the same when you look at Vienna & Singapore, once landlord's don't have a guaranteed pool of tenants, there isn't the upwards pressure on house prices they create (there are still ofc other problems, but CA population has grown 60% since the 1980, yet house prices have grown by 500%)

> We could reverse them and have similar housing booms, and it would absolutely be a significant force in driving down housing cost.

I just don't think it's realistic, market rate housing has very little impact on house prices because demand isn't just from people living here, it's also massively amplified by landlords who are able to collectively buy up the majority of housing at very low risk to themselves, so paying far above what others can.",t2_g4swkdum,rioting-pacifist,0,1648234390.0,0,t1_i23m300,i23m300,False,FogHawk,t3_tmnylr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tmnylr/what_bay_area_city_has_changed_the_most_since/,What Bay Area city has changed the most since your childhood ?,/r/bayarea/comments/tmnylr/what_bay_area_city_has_changed_the_most_since/i23m300/,1,r/bayarea,0,1

">Violent crime is lower per-capita in dense areas than sparse areas, nationwide.

Just to discuss this one point, per capita is a bad way to look at crime. It doesn't matter to someone how many people are living in their area if there's high crime, it matters how much crime is occuring in the area, and dense areas have far more occurrences than sparsely populated ones do.  The fact that the per capita number of crimes is lower in dense areas doesn't change the fact that the total number of crimes are far higher.

I think your argument boils down to asking people to ignore or even exacerbate negative factors that affect them in favor of (maybe?) correcting negative factors that affect others. I think that's pretty naive, because humans generally don't do that.  

I for one have no belief that any reasonable amount of building of new units will actually bring down prices in the area, because demand outstrips supply to a tremendous amount. You could add hundreds of thousands of new units in the Bay area and barely dent the demand, because adding new units also adds new demand as people look to move into the area. Strongly suspect that what we will end up with is a extremely dense place that is still quite unaffordable, and that is the worst of all outcomes for property owners here.

Given the fact that human life and citizen activity only accounts for an extremely small amount of the factors that push climate change, I can't agree that we should prioritize cramming people into extraordinarily dense situations instead of going after the primary polluters, IE, coal oil and gas production and heavy industry. This is sort of like California telling individual citizens to cut their water use by 50% while absolutely ignoring the fact that industry wastes water profligetly in the state",t2_5o29y07s,Havetologintovote,0,1648231205.0,0,t1_i23e2cw,i23e2cw,False,bearsoski,t3_tnddqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tnddqe/bay_area_native_balanced_view_of_our_little/,Bay Area native - balanced view of our little bubble we call home,/r/bayarea/comments/tnddqe/bay_area_native_balanced_view_of_our_little/i23e2cw/,1,r/bayarea,0,1

"That's not a fact. Liberalizing land use is good for land values even as housing unit prices can come down. Violent crime is lower per-capita in dense areas than sparse areas, nationwide.
