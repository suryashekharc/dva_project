"I've lived here for 9 years and haven't had much of a problem with neighbors or noise. The most consistent issue has had to do with the elevators and cooling.

It seems every few years the elevators decide that everything is going to break and replacement parts would take forever to arrive. Most recently, one elevator went down for 4 weeks over the holidays. It was fixed early in the new year only for the other to break the following week, which took an additional 6 weeks. How Batistella decided that 2 elevators would be enough for a 22-floor building is beyond me.

There were issues with the cooling system last year which caused it to be only half functioning during those heat waves. It was grossly uncomfortable and made much worse when you consider that every unit has floor-to-ceiling windows.

All in all, does the building have its fair share of problems? Yeah, I'd say so. But board does a reasonable job (as far as I can tell) and the property management company ultimately comes down to who the property manager is, not the company itself.

"I have bought a few vehicles from Regal Auctions, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you have the expectation that you can do your own repairs and/or you're going to drive the vehicle into the ground. The reason they're at auction, finance repos aside, is for a quick private sale or a trade-in the dealership doesn't want to deal with. That being said, if you can get some killer deals on end of life vehicles.

Avoid anything ""luxury"" over 10 years old. The cost of repairs is going to be higher (flip side is the maintenance was more likely to be done).  Most modern cars will last 10+ years if maintenance was performed, but you'll need to google vehicle specific quirks, like model specific transmission or engine issues. Don't buy the first year of a new model, as its most likely to have the most bugs. Honda and Toyota are always top rated.

"You will need to take a course for your non restricted and (optional but recommended) restricted and apply for your PAL (possession and acquisition license) in order to buy firearms or ammunition. Taking these courses will help with the legal aspects that are required as a firearms owner like safe storage and will also help with many safety aspects like how to safely load and unload firearms and how to identify which ammo is required. This course is not necessary to fire a firearm but you should take it as soon as possible because being approved for your PAL can take up to a year now and once you start shooting you will most likely be hooked and want to start buying firearms ASAP. 

I would also try to find a friend or relative with their PAL to take you out to shoot as you may feel more comfortable with someone you know teaching you and it will be much cheaper.

You can also check out r/Canadaguns to check out the firearms culture in Canada and see and ask Canada specific questions relating to firearms.

Lastly, if you don't know anyone with firearms many people in this community will gladly help you get started and are open to taking out new people to the sport so don't be afraid to ask.

"Ya his face is ridiculous, LOL he’s just a big old melon head. He has literally fallen out of bed three times today alone. The way he wakes me up
In the morning is to stand over me and stick his nose in my mouth! I wish I could catch a video as it’s soooo funny. He has his moments but we’re going to  obedience school together as I’m a firm believer if you have a powerful dog you need to be able to control them. If you need a good school I really recommend Kayenna Kennels. Bob is one of the instructors for obedience and he is wonderful. He uses a force free method of training and is very gentle. I attended obedience with my old guy and it was one of the positive ways we bonded together. Might be worth while to look into. The instructors to see so many little things that you don’t catch in yourself doing with your dog it really has helped me a lot. And I thought I was fairly decent but even going back with this new dog I’m really picking up lots of little nuances in my training with him.

Regarding vets my previous dog had so many health issues that I jokingly wanted to put a sign up at my house that said it’s been 26 days since our last vet visit. Through that I got to know a lot of different veterinarian services/vets here in Calgary. I live in the south east and I had to essentially work with the vet clinic that had a 24 hour component to it because they were times I was in there at 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning when things with the wrong. I use to go to FishCreek Animal hospital, but they were bought out, are no longer open 24 hours and honestly I felt like the quality of their service really changed. But the good news was, while there, I started working with a Dr, named Dan Katz and he is outstanding. After he left, I put on my detective hat and I was able to track him down to his new clinic. He’s moved to the Alpine 24 hour animal hospital which is right by Chinook, next-door to the Goodwill. 

I have ended up needing to use them many times in the last year and a half and even when I didn’t necessarily deal with Dan, every doctor in there I dealt with was outstanding. They all really went above and beyond for me on multiple occasions. It’s one of the few vet clinics left in Calgary thats privately owned, So you’re not dealing with all these big corporate policies around how they handle things. I have absolutely no qualms in recommending them, and certainly recommending Dan.

"I’m also sorry for your loss, these little creatures capture our hearts and souls for sure. You’re absolutely right on the patience thing with these rescue dogs. I honestly don’t know if I could’ve handled him 20 years ago. I had to let a lot of stuff go initially. He would use peeing in the house as a bit of a dominance /power thing. So I would just buy pee pads at the dollar store and put them in the areas that he would go. Then if he would pee on them or pee in the house I wouldn’t acknowledge him, I would just clean it up and throw it away. I could see him watching me and I would say after the first six months he hardly ever had accidents in the house anymore because it didn’t evoke a reaction like in his previous home. 

What I will tell you from my experience is it takes a while for these dogs to learn how to trust, and to learn how to just be a dog. I honestly saw changes in my dog almost up till he died. I Mean simple things like cuddling up next to me didn’t happen until four years into me owning him. I think the greatest gift you can give your dog is the ability to do it on their own time schedule. I had a great vet tell me with my rescue cat to remember that they don’t have linear thinking. They don’t look at you and “say she fed me yesterday, she fed me today, she’ll feed me tomorrow” it takes a very long time if ever for them to get through some of this stuff. That kind of took some of the pressure off. A great sub that you might want to follow is r/reactivedogs. Lots of people going through what you’re going through, great suggestions and helpful place to turn for tips if you need it. Please feel free to post a pic, I would love to dare her. 

What I didn’t add in the story was, my always super healthy cat passed very suddenly 3 days before Christmas. To go from a 2 pet house to a no pet house in 3 weeks was too much. Soooooo I have started fostering an Olde English Bulldogge puppy about 2 months ago. He has been a bit of a balm to my loss for sure. He makes me get out of bed each day and keeps me going. My Apple Watch sure noticed, lol. It keeps messaging me, hey you’re walking faster, hey your heart rates up, hey you’re walking further! Yes it’s because I’m being dragged around the neighbourhood by my dog.

"Hey, I work for AHS making calls to people with new diagnosis of COVID (as of right now it's only healthcare workers and those involved with congregate care / acute care settings). 

If I were calling you to inform you of your result and review your symptoms, etc. This is sort of what I would tell you:


- because you had symptoms starting yesterday, we would consider that Day 0 of your COVID isolation period. If you are fully vaccinated you would isolate for 5 days. Last day of isolation would be March 29, March 30th you can return to school, etc. You must maintain mask wearing when outside your home for the 5 days following your isolation. (10 days of isolation if not vaccinated). All of this assumes your symptoms don't persist or worsen. This is a legal requirement and it means no leaving your property. Visit alberta.ca/covid-19 for more details on isolation. 


- for notification, you are transmissible from 2 days before your symptoms started to the end of isolation. So if you hung out with anyone in that period you should let them know to test or at least watch for symptoms. Yes, let your school know. I would recommend calling your doc if you have questions about symptoms, or if you don't have family doc call 811. 


- same with discussing treatment, doctor is your best bet. If you are immunocompromised or unvaccinated, you may want to look into available monoclonal treatment. But if not, this treatment won't help you.

"I was looking into going south for dental work a couple years ago and came to the conclusion that should an issue arise it wasn’t worth it for me. 

I don’t know The doctors name but apparently there’s a doctor in Calgary that books medical suites somewhere in the Caribbean and he will take his patients down there perform the surgeries while they’re on vacation and then he’ll provide all the aftercare once they come back to Calgary. This way he can actually get surgical time, which he can’t get easily here and his clients get the procedures done in a more timely manner. Of course this was pre-Covid so I’m sure nothing has happened in the last 2 to 3 years.

I'm not fear mongering at all, the city is just full of liberal idiots who would eat a bowl of shit if you told them it would cure cancer for fuck sake. You clearly haven't been here long enough, let alone lived in Forest Lawn.

I've lived here my entire life, and I can't count on my fingers and toes all the crimes that have taken place here... not to mention all the ones I was close to, that I couldn't fucking believe happened at all.

Besides, I already said it likely doesn't compare to some US cities. Older, more time for people to move in and fuck the place up.

I'm not saying Calgary is Detroit, nor am I saying it's any bit as seedy as Staten Island. Hell, it's not even as seedy as the suburb 10 mins from where my buddy works out in Georgia. Shit, you can go to Fort Mac and it's worse than here. GRANTED.

"Oh come on now I seriously doubt that's what the implication was. Hear me out:

To me I read it as if you're afraid of getting stabbed in Calgary,living in a big city probably isnt a good choice. Its not saying if you go to x part of town you are going to/deserve to get hurt.
 it's more about if you think calgary is that dangerous you shouldn't live in a big city.


It's seemed more like they were saying something along the lines of  "" if you're afraid of tsunamis you shouldn't live by the ocean."" It's not saying people who died in a tsunami had it coming. It's saying for your own mental well-being you shouldn't live by the ocean if itscares you

You are literally doing the exact thing this person was suggesting. You don't feel safe in the city so you're moving. 

Now should I assume you're implying that we deserve to get stabbed because we choose to live here? No, of course not.

What do you think is on my mind?  You don't have a damn clue, stop making assumptions. 

I'm not trying to attack you here and I genuinely don't think that other commenter intended to victim blame. If I thought they were I would be on your side

I saw your other comment on this thread  where you explicitly stated that you want to smash addicts faces into windows. 

You say something like that and yet somehow you're judging others others for being callous and dehumanizing? It seems like you're just projecting your worldview onto others.

"It depends on who's interpretation is being used.  For example, the common phrase 'eye for an eye' is often quoted by people to pursue harsh punishment on people who wronged them or other.  Such as in defense of the death penalty. Pretty straight forward right? Lots of Christians do just that.

However, a learned theologian would have a little context that changes the meaning.  When 'eye for an eye' was written, punishments were wildly out of whack.  ...Steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving family and they'll chop off your hand sort of thing.

Suddenly that bit of context changes the meaning.  Now the phrase can be understood to be instruction Christians to have mercy on others.  Eye for an eye  now means don't go too far.  Have some compassion for others.  If anyone ever wondered what goes on in all those bible studies that people attend, well now you know.

This is one of the reasons you have to be careful when picking a church.  It's so easy to manipulate people and certainly there's no shortage of bad actors who do just that.  Maybe they decide that they're going to take the Bible literally.  Or use it to justify any nonsense that suits their current political agenda.

But to make a claim that the Bible is simply awful, is at best ignorant.

However, if they value you as a friend they may stop taking about it in your presence to avoid conflict or even pretend they agree with you.  That's about the best you can hope for in the short term.

"So funny that I was reading this post while sitting at the ice skating ring at Olympic Plaza (City Hall). Came from Chinook earlier, was listening to a song so loud while I pass those guys in Chinook, this post made me realize they were preaching about Jesus.

It's 18.14 and like 10 minutes ago, a guy passes by saying can I talk about Jesus? I say No. He tries to still preach. And I say please leave me alone. Then he says are you Muslim? I get so pissed off that I say I am a Satanist as some fellow redditor suggested. Say hail Satan. But still say Stay happy.

I am new to Calgary, just an immigrant in Canada. I am an atheist and I don't care what other people believe in or the lack of belief! But why would you just make assumptions, yell Salam alaikum without even asking? Some people just assume I am an Indian, some say Iranian/ Afghanistan. 

While I love meeting people from different places, just acknowledge that this stranger is just trying to survive here! Came here at City Hall after working in a warehouse from 7 am to 3.30 pm doing hard work and minimum wage. Left with 500 Cad in my account. Staying in an airbnb and don't know where I end up next month, just please keep your love of God to yourself and please don't make any assumptions.

"There's a lot of things I want to say to people who have the thoughts in mind that you do. Truly.

The tone of the comment forms the implication, and the tone is coming directly from the phrasing of the words. Read it a few times. The guy was basically saying that, ""If you don't want to get stabbed, don't go to this part of the city."" which is just horse shit. It's true, but that's where you're laying the blame at the feet of the victim, see? It would be one thing as a warning, but it's just a callous statement devoid of any sort of humanity.

What part of Calgary culture encourages random stabbing? The homeless epidemic that isn't being solved or even attempted at, let alone the drug epidemic that we're facing.

These are deep systemic issues I realize, but that would be the answer to the question. You have to clear up homelessness, you have to clear up the drugs, you have to start looking for real, actionable solutions to these sorts of problems because they directly contribute to crimes, not least of which include random stabbings.

Am I saying that the perp in this case was part of either demographic? Well, I can't say, because I don't know enough about him - what I can say is that we see a lot of this stuff that isn't random, and it tends to pertain to those key issues.

Now, before you go and fly off on the ""So what are you going to do about it?"" tangent... I'll tell you:

Walking with dog poop is one of the things you sign up for when you get a dog. If you're not ready to walk around with a bag full of poop then don't get a dog.

It's also sad that because of the poop situation in Calgary I will likely never let our dog out in any dog run/off leash area, as it's:

[https://www.alberta.ca/fuel-tank-storage.aspx](https://www.alberta.ca/fuel-tank-storage.aspx)

It appears as of 2020 Alberta Safety Codes Authority looks after fuel storage, might have more luck with them to understand if this is an issue or not.

I'm not an expert in this area, but a quick read echoes what most are pointing out here (Diesel is not super flammable) is that if the substance has a flash point below 37.8c it seems to be more regulated, but diesel seems to have a flash point of 52c.

For your piece of mind, contacting the  Alberta Safety Codes Authority should give you that.

The only other angle is environmental impacts of a leak.

"This picture brings up a lot of memories. I remember we rolled up to the location in a limo. We were obnoxiously drunk for a bunch of 18 year olds (well I was 17, but who cares) and looking back on it now, we probably should’ve tipped the driver or apologized for our behaviour.  

We stopped to take a group photo. I tripped and got my pants dirty but I was too buzzed to care. My date was there with her group of friends and I was so excited to dance with her after the convocation. She later ditched me for someone else but that’s life I guess. I spent the time dancing with my mother which I have very fond memories of.

I had a big group of friends. We were very tight knit and we had some great times including this one. Everyone was getting back into the limo and I was the last to go back in and one of them shouted at me to hurry up because I was taking this photo. This was one of the last times we were all together.

"Looking into this further, tracking crimes on a incident per community basis isn't a great measure as communities are so very different, both in geographic size and makeup.  Beltline obviously has the most incidents, but also has the most residents (and lots of businesses), so while it's gonna be a dark color, it doesn't mean you're more likely to be victimized there.  On a per resident basis, the Beltline is in the lower portion of the range.  Likewise, I suspect Shawnessy is being brought up by the inclusion of the Shawnessy power centre and 2 LRT stations and parking lots in its boundary.  It's also a relatively large community at apparently over 9,000 residents.  The 2017-2022 per resident incident rate for Shawnessy was 0.0387 (383 incident/9368 residents), whereas the neighboring Shawnee Slopes community has much fewer at 126 incidents, but a far greater per resident rate (0.066) because it's a smaller community of 1911 residents.

That’s what I thought. I know they don’t want to offer any assistance when there’s a 3rd party. Go figure you can’t ever seem to win. They seem very reluctant with things.

"It's a really bad situation in Canada for this sort of thing, unfortunately. It's the sort of question it would be much better to ask a lawyer, and specifically a Canadian lawyer, about. The same lawyer I plugged earlier actually has at least three videos on dog/bear/whatever spray, the most important two of which I'll link it at the end of this post. These videos are more important than anything I will say below.     

My post was mostly around possession offences: if you are carrying dog spray with the intent to use it for some potential self-defence situation against another person that may or may not materialize, your intent legally transforms it from a dog deterrent into a weapon and then then you are potentially violating the law by carrying a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace regardless of whether you ever end up using it on another person, or even if you hope that you never will. 

If, by contrast, you carry it with the purpose of deterring an attacking dog and end up using it against a dog, it never becomes a weapon, legally. If you carry it with the purpose of deterring an attacking dog and end up using it against a person, it legally becomes a weapon, but the self-defence situation that \_*already\_* exists probably justifies your action. That doesn't mean that you might not end up in legal trouble anyway, at least for a while. 

A third scenario: you carry pepper spray and it is in a bottle that labels it as a self-defence tool or, worse yet, uses the term 'mace' (maybe you got it from the United States). The simple act of putting the same spray in a different bottle has instantly transformed it not just into a weapon, but even into a prohibited weapon: mace is a prohibited weapon in Canada, so that's a specific offence just for having had it at all and it's far easier to prove since the Crown doesn't have to establish your intent, just that you were in possession of the darn thing. (To do the same thing with regular dog spray, the Crown would have to prove both that it was a weapon at the time and that you were carrying it for no good reason. Not so in this case.) Make sure you don't do that. 

Do you think this is stupid? It absolutely is, but that's laws in Canada around weapons. The CPC made a little kick at trying to fix it up a bit (they legislated, for example, that the size, strength, age, sex, etc. of the assailant and of his or her victim(s) must be considered when evaluating the legality of the use of force in a self-defence situation) but it was pretty minor.

"They don't change soiled diapers? Fuck no. That's awful. I wouldn't even think of considering them. That's very strange and it's neglect, is that an official policy or what a review said?


We never asked to stay for the first day or so because we wanted our child to get used to the fact that we would be doing drop off and they would need to acclimatize to that. If anything didn't go well they would call. It's normal for a child to be upset the first little while. They get used to it and it's good for them. 


We were very pleased with brightpath for the first few years of our kids life. I am not sure if they have cameras but they do upload reports every day and were extremely vigiliant if anything happened and we needed to be contacted. After leaving brightpath for Kindergarten transportation reasons we have also been very happy with Active Start as their prices are reasonable, especially with the new changes and their facility is absolutely top notch and the staff are wonderful.


Make sure you apply for subsidy if you're eligible. 


If you have even a minor doubt about a childcare provider, then follow your gut. Don't go with them. We visited many before we found the right one.

"I'm on day 12 of symptoms, it's been pretty rough. Buckley's and Neocitron have been my go to, along with some Tylenol muscle relief for the body aches (be careful though, Buckley's and cold med will also contain acetaminophen, so I was doing one and one, or two of only one product at a time). 

Buy some pedialyte, or other rehydration tablets. 

I have been shocked as to how it's totally wiped my appetite. I only ate smoothies for the first week, dropped 9 lbs in 4 days. The insomnia was strange too - exhausted but it was like I had 10 shots of espresso at the same time. 

Hope it's not as rough for you - hydrate, sleep, take it easy. All you can do.

"Oh thanks for this! What Montessori daycare do you use now if you don’t mind my asking? The staying with him is just to let him become accustomed to the new environment/people before I leave him. From an attachment perspective (the theory, not the parenting approach), it just feels a little intense to stick him with strangers and I’ve noticed if he has some time to meet people and get accustomed to them, he’s much happier to have me disappear. As far as the camera goes, it’s not that I want to watch him play, it’s that I want to be able to check in to see that he’s safe. Like I said, I’ve worked in a daycare, and I found them to be quite rough with the kids (pulling them about by their arms, yelling at them, etc) so I’d like to have that peace of mind that I can login somewhere and see my son is safe and being properly cared for. That might be intense I guess, but I doubt that I’m the only parent who would like this type of assurance. That’s crazy that some Montessori schools don’t allow for imaginative play.

"Firearms can be fun, and I highly encourage you to try them.  Maybe consider a basic rifle for target shooting and then (if you’re comfortable) a handgun.

Like others have suggested, just hit up any gun range and they’ll sort you out (they deal with newcomers ALL the time).

I’ve sent some folks to the Shooting Edge (Blackfoot and Glenmore) and did my training there way back in 2008ish.  I’m sure other ranges are just as good, but I’ve never had a reason to recommend a different place.

Costs…..assume $1.00 per shot and you’ll be fine.  Smaller calibre will be way cheaper, but generally speaking you’ll be in the $0.50 to $1.25 range.  $50 is plenty for a first time.

And don’t hesitate to call ahead.  Like I said, they deal with newcomers all the time, and will make it a positive experience.

"That federal plan you reference happened after Rachel came out with her own carbon tax ""plan"", which she had not told Albertans about. She was elected before he was.  

The federal policy you describe was part of the ""social license"" myth she and Trudeau cooked up, suggesting if Alberta played ball with his anti carbon crusade, he'd look kindly on pipelines. That came after she bagged us with her carbon tax. 

Of course, Alberta got nothing in return because Junior Trudeau politicized the regulatory process, taking pipeline approvals into Cabinet, set up a tanker ban that applies only to Alberta oil, cancelled Northern Gateway, changed the rules to scupper Energy East with end use restrictions that don't apply to Québec cement plants nor Ontario carmakers and then bungled TransMountain. Meanwhile, Biden cancelled Keystone XL, to appease Neil Young and Jane Fonda, after Trump had approved it. 

Rachel got absolutely nada for her cozying up to the Snowboarder in Chief on climate. Sweet FA. She either lied about that social license deal or got swindled. Neither is good. Notice nobody talks about ""social license"" anymore, because it never existed.

That alone disqualifies her from ever leading this province again. Not to mention the power fiasco and the explosion in size of government. 

This book describes the massive failure of Notley's policies:

"We have done a few daycares and are at a Montessori now - I have a few thoughts on that and just some other general ones, these are all subjective:  


1. Not staying with your kid the first few times - I am not sure I understand the advantage of this. The reality is it doesn't matter how many times you stay with them, they are gonna lose their shit the first time you don't (and probably several times after). Kids are very adaptable - it breaks your heart to leave as they are crying, but it doesn't take them long to start playing with other kids. 
2. Dirty diapers - can't provide much insight on this - the one we were at had a ""must be potty trained"" rule. However, we do send them with a change of clothes and they do not call us if there is an accident.  Before that, we were at a daycare that did change diapers.
3. Montessori recommendations - Take a look at a few. When we were evaluating Montessori we quickly learned they can be quite different with their approach. Some of them are extreme montessori and some are more liberal with how the follow the system. The extreme ones seemed a little weird (ie. if your kid wants to pretend they are a dragon they shut it down, because no fantasy). I didn't like the ones that appeared to have a problem with imagination and focused entirely on life skills and the real world.
4. Cameras -  I guess you could go either way on this - my personal opinion is what are you expecting to see? Your kid playing with blocks? Licensed daycares do have rules to follow and get inspected. Zebra crossings are here: [http://www.humanservices.alberta.ca/oldfusion/ChildCareLookup.cfm?s=vio&sfid=80001892&cctype=DAY%20CARE%20PROGRAM&sinspd=09082021&sinspc=325134&show=](http://www.humanservices.alberta.ca/oldfusion/ChildCareLookup.cfm?s=vio&sfid=80001892&cctype=DAY%20CARE%20PROGRAM&sinspd=09082021&sinspc=325134&show=)

"> If every bridge and road needs a bidding process why doesn't public spending on art go through the same process?

I personally don't know enough about the process, artist, or intent that resulted in the blue ring - and it's something I'm semi-motivated to look into with all this discussion.  

Something else that this discussion has gotten me thinking about is whether the blue ring is a victim of its location.  Would anybody give it a second glance if it was installed somewhere like Stephen Ave or another city center sidewalk or roadway?

I mean downtown Calgary has giant bolt figures that kind of look like they are having sex. 17th has two rotund business men talking. There's the large circle of tall skinny people, etc. None of these installations catch the same flak as the blue ring, but any one of them would look really out of place on a distant suburban overpass or street.

If the big blue ring were installed on Stephen Ave where people could walk through it and get up close, would they be as outraged? Would it seem as ridiculous? or as out of place?
