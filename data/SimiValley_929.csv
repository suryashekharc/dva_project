"I'm a trainer and this is probably one of my biggest peeves from other self entitled owners...

I think owners are just trying to boast and demonstrate how ""well behaved"" their dog is, disregarding any other aspects of the situation.

What owners don't understand is...
1) We have leash laws for a reason. Follow them or risk a dog being put down at *their* own fault for disregarding basic respect and leash law.
2) Barrier frustration! Even if you *think* your dog is well behaved/trained, you're disregarding the fact your *illegal* actions can cause distress in other dogs. So if they react, that's not the owner following leash laws fault, it's their fault.

There's reasons dog parks outline keeping dogs off leash while inside the park for this reason. The same way we have leash laws at public parks for *everyones* safety, not just for your own dog...

People need to set aside their pride and stop taking offense to something that's much bigger than them and take some accountability. It's not hard to keep your dog on leash while in public *or* at least leash your dog at the sight of any other dogs in the distance. Have some decency people.",t2_3pzs6990,Dylberts,0,1648070373.0,0,t1_i1ukgui,i1ukgui,True,CountyRoad,t3_tdei6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/simivalley/comments/tdei6m/im_exhausted_by_aggressive_people_and_their/,I’m exhausted by aggressive people and their unleashed dogs at regular parks,/r/simivalley/comments/tdei6m/im_exhausted_by_aggressive_people_and_their/i1ukgui/,2,r/simivalley,0,2

"It’s the people for sure. I was with my dad walking my dogs, leashed, around the track of Lincoln park once and some idiot decided instead of running around us, he ran in between. And tried to pat my golden on the head and my border collie. Guess what happened? My border snapped at him and bit his forearm. Caused a huge scene and kept blaming us for having aggressive dogs. He was super close to calling the cops and needing an EMT (this is embarrassing as it was nothing that warranted them to come out). People started filming as he was yelling at us… just a mess. I wanted out of there. He wasn’t listening to me. I told him to put pressure on his wound and see a doctor later if he’s concerned for an infection. He didn’t trust anything I said and straight up followed us home so he could confirm our address to report to animal control. 

Animal control came next day and check license and rabies vaccination. Put on quarantine for 2 weeks… that was that. This happened in 2019.

"1-2. Like anywhere, it has pros and cons. Pros: some great international markets and restaurants, cool little shops (the $5 or less bookstore is my absolute favorite), cool wilderness areas to explore, and great hiking. Cons: Trump rallies and caravans that clog up the streets and freeway when active. Turned my 20 minute commute into a 45 minute commute. Rent is skyrocketing (though I guess that’s pretty true of a lot of places in SoCal and beyond right now). Not sure if it’s just my experience, but there’s some blatant hostility especially on the roads (I’ve been screamed at while crossing the street WITH the right of way, or while obeying basic traffic laws). Not exceptionally LGBTQ+ friendly.

3. I work in Westlake Village, so not sure. Many minimum-wage type jobs in Simi seem to be hiring.

4. My doctor is not in Simi Valley.

5. There seems to be a growing homelessness crisis in Simi, with few resources to help these folks, and a general public indifference.

6. The far right groups meet in the abandoned Babies R Us parking lot. Parks and recreation centers are usually quite busy.

7. The more affordable apartment complexes are rather old and not well-managed, I’ve had a host of issues that have been brushed off or not been properly addressed.

"I don’t live in simi anymore, but I was born and raised there and moved out a few years ago.

1.	I loved it. Simi is nestled in between the coast and major cities, but is far enough away where it doesn’t experience the “big city” problems (as much.) Being near the coast means we have cooler temps in the Summer, and we have the beautiful scenery of the valley. However, Simi has outgrown itself and what was once a small middle-class town isn’t so much anymore, ever since the housing boom in the early 2000’s. 
2.	Strengths: it’s still a small town with small town vibes. Beautiful weather, scenery, and pockets of close-knit communities. Weaknesses: exploding rent and housing costs (like any other place), lots of lazy, entitled people (just comparing the number of shopping carts left in parking spots and on curbs compared to where I am now!), no sort of nightlife for adults, our Simi Mall is a giant wind tunnel of nothingness 
3.	Employment: depends on the industry, I assume. I’m in tech, and there was nothing for me in simi. I would have to travel to Los Angeles or Santa Monica if I wasn’t remote. Hence why I left.
4.	I did, and she moved out of Simi. She was so good that I traveled to her new location 20 miles away. So is she accessible now? Not really. She’s also usually booked out at least a month out.
5.	Greatest health problem? Probably the rampant heroin use in Simi.
6.	The gossip center of any town is usually Nextdoor app. Lots of bored Karens on there. Or Facebook groups.
7.	I will always have a place in my heart for Simi, so much so that I got the Happy Face Hill tattooed on my forearm. However, much like a lot of hometowns, it’s changed so much. I grew up there from the 80’s - late 2000’s. I’m happy staples that make Simi great are still there: Dr. Conkey’s, Jerry’s Cafe, Carrillo’s, etc. But Simi started building houses near the beloved Happy Face Hill and they’re an eye sore. House pricing and rent is astronomical. I’d say 90% of people that I grew up with had to move out of state because we were all priced out of our hometown.

"The city code of ethics she signed means she is still responsible for her actions as a city representative. It seems the primary issue that was brought up was that she needs to act in the city's best interest. Her actions were in the best interests of a select minority and not the collective whole. There is also the issue of how it looks for a city representative to make a public disclosure like that and have that lead to somebody being able to evade the checkpoint and later get into an accident. There could be some liability and culpability by her and the city in that scenario.

Remember all the FB posts that Mike Judge made? He should have been censured for all that, but skated by. Since then the council has been watching the ethical nature of its representatives.

"I grew up here and recently came back a couple of years ago. It’s changed but not significantly. Honestly I do miss the vibe we had in the 90s and early 2000s when we had more non-franchised stores and restaurants. It had a more small town feel. There seems to be so much traffic now and new housing developments are so cramped. My parents remember saying the city never intended to build north of the 118 but lol look what happened… now there’s a new one going up off kuehner and probably in the worst spot possible fire/wind wise. 

The power has been shut off more than I ever remember for the potential fires. The 23 is still a mess. The 118 stretch from first to Tierra rejada is still a mess. We are still having issues with groundwater. The city had a huge failure with the mall. 

In many ways it’s chill. It was seen to many as a bedroom community and an escape from SFV but still easy (kinda) commute to LA (I’d argue the traffic is better than SC). Main reason why my parents decided to leave Woodland Hills in the 90s to come here. Personally I don’t think I’d want to settle here as I know I would not be able to afford to buy a home so once my parent’s retire and sell their house, sayonara!",t2_2e50i0cs,Defibrillator91,0,1642128201.0,0,t1_hskrrpx,hskrrpx,True,origami_freak,t3_ryhtfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/simivalley/comments/ryhtfu/this_sub_i_kind_of_empty_anyone_got_any_stories/,"This sub I kind of empty, anyone got any stories of your experience living in Simi Valley",/r/simivalley/comments/ryhtfu/this_sub_i_kind_of_empty_anyone_got_any_stories/hskrrpx/,2,r/simivalley,0,2

"A woman’s boyfriend was arrested in her killing after she was found dead in a car in Simi Valley last week, LAPD said Wednesday.

Angela Kukawski’s body was discovered in her parked car in the 1500 block of Patricia Ave in Simi Valley on Dec. 23, one day after she was reported missing from Sherman Oaks, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a news release.

Kukawski was a celebrity business manager whose clients included the Kardashians and Nicki Minaj, Variety reported.

Her boyfriend, 49-year-old Jason Barker, was then arrested on suspicion of murder.

“Detectives believe that Barker killed the victim inside their Sherman Oaks residence, placed her inside her vehicle, and drove to Simi Valley,” LAPD said in the release.

Police did not provide further details on why Barker was suspected in his girlfriend’s killing, or what is believed to have motivated it.

It’s also unclear how the woman died.

"The Simi Valley Police Department has arrested two people and is looking for five others after an early-morning smash-and-grab burglary, police said.

The burglary was reported at about 3:30 a.m. Saturday at Metro PCS and a neighboring business, Core Health, in the 2800 block of East Cochran Street, police said in a release.

The front doors of both businesses were smashed, and while searching the nearby area, police found Lancaster resident Byron Moore, 21, and Los Angeles resident Kayla Dixson, 22, police said.

“Officers recovered stolen items from their vehicle and placed them under arrest,” the released added.

During the investigation, police found that a total of seven people entered the two businesses, and the other five thieves are still outstanding, police said.

Moore and Dixson were taken to the Ventura County Main Jail, according to police.

Dixson is being held in lieu of $110,000 bail on two felony burglary counts and a felony criminal conspiracy charge, jail records show.

Moore is being held in lieu of $115,000 bail on the same charges as Dixson, as well as felony charges from an out-of-county warrant for possessing a firearm as a felon or addict, possessing ammunition as a person prohibited from possessing a firearm and carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle, jail records show.

Dixson and Moore are due to appear in Ventura County Superior Court on Tuesday.

We tend to try to stay on the safe side and drink water from another source, don’t eat anything we grow from the soil here, and are just aware in general of what’s happening with the lawsuits and if there’s any new information.

"First, your home disclosures should include information about SSFL. All homes in the area require that disclosure.

That said, the issue with contamination has to do with two key factors. Distance and time. The issue is reduced as they increase. Your home is pretty close to the site compared to most homes in Simi. However your risk factor compared to a home on the far north side of Simi is probably in the tenths or hundredths of a percent. Measurable, but barely. Your risks for asthma were probably higher in Burbank. So its all a trade off. 

The cancer issues surrounding SSFL are slightly higher than normal from what I've seen, but not enough to rule out other natural causes as a contributing source.

I'm probably far less concerned about radiation than most. I understand it and how it works. The biggest issue is you can't see it. So fear of the unknown is what scares most people. The body can tolerate some radiation, but like all contaminants, you ideally want none in your life. Unless you life out in the country, that's tough to achieve in the city. 

Anyways, do your research as needed. Simi is a nice place to live. I'm sure you'll make the right decision for your family.",t2_8c230izs,tylershowstop,0,1627572334.0,0,t1_h6ys0ul,h6ys0ul,True,Gio1050,t3_otthw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/simivalley/comments/otthw6/moving_to_simi_valley_concerned_about_ssfl/,Moving to Simi Valley.

"Not from Simi, but I grew up in Chatsworth before moving out of state and have family surrounding all the communities dotted around the SSFL. We’re also in the process of buying a place in Simi right now as my folks want to see out their sunset years in CA. 

I think it’s good to know and understand the risks and take some safety measures, even if people think you’re overreacting, especially b/c you have young kids. From what I understand the predominant radio active isotopes (strontium 90 and cesium 137) have gone through 2 half lives, so they’re now around 0.25 of their original exposure if you came into contact into them, but I’m no nuclear chemist.

The bigger issue IMHO is the solvents that have permeated into the water table, especially TCE, perchlorate, lead, benzene, etc. You definitely want to get a reverse osmosis system and get a bottled water subscription so you’re not cooking with potentially poisonous water.  With that said, I don’t think Simi is any worse than any other neighborhoods in SoCal, as there’s plenty of industrial contamination thorough-out the LA basin. I moved out of SoCal shortly after my daughter was born in 2014, for other reasons, but now looking back I’m glad I did because if we had not my daughter would have been exposed to the Porter Ranch gas leak.

Do your research to put your mind at ease, and take some precautionary measures, but also take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Overall, Simi is a great community to raise kids. Limit their exposure with the contaminated side of the valley (don’t hike close to the SSFL, avoid using parks very close to it, stay indoors when there’s fires to avoid breathing the ash dust, etc), but also don’t over think it (I say these and hope it’s not sounding paranoid, but mainly cause kids get into stuff and put things in their mouth, etc). As an FYI, we drank tap water most of our lives and lived between 2 large aerospace outfits in the west valley, and were also in the shadow of the SSFL. I also remember playing hoops outdoors in Chatsworth during the 2005 fires and I’m sure I breathed up a lot of bad stuff coming off that mountain. The issues are everywhere, so don’t feel like you’re putting your kids in harms way, because you’re not anymore than any other place in SoCal...

Acorn listings have weekly rental listings in there. I've read one's stating women preferred. I've noticed the prices are somewhat more reasonable than what you see online.

"I can’t disagree more. Your assessment is an old one and is losing ground on a day to day basis. In 2020 this town went blue, the Trump parade was mostly hated by the locals and the one house on Cochran that actually still has all the obnoxious Trump flags is considered an eyesore by most in the neighborhood. The idiots that still rally for Trump on the weekends are actually paid to be there just to sell merchandise. The ratio of 1/5 vehicles as being 4/4 gas guzzling hick-rides is way off, I’d say it’s more like half the vehicles here are mom-rides. As the housing market quickly changes, more left leaning families are moving in and the echoes of Rodney King and Ronalds library being the only known history are fading into black.

It could have been something as simple as a fan going out on their end, but they wasted a lot of time and money sending me new routers.

"As nationwide nonprofit organization, Vitalant exists to help ensure a safe, dependable blood supply for all the communities we serve. Blood banking today is complex. Vitalant is licensed and inspected by the US Food and Drug Administration in much the same way as a pharmaceutical manufacturer. We provide nearly 2.5 million transfusible blood components a year to patients in approximately 1000 hospitals in 28 states.   
  
It takes considerable resources to collect, process, test, ship, and manage this lifesaving resource. We greatly appreciate the donors who join us in helping patients. It would not be possible without their generosity.   
  
We owe it to the patients who receive those transfusions to have the most expert, capable people overseeing this vital work. We believe salaries should be both competitive and appropriate to the scope and nature of our work, and we do compete with for-profit corporations for excellent employees.   
  
So how do we determine salaries? Each year, Vitalant’s human resources department reviews compensation studies of similar positions in similar size organizations, both inside and outside of health care. We also regularly retain independent outside compensation consultants to review the compensation and benefits of our key executives to ensure they are appropriate as well as competitive.    
  
Additionally, we have a review system of checks and balances that works like this: we have an independent board of trustees representing the communities and hospitals we serve. The board has a compensation committee that reviews and approves our salary programs. The board determines the salary of our president and top executives.   
  
I hope this has answered your concerns. In closing, on behalf of the patients we serve and the people who love them, thank you for donating blood.",t2_3e4gdj6e,sdevillers,0,1622741550.0,0,t1_h0gpkg3,h0gpkg3,False,sdevillers,t3_nemsfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/simivalley/comments/nemsfo/blood_drive_on_thursday_at_rancho_santa_susana/,Blood Drive on Thursday at Rancho Santa Susana Community Center.

"How much are you profiting on a pint of blood? $300? Although you may be non-profit, you're paying your executives very well, even executives that don't do any work\[1\]. Let's be honest, the patient in need of the blood will be paying for more than just the cost to process and handle the blood (that was donated), they are also paying for these high salaries, and in turn, there is no incentive to companies like Vitalant to create a more cheaper an efficient process for the end patient in need. Health insurance doesn't need to cost as much as it does in the USA. But because it has become such a (profitable) racket, pharmaceuticals/health have spent the most money in lobbying\[2\] for a given industry/sector. And people need to realize that health-care can easily be covered by the taxes we already pay, if we don't have to pay for these additional and unnecessary costs like these salaries or lobbyists that's passed on to us when we're paying for the medical bill & insurance. And this is why we're the only large rich country without universal health care\[3\].

"As a dog trainer, this is something that infuriates me all the time in Simi Valley. Owners have their dogs off leash in public or parks *all* the time!

I understand that owners just want to pride theirselves on owning a ""well-behaved"" doggo who wouldn't run away or overreact, but what they don't understand is it's not all about them...

Aside from there still being a chance (no matter what) that their dog could react or be startled by something unexpected, a dog being off leash can cause another dog on leash to experience something called barrier frustration. Barrier frustration can lead to escalation or injury in either dog or anyone else potentially around.

"Hike Rocky Peak before it gets too hot. Sorry I'm not familiar with the gyms/basketball courts, so I can't help much there. The Reagan Library should be reopening in the near future, and I would highly recommend checking that out.

Here are some restaurants that I'd recommend, in no particular order:

* Carnitas El Rey (carnitas tacos)
* Custom Pie (pizza)
* Greek House Cafe (Greek)
* All About the Burgers (burgers)
* The Hat (pastrami, chili cheese fries)
* The Flying Yolk (incredible breakfast sandwiches/burritos)
* Ali Baba's (Mediterranean)
* El Pollo Corona (excellent Mexican chicken and tri-tip plates/burritos)
* Bollywood Indian Kitchen (Indian buffet)
* Indian Haweli (Indian buffet)
* In-n-Out (burgers)
* The Habit (burgers)


If you're willing to drive a bit and you like beer, here are a few other places to try:

* Golden Nugget Pub (Simi Valley - craft beer bar)
* Enegren (Moorpark - German style brewery that focuses on lagers)
* Tarantula Hill (Thousand Oaks - solid hazy IPAs and stouts, great pizza and wings)
* Handiest Food Mart (Moorpark - great place for all things alcohol)
* Bottle & Pint (Newbury Park - great craft beer bar and bottle shop)

"Well, couple things about living in the US vs Europe - public transportation isn't the best out here. Oh we have it, and I like the trains even though they take twice if not three times as long to get where you need to go. But having your own car is worth it out here, especially if you like going to other places that would be significantly more difficult to get to via public transport (such as Santa Monica) The advantage of living in Simi vs closer to metropolitan LA is that you're further away from the traffic and chaos or living in a big city but close enough you could make it down to the city in under an hour usually by car. 

Food culture too might be a bit of a shock coming out here. You can peruse through this Sub to see all kinda food recommendations. 

There are some private gyms with basketball courts if you're interested in signing up for a membership, otherwise there's a couple decent outdoor basketball courts over by ""Lemon Park"" otherwise known as the Rancho Tapo Park. 

As far as ""stuff to do"" in Simi, you are somewhat limited within town. There's the Regan Library, a couple other small historical places, old movies sets, to visit and see. And a small teaching zoo at the Moorpark Community College.  And there's a few hiking trails.
