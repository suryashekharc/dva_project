"Are you fishing from the bank? Haig mill has some nice fish in it but it’s tough to fish. It’s deep and doesn’t have much structure. It has spotted bass in it which like to hang out in deep water. Chickamauga creek has multiple kayak lunches in the ringgold area, the fishing was never that nice for me, but it’s pretty and peaceful. Queen City lake in Lafayette is a nice fishery, with a lot of bank access. It can be tough though. Other decent reservoirs in the area are Rocky Mountain in Rome, Sloppy Floyd in Summerville, Salacoa in Calhoun, carters rereg lake in chatsworth. Fishing in Dalton isn’t very good, but it’s a short drive to a lot of good places to fish.",t2_dahfatt6,BIGHIGGZ,0,1648162927.0,0,t1_i1ztbd1,i1ztbd1,True,DrPupperMD,t3_tmayrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaltonGA/comments/tmayrh/anyone_know_good_places_to_fish_havent_had_any/,Anyone know good places to fish?

"I see folks up in Chickamauga fish the river behind Lee  & Gordon’s Mill. It’s about 30 mins from Dalton. It’s a public parking lot and people seem to bring kayaks or blow up boats to launch from there, or just fish from the banks. With this, I think you need a GA fishing license to avoid DNR. There’s a YouTuber that posts a lot of informative videos… dang, I forget his channel name, but just search “west chickamauga creek fishing” & he has a lot of videos posted of that area.

"Stacey and her team came to our district several times in 2018 alone for her campaign (Dalton twice, specifically) and then again all over the place in 2020.

Georgia had 95% of eligible voters registered for 2020 yet we only had about 65% turnout.

Besides, it's not up to Stacey to do it alone. Anyone can help get people registered, and should. Anyone can help voters know where their precincts are, and should. For Whitfield County specifically, the elections office is in the courthouse. The doors in the middle of the main hallway, across from the elevators after the metal detector.   


To that point, as well - anyone and everyone who has the privilege of getting time off from work to help run elections or serve as a poll watcher - absolutely should do that.

">The thought is that even if a plant unionized, it would soon enough be shut down and production would be moved elsewhere.

Having worked on the infrastructure side of one of the Big 3, I can tell you that there is no way a production line from any one plant could be moved to any other plant without hundreds of thousands of dollars (if not millions) and a multi-year project to manage it.

I don't think people realize just how fragile the supply chain of any of these plants are. If anything, I think a concerted effort at a few key plants would be enough to make at least the company I worked at cave, and it wasn't the smallest of the 3.

But yeah, a lot of other people have mentioned the propaganda that prevents it, and unfortunately that is still pretty strong. Last conversation I had about it was ""Why do I want to get a smaller paycheck in a union?"" People clearly don't understand how unions work.

"The overwhelming consensus among people in the mills I have worked at is anti-union. From years of what amounts to propaganda and increasing financial instability, people are afraid to rock the boat at all. The thought is that even if a plant unionized, it would soon enough be shut down and production would be moved elsewhere. 

Even if employers did illegal things to squash a union drive, what lawyers in the area would go against the largest power players in our area? Imagine a north Georgia lawyer trying to sue Shaw?  

It would seriously take huge union drives at multiple companies being successful simultaneously in one of the most conservative parts of the country for it to have a real and lasting impact. 

There’s a reason the solar panel plant from Korea chose this area to build their new plant. A union at all manufacturing facilities in the area would greatly benefit the local population but they still would not choose to do so even if the obstacles to achieving this goal were surmounted. It’s relevant to note that this is the same area represented by a member of congress that isn’t even qualified to post on Twitter. Unions just aren’t in the cards for this area.

Sorry your experience was horrible but if you worked for any of their businesses now i can guarantee you it wouldn’t be like that.

"So I live in Varnell, which is just outside of Dalton but so small that a lot of things over here are addressed as being in Dalton. 

We get free trash pick up once a week. There is nothing out here. Cohutta is next to us and they've got some small businesses that are trying to grow and it's been a really interesting experience living here. Dalton is only a few minutes away, Ringgold is about 15-20 minutes, and then depending what part of Chattanooga it can take 30-45 minutes to get there. Plenty of back road driving with nice views in the area.

Housing costs are definitely a little funky here. There's a couple houses on sale down from me. I know one is $180,000 right now. Looks like they did some renovation on it, but I swear the cabinets in their kitchen are the same ones like I took out of my kitchen, and those were particle board that had been up since the 80s and they were in rough shape when I moved in back in 2015.",t2_6ltiy,emilymae24,0,1638626776.0,0,t1_hn71xf9,hn71xf9,True,R_iski,t3_pj92by,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaltonGA/comments/pj92by/thinking_about_moving/,Thinking about moving,/r/DaltonGA/comments/pj92by/thinking_about_moving/hn71xf9/,1,r/DaltonGA,0,1
"Better communication for events. I remember there was an airshow that was supposed to happen at the Dalton Airport, but was cancelled because they didn't presale enough tickets. But hardly anyone knew about it. 

Also, considering we have an air field, who takes off and lands from their mostly? Because I remember one year they wanted to spend the SPLOST towards building a private hangar to encourage people to keep their planes there. Which to me seemed a huge waste of money when we still have other places that need fixed.

I wish we had actual kid safe places. As well as kid free places. I want somewhere I can take my kids and know that I don't have to hover and feel like a helicopter parent while watching them play. All I know of in our town is the playgrounds and I think there is the one jump park? I could be wrong. I think we have a bunch of playgrounds, but being open spaces those can get hard to keep an eye on kids at. 

But kid free places would be amazing too. Because sometimes, I would love to go somewhere with my husband and friends and not have to worry it's going to be ruined by someone's kids running around and screaming. 

I've heard the convention center used to be a big deal and hold events all the time, but the last few years I think I've only heard of maybe one sports thing going on? Other than that I think Ive heard them doing the proms/graduations, and some weddings and business meetings. I could be wrong, but I think it would be nice to have some events there that are open for locals too. Concerts or disco nights or something. 

It needs to have more things spread out. We all know we can go to Walnut/Cleveland Hwy/Downtown Dalton for food.  But then you get off Glenwood and go onto Abutment and it's mostly a ghost town. They've started getting a little more that way, but it's still not much. But we have so much condensed into such small areas that it's easy to overlook something. 

I don't think we'll ever get an Olive Garden, and I don't know that we need one. We have plenty of chains to choose from, I wish we had more small business restaurants that were a different type of food, I know on Morris I can find so many different Mexican restaurants, but we have one Mediterranean restaurant in Downtown, and an ass ton of burger places. Some diversity would be nice, but I'm not sure how well it may do since it could be hit or miss. 

Damn, this got longer than I expected 😬 I just hear so much about what this town was like before I was born, and it sounds so much better than I what I see it like now.

"the world is truly an evil place and man is capable of some ugly things. I wouldn't put it past anyone tbh. to tell you the truth, i worked at a gas station and would have ""those kinda girls"" come play the slot machines. anyways, became real good friends with one and we hung out one day when i wasn't busy at work and she told me (in a very sluggish almost drunk/drugged voice) that she wasnt from dalton and that it's been 8 years that she hasn't been home and that she wants to go home really bad. I asked why doesn't she go and if its a money issue, she said she couldn't go. dont really understand what all that meant but from how pretty she was, and how she would dress screamed ""sex traffic"". she was young and pretty but you could totally tell she was on drugs, at the time i didn't put it past me to think sex trafficking because I always would meet druggies and just assumed she was another one, wasn't til i sat down and thought about her that the pieces connected. i highly suspected the manager/owner of that gas station to be involved to some degree in shady dealings, (people always coming up saying the manager said to give me x amount of money, various coke heads hanging out at the gas station and ""knowing the manager"", even had one girl who i suspected of scouting other girls for her ""bar/club"", but later found out she was a madam of sorts and would pimp girls out.) true shit man, i swear my left nut on what im saying. people in power tend to abuse it at one point or another and to me, the majority of rich people, didnt get rich through honesty and playing nice. the said family that i worked for had a history of drug trafficking, know this for a fact because of people i knew that we have in common. might be putting myself out there by saying all this but if you read in the news about a body being found in the next few days, just remember it was me and go after the gas station owners lol.

"you're welcome! there are many taco places in Dalton. My go-to places are tacos beto, taqueria paisanos, and the taco place next to carniceria loa. I've never had al pastor from any of those places, I always get tacos de tripas and tacos de lengua from these places. I also get barbacoa tacos from taqueria paisanos. I've heard great things about taqueria villa juarez but I've never been there.

for birria, there are a few stands (they aren't restaurants, they are food stands that show up at places) and they have Instagram accounts and they post the addresses of where they show up (@birria.broz and @ birrieria\_el\_llano) and there is this restaurant Delicias Reinita that sells birria (i haven’t tried theirs but i’ve heard good things about it).

I'm not a mole connoisseur and I'm not sure how a good mole is supposed to taste like and I've had it just once, but tacos beto sells it and the taqueria next to carniceria loa might have it too.

For tamales, I get it from the taqueria next to carniceria loa, they sell it Sundays and you have to be there early because they sell out fast. They have chicken and pork tamales and they're sold by dozen and half dozen.

Also, I'm not sure if it's your thing, but there's this Mexican chicken restaurant called el pollo alegre that is very popular and they sell pollo asado and I'm a huge fan of that.

There’s so many decent jobs, but no place to live anymore. Notice how rent used to be dirt cheap before all these factories started competing for competent employees? Toyo again is my only first hand example, but remember how hard it used to be to get hired there? Needed a copy of HS diploma and to take that work keys assessment and score high (algebra, yuk!)

"My favorite place for local food in Dalton is a local Japanese restaurant called Kumo. They have the best Japanese food in town and their prices are actually pretty good for how much foor you get, but if you really like sushi go to Fuji. Fuji does 24/7 50% sushi so sushi is always cheap there but anything else there is a bit pricey.

Other than that, Spiced Apple is an amazing sandwich place. They do the best deli sandwiches I have ever had and they have homemade pie to die for that they make fresh daily. A sandwich and chips with a drink costs around $12 so I highly recommend going there for lunch one day.

In terms of authentic Mexican food, there are two types of Mexican restaurants in dalton. You have Dalton Mexican food and Authentic Mexican food. For Authentic Mexican Food there is a small taco shack called Tacos Beto that does the most authentic Mexican food I have had in town. For Daltonized Mexican food there are a lot of places you can go to. I saw someone in this thread say Flakos and it is a really good Mexican place, but others like Tijuanas, Los Reyes, and Los Palmas offer the same kind of food.

You gotta go to Buckin Burrito. It's our local version of Chipotle/Moe's and it's 10 times better than either of those places. They offer build your own burritos/nachos and have in house made salsa that comes with your meal. Easily some of the best burritos I have ever had and I always try to go when I'm back in town.

Finally, There is Oakwood and Cherokee. Dalton classics right in the middle of downtown. Oakwood does classic southern meals and Cherokee does Pizza/Wings with craftmade brews. Both places are owned by the same guy and I've always loved going there to have a good meal with some friends.

I've seen (and lived at) many apartments in this area and everyone of them have become a shell of their former selves. All of them have atrophied and become borderline trash to be frank. I can't imagine more apartments would help when the townsfolk around here literally trash their own residencies. I just moved from an apartment complex where I felt were not bad when I first got there but a few years later and it seemed like residents were going out of their way to break shit. Even if we got nicer new apartments they'd probably cost twice what a mortgage would which is a crime in itself. Look what legacy and park canyon charge.

"Housing buying/selling is basically not happening in this area my friend. I live in Ringgold and like they said in the earlier post, $200,000 is going to be a hard find Brother. I live Ringgold, I moved here grom Mississippi in 2005 and wish I would've moved here a lot sooner...the school's are the best in the state and the teachers actually give a damn about the students, it's peaceful, laid back and just a great place to live all around. The people are friendly and will actually speak to you. Its what I call perfection, out in the country with a small town feel and close enough to the big city (Chattanooga,Tn.) that it's not a long drive to get what you are looking for........      It's 20 minutes to Chattanooga,Tn. on 1-75 North (Medical  Specialist, Hospitals, the Mall, a fairly decent night life... it's a college town so ya know...kids and alcohol...need I say more, etc...downside gangs, drugs, violence and about 2 to 3 gang related murders a week...my advice, if you go into Chattown at night stay around the downtown area, Market Street bars,clubs,dining,etc... or the Mall area, Gunbarrel Road, dining, shopping, Movie Theaters, or go to East Ridge,Tn nit as pleasant as Chatt but hardly any of the BS either ...it's not as bad as Chicago though) and 25 minutes to Dalton,Ga. on I-75 South (about the same as in Ringgold only bigger...just a wider variety of options to choose from as far as Jobs, shopping, etc...), everything else  you get to within 15 minutes or closer (in Ringgold, there's 3 dollar stores, 4 grocery stores, 3 or 4 top notch attorney's offices, 3 pediatricians, 4 doctors offices, 3 dentists, 6 legit restaurants, at least 9 fast food joints, 4 car dealerships... I think you see what I am saying here and Ft. Oglethorpe is maybe 10 minutes up the road if you can't find it in Ringgold then you can find it there). Hope you found this helpful., like I said if you can find a place in Ringgold, BUY IT, hands down this is God's little slice of heaven on Earth Brother... Your kids won't like it much because of the small town feel (mine didn't, they actually hated me for almost a year, teenagers...lolol) but it grows on even the wildest of kids plus you and the Mrs. will be able sleep at night knowing everyone looks out on one another around here too. You are going to fall in love with this place.. .literally...

I had this long rant written out, but basically I want options. I want to pick a dinner out by having many more options than the few it feels we have in town. I want more options for an OB than the two offices we have in Dalton that have to serve the entire area, so the waiting time is insane just to be rushed through the appointment. I want to feel safe going to the park, or have areas where I can walk from one place to another without having to drive everywhere. Or even decent public transport vs taxis.

"I no longer live in Dalton.

The absolute worst thing (in my opinion) about Dalton is that there is no part of the city where a car is not essentially required to simply exist AND that it feels any kind of safe to bike. Dalton's biggest enemy is a complete lack of density. It's a problem that certainly isn't unique to Dalton, but it is a major issue that America is going to have to reckon with particularly as those unfunded maintenance bills come due (property taxes aren't close to being at the level required to keep up with the maintenance or replace old infrastructure like sewers).

After that, I would note the near-total lack of public green space.

After that, I would note that the politics of Dalton and Whitfield county are nearly completely controlled by regressive voices.

The best thing about Dalton, for me, was proximity to both Chattanooga (events, walkable spaces, etc) and outdoor activities such as hiking / biking trails (Pinhoti, Raisin Woods etc). The competitive problem for Dalton as a place to live is that Chattanooga is closer to all of those things, and many more-rural places are just as close but also cheaper.

The best thing Dalton could do would be to really, really strongly get behind an ATL --> Nashville HSR corridor, and get a stop.",t2_4se3z,mjacksongt,0,1627535741.0,0,t1_h6x8f5d,h6x8f5d,True,Suck_My_Gock52,t3_otqftk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaltonGA/comments/otqftk/favorite_and_least_favorite_thing_about_dalton/,Favorite and least favorite thing about Dalton,/r/DaltonGA/comments/otqftk/favorite_and_least_favorite_thing_about_dalton/h6x8f5d/,23,r/DaltonGA,0,23

"I honestly haven't heard anything about this incident, but let me take a guess. Someone on a Facebook posted an article critical of this girl's actions in appropriating native culture. It was commented on by a few people before being taken down. In that time, some local tea party loon took a screenshot, stripped out any context, and posted it on every right wing Facebook group in North Georgia so they could claim that, rather than objecting to this person being blatantly, obviously racist, Democrats are attacking an innocent little girl who can't possibly be blamed for just following a fun tradition (of mocking native culture).

">Obviously people at irl political meetings arent stupid enough to be socialists, im talking about normal people having normal conversations with people they know.

What normal people do you know that are talking about socialism? Again, pretty involved in Democratic politics and I've never heard anyone say we should be a socialist country. There was a lot of talk about Democratic Socialism in the last election, but that's the system we already have! Again, if we are going to pretend that every Democrat has to be responsible for every crazy ass thing a college sophomore said while stoned, we can't actually have a discussion. 

>Racists are made into voters and voters are made to be racist. People are shaped by there environment. You have the option to be something in their environment that shapes them toward something better, so why wouldnt you unless you just care about being self righteous?

It's 2021. The 15th amendment has been the law of the land for 150 years. If, after all that, someone still really doesn't believe black people should be allowed to vote, they are not amenable to reasonable discussion. I want nothing to do with them. 

>Who have you ever actually pulled over to your way of thinking with that attitude

I'm not trying to convince Republicans to vote for Democrats. I'm trying to convince Democrats to vote for Democrats. I think conceding Republicans talking points works against that mission. You do you, though.

Who in Dalton politics is doing this? I've been to a fair few Democratic party meetings up here, never heard anyone preach the virtues of socialism. OTOH, lot of MAGA drones spouting whatever Tucker Carlson said last night....

>If someone is still on the fence about whether or not black people should be allowed to vote,

You can't reach that person, and it's a waste of your time to try. Spend your time talking to persuadable voters, not throwback racists.

>3: DO NOT SAY ""nobody says that"". The fact that they are bringing it up and that there is an entire spectrum of fucking idiots on the internet means that at someone somewhere probably did say that

If someone's starting point is that I, as a Democrat, am responsible for every crazy thing anyone to the left of Nixon has ever said on the internet, we can't have a conversation. They are looking for a fight, not a discussion. Walk away and let them watch some more Fox News.

Nope. Challenge the framing and basis of their argument. ""Sure, liberals are godless heathens, but have you considered..."" is a waste of everyone's time.

"YES, that last paragraph is what really irks me about it all. If I knew these taxpayer funded projects would go towards benefiting the WHOLE community, I'd be excited. But it's just another way for the downtowners club to exclude ""the poors"", like you said. The whole park is literally just a pet project for one guy. But because he has the connections and funding, it gets done. Meanwhile, I can't take my kid to our favorite park/playground anymore because there were used needles under our favorite sitting tree (Magic Carpet Kingdom right down 41). It's discouraging because sometimes I read the daily citizen forums and it seems like people aren't even raising complaints or concerns with REAL problems in this community, they're just arguing about Trump losing (still??)

"I didn't take it that way at all. I normally stay out of reddit comments because of their tendency to go really badly, really quickly. But the hometown subreddit is made for us, so I just try to temper my tone.

Yeah downtown should absolutely extend beyond the tracks. The fact that it doesn't irritates me. That entire hill to the east has some gorgeous houses.

And don't get me started on the downtown property owners. Just another good ol' boys club, although it is starting to skew younger. Still white guys, but at least younger white guys. I do feel like at least business ownership is starting to diversify.  (I mean , barely, but I'm glad to see it.)

To me, even though the park is privately funded, I do think it's to the greater public benefit. So the use of tax payer dollars makes sense to me. But like I said upthread, anything good for downtown is good for me personally.

I was curious if the restrooms will stay open. I've never really used any of the other parks' restrooms, but anything downtown that might get used by the poors is always locked down.

"Hahaha, that last line got me. I certainly don't take your comments as condescending, I hope you didn't take mine that way either. I like having conversations with people on here, but sometimes they'll read tone that wasn't intentional.

I completely agree with your sentiment about housing. It just seems to me like the city spends an awful lot of time focused on those businesses downtown and disregards other parts of the city, especially anything on the other side of the train tracks. Its nice to see a few new things pop up, like the small strip of shops right there on Morris St. before you get to the Mohawk complex. But in reality, downtown just has overpriced shops and restaurants that close before 8, and they still seem to be doing fine. Those business owners have their own regular meetings with the mayor, they have a lot more say about what goes on in this town than necessary. The city wasn't going to do anything about the weirdos who were ""guarding"" the Joe Johnston statue until those business owners started complaining that they were harassing their customers. The DPD had gotten like 40 calls in one night about those guys and still only cleared them out when the downtowners club complained. It just seems really clear to me that nothing gets done around here unless you have the right name or bank account to make it happen. 

And about paying bands, I didn't mean like taxpayer dollars to pay them, hell, I'm pretty sure the parks dept has zero money invested into Burr Park, it was fully donated by the Burr family and they still have money to use. I just took issue with them asking for 300k of taxpayer dollars that none of the taxpayers get to approve or something. Considering it's not technically for public use, like sure you could go walk around or throw a frisbee there but you can't just use the stage like you could a playground or soccer fields. And who knows if they'll even leave the new restrooms open to the public or if they'll only unlock them during events.

"Spending money in Brookwood doesn't help me as a citizen at all, but I don't think their neighborhood should flood just because I don't benefit.  I do live in downtown Dalton and spend most of my time there. Any driver for downtown Dalton is a benefit to me socially and monetarily.  I don't think there should be funding for fixing up a flood plain on Chattanooga Rd when there are so many opportunities to build housing in other places, but it's happening.  I'm trying to conclude this without sounding like a condescending asshole, but infinite needs, finite resources and I don't get too much of a say in it.

Performers are paid for by sponsors, not the parks department. Local people and companies are paying them from their pocket, so I'm fine taking what I can get. The concert series is a driver for downtown businesses, so the point might as well be to appeal to a broad a demographic as possible. Also, people go to see bands their friends are in. So local bands, largely cover bands, help that effort as well.

"Yes, you might use the restrooms there once or twice a month, but when the city is spending that much for something that isn't actually accessible to the public I don't think it's right. The money for this park was donated, in fact, they still have money from that donation, they just asked that the city match the 300k they're putting up to build the pavilion. So a total of 600k (or more, by the time it's finished), all for a place that you couldn't even use as a citizen. If you wanted to use that park yourself, for a show or party, you'd have to get permission. Meanwhile, there are problem areas within the city limits that could use some funding. During the same meeting they approved this they also approved some infrastructure work over near Brookwood at 1/3 of the cost of that 300k. And that section over there isn't the only street in the city where heavy rains flood out. I'm not knocking the concept of Friday night concerts or the park in general, I'm just saying maybe there are more important things to spend that money on, rather than dressing rooms for bands from ringgold to trash. Dalton's American Legion has crowdfunding signs to help save their building, ffs. 

And as far as what people under 30 want to see, I'm not sure there's an answer to that without going into a long discussion about the evolution of music consumption and the difference between generational interests in live shows/performance. Personally, I think a lot of the EDM/DJ culture revolves around drug use, starting in the 90s with ""raves"", and the last thing we need downtown is a bunch of kids on ketamine. Obviously I'm not stating that every EDM fan is a drug user, but there's no denial that the culture does revolve around it. 

Maybe if they took some of that money and budgeted it to pay actual good performers it would draw a more diverse crowd.

"First word of advice: if the owner is Greeson or is managed by Eagle Property Services, don't rent it.

Second, don't be afraid to look outside of Dalton in the surrounding areas. Tunnel Hill, Varnell, and Rocky Face are all excellent locations (the southwest side of Tunnel Hill is a little methy, but the side by Northwest Highschool is pretty good). Even the surrounding counties like Catoosa (with Ringgold and Fort Oglethorpe) or Murray county (with Chatsworth) have small gold mines.

Third, do not rent a house that you have not personally inspected. There's a lot of slum lords in the Dalton area, and things like missing floors under your kitchen cabinets are not unheard of.

Fourth, the rental market in the Dalton area is absurd. For a town full of carpet mill and fast food workers, there are some pretty expensive rents. But persistence pays off. Every day you'll find new places that weren't listed yesterday.

I know it sounds like a lot of negativity, but for every bad house you find, you'll find 10 or more great houses that are worth it - the bad ones just look great until you find the gotcha.

As far as facebook groups for groups in Dalton, I know there is a bicycle group called the Dalton Area Cyclists that used to meet twice a week for a big ride, and that they have rides for all skill and speed levels.

Then there was the runners page, which was either Carpet City Runners or Dalton Area Runners but I can't remember off the top of my head.

Also there was the Northwest Georgia SORBA page for mountain biking. There was also the Downton Dalton Authority page that usually had posts about what was going on downtown as far as events and businesses.

"Free will is the reason to make the choice or not. Evidently you've never sought for the relationship God wants to have with you on a personal one on one relationship. Instead it sounds more like you or someone you know has only sought for God to answer in your will and not His. What we want or think we need in life probably is not what He needs us to have. Good way to determine this, is anything that doesn't involve Him, or bring us closer to Him probably isn't good for us. Sin is very colorful that way, satan is very good at making things keep us from seeing or knowing God and the Love behind which creation was created with. The Bible is not confusing, it just takes the indwelling of the Holy Spirit so we can understand it all. We all are our own worst enemy and full of faults nobody wants to accept. Most look to blame anyone else they can, but in fact the person in the mirror is responsible for just about everything. Knowing right from wrong at every point in life we all had choices to make. Bible tells us that a day is as a 1000 years and 1000 years as day to God. So at every moment of each day we have 365000 choices that could bring Glory to God: or to ourselves, weighing out right and wrong. Humans without the influence of the Holy Spirit and knowledge from the Bible, we're probably going to make the wrong choice
 Everything about this world puts us in a continual battle always with ourselves first, but true JOY is Jesus first, others, next and you last.

"The ol’ “Holy Spirit” and Jesus do their jobs well. Rips families apart all the time. The Bible is full of confusion and it is said that God is not the author of confusion.... 

So if people are looking to put their families back in order it could be easily read in a few gospels in red ink that it would be stupid to seek anything that can’t get into you unless you ask. 

What else can’t come into your “home” unless you ask? Jesus is a vampire. Constantly creating problems and fixing them so you give praise. Not only that, but would have you turn the other cheek to become the highest honor in the religion. Martyr. Who by the way sits under the throne crying how long!!!! Forever because Spirits feed on emotions. And if you think God ain’t going to get his fair share of suffering you have lost yo mind. 

From the first book of the cannon we see a “Father” slap a trap in his children’s habitat. I would ever no good parent would. If you would your a fat jerk. The all knowing God of only love set a sin bomb and his children who he knew would disappoint him did because they where not perfect as we are taught. If God made the devil in the same manner then God is not at all love. In fact you are in hell if you believe that. A God in complete control would issue a debt relief to his devil that held a debt against his children..?.!? None of it adds up. 

I pray you are set free. I give you my blessings in my own name. No one split the void between me and I am.

"The difference is your asking for the Holy Spirit to come back into your heart. There is a difference. Jesus tells us that He must go so that we can receive the Holy Spirit, our teacher and comforter. 
Praying to God asking for these through your confession of Belief in Jesus, and that He died upon that cross, resurrected so that we may go home one day. God won't allow another spirit to take place. But we all have free will and can pick back up bad habits and go back to living as we once did.
That's why we need to read our Bibles, our instruction guide of how to live in this world and prepare for the world to come.
