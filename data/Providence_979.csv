Plus Stereo Discount Center just off Thayer, the 2nd floor palm reader, head shops, hair stylists, the basement Curry in a Hurry -- omg their lentil soup and the samosas?

"I lived in Fox Point for over 10 years and have been in Mount Hope for 2 years. I would highly recommend Fox Point. I also think most of Mount Hope is safe.

For Fox Point, for years I frequently got out of work between 11PM and 2:30AM and would walk a few blocks home after parking my car even carrying my laptop with me most of the time. After a while I started dropping off my laptop first, but I never had any problems. The only slightly sketchy thing that happened to me was someone pulled up in a car and asked for money one time. Coincidentally, I knew I didn't have any. I told him I didn't, took out my wallet, showed him, and he drove off. I don't think anything would have happened if I just said no, but it is kind of a scary encounter at 1:30AM! There was a little bit of property crime though. I knew two people who had their cars stolen for I presume joyrides because they got them back just parked elsewhere in the city in both cases. My basement was also broken into and my bike stolen. It was not a good bike anyway lol. There are a couple other little things I can think of, but really as I was there over 10 years I wouldn't say it was worse than the suburb I grew up with the exception of car break-ins maybe. I also think car break-ins are far greater in areas like Federal Hill. No one ever broke into my car.

For Mount Hope, I have not personally encountered anything sketchy. It is scary that there were a couple shootings in the area while I have been here though. That is pretty bad. However, I have never heard of anything happening outside of a few streets and I just would not live on those streets. I have not had to walk around at night, so I can't compare to Fox Point. Property crime is probably less. I have a friend who leaves so much stuff in their car on the street it's like they are trying to bait someone to break in and no one has. As someone who got their bike stolen, I also noticed that bike security is very lax here as I often just see garage doors open with bikes in them.",t2_4d1fo,Nate642,0,1648219281.0,0,t1_i22jid4,i22jid4,True,ofangelics,t3_tk1kwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tk1kwa/looking_to_move_to_providence_as_a_young_female/,"Looking to move to Providence as a young female, what are the safest places to live?",/r/providence/comments/tk1kwa/looking_to_move_to_providence_as_a_young_female/i22jid4/,1,r/providence,0,1

"What you're describing is a normal skating event whether it's ice, roller, indoor, outdoor, and this is pretty low on the rink crowd scale. Imagine going to chez vous where there are literal poles in the middle! lol. The most important part of skating safely in groups is paying tf attention to your surroundings, gaining some intuition to anticipate what someone is about to do, and gauging your skill vs what you want to do.

Moving with wheels and blades requires a little practice. I grew up in rinks as a competitive skater, broke each wrist three times because pads didn't go with my sparkle dresses. Played roller derby for 12 years and my only injuries were a dislocated shoulder and ankle sprain. The best way to survive ground impact is protective gear and knowing how to fall safely, but you can get a gnarly tib/fib from stepping the wrong way all by yourself.

You can crack your skull falling off your bike, too.

u/UncleJimmee if you want to skate, skate. It's wonderful.

Enforce existing noise laws and teach people not to be anti-social. But telling them it's OK to make as much noise as they want whenever they want because they ""enjoy"" it and / or it makes them feel ""cool"" certainly isn't going to change their behavior. Why would you expect it to do so?

Whether that's delirium or not, it's not a chronic illness and it goes away soon after seeing the behaviors of every other human being. We can't make being an asshole illegal, but bitching about a lump sum of people who enjoy something is not going to reduce the assholes.

The number of bone stock vehicles that drive like fucking idiots and try to kill me, and then try to play it off like it's my fault, in this region is obnoxious. I've had people honk and flip me off when they run a long-standing red. 

I've had people literally slam on their brakes to take a picture of my commercial driver information on my vehicle after noticing them flipping me off and driving on my ass, and pulling over to let them pass. 

You want to help public health? Figure out how to get people to stop acting like complete fucking assholes to each other.

This is why I actually enjoy going to inner-cities. People understand that if you act up you could get shot, so they are more civilized than those who actually have a higher standard of means. It's actually quite pathetic that people feel so entitled and untouchable if there life is, apparently, too comfortable.

"I’ve spent a lot of time in both in recent years and currently live in Providence. My breakdown is below but the short of it is: if a genuine city life is more important to you then choose Providence. If access to nature and food/drink/coffee scene is more important to you then choose Portland.

-Portland is on a huge upswing right now. This is making prices crazy but it feels like a city that is exploding with life. The food scene is unbelievable—punches in above most major cities and definitely way above Providence. There is just an energy on the peninsula that is pronounced. The people and energy feels genuinely cool—like the population is as up to date as NYC in trends in hospitality, style, etc. PVD has a few spots that are on this level, but a lot of the scene here feels much more scrappy and a bit behind the cutting edge.

-Portland I think attracts people who care about natural beauty, food, ie have a list for life, people seem happy there. Providence people seem grittier, tougher, etc. 

-The access to nature is also much more real in Portland than here. Honestly Rhode Island is not great for outdoor life—the nearest good beach to Providence is 30-40 minutes in Jamestown or Narragansett and it’s not even that great. There’s no mountains etc. By contrast if you go just ten minutes in any direction from Portland you’re in amazing nature in Falmouth, Cape Elizabeth, etc. and day trips up to mid coast or the mountains are incredible. You can take a ferry to pine islands from downtown Portland in just 20 mins.

-Portland downside is the prices: it’s gotten crazy anywhere that’s remotely urban. I also get the feeling that not many families stay in downtown Portland—it’s young people and vacationers. Doesn’t feel like a real city in that way, though if you plan to live in the burbs then that doesn’t matter.

-What makes Providence great over Portland is its more of a real city if that matters to you. There’s a lot of urban neighborhoods,  ton of diversity. There are obscure music venues with niche audiences, there’s all sorts of authentic ethnic food. I would say culture here in Providence (both traditional museums and things like concert venues, art house movies, etc) is much stronger. Portland is more about drinking an IPA after a hike.

-Providence is much more connected to Boston, New York City and the world more generally. Portland is an outpost, albeit a beautiful one.

-Despite complaints about prices going up, Providence is very affordable. The suburbs are super cheap compared to a lot of east coast locales, and there are cool neighborhoods downtown that are pretty reasonable.",t2_f5ugbqem,lightningbolt1987,0,1648057518.0,0,t1_i1tmqtg,i1tmqtg,True,PenguinontheTelly,t3_tk30a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tk30a1/providence_vs_portland/,Providence vs Portland?,/r/providence/comments/tk30a1/providence_vs_portland/i1tmqtg/,2,r/providence,0,2

* Portland drivers seem almost painfully kind
* Providence drivers think laws around driving are for the weak. 
* Portland yards feel really well maintained and more friendly. Free book libraries, quirky things to play on, etc.

"I’ve never lived in Portland ME but my friend does and I visit. It’s cute. I’d visit her, but not the city intentionally for the city, not stay too long, and I wouldn’t live there. 

To quantify diversity, ME has the whitest (94.3%, meaning ~77,500 in the state who are not white) state in the US, closely followed by VT (94.2%). 

RI generally has a great location. If there’s any culture, arts, nature that you can’t find here, it’s close by. 

I grew up in MA, college in PVD, Boston for 15 years, and just moved back to PVD in 2020. While Boston is surely home, there’s a very square, rat race, joneses vibe that doesn’t exist here. Or at least not in my circles. In the greater Boston area you need to be (or it was normal/standard) to be partnered, home owner or planning to be, super good job, masters degree, etc. The only people who go out are in college. The arts exist but they’re the weirdos, and few and far between. It’s really hard to meet up with people due to traffic and/or everyone leaving the city to buy a house. 1-2 miles is 30 minutes. Crossing the river is like hopping the pond. 

In providence, and perhaps this is because I still have a circle here from way back, it’s just easier. The public transit is abysmal, but its easier to get around by car and the whole place is very walkable. Easier to maintain in person friendships and activities. Rich arts culture. There’s always something going on everywhere,  not like how Boston is all giant corporate sponsored events in the common or back bay, you know? People have all different lives down here. Very townie in the respect of life long residents. Not as transient as Boston due to not having as many colleges. The college neighborhoods are very defined whereas all of Boston is a college neighborhood with some more dense than others. It’s much more family friendly. Children exist down here, and they pretty much don’t in Boston.",t2_3nqtptnr,yourbffanna,0,1647992421.0,0,t1_i1q9lop,i1q9lop,True,PenguinontheTelly,t3_tk30a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tk30a1/providence_vs_portland/,Providence vs Portland?,/r/providence/comments/tk30a1/providence_vs_portland/i1q9lop/,8,r/providence,0,8

"As someone who has lived in both, this sums up well. I’d add a couple points:

Portland feels much more remote in comparison, at least in a New England sense where we’re more on top of each other and one area sort of bleeds into the next. 

Similarly the transit situation is raw. The jetport is nothing special, comes at a premium, and your alternatives are Manchester and Logan. The Downeaster is a joke and is not a sensible option for either budget or schedule. I found myself on that concord trailways bus down to Boston more times than I’d liked because there really weren’t any better / cheaper options. 

There are no good paying jobs. I mean ZERO. Bring your money with you.

Finally the weather is noticeably colder, the summers are much shorter and the winters longer and snowier. Plus side, there is a big skiing culture out there, both downhill and cross country, and it’s a real hoot in the cold months.

"Providence probably has Portland beat for arts and food just based off of size and diversity. Providence has everything when it comes to food and punches way above its weight. Pvd/ri also has the unique quality of good Italian food being everywhere and at every price point. 

Portland has closer access to more beautiful coastal spots and closer to the mountains if you’re into that.

There’s plenty of hiking (just not mountains) when you get outside of providence. Surf is  better in RI than  Maine. Theres a decent sized scene and a few good spots. There’s also a pretty big difference in water temp and that matters if you surf in shoulder seasons. I don’t surf but I do sea kayak and I’m comfortable doing so from May-October. I go up to Maine to kayak every year. For perspective the water temp in early may in RI is about the same as early august in Maine. It’s a big difference. 

Portland is safer and greener for sure. Portland is more like a really big beach town mixed with a very small city. Providence is an actual proper city and while it’s population is only 170k it feels like more because the state and surrounding areas are so dense. There are many neighborhoods seemingly devoid of trees or greenery in providence owing to its Heavily industrial past. 

Portland is better for the outdoors but in terms of entertainment that a city offers providence has it beat by a lot and it’s much easier to take trips elsewhere (Boston, NYC) than it is in Maine.

If you come to RI for the love of god do not say things like “RI is just south Massachusetts”, “There’s nothing different about RI from MA”. We’re our own state and we understand we’re much smaller and Boston is a big global city.",t2_7mc9n,r0k0v,0,1647974508.0,0,t1_i1p0z9g,i1p0z9g,True,PenguinontheTelly,t3_tk30a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tk30a1/providence_vs_portland/,Providence vs Portland?,/r/providence/comments/tk30a1/providence_vs_portland/i1p0z9g/,1,r/providence,0,1

"Moved to Prov from the west coast ~1yr ago. I'll probably get dvotes for this but imo Providence is loud and menacing. I find that there are a whole lot of inconsiderate, and actively antisocial people here. The noise is next level, especially the nightly bass, the shouting in streets, and the fireworks. The traffic here is wild. People regularly just drive on the shoulder or even in the oncoming lane, and I've never felt road rage like I have here. Smoking seems much more common here than on the west coast, especially indoors. People love to do stuff like cut in the checkout line, and on multiple occasions I've been followed home (I'm a guy) or physically threatened.

I've lived in other bigger cities on the east coast, and in SoCal. The whole hustle culture psychopathy vibe def only applies to a small handful of people in the day, though it's waaay more than other places like Roxbury or SF. I feel more energized here and people in general are very friendly. It's certainly got its charm, and I think there are lots of people who appreciate the upsides and don't mind the downsides.

"Maine will have better access to mountains obviously. White Mountains are about 2 hours from Portland and Maine has its own mountains. If that's what you are into. RI does not have anything to compare with that. I drive an hour to Wachusett or often just do Blue Hills like you might already do. There are plenty of little hikes around RI but if you are looking for verticals they don't really exist except in very small doses.

That said, the location of RI vs. ME in terms of the ocean currents means that ME beaches are much colder than RI (I mean in terms of 5-8 degrees being a difference, not like tropical vs arctic). I can use the ocean from mid May through early November. Don't get me wrong it's cold at those extremes but the 5-8 degree temp difference really extends the season IMO.

If you go full (ed:) drysuit surfing I think these are kind of equivalent. It is IMO a little harder to get to the best spots in RI (rocky shores to navigate) though beach surfing in Narragansett and Second Beach in Newport is nice. If you don't like drysuit I think the season is again, much shorter in Maine.

I will say that Providence feels more like part of the Boston metro than Portland (45 minute vs 2:30 train ride for instance) if that is important to you. I have no problem going to a show or game in Boston in the evening and being ok the next day. I also like the 3 hour train ride to NYC which makes it easily doable as an overnight or weekend.

"My friends in Portland complain a lot about tourists during the summer, basically making the downtown area completely undesirable. For me, that’s one of the things I liked about Providence; when the weather was nice it was more of a locals-only type city when some of the college kids went home. The tourists are going to the coast. 

Portland is smaller and less diverse and of course colder/snowier. Portland has better beer and access to the woods. Portland is further away from everything and I think has a lower cost of living. I’d hate to be that far from Logan. Both cities have good food scenes, although I think Providence wins slightly. Providence is a bit rowdier and I think there’s a larger gap between the haves and have-nots in Providence. In Portland you’d be more reliant on a car than Providence. Both cities have their own unique small-city personality and also benefit from being the largest city in their state.

"I was born and raised in Portland and moved to Providence 2 years ago. Some pros and cons - for reference I lived on the West End in Portland and currently live near Hope Village in Providence. 

Portland

Pros: 

- extremely walkable/bikeable
- amazing food scene
- happy hour is a legal thing
- feels safer than Providence (might be due to the size difference)
- Decent little arts scene (especially with MECA right on Congress St downtown)
- Not a ton of noise pollution

Cons:

- Housing prices are through the roof right now and bordering on Boston levels. It's nearly impossible to find something on the peninsula
- Due to the size can feel pretty sleepy at times
- If you're not into the bar scene there's not a whole lot to do at night
- There is a very pronounced lack of services for the underserved population. There's one large cluster of social services near Preble Street and this area causes lots of tension for folks within the city.
- Because of the size, a lot of the standard amenities you'd find within a larger city are niche and more expensive. Think barber shops, butchers, etc.
- Closest decent surfing is going to be 45 minutes south at Short Sands/Long Sands in York.  
- A bit of a lack of diversity in population
- Gentrification is rampant within the city limits

Providence

Pros: 

- Much more to do on a daily/nightly basis
- Comparable restaurant and bar scene to Portland, just more varied
- Much more diversity 
- Surprisingly not overwhelming for its size
- Amazing ethnic and specialty markets

Cons

- Noise pollution is definitely a thing compared to Portland
- Much more crime, even taking consideration of the size difference
- Feels a bit more rough-around-the-edges than Portland (may be a Pro, depending on how you look at it)
- Roads are terrible

"Fox point is a great option on the East Side, more affordable than Wayland and close by to a ton of shops and restaurants, this was one of my favorite neighborhoods to live in. Ideally, The East Side is the “safest”, but there is still a lot of college kids and your car is always susceptible to a smash and grab no matter where you are in the city. Hope Street has a lot of good options too. When looking at a map, anything above Camp and all the way down to Blackstone Blvd is good, and you probably wouldn’t want to go any more north than Pidge Ave (or LA Fitness for reference), if you want to be walking distance to anything. If you can find something off of Benefit street, grab it. Steer clear of downtown, anything between the river and the highway, rents are high and it’s really not worth it. Federal Hill and Broadway have a lot of great options too as you move into the West End. These neighborhoods are really hit or miss when it comes to crime - fed hill has gotten a bad rep the past several years, and for good reason, however there are some diamonds in the rough as far as housing and streets go - you’d want to be as close to Atwells as possible. Broadway, knight street, also great reference points to start looking around too, and The Armory District (parade street), although a bit on the edge of town, has awesome spots, and typical renters are young industry workers who like to utilize the park with their dog.

And to answer your question. I was 18 years old and work at Burger King for three days before they offered me a management position . And my 21 year old sister with slight learning disabilities is a manager at Burger King . “Management” at fast food is the equivalent of a intern at a huge company. There is absolutely something wrong with full grown adults being managers at fast food places . Literally it’s so simple . Keep a crew and report sales and inventory . Most people straight from high school can  perform that job . Also it requires zero college education and zero past experience . Fast food management is nothing . And the thing is . A single person or couple  can support them selves from that job . It’s the people who have 5 children who say they can’t . Again use your degree for deductive reasoning. These are entry level jobs . They are meant for teens and young adults .

"And here is where you show your ass.

You're complaining about people not having jobs, but also complaining about people who have jobs, for example, a manager at a fast food restaurant. Why shouldn't someone who works full time make enough money to support themselves? And if you say something dumb like these are jobs for high school kids and college kids... who the fuck is going to do them during the schoolday if not working adults?

You: Get a job! Also you: Not like that!

My generation was taught we were to go to college no matter what, and even if you get a dumb degree it was supposed to demonstrate  competence and follow through, or at least that's what all the adults in my life told me. 

I really wasn't given much of a choice, my parents told me at 18 go to college, or youre kicked out. Why is that on me and not the adults that should have known better? 

So yes, I have a pretty dumb degree (Political Science), but I have also maintained for years, *if I had been given a choice by my family to work and wait, I would have chosen a major with a clear career path.*

You talk about skills, your wife has a job anyone can master in weeks. I don't even mean that with any disrespect, I started my career doing direct care work. It's important and valuable work, but let's not pretend the actual skills needed are something anyone cannot learn. 

Because of my useless degree in Political Science, however, I was able to get promoted to human service management more quickly than if I had no education.

You kinda self-own here, youre so busy putting productive adults' ways of earning a living down, if your family is so successful, why do you even rent instead of owning your own home? Surely if you can afford 1200/month on a fucking apartment, you should have been able to get a mortgage before home prices spiked?

See, I can put down others poor life choices too! Youre not the only one.

Umm you would probably need to just take the commuter rail to and from PVD. It's more reliable. Also the acela tends to be late leaving to boston from PVD so it is a 40 min or so trip but it can be 10 to 20 minutes late at times so you know. The amtrak coming back comes in just fine. But to be honest a commute to a job near south station or copley isn't bad but the commute to cambridge is actually rather far. I would be budgeting an hour and half to get to cambridge at least.

"**Quick bite of food** \- highly recommend Nice Slice for a slice of pizza. It is great NY style thin crust and they have tons of vegan options if you're lactose intolerant like me! If you're looking for something sweeter, hit up Madrid (Santiago cake, chocolate eclair) or Seven Stars (ginger scone, cinnamon bun).

**Best view** \- As others mentioned, Prospect Terrace is far and away your best option.

**Interesting Walkable Areas:** Brown's campus is beautiful, as others have mentioned. If you go that route, my favorite street to walk along is Benefit St! Very old houses, all different colors, very New England vibe. Both Hope St & Wickenden have cute little ""town square"" esque areas with little shops, cafes, and restaurants you could check out too. I also really enjoy the pedestrian bridge that crosses the river and walking alongside the (albeit small) riverwalk.",t2_23ltrulq,roshashana,0,1647741269.0,0,t1_i1cs7ic,i1cs7ic,True,Snibbly_Tigs,t3_thut0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/thut0b/tips_for_a_traveler/,Tips for a traveler,/r/providence/comments/thut0b/tips_for_a_traveler/i1cs7ic/,1,r/providence,0,1

"Well, that’s pretty much what I said in my last comment. I can see that you should leave out pictures and wording that hints at race, economic status etc. But other than that, I don’t see why it’s an issue to just tell them why you’re excited about the property. I think that’s no different than when you’re there and you talk to the owners or their representative. Plus, everybody might be exaggerating (lying) in their letters, so everybody is in the same position. And, trust me, I’ve been on the receiving end of housing discrimination recently and know the market is no fun if you’re not a big corporation or have crazy deep pockets. I think the government should pass a bill that forbids corporate or out of country investors to buy up entire neighborhoods for rentals or investment, changing the face of communities, causing gentrification.

"The rent situation in Providence is terrible, but that's true all over the country as well. For example, I follow a community website for a very small town in rural Virginia, (because my Mom lives there), and there are numerous posts from families desperately searching for affordable places to rent. I was shocked at how high the prices were; it's not urban, not a great place to live, and jobs pay much, much less. It's depressing and it leads to people becoming homeless or food-insecure.

I moved to Providence in 2018 when I looked around in Malden, MA, which was already a long commute to my job in Boston, and realized that if my landlord ever raised the rent to market-level, there would be nothing I could afford. I love living here, despite the drawbacks; it's the first time in decades I've been in a place where I feel some sense of belonging. I think a lot of the skyrocketing rents in Providence are due to the high taxes for property owners who can't claim the Homestead Exemption. Brown and other universities own most of the properties here and don't pay taxes, so individual owners have to make up that difference.",t2_2607017r,wearTheDamnMask_137,0,1647698600.0,0,t1_i1a4slr,i1a4slr,True,knoeKNAME,t3_tfcvh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tfcvh0/its_crazy_to_me/,It’s crazy to me...,/r/providence/comments/tfcvh0/its_crazy_to_me/i1a4slr/,3,r/providence,0,3

"Oh, I'm not saying that it is illegal but that there is a current bill in the House that would make it illegal. The bill is to add a section to the RI Fair Housing Act.  I can see why it could be a problem.  Discriminating is easier than you think.

For instance, it could be as simple as saying that you have children or that you're excited to buy a house because you got married last year. The whole point of the letter is to influence the buyer to choose you so it's not a stretch that you could influence the buyer to choose you (or not) for a discriminatory reason. 

The summary of the bill is:  *Prohibits a seller’s agent from receiving buyer ""love letters"" when receiving offers to purchase real property.*

And, if it passes, it would add this to the RI Fair Housing Act:

*In order to help a seller avoid selecting a buyer based on the buyer’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or familial status as prohibited by the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.) and this section, a seller’s agent shall reject any communication other than customary documents in a real estate transaction, including photographs, provided by a buyer.*",t2_2wj9a87x,littleheaterlulu,0,1647674999.0,0,t1_i19966y,i19966y,False,EmperorMing101,t3_tdk4vx,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tdk4vx/hows_everyone_doing_in_this_crazy_housing_market/,How’s everyone doing in this crazy housing market?,/r/providence/comments/tdk4vx/hows_everyone_doing_in_this_crazy_housing_market/i19966y/,1,r/providence,0,1

"Right so it’s people, not the conditions they’re subjected to? People are products of their environment. The institutions put in place to make sure people and their families aren’t forgotten have failed over and over again, and these rents are a reflection of that happening again, just on another spectrum. The elements that made some of these neighborhoods desirable in the first place were products of the people who lived there before, whether it be “there’s lots of families here and the neighbors all know each other,” or “that market on the corner is walking distance and makes really great sandwiches.” People move to those neighborhoods, prices increase with demand, and then the families and the markets that made the neighborhood appealing in the first place are priced out. What you have left is a bunch of cultureless assholes capable of/willing to pay whatever the hell landlords are asking for. Slap a brewery and a $7 latte on it and you have your new problem. “This neighborhood isn’t what it used to be.” Then those people look for homes wherever the last people were priced out to, and bully them out of that neighborhood too.

The rents in Providence aren't trying to keep pace with Boston, they are trying to keep pace with the taxes in Providence.  Theoretically, Providence rents should be higher than Boston rents.

Even when cities are property tax dependent, like Providence is, they can (and do) lower the property tax rate when property values increase because they can still bring in the same amount of money even with lower property tax rates. 

But, not Providence, they keep those super high property tax rates even with increases in property values. That is the greed that is not being addressed.

What I realistically want is for people that rent not to be exploited by people who aren’t doing anything other than owning property. You should be able to live comfortably when renting.

The first policy goal should be that everyone has shelter, and our current solutions are failing that even that basic goal, much less delivering affordable and desirable housing.

"Rent control sounds good but it almost never typically works as intended. It almost always leads to reduction in amount of housing stock and to rapid and broad degradation in remaining housing quality. 

It also causes black-market-type situations that exacerbate rather than alleviate housing shortages/costs. [This is a good article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/15/comeback-rent-control-just-time-make-housing-shortages-worse/) from a left/pro-poor-person-perspective on why rent control is bad. I'm willing to talk more about this though, because I'm very passionate about the issue of housing, and i def think rent control is a dead-end.

As far as nationalization of every single rental property in the United States..... I think it's easy to be reflexively anti-free-market in the US, because our society has been trashed by extreme-free-market-fundamentalism over the past 50 years... but this is a bad idea, even if it was politically viable. 

Standing up and maintaining a (municipal? state? federal?) agency to administer every single apartment across the United States would be a logistical nightmare and would take billions of dollars to staff before you even factor in the costs of building/maintaining housing. Also, while dealing with landlords can be rough, I imagine dealing with a (state? municipal? federal?) agency to deal with a clogged toilet would be a lateral change at best. There is also the inevitably of black markets, which will re-monetize everything basically defeat the whole. 

I think a lot of people who put forward these ideas don't factor in the prevalence and danger of black markets.

"In the short term I think we can do a lot to maximize our existing housing stock. All over the country companies (including Zillow!) were actively buying as many houses as possible to rent them out.

So we could say, for example, that companies are not allowed to own single family houses at all and must sell them in the next year or face steep penalties. This would let them still own large apartment buildings, but would remove the price pressure on single family homes that are driving all housing prices up. 

Or we could introduce rent control: just say you're not allowed to charge more than a reasonable rate. We'd have to hash out how to calculate a reasonable rate, but that's what lawmakers are for.

These are solutions that still allow landlords to exist but prevent companies from just hoarding all the houses and then saying ""an apartment now costs $2K/month and since we/our friends own all the houses you have no choice.""

">Insinuating i didnt work for it.

I didn't insinuate dick.  Right now you're leaching off of the working class.  Clear enough for you buddy?

>So your telling me it would make it better if the owner was born rich or inherited the house?

Honestly yes.  At least then you can claim ignorance but you know exactly their struggles.

>Also i dont make people pay anything THE MARKET SETS THE PRICES.

Not true at all.  The market sets the price that is the absolute highest it can be while still having people actually in homes.  It maximizes profits.  I'm sure you could charge less and still make a profit but **you** don't want to.  You set the the price of your apartments don't try to pass the responsibility on to something else.  you have to live with the prices you charge.

>Quote from 1 of my favorite childhood movies. “ Its my party and i cry if i want too”. You would cry too if it happened to u. Oh my bad u already crying.

What?  I would cry if I was charged a lot for rent? This didn't make any sense.

>im just fucking with you. But honestly be the change you want to see in the world. Buy a house in this market and proceed to charge below market rents. Lmk how it goes for you. Or become a politician and make laws that support your pov.

Me buying a house and charging below market rent does absolutely nothing to fix the system.  You're either ignorant of that or being disingenuous.  My bet is disingenuous considering you're on the right track that it should be laws that prevent people like you to cause people to live paycheck to paycheck.

>I still got a job but its my day off thats y i have all this time to address you. Have a blessed day tho real talk

"Unfortunately this isn’t actually making the neighborhoods thrive at all, a lot of these overpriced apartments stay empty because the landlords are charging $200 non refundable “application fees” and making more on that than they would in rent (they are easily getting 20+ apps per unit per month).

My roommate was looking for a place for over a year, she saw the same apartments listed for months and would be told there a dozens of applicants ahead of her but somehow it stays vacant.

"r/Providence is more of a discussion on the City withere r/PVD is a circlejerk of the city.  Thats what i meant from the last comment. 

I get what you are saying and I agree with you.  However someone who is proud of their view and may have spent a lot of money on it made a post to show it off.  Now I know this is the internet and we write things we wouldn't necessarily say to someone's face but I think a reasonable responsible may have been.  ""cool view, enjoy it"".  But people on the internet love to ""Yuck the yum of others"".  Did it occur to you that the reason you are getting downvoted isn't because you don't like Providence but maybe you're pissing on OP's parade?

Aren't you pretty much describing 90% of reddit.  Most subreddits are a circlejerk or ""cultish"" for that particular topic.  Don't be surprised when you are downvoted in r/pizza for saying pizza isn't that good.  The reason people joined r/pizza was cause they love pizza, want to know more about it and share experiences.  You're coming in basically saying pizza sucks.. I can't wait until I stop eating it.. and I can't believe why you guys in this pizza subreddit talk so highly off it.
