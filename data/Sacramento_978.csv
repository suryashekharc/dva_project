"It’s on you bro 🤷

This is my list and you can criticize it as much as you want but Ryujin will be my #5 no matter how much you complain about it.

It’s ramen comfort food despite how simple it is. I used to be like you who only like authentic ramens but the more I thought about it, it was close minded of me to remove any casual-Americanized ramen because at the end of the day, they’re still really good despite being simple. 

And on your point about being a restaurant, yes but quite a lot of ramen restaurants nowadays actually shy away from a ramen shop from Japan. In Japan, the owners make money from being able to get out the food fast so they can get the next customers. This is precisely why Ryujin, despite being as you say “Subway” of ramen which in all honestly is a disrespect to the cook and owner, will always hold dear to my heart. 

Most of the ramen restaurants I listed out isn’t similar to the ones at Japan, only Ryujin actually sticks with it.

"Ok so I’ll answer the question about the penalty.
A while back the law required owners of AR type rifles to register them as they would be considered illegal to own without said registration. I had to register my rifle or face felony charges if caught even though my rifle didn’t have to change in any way. Now I can not sell or transfer my legally owned and registered property. On top of it I had to pay to register this rifle I have own for years.

"Your reading comprehension needs some work. I never said I resent paying into CalSTRS.

I pay 10.205%. Non-public school employees pay 6.2%.

I also pay into a Roth 403b and Roth IRA. Please. I pay way more percentage wise than the typical person.

“Our rule of thumb is to save 15% annually at any point throughout your career, and that includes any contribution your employer might make,"" says Meghan Murphy, a vice president at Fidelity Investments.

Other 401(k) providers recommend similar savings rates. ""Typically we would recommend that a person save 12% to 15% of their salary for retirement,"" says Shannon Nutter-Wiersbitzky, a principal at Vanguard.

*However, most 401(k) participants aren't saving this much. The average 401(k) contribution was 7% of pay in 2020, according to Vanguard 401(k) plan data, but that jumps to 11% when employer contributions are included. Only 22% of 401(k) participants save more than 10% of their salary for retirement.*”

So what is your point? You resent paying into your pension? Or that others HAVE TO PAY INTO SICIAL SECURITY AND some form of retirement - generous public pension that your employer also contributes to - or those of us who don’t have guaranteed public pensions and fund our own retirement thru 401ks and IRAs - often w/out am employer contribution?

"A few caveats. First, any professionals are working with 4-6 weeks vacations, plus standards days off which make that 261 more like 226. I know this because I'm on the job hunt for non teaching jobs and struggling hard to accept possibly losing my summers :(  but I agree that have the days off, especially around holidays, is a very nice work of teaching. 

Second, during the day we actually work more. I teach roughly 5 classroom hours per day. And for those 5 hours I must be ""on"" in a way that others are not. I think nurses are one of the other fields that is uniquely like this. In my previous work experience I was never ""on"" for the length of my shift. Never on for 5 cumulative hours per day. In teaching I also have to plan, grade, and communicate with families, along with other shit. This adds about 2-3 additional hours each day for new teachers and for English teachers. For me it's like 1 more hour each day. So I'm a workday as a teacher I put in 6 hours of work everyday. In my previous office work, retail work, and restaurant work, I never put in 6 hours, even if I was on the clock for 10. 

And none of that matters. The simple fact is that they are starving for teachers and can't fill classrooms with qualified people, so kids are forced to stay with subs and fill out worksheets they don't know. If the district can't get teachers then their wages are inadequate for the market.

"I think this is something that SCTA could have made concessions on years ago, so it wouldn’t be so painful now. 

Healthcare premiums go up every year. It wasn’t as painful a few years ago when our district joined the state healthcare pool and we were able to lower some of the projected increases by being in a larger pool. We fight for 1-2% raises every year while our healthcare premiums go up, pretty much negating any raise. But our base salaries are higher so it helps with STRS.

"Most of the Stockton corridor businesses are empty because there is no parking for cars

and a 5 lane road cutting through the area makes it hostile to bikes and pedestrians.

Because we are in a food desert, with an empty business district, people are forced to drive out of the neighborhood.

Which creates a self fulfilling dependence on cars, roads, parking lots, strip malls, etc.

Most of their students are very low income. Highlands takes donations and gives them to any needing student for free.

"When you say “teachers agree to lowering costs of healthcare” do you mean they are open to paying for their healthcare? 

One of the posters below shared that teachers,‘perhaps also classified, pay nothing - even for a family of 6.

That is a very very unheard of benefit - 100% coverage of at least 6 family members with zero employee contribution? 

So what is the union willing to have employees pay toward health care to get more, higher salaries, compensation?

I believe the union is agreeing to let the district find lower premium cost options yet still have the district pay 100% of coverage for employees and all their family- and lifetime benefits for the employee?

I am so confused by zero health benefit payment from employees and ALSO asking for higher compensation.

"Absolutely agree that SCUSD is having issues recruiting teachers. I do not believe it is exclusively or primarily due to salary/ compensation. A decade or more of contentious relations between board and union, years of turnover and dubious pension sweeteners the Casa deal), for highly paid executives, the threat of receivership by the state due to fiscal problems, etc., also contribute to challenges recruiting.
I believe bonuses make sense - the examples you provided - as they are one time (or periodic) incentives that do not lock the district into long term compensation and the pension obligations. Bonuses don’t lock in long term salary increases and increased employer contributions to STRS and PERS (I believe classified are likely PERS, and some teachers who were in administrative or non teaching positions may also be in PERS, partially).

"So I was interested in purchasing something in these areas, and felt the burbs would be awful (except for proximity to the mountains. But Sac is closer to the central Sierra, so can't really go wrong.) The ability to walk or bike around town is huge in my opinion. Means you don't have to drive nearly as much. Especially if you bike or run the city can be so small, in a good way. And the trees, character of the neighborhood just have so much more to offer. That said, it's a trade off. 2 bed/ 1 bath going for the same as a suburb bigger, newer house with more space. But the total lack of substance those neighborhoods have is really off putting and frankly bizarre.

From time spent, there are definitely homeless folk wandering around all over the grid and beyond into those neighborhoods these days. Fact of life. You'll do well to really learn the area before buying. And depending on budget it might be a minute until you find a place that meets your criteria in the areas less likely to see foot traffic of this kind.

Personally I've become not so stoked on the wildfire smoke situation and so have given up my search for more permanent housing in this area. But if I had to live anywhere in greater Sac, it'd absolutely be closer to the urban core rather than in the burbs.
