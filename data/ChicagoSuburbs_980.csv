"The islands of culture in suburbs in general are often small, and hard to find. I think you might have a little more success looking across the border into Indiana.  I was born and raised in the south suburbs.  Indiana seemed A Million Miles away though I'm less than a dozen miles from where I grew up. 

If you're not interested in heading into the city, and as the weather is changing I know that people enjoy hanging out on the square in Crown Point.  

Another suggestion for the summer and it's a little bit farther away, not particularly cultural, but a ton of fun, the Bristol Renaissance faire on the Wisconsin border. Little more than an hours drive from the south burbs. Go with some friends from work but have a designated driver.  You'll see comedy shows acrobats, jousting, and yes they even have turkey legs. He'll just be smiling and having so much fun with whomever you're with and it'll be a good bonding experience. Invite somebody from work to go as couples. 

As an outdoor activity there's a unique place not far from you on Lake Michigan. Cowles Bog is part of a National Park. It is a beautiful hike through the dunes and not very difficult. You could go there any time of year and when you come out onto the Beach area the views from the top of the dune of downtown are lovely.  You can drive a little farther into Michigan people like to visit wineries and do wine tastings.  

Back in Northwest Indiana there are popcorn festivals, festivals for The wizard of Oz. There are still pieces of small town America more so than in the South Chicago suburbs.

Edit: Another activity that I thought of is one that my family and I have done. Audition as a supernumerary at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.  It's an amazing place and if you were to get on stage you would have an awful lot of fun.  You'd get to meet people as well and have a bit of the urban life that you miss.

"Just a suggestion...  further south of Rosemont but it wouldn't hurt to check out some areas around the Cook County Forest Preserve. Willow Springs and Lemont seems like it would be ideal. You can get to Midway Airport in about 20-30min... its also much easier than flying out of O'Hare imo. Might take you a few more minutes driving to the airport but you should get through it a lot quicker. O'Hare could be made in about a half hour depending on traffic.

Is it possible that a subuurban cop is out there scamming people? Yes. How likely? I'd say very low. Suburban cops around Chicago tend to be asses but I haven't seen many corrupt ones.

"I'm from So Cal originally as well, and though the traffic patterns are different between here and LA, they are both challenging.

The issue with Chicagoland traffic is that once you get out of the immediate area and into the suburbs, you'll find that most of towns and villages are like islands with an inadequate road system of mostly single lane highways connecting them (and it's much worse when the weather is bad). And be careful on those highways. People often drive like maniacs because of those long connectors between populated areas and weave in and out of traffic (though it has gotten better since they raised the speed limit to 70).

"I currently live in Glen Ellyn (approx 7 yrs) and my wife is from Downers. Here is my take on the villages you list regarding property taxes:

Glen Ellyn - not as many business districts, so the homeowners foot the bill for the property taxes (which are mainly for the schools); volunteer fire dept though so no tax for that

Downers Grove & Elmhurst - many business districts which offset the homeowners’ property taxes

Hinsdale - expensive homes so the property taxes don’t need to be as high in order to collect the necessary amount to fund the schools

Clarendon Hills (CH) - don’t know a ton about the town, but my wife says that the houses are similar to Glen ellyn’s, but they have a really small business district (their downtown is almost nonexistent).

1) She is unaware of having hit the guy's car.
2) Something that usually does not involve cash (car repairs) is handled with cash.
3) She's from out of state.
4) There's a sense of urgency, because the guy wants his money right away, and you need to solve this right now to avoid future problems.

How did she give him $1200? Surely she doesn't carry that much cash.

Part of me wants to know if she got the guy's license plate and other identifying info, so she can potentially take it to the police. Then I remembered that a cop was in on it.

Here is the answer to your first question...

City of Countryside   
""There are four mock-ups being constructed north of City Hall. Each is being constructed like a different section of the new Municipal Complex. The main purpose of these advanced mock-ups is to enable testing and simulation of air infiltration levels in the building envelope. In other words, how much air from the inside of the building is being leaked to the outside and vice-versa. To aim for Net Zero Energy, the CountrysideMunicipal Complex has been designed to achieve a maximum 0.25 CFM/ft2infiltration rate, which is 165% higher performance than conventional, energy-conscious practices might meet. One of the key take-a-ways from early energy studies by Dewberry Architects was the significance of a tight building envelope in reducing energy demands. The second purpose of the advanced mock-ups is that the contractors will be using the actual building construction materials and finishes that will be used on the construction of the new Municipal Complex.  Things like the installation of the windows and doors, the color of the brick and mortar, the color of the metal trim, and how all the materials come together will be built on these mock-ups so that there is a reduction in running into a construction issue during the construction of the facility""",t2_k47s0f0,ChicagoTRS1,0,1648007587.0,0,t1_i1r5nwd,i1r5nwd,True,loweexclamationpoint,t3_tkk35n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tkk35n/saw_these_on_a_trip_to_midway_what_are_they/,Saw these on a trip to Midway - what are they?,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tkk35n/saw_these_on_a_trip_to_midway_what_are_they/i1r5nwd/,5,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,5

Those factors are essential for the system to monitor the engineer’s compliance with signals and speed restrictions and to calculate when to stop the train in case the engineer does not comply.""

You'll notice that the turn-around at the terminal stations is about 15 minutes and BNSF has said previously it takes them 12 minutes to set up each run under PTC. So there's no room for serving those stations on the post-rush-hour hourly schedule. Fortunately, all of them are pretty short trip (i.e., less than half a mile) to a nearby station that still has service.",t2_qcrd0,mr_yozhik,0,1647986832.0,0,t1_i1pwd8d,i1pwd8d,False,mr_yozhik,t3_tk4z56,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tk4z56/new_metra_bnsf_schedule_effective_march_28th/,New Metra BNSF Schedule - Effective March 28th,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tk4z56/new_metra_bnsf_schedule_effective_march_28th/i1pwd8d/,4,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,4

"I've put together and taken apart several. They aren't very tricky, especially if instructions are included or can be downloaded. Usually takes 1 person 2 to 3 hours, and 1 person can definitely do it alone. 

Be sure you have the trampoline hook to attach the springs to the frame. Last time, I did a used trampoline and had to improvise a hook from some metal rod and a vise grips. Yuck.

And if there is a separate step where you hang all the springs from the net, then go around and attach them to the frame, don't. Just attach a spring to the net and immediately hook it to the frame. Do about every 4th or 5th spring, carefully counting out holes in frame and net. The last few will be very hard to pull.

"Lifelong Joliet resident, made a reddit account to comment here. I am glad you're finding pleasant people and experiences for your family here. I will advocate for this city until I am blue in the face, so I am thrilled that you're finding positive things to say about Joliet.

First, the food! I saw you mention Facebook groups; there's a VERY popular group about our food fare called Joliet Area Bar and Restaurant Guide. Portillos is the tip of the iceberg. Portillos is a catch-all of all things Chicago fast food. Portillos is strictly okay in the grand scheme. If you want to understand the draw, by all means sample the menu. But do know that there are better places around Joliet to get any item that they serve. In the same vein as Portillos, I will recommend Mr. Submarine and Pop's. Honing in to particularly hot dogs and sausages, Joliet is a goldmine. Babe's, Joe's, Jody's and Hey! Hot Dog are established places in the area to sample and begin to understand the Chicagoland hotdog and sausage fandom. Babe's is a particularly nice example, as they are a staple of Joliet cuisine, alongside Merichka's and Al's mentioned in this thread. Babe's has a LOT of pictures on the walls, and people will bring their old hot rods out to their parking lot on weekly cruise nights.

On the topic of classics, I'll recommend you try a few other places throughout town. In addition to some of the classics I mentioned, Thayer Bros. Deli, Jameson's Pub, Old Fashioned Pancake House, and Anthony's are big, classic names in the Joliet restaurant scene. Some newer places that are definitely worth knowing are K-Ribs, Sushi Ya, Forno, Juliet's, Cut 158 and Hamburgerseria. Those restaurants are all full-service, find-a-solid-meal type joints. An underappreciated aspect of our dining scene is the local cafe. Jitters, Kafe De Kasa, and Homecut Donuts all serve a killer cup of coffee, and in our neighboring Plainfield, Krema and 10 Drops are solid coffee houses. Joliet also has a huge Mexican population, and a lot of good Mexican food. In central Joliet, La Mina, El Sabor and El Primo are stand out joints. Headed east to Collins street, Luna Mexicana, Los Comales (a Chicago export) and Mariscos La Laguna are big names of the area. Collins street and the surrounding area is a stronghold of Mexican community and culture in town as well - the Hartman Center has some events throughout the year that may be good to get the family out to, as does the Spanish Community Center on Eastern Avenue.

On to family experiences. You are right, Joliet has a lot of churches. The obvious big one is the cathedral, but one church that seems to be related to everything in town is St. Joe's. They have a big park complex on the north side of town along Raynor and Theodore, and you should be able to find a lot of family friendly programming at their complex in the summer; their picnic is an annual hit. Another big event in the summer is The Taste of Joliet, at the stadium on West Jefferson. That area is the HQ for all things park district, their social media will be a great source of things to do. If it comes back, their series of concerts in the park should be something to pay attention to. On the other side of town, the Joliet City Center Partnership puts on a lot of events along Chicago Street near the Rialto. Two big ones from the partnership that happen every year are New Orleans North and Fiesta En La Calle, and other events in that same neighborhood you'll hopefully see coming back this year are Star Wars day and Rock The Block. Right in downtown you'll also find Bicentennial park and Slammer's Stadium, which offer a lot of summer fun for the family and frequent fireworks displays. Further east, Pilcher park and Nowell park have a lot of youth and family programming, much of it outdoor recreation focused, as does the Will County Forest Preserve.

To your point about opportunities for writers, I can recommend a few things to investigate. As teaching goes, there are 2 universities and a junior college in town that could offer opportunities. There is a bit of a scene for local artists in Joliet. Some venues that I've seen spoken word/poetry events take place are The Drunken Donut, Jitters, The Strange and Unusual Gallery, and Elder Brewing. The people that host/book these events may be connected with established local writers, and could put you in contact with people in the know. We also have the University of St. Francis and their English department. Every year they have a conference showcasing written work of University students, so there may be some insight in that department in the direction of getting published in Joliet.

Lastly, Chicago. I've seen other redditors mention the Metra. I can vouch, it is a great way to get to and from Chicago. I rode the rock island from Joliet to 35th Street, and then the Red Line up to Fullerton while attending graduate school at DePaul. If you are to ride the Metra, you should also make yourself familiar with the CTA. The Ventra app will have your tickets for both services in one, and will have a map of stops for any line you're riding. The Metra is reliable except for when it's not; it frequently gets stuck in Mokena and Blue Island waiting for signal clearance, and trains that follow the Beverly sub-line take a slow detour of local stops through the southwest side of Chicago. The delays might not be all that painful, as the seats on the train aren't small, and sometimes you'll be near a power outlet and connected to WiFi. Overall, it's a thrifty alternative to driving, where the trade-off is possibly a lot of your time. Something I do to get the best of both worlds is park at Midway and ride the Orange Line into the city.

"My wife used to sit for people she would meet as members at her work.  She typically got around $15-20 an hour depending on the number of children, but you have to be selective as there were parents that thought they were hiring a nanny.  They would ask her to pick their kids up from school, take them to the park with the dog for playtime and exercise, or do housecleaning or dishes at the house.

I always told her to refuse that type of stuff due to liability of getting into a car accident with their kids inside, a major injury at a park, or other unexpected situations.

The worst was a family that asked her to spend the weekend while they went on an out of state funeral, and ended up paying her like 300 for Friday at 5pm through Sunday 9pm.  it was about $6/hr.

\- Riverside Foods, our local grocery store  
\- two bars, one of which is a charming cocktail bar right across from the train station  
\- oodles of public parks

In addition, you would have ready access to Berwyn, Brookfield, LaGrange, Forest Park, and Oak Park, all of which provide plenty to do for young professionals. Berwyn would provide affordable housing for those who don't have kids, while those wanting good schools can live in Riverside or further west. Access to downtown is rather easy via Metra, I-290, I-55, or Ogden. Plus being on the Metra BNSF corridor lets you potentially seek talent from places out west such as Naperville since it's an easy train ride.

If Riverside doesn't work for you, then you might wish to look at Brookfield, Berwyn, and LaGrange as well.",t2_qcrd0,mr_yozhik,0,1647751241.0,0,t1_i1dab9g,i1dab9g,True,ConsciousAuthor7982,t3_thxtf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/thxtf1/where_to_open_an_office_in_west_southwest_chicago/,Where to open an office in west / southwest Chicago suburb?,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/thxtf1/where_to_open_an_office_in_west_southwest_chicago/i1dab9g/,2,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,2

"I imagine due to covid there's still probably a lot of great deals anywhere you look. Curious why West / Southwest Suburbs?  
Keep in mind a few things  


* Unless you are planning paying top salary that keeps up with inflation, you probably want to be somewhere where your employees don't necessarily need a car (e.g. near a train station). Many young people are still too broke to afford a car payment (and interest rates are starting to rise)
* If for whatever reason you have to interact with the county, Cook county is is the largest county in the country so if you ever need anything from them, it will take 6x as long to get back to you. I imagine DuPage & Will have more reasonable response times.
* If your workplace is primarily young professionals, you would do better with local amenities (e.g. local bar, coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, etc) in walking distance. 

I would suggest riding the Metra lines that serve West and Southwest (UP-W, BNSF, SWS, and maybe Rock Island?) - they all go through several ""quaint"" business districts of various suburbs. Majority of the price / sqft seem to correlate with the building's age. In my local area (Oak Park) there seems to be a quite a few offerings on [loopnet.com](https://loopnet.com) on the lake st corridor. As far as access to public transit and the amenities, Evanston is only other chicagoland suburb that comes close. The downside is if you need to drive there, Harlem & 290 during most of the day (weekdays and weekends) is one big cluster\*\*\*k",t2_11hmtr,TixSwo,0,1647717710.0,0,t1_i1bd4gz,i1bd4gz,True,ConsciousAuthor7982,t3_thxtf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/thxtf1/where_to_open_an_office_in_west_southwest_chicago/,Where to open an office in west / southwest Chicago suburb?,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/thxtf1/where_to_open_an_office_in_west_southwest_chicago/i1bd4gz/,1,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,1

"I'm a young tech professional and live in the western suburbs. There are a few of us out in the Lombard/Elmhurst/Hinsdale/Oakbrook area and a few more up in the northern suburbs like Arlington Heights. 

To be totally frank, the biggest reason to move further west or south is to save money - and we're not underpaid. 

I think you will struggle to hire if you're outside the city, but if you have to a near suburb with access to the L and metra is the best bet. Oak Park is about as far out west as is worth going imho. The big businesses (McDonalds, John Deere) have moved back into the city, not out to the suburbs. Specifically to attract younger talent, especially in tech.

"Riverside just recently passed a rental registry, though it exempts single-home residences and owner-occupied two-flats. The main reason why it was enacted is that it's the only practical way non-home rule communities can deal with the problem of slumlords. And while it increases the cost of rental housing to some degree, one also has to keep in mind that it seeks to minimize the costs slumlords impose through neglect and nuisances on the community as a whole.

For example, we had tenants without heat for days the other winter, a resident that fell to his death off a rotten staircase, and violence involving drug deals that all arose from slumlord multi-tenant properties. The rental registry now allows Riverside to do inspections on a regular basis and deny rental permits due to neglect or unabated nuisances in a manner that generally isn't feasible without it.",t2_qcrd0,mr_yozhik,0,1647662353.0,0,t1_i18rn0c,i18rn0c,False,Boring-Scar1580,t3_thixv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/thixv8/north_riverside_trustees_approve_rental_registry/,North Riverside trustees approve rental registry,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/thixv8/north_riverside_trustees_approve_rental_registry/i18rn0c/,4,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,4

"from the article 
""The ordinance requires landlords to register their properties annually for a fee based on the number of dwelling units. The annual fee to register a building of between one and four units is $150, with buildings of five or more units being charged a $250 fee. When there’s a change in tenants for single-family rental homes, the village will charge a $25 registration change fee.

**All landlords are required to provide landlord/property management contact information in the event the village is notified of a complaint at a rental property.** Scarpiniti said the village also will compile tenant contact information annually from landlords.

North Riverside officials in particular want to get a firm hold on just how many single-family homes are being rented in the village. Last fall, Scarpiniti estimated that there were more than 100 such properties scattered around the village.

Landlords are required by the ordinance to allow a village inspector to assess the “health and safety” of rental buildings, including individual dwelling units upon village request.""
