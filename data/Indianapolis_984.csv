"Living downtown will motivate you to have options based on what’s under construction. And for the basics, staying downtown is worth the slightly higher prices, especially at these gas prices. After Target closed their Southern Plaza store (years ago now), I pretty much stopped shopping at Target. But the southport road one was good enough if there was no I65 road construction (so during one of those phases, I also stopped going there, lol). 
I think Avon is terrible from downtown because it always seems too far to loop around to 36 and 36 traffic is always bad (however, w the north split closed, that’s changed as it’s faster at times to hit 70E/465 to head northwest to avoid driving across downtown). Meijer is my go to big box and I go to one of 3-4 picking the one convenient for whatever else I’m going, visiting friends, family—ie Keystone if I’m in BRipple, Camby (20-25min). For housewares, like rugs, towels, the Meijer in Whitestown just off I65 is worth the trip and it’s a 25min cruise out of downtown. Apparently new subdivisions getting built all around it results in more inventory like that. It’s my favorite Meijer.

"This sucks, majorly, but I am not at all shocked.  I’m a huge advocate for recovery housing and have helped with opening a women’s recovery house in another donut county.  We got some push back from the neighbors, but we also had the support of the mayor and county council and commissioners.  I currently sit on the board for the Indiana Affiliation of Recovery Residences, and zoning and NIMBY have prevented countless numbers of sober living homes from opening.  

I’m not sure of the current stats, but as of about 5 years ago, we we only had about 1 recovery house bed per every 12 persons with SUD who needed it.  For women, there are even fewer beds.

Sometimes I wonder if the general public even understands what a recovery house is?  It’s not a correctional facility, nor is it a methadone clinic or even a detox hospital.  On some level, I guess I can understand the concerns, but at the same time a recovery house is a hugely important investment in a person’s early sobriety and their continuum of care.

[The funding for 2021 was $7 million](https://www.wrtv.com/news/local-news/indianapolis-receives-7-million-in-federal-funds-to-address-homelessness)

[The funding for 2020 was $7.2 million (see IN-503)](https://files.hudexchange.info/reports/published/CoC_AwardComp_State_IN_2020.pdf)

[The funding for 2019 was $5.5 million](https://www.hudexchange.info/sites/onecpd/assets/File/2018-indiana-coc-grants.pdf)

[The funding for 2018 was $5.2 million](https://www.hudexchange.info/sites/onecpd/assets/File/2017-indiana-coc-grants.pdf)  


Also, this is not the only source of money. As /u/carrotdadsupreme notes, there's also an additional [$14M in HOME-ARP funds](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/CPD/documents/HOME-ARP.pdf) but that isn't likely to be repeated.

Lastly, I'll note that according to the point-in-time count, there are about [2,000 homeless people on a typical day in Indianapolis.](https://policyinstitute.iu.edu/doc/pit-count-2020-brief.pdf)  So that gives you an idea of the scale of the issue and helps understand how much money this really is.",t2_4kvy,robbyslaughter,0,1648231311.0,0,t1_i23ec1w,i23ec1w,True,greenhousecrtv,t3_tn7rwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/tn7rwq/indianapolis_receiving_94_million_for/,Indianapolis receiving $9.4 million for homelessness efforts,/r/indianapolis/comments/tn7rwq/indianapolis_receiving_94_million_for/i23ec1w/,1,r/indianapolis,1,1

I also teach Capoeira at North Mass Boulder downtown which I would describe as semi gymnastics-adjacent - we work heavily on mobility, flexibility, bodyweight strength, handbalancing, flow, and light acrobatics (cartwheels, etc.).

"I would suggest the Carmel D League. Their leagues sell out frequently, but they have wait lists that help you get in the league quicker.

As for gear, it's near the end of the model year for most hockey manufacturers, so you'll start seeing gear getting marked down heavily as CCM/Bauer/etc are trying to move product so they can add a different color way to the same gear and charge you more for it. I would just Google to find the best online shops and look for deals. If you aren't sure on sizing, go to a Play-It-Again Sports and try on gear to get the sizing. You also might be able to find some really good, lightly used gear there.

"> it smells off and on like straight sewage in this place

You mean, inside the house? That's not normal. Is the odor coming from outdoors and you can smell it in the house? Or does the odor originate *in* the house?

If you smell it in the house and not outdoors, there's definitely something wrong with the house plumbing. Might be as simple as a clogged vent, or a dried-up trap.

Try this next time you smell it: pour a pint of water down every single drain in the house. If the house has a basement, make sure you put water down the floor drain(s) too --- use two pints.

If the smell doesn't dissipate within 30 minutes or so after doing that, call your landlord and tell him that if he doesn't call a plumber to fix whatever's wrong, you're going to call the county health department.

If the smell is coming from outdoors, call the health department anyway, because that means there's probably a broken sewer line nearby. Maybe a main, but more likely IMO to be a leaking lateral from a nearby house.",t2_vmto209,PingPongProfessor,0,1648209198.0,0,t1_i21yguh,i21yguh,True,AsterismRaptor,t3_tnf09i,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/tnf09i/sewer_smell_every_time_it_rains_old_southside/,Sewer smell every time it rains?

"We bought a house in Avon a few years ago. 

Most of what I’m reading in these comments is pretty accurate, especially the parts about it just being urban sprawl. 

I will say the traffic here isn’t any worse than anywhere else. It’s really not. People like to complain and say it is, but it’s the same as every other Indy suburb. 

We live about a mile from the CSX rail yard. We can hear it a lot, but like airplanes (which we also get a lot of here), you tune it out after a whole. It doesn’t add to car traffic because basically every road it intersects with here goes over or under the railroads.

"When I did a lot more traveling, I used to see the same folks over and over in different cities.  

For instance, the cowboy guy that played guitar...I'd see him in Nashville and once in Columbus.  Some of the guys that hold signs by the road...often times they were told by the folks 'running the tickets' for specific intersections where to go once they started to not make any money in the city (that was a biker gang run org that kept these folks on the hard stuff and took most of their money...remember that when giving money to folks asking on the side or middle of the road).  

If any of these folks ask for a ticket out, they WILL get one.

Sad part is, they usually have a circuit and will be back, but for a few months they are someone else's problem.  

And worse, MOST come from small towns that send them to Indy or Columbus or Nashville...and these small towns NEVER have to deal with the cost of these folks again.  

Other cities do this, our city does this, and it shifts the load elsewhere and never solves anything.  

The worst part of all of this is...if we build homes for these folks...other cities are just going to keep sending their people here.  So until we have state-level solutions and national solutions forced upon the states...the best we will ever do is put a bandage on it.

"Hi there, resident of Avon, the very east end of it off Raceway Road and County Rd 100N/10th St. It’s a huge difference in commute downtown between East Avon and west Avon. I work in Indy, the east edge of downtown near I-70, and my AM commute is 22 minutes.  The train yard noise doesn’t reach this area, my neighborhood is quiet and nice and we love Washington Twp Park. We are getting a new water park opening this summer (Plainfield had a great water park already. )
The selection of restaurants and stores here is large but very standard (not fit for foodies but super easy to have tons of options if you don’t feel like cooking). Not a big deal at all in my opinion because we just hop downtown all the time or to the surrounding areas to switch it up. Rockville Rd is bad for traffic, but you just adjust your timing and routes as needed. If you find a house that you like, I would not let the traffic or ‘lack of culture’ dissuade you. Another commentor said this is a bedroom community and I’m honestly quite ok with that. My kids can run across to the playground and go to each other’s houses in our neighborhood, we can bike the B&O trail from parking at IU West hospital, hang out and play at the creek at Washington Twp Park on summer Saturday afternoons, and the school system is solid with lots of diversity.

"LOLd. Yeah, it’s pretty...dope!  😂

Let’s put it to you this way...I have a friend who used to smoke 1/8 oz of weed *daily*. To smoke that much every day means you are a *HARDCORE* weed smoker. Doing the math shows it would take him 384 days to clear out three pounds of weed.  Next level smoking and it would still take him over a year. 

I’m a regular smoker and can knock out 1/8 in seven or eight days. Going by seven for easier math, that means it would take me 2,688 days to run out of three pounds (7.36 years).

"Are you looking at the subdivision just off Ronald Regan and 100s? If so I lived in there for 5 years. I didn't notice it except at night while in bed when they were coupling and decoupling the cars - at least that's what I assume the banging was. Our bed was right under a huge window facing the direction of the train yard. My husband wasn't bothered, I'm a light sleeper and it wasn't hard to get use to. Never noticed it any other time. It's a nice subdivision and is in a great location. HOA board is led by a bunch of jerks. We moved to find a bigger place more central to Indy as my husband works for a local staffing firm and wanted a shorter commute. Now we live near fountain Square and I love it. I do miss being so close to the big box stores, but that is offset by the other things we are closer to. I would have been content find a bigger place in Avon, but husband didn't want to deal with the longer drive. We don't like to go out much, so when we did it wasn't a bad drive into downtown.

We have lived in Avon for 16 years. Our kids have all grown up and moved away. It seems like a safe community but the traffic is bad. You have to plan ahead to get somewhere.  We live near Rockville rd. So we can hear the trains when it rains the brakes squeak. However after so many years its just background noise and we don't even notice it any longer. Everything you need you can find here or get it pretty fast from Amazon or chewy. If you are looking for the cute little town with a square...this is not it. It does seem that we lack a place to just walk around and meet new people. After the kids are grown it is hard to meet new friends.

"Before I hear all of the complaining about the lineup, I just heard IMS president Doug Boles on local radio talking about things. Here is the summation I posted on the IndyCar sub….

Doug Boles on local Indy radio about Carb Day just now. Sounds like you all should be upset with Live Nation more than IMS


“Doug Boles was just on with JMV and spoke at length about the Carb Day concert lineup. He was diplomatic as always, but went into detail about how difficult it was to get acts for this year’s Carb Day concert…they start planning this in Jan/Feb, when we were full on drowning in Omicron cases, so there is that. He also talked about how so many bands grouped up to tour together (not uncommon)…but that Live Nation doesn’t allow touring bands to play in a given market more than once in 100 days. Since a lot of big acts come to Indy (Noblesville is considered the Indy market, not to mention bands who come downtown) that forced them away from some bands they were considering. Doug tried to put a good spin on it but you could tell he wasn’t thrilled…kept saying “remember this is just part of Carb Day, it’s about having fun and having a good time, it’s still a great value for the day”….so I think that he and IMS were really limited this year by COVID, and Live Nation. Not defending anything but trying to provide some context that I heard….”",t2_bjm5zn3,cmgww,0,1648156146.0,0,t1_i1zcss4,i1zcss4,True,Tikkanen,t3_tn3zfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/tn3zfl/kings_of_chaos_rick_springfield_morris_day_and/,"Kings of Chaos, Rick Springfield, Morris Day and the Time headlining Carb Day",/r/indianapolis/comments/tn3zfl/kings_of_chaos_rick_springfield_morris_day_and/i1zcss4/,9,r/indianapolis,0,9

As someone that grew up in that area and still has a lot of family there I would really recommend you look at Plainfield or Brownsburg instead if you want to be on that side of town. Outside of schools Avon has few redeeming features and the traffic on 36 is absolutely horrible. 36 was incredibly poorly planned and they just keep continuing to do construction on it to try and improve it. I really don’t think it’s possible for Avon to build its way out of all of the problems it has created for itself. Happy to answer any other questions you may have.

">SCOTUS has made it clear that the mere presence of a smell isn't enough to search a car. 

IANAL, but I don't think that's quite true. In states where marijuana is legal, smell is typically not probable cause. But in a state like ours, if the officer can show he's been trained to recognize the smell, the courts will usually allow the subsequent search. Multiple appeals courts have equated smell with evidence in plain sight, which of course is enough for probable cause. 

That's for probable cause to search without a warrant. In this case, the cop had the statement from the boyfriend, along with the smell, as justification for a warrant. The judge issued the warrant, and only then did the search occur, according to the news accounts. I think without the report from the boyfriend, the smell alone wouldn't have been enough to pursue a warrant, given the DV aspect of the call. Whether a judge would grant a warrant in that hypothetical, I'm not sure.

"Hi there - I got Verizon 5G home Feb 2020.  I loved it for just about 2 years.  It was cheap, 10x faster than my xfinity internet that I had.  But their resolution to issues is terrible.  In December of 2021 I lost 5G signal and while it was around Christmas time and covid issues with workers being out, it took them 3 days to get me back up and running.  This was the first time I had lost service since signing up.  I did not want to go back to xfinity, so I figured they set me up with a newer modem/router and said I should not lose the signal again.  And boom, just about a week ago I lost the signal at 1:30pm on 3/16 and it was not my modem/router this time but an actual outage.  They said they were diagnosing the problem and it should be fixed in 12-14 hours.  Now that's a long time if you ask me especially since I work from home.  Calling customer service or tech support didn't help at all because they cannot give any update as to the situation.  They one tech support rep told me that if an outage occurs (like this one) that it could take up to 48 hours to resolve.  And he also told me that since I work from home I should look into a more reliable service.  Had I known that I would have never switched.  I can't be without internet for 48hours +.  So it went out 3/16 at 1:30 and I did not get service back until 3/18 sometime in the mid-morning.  So if you are good with the slow response and resolution if anything happens.  It's great.

Say they ignore it or try to sweep it under the rug, and the boyfriend is charged. You can bet it's going to come out eventually, and that makes it 100x worse for IMPD. 

I agree with the point you're making, and in most cases I don't think IMPD is looking to arrest DV victims on unrelated charges discovered on the DV call.

"Wow, what a visual. 80 feet of yet another cheap generic big box building that’ll look like every other cheap big box building going up in Broad Ripple and downtown. Woo hoo, Gershman is now officially a one company wrecking crew responsible for turning Broad Ripple into a grotesque parody of an historic village. 

They and Milhaus and all these developers propose these oversized buildings so they can justify putting their hands out for the most TIF possible and run it all through the pre-greased wheels of the city approval process. Lol literally the first [campaign donor listed on Vop Osili’s](https://imgur.com/a/tre2Ee4) 2021 campaign report is Eric Gershman. [Source](http://ofm.indy.gov/CampaignFinanceAPI/Document/Index?documentName=City-County+Council%5cOsili%2c+Vop_cncl-ccc_2022-01-19_CFA-4-ANN.pdf). They get their TIF $ and run the money and the project through a LLC registered under an agent with results in no accountability of how they’re spending any of it on the project or even if they spend it at all. The development gets built as cheaply as possible and gets splashy PR when it opens with sky high market rate rental prices. Then boom, the developer sells it within a year or two to an out of state REIT (see the [OG building in this scheme, The Coil](https://www.ibj.com/articles/71496-coil-apartments-in-broad-ripple-sold-for-more-than-40-million)) thus earning a nice fat profit for the developer. 

Notice also that none of these developments in BR will offer affordable housing units. Even developers who said they would set aside some affordable housing units during their projects’ approval process have not done so. During the [River House](https://www.riverhouseindy.com) approval process, developer [Todd Morris promised a number of affordable housing units would be included](https://imgur.com/a/hJ4E0rJ). Well shocker, from day 1 after completion to today, calls to the River House leasing office inquiring about any affordable housing units or a waiting list for one are met with “Riverhouse does not participate in an affordable housing program at this time.” Why would a developer even need to follow through on an affordable housing pledge? They and construction-related companies who donate millions to the campaign funds of city officials (Mayor Hogsett among them), know any accountability will conveniently fade away. 

Adding density in Broad Ripple could have been done in a [transparent way that would have](https://www.heritageinspiresyyc.org/economic-benefits/) preserved its historical value and still brought in a multitude of new residents and visitors. Leveraging its historical value and carefully planning and adding in higher density developments while prioritizing the integration of green space and the river would have drawn people to Broad Ripple for decades. Instead we have a race among developers to exploit as much of the transit oriented development districts’ government funded giveaways (why do you think they pushed the Red Line so hard for College instead of Keystone) as they can as fast as they can and to hell with any sort of sensible planning and design. The result being in a few short years we’ll be stuck with an unrecognizable Broad Ripple crammed full of zero lot line incongruous and cheaply built mega developments that attract few new residents and visitors. All with insane rental rates that price out the folks the Red Line was supposed to serve. Oh well!

Edit to add: Calling the [gross looking glass and concrete mega box](https://imgur.com/a/qJdLVKL) Gershman will slap up at 6400 Ferguson “timber built” does not make the final result any less a typical office building you can see off any 465 exit.

Avon is pretty varied in terms of living experience. I love where I live, but you couldn't get me to live south of 36.

I have access to 20 miles of downright decent bike trails and pretty soon I'll be able to get to Costco on a bike. Ronald Reagan gives me good access to 74 which gets me pretty much anywhere I need to go without much traffic.

"I grew up in Avon. You get used to the noise of the CSX, but it is something you can hear from miles away. I personally moved away and have no interest in moving back because it had changed so much from when I was a kid. Rockville Road is just chain restaurants and stores, so there really isn’t much to do outside of shopping and eating. The parks are nice, though. I favor Washington Township park over Avon Town Hall park. It depends on what you’re looking for. Brownsburg is changing a lot and has developed its downtown more. Plainfield has an outdoor mall and you can take US-40 downtown. Avon has better rated schools than the others, but it’s nothing drastic. I had friends at both other schools and they were educated just as well in my opinion.

"Avon is pretty much a bedroom community. It doesn't have a historic/fake Main Street or really its own downtown. Rockville/US-36 is lined with big box stores and chain restaurants, and is also the primary road in town. But its also a relatively affordable suburb, especially compared to the northern burbs.

There's two larger parks on the western end of town and I think a couple smaller parks spread out, but its nothing like the parks system of the northern burbs or Indianapolis. And the two other burbs nearby (Plainfield and Brownsburg) I'd argue have better shopping and dining options.

Outside of shopping at big box stores or eating at chain restaurants, you'll need to hit up Plainfield, Brownsburg, or Indianapolis for most activities.

Any CSX rail line in the metro area can be expected to be heavily used. It is part of living in a metro area and some people are used to it, and others don't ever get used to it.

This isn't even a case of aggressiveness, its just dogs have claws and teeth and can get very active with each other.
