"ya, there seems to be a whole lot of white and brown kids using that word like theyre the wu tang oxtura/cam clan. i dont see em hanging with any black friends if they got em. its like who says it the most in any conflict is somehow right. and once said its like magic how they can just ignore the misunderstanding that got the shit show started.  

and even if they actin like a toy, calling plays before they know the score, whoever calls someone a bitch is not only right but also wins. like the pigeon that will land on the chess board, take a shit, knock all the pieces off and declare a win.  its a favorite word of any fledgling narcissist to lob at someone they have wronged thats giving them a taste of their own medicine.  

my neighbors grandkid is like this. i have a small home studio and he heard about it and i recorded a couple verses of a song he was working on with a friend. both born and bred in camarillo. kids have never missed any meals, dont really have chores they have to do to pull their own weight. my neighbors kid is really good looking and has enough charisma to not be a dud im sure all the girls have a crush on him and he knows it, chip on his shoulder style. 

anyway, they can be nice well adjusted polite kids. neither one has ever gotten in any major trouble because they arent really hustlers, they just go to school and surf and hang out and family provides all they need. not tons of money  but rich with love and support. 

&#x200B;

they start their little raps and its just super misogynistic, violence normalizing, low effort lies about themselves as shot caller gangsters swimming in cash. the kid caught wind of what i thought of it a few days later and using the cover of some other traffic in my place, catches me sitting on my couch hanging out with a friend.  

so, with the support of a few of his minions next to him, he holds his phone out saying hes recording for all his tik tok followers, drops the n-word a few times, asks me if i still think he's not tallented. his raps have a generic trap flow to them and he kinda pulls it off, to his credit. so he thought he was setting me up with that lead off into a surprise we're live type sittuation. so, referring to a convo he mustve caught wind of..

so i said back to him. 'i didnt say you arent talented, what i said was your raps are a dime a dozen,' he kept on recording so..' you sound like everyone else, nothing special. you gotta find your own voice, thats my advice. what we recorded, you dont live like that, you guys are from camarillo.'

"Of the three most prevalent radioactive elements identified at the Santa Susana site, cesium-137 has the longest half-life at 30 years. It's been 62 years since the accident. Furthermore, the old Santa Susana Field Laboratory, sitting at 1694 to 2120 feet above sea level is at the headwaters to the Los Angeles River and most of the watersheds around the West LA and East Ventura County areas. The SSFL runoff feeds groundwater in an extensive area, including the the Malibu Creek Watershed Area, which extends from the SSFL all the way through Westlake Village and Agoura, and flows all the way to the ocean. 

So are you scared enough to never go to the beach at Zuma/Malibu? Fukushima gave the West Coast a lifetime supply of cesium-137 anyway, so for that matter, best avoid *all* the beaches in SoCal! 

And forget the San Fernando Valley, too. Bell Creek Runs from Santa Susana all through the Valley.

"Ventura usually has a lot of stuff going on downtown that is geared to 20-somethings it just kind of depends on what you're looking for.


Most of the people I know currently are through the craft beer community (or work) so that's the majority of the recommendations I have. There are quite a few trivia nights picking back up again at breweries around the area if that's something you're in to. Topa Topa Brewing usually has a lot of events throughout the week at their different locations and is starting a book club really soon. If you like plants, Seaward Brewery is having a plant swap on March 20th. Many of the breweries will host live music and maker's markets as well.


Non-brewery related: REI in Oxnard will have community classes and events geared toward outdoors-related activities. Not sure if they're back open yet, but the Oxnard Gem and Mineral Society has some cool hikes and classes. A lot of the community gardens, animal shelters, and food banks in the county love volunteers, but this may require an application to volunteer just FYI.

"There is somewhat a scene.  I am grateful for it.  It's small, but still awesome.

Starting with Ventura:

First note, Seth's Games and Anime is closing this month.  It was a good hub for DnD, Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh, but also Magic the Gathering.

Arsenal Comics has stores in Ventura, and Newbury Park, and they do Magic there (a lot of the people I would play Magic with regularly are playing at Arsenal these days).

You also have Endgame Comics downtown Ventura.  They also do Magic tournaments as well.

Going to Camarillo:

There is +EV Games.  They are a pretty serious Magic shop.  Competitive players, decent selection of available cards for sale.

Zander's just started doing Magic.  I do not know how it will all work, because they typically charge for space (like $5 per person for a whole day).


As far as the formats.  I don't see much Pioneer going on at all.
I am more of a Modern player.  Most players around are Commander, with some Standard going on.

I would recommend just finding the shop that fits your drive, and show up.  You will find like minded players for your formats and can build a coalition to get more players to play the tournaments you want to play.",t2_6n240,Chrispanic,0,1645214036.0,0,t1_hxhkbox,hxhkbox,True,eadenoth,t3_svoy9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/venturacounty/comments/svoy9t/gaminghobby_shops/,Gaming/hobby shops?,/r/venturacounty/comments/svoy9t/gaminghobby_shops/hxhkbox/,7,r/venturacounty,0,7

"**[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_position-indicating_radiobeacon)** 
 
 >An emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) is a type of emergency locator beacon, a portable, battery-powered radio transmitter used in emergencies to locate airplanes, vessels, and persons in distress and in need of immediate rescue. In the event of an emergency, such as a ship sinking or an airplane crash, the transmitter is activated and begins transmitting a continuous radio signal, which is used by search-and-rescue teams to quickly locate the emergency and render aid.

"I sincerly hope that your father is found.

For anyone who likes to hike or camp solo in places where there aren't a lot of people, I strongly suggest that you buy an EPIRB if you can afford one.  They transmit a radio frequency that can be picked up by satellites and will alert authorities to the fact that you are in distress, they typically have GPS receivers so they can broadcast your exact position.  They're not cheap, but life isn't cheap.  Buy one if you can afford it.  It's the same technology as aircraft use to alert people when they crash.

">not everyone can afford a Tesla

Um, the base [Tesla Model S](https://www.tesla.com/model3/design) is **cheaper** than the MSRP you mentioned! But the best part is that there are no Tesla dealers. You fill out a form, then go pickup your car (or sometimes they actually deliver it to you).  Last time I was at a dealer, it took them over 3 hours to ""do the paperwork"", which is apparently code for ""waste time while they try to up-sell you"".

Also, the UX of non-Tesla chargers looks horrible-- reminds me of going to the gas station.  Public Tesla chargers have no buttons.

"I did a lot of research of these moumtaim regions because I wanted to go mountain ⛰ but it was closed to the public despite it being public land.  I went to California data website and found out each of these plots are oil rigs and they are in fact public record . You can register for a plot for really small fee   if you fill out paperwork with the state for oil drilling.  Your equipment has to be inspected but I believe  can also be a DIY oil drill so long as it's certified to meet state and federal requirements.  The oil drills here are extremely deep requiring 5000ft+ of drilling and no normal person even using a 200hp engine to drill would reach that feet unless you combine a bunch of car engines or something.  They also use patented gel to inject in the ground after drilling which becomes hard like cement when the second solution is put in.

I believe there were stories of homeless people living in the mountains in places that weren't geld off and weren't paying property tax so the government deemed them treasonous so they injected the gel right into the chamber underground they were living in and killed them all . Nobody gets away without paying taxes. Just joking but the gel is actually patented / assigned by the U.S department of energy I you look up patent (doubt you can find it with the limited info I gave here plus I don't remember the patent no). Lots of imagination comes when thinking of the ventura mountains there's almost no drone footage of the place and no real photos besides satellite.  Ventura County doesn't sink as much as other places so it's possible they inject cement gel after drilling.  I don't know everything about the mountains,  it's all just speculation and skeptics, I would too spread misinformation if I was an oil company so the public doesn't know anyone can register a plot there . Thank you for asking such question I would really wish there was more apparent information on these places although it does show who owns the wells on the website And maybe that's all that is, a place with  0 accidents 0 deaths,  nothing crazy but who knows.

I was surprised how affordable it is compared to SoCal. Portland proper was a tad too urban for them so the settled in Beaverton and the breadwinner will commute to town. Salem was on their list too. And Corvallis. It’s really nice up there. My daughter-in-law’s sister is a bartender outside of Portland  and makes a fine living for her growing family. You’ll be all set when your studies are done!

"An hour from the beach puts you roughly in Ojai, which might be even more expensive than Ventura, or Thousand Oaks, which is more expensive than Ventura, or towards the San Fernando valley, which is probably a little more affordable but not by much. North of Ventura is Santa Barbara, where 10 years ago the rent was hitting 3k a month for 3 bedrooms and your neighbors are Oprah and british royalty. South of Ventura is Malibu and nose-bleed expensive. 

3 bedrooms is a \*tall\* ask. I agree you're looking at 3k or more per month for a 3 bedroom apartment. A house with like a yard and a garage is going to be north of that. 

To start to see prices fall you're looking at 2-3 hours inland from the beach and at that point you might as well start looking at the central valley, which while expensive is not nosebleed expensive yet.",t2_slkjx,Flatline2962,0,1644288771.0,0,t1_hw16gxb,hw16gxb,False,QuasarKay,t3_sn5siu,https://www.reddit.com/r/venturacounty/comments/sn5siu/relocating_a_large_family/,Relocating a large family,/r/venturacounty/comments/sn5siu/relocating_a_large_family/hw16gxb/,2,r/venturacounty,0,2

"Ventura Co. is pretty rough considering your limitations right now.  If you look into places like Paso Robles or Santa Maria, you might be able to find something that works.  Easy access to the ocean and a good combination of rural and small city.  We have friends that have a farm in Paso and their kids are all working in the service industry there (big vineyard area).  They are all getting by OK.  Once you have your RT degree, you could probably do pretty well for yourself in one of the local hospitals.

I can’t quote rent prices, but I know they are better than Ventura.  Once you get some experience under your belt, you could probably make your way down to Ventura County and work for Kaiser Permanente.  They are expanding gradually throughout the county and they are very good to work for (my wife works for them).
