I feel you my dude. I have been here since July of last year and if you're coming from a larger city the things your use to don't exist here. I'm not super outdoorsy so there is even less for me. I have been working on some personal projects to keep busy which i'm not ready to announce publicly but from. my experience if you want something your going to need to put in the time to start it yourself which for me has been both frustrating and extremely rewarding. I may have a parking lot in the very near future (within a month) that I would be willing to allow you to use if you or someone is interested in starting autocross however we would need to get appropriate insurance and permits that i don't have the capacity to take on at the moment. You will find there are people that are interested in doing a lot of new things but there seems to be a huge hesitation to allow outsiders in to do it. (some fear of losing what makes casper well casper) I hope more people start to bring new things but the city is a beautiful place to live regardless.,t2_4i7r3spt,Lamoneyman,0,1647722725.0,0,t1_i1bol4p,i1bol4p,True,Chaseocavo,t3_tfs1k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/casper/comments/tfs1k2/theres_nothing_to_do_in_casper/,There’s nothing to do in Casper.,/r/casper/comments/tfs1k2/theres_nothing_to_do_in_casper/i1bol4p/,2,r/casper,0,2

"Don't think there is such a thing, legally, in Wyoming. There are 'Service' animals, but not 'support' animals, as is used in the vernacular.
(IANAL and YMMV)

If it is, only way you can likely do such will be through a licensed physician/councilor. They'll likely have to prescribe it, then you'll need to go through other channels to get an approved/certified animal. Much like one would with a 'Service' animal. That one is legally defined (see link below)

If all you need is a 'cover letter', you can get those online. Even if ESA isn't legally defined or implemented in WY, there are places that will honor such a letter - even though they're not obligated to.

No moose or elk in Casper. You can see pronghorn and deer. There are some hiking trail on the mountain or down by the platte River. But it is winter so the mountain trials might be snow covered.

"The bridal trail at the base of the mountain will give you the most in terms of scenic beauty and physical challenge. The elevation gained is somewhere around 1300 feet In 1.5 miles, it’s a loop so it’s easy to navigate as well. You’ll see a frozen waterfall, gorgeous alpine winter scenes , maybe a few mule deer and ice climbers, there has been sightings of mountain lions but they’ll likely see you before you see them. You can also traverse the riparian zone along the river, there’s a very well laid out pathway, less elevation but equally beautiful in its own right. You may see mule deer, white tail deer,  coyotes and many water foul  along the route. Wyoming has a broad diversity of ecology but most people get focused trying to find snow capped peaks that one finds a little further north. If you have an app such as Strava, you can use the heat maps feature to find the most popular routes. Definitely hit up the bridal trail if you’d like scenery and a challenge, bring some cramp ons , you may need them.

"I moved to Casper from PA. While I have not witnessed racism outwardly taking place, I have heard a few stories of black couples being pulled over and ticketed for no reason. There can definitely be shit heads anywhere you go, but I think you will find that a majority of the people in Casper don't really care one way or another as long as you aren't hurting anyone. 

We are a highly conservative state. So, occasionally that can mean we are behind a bit in certain kinds of laws related to equality, but that seems to be special to the LGBTQ+ community. A point is weirdness for me coming from PA to WY was the difference in gun culture. I remember seeing someone open carry at a pizza hut buffet and wondering if was a cop, only to be told that most people open carry and there aren't many restrictions (at least compared to PA). But, there is less violence here than most places... So there is that.

 My oldest is in elementary school. His school seems to have a diverse group of students from various backgrounds with mixed race couples. He absolutely loves it there and was really proud that he was considered reliable in helping his Spanish speaking friends when they had trouble understanding directions.

"There are issues. 

I've had people say racist things to me here. (Probably because I look like a middle aged white karen, and they somehow thought those views were safe to express around me). For example, last year, a neighbor complained to me because the local news hired a ""colored"" anchor. 

That being said, I think most of the people here are just fine, especially the younger generations. And the old racists are unlikely to be so in front of your face.

I've noticed interracial couples out and about town. There aren't a whole lot of black Wyomingites. Thus it stands to reason that if you're a black Wyomingite, it's statistically likely you're going to date and marry a white person. I've also seen a few HUGE ranch families, where it appears a white couple adopted kids from places like Kenya by the bucketful.

I've had a *Black Lives Matter* decal on my pickup for awhile now, and it hasn't been keyed yet. (Knock on wood.) Once when my sister was using the truck, an elderly white man asked her to roll down the window, and told her he was happy to see someone in Casper publicly supporting black lives.

So there's that.

Truth be told, if you're going to have a problem with anything here, it's gonna be the winters. Relentless freezing cold hurricane force winds can be a bit much for some.

"Wife works on Medical floor at WMC and she enjoys it quite a bit and I know they certainly could use the help.

 Airport is on the far west side of town so around 20+ minutes to downtown Casper.

Uber is certainly available most of the day. Not terribly certain about during shift change hours though. 

Weather wise we have a chance at snow all 12 months of the year! April should be the end of Winter and it'll move into the more rainy part of the year. Mid 50's and 60's most of the time.

Like the other poster said North of I-25 is the less desirable side of town but Casper is a relatively quiet place to live. Most ""crime"" is drug related as Meth seems to be the desired driver here. Even then Casper is a pretty quiet place. 

Oilfield is still way down at the moment so finding a rental or ABNB shouldn't be too bad though if a property is for sale it only lasts about a day before being sold.

"Fellow nurse here (I work for a hospital back in WA, no affiliation with any facilities in Casper)- 

Should be nice by April- still some cooler mornings and still going to snow at least a couple more times. May and June at pretty great- not too hot or cold. Still a chance for snow, even into June (it has happened)! 

Typically you’ll want to avoid the areas north of I-25 but it’s also kind of an unfair characterization- the “nicer” homes won’t likely be there but, for the most part, people here are pretty nice. In fact, I lived in the Seattle area for seven-ish years before I moved back and it took a while to get over how suspiciously nice most people are here. Not like quaint southern town nice, but treat you like an actual human nice. 

Basically all your major consumer needs can be found on the two main drags in town:
east and mid Casper- 2nd street has Walmart, Albertsons, Walgreens, fast food, sit downs, etc. 
west Casper- CY avenue has the same. 

Honestly, depending on where you get a place and how close it is to WMC, nearly everything is walking distance. Or grab a bicycle! We do have some public transit but I’ve never used it so not sure on the schedule. I just checked Uber and there are two drivers for a Friday afternoon but YMMV.

I can’t comment on how it is to work at WMC but I encourage you to take the contract- Casper is a pretty ok town all things considered. And if you like outdoor stuff, we are literally at the foot of a mountain with a ton of outdoorsy opportunities. There’s really great running/walking trails in town and on the mountain. Fishing too if that’s your thing. If you do decide to take the contract, feel free to shoot me a DM- I’d be more than happy to help out a fellow nurse!

The airport is about 15-20 mins away from the hospital. Everything is pretty close here. I would stay away from the Northside. Its not terrible but definitely a more undesirable part of town.

"> Is Casper about to be a ghost town?

Lol. No. Casper is ""too big to fail"" by Wyoming's standards. Even if all of Casper's major economic sectors were to ""fail"", Casper won't ever turn into a ""ghost town"" simply because (1) it's centrally located in WY, (2) it's located in a valley with a river running through it and a mountain next door, and (3) it has a major interstate running right through it.

I'd think by now Casper has to have at least 60,000 people. That's far too big by Wyoming standards to be susceptible to a huge decrease in population due to one major economic sector failing.

"As one who moved from Dallas 2 years ago, I can't answer all of your questions but there are a few.

3: Unsure on RC cars, but there is a giant RC airplane club here.
 
4: You'll have 3-5 options depending on where you live. Most places will have Spectrum cable which is 100mb to start and I think you can get up to 500mb. Centurylink is here but it isn't very good, topping out at 40mb most places. There are a couple wireless providers that can provide pretty good speed, Visionary is the one I've used and it was great. Regarding tech purchases I bet you'll need to order in stuff you can't find at best buy or the few tiny computer stores in town. 

5: Himalayan Indian downtown, Thai Kitchen, Dasasumo (Sushi + Thai), sweet zoey (greek), plus there are a few good food trucks that have a nice ethnic variety. You won't have all the options of bigger cities but Casper does well for a city of 60k in the middle of Wyoming. 

Crime isn't a big problem here despite what people may say. It'll be hard to find a place with no crime. The east side of town is newer/nicer, but most places you won't find many problems. 

While you don't have Chipotle you do have another chain in qdoba with 2 locations here. It's not the same but hey, guac is free. 

I've lived in Seattle, East Idaho, Dallas, and here. It takes an adjustment knowing that not everything you need is in town and you may have to drive 3 hours to Ft. Collins for some things such as Costco, dining, clothes, etc but that's what life is in remote areas. 
Your grocery stores will be wal-mart, 2 albertsons (similar to Tom Thumb), and Ridleys (Idaho based chain), and Smiths (Kroger). 

I would recommend getting snow tires, or at least all-weather tires (between all-seasons and snow) for your cars. The main roads are well maintained but small streets and out of town roads can get a little hairy at times. It snows here, it gets cold here, but you won't have snow on the ground from Oct-April like some places. It comes and goes through the winter every couple weeks. Most storms drop up to 6 inches, rarely more.

"I would reply to all of your questions but some answered already so I'll answer the ones they more or less didn't. I work in IT and you have up to GB speeds so that shouldn't be a problem.

 The drive to Denver is about 5 -6 hours depending how much of a lead foot you have and what the weather is like. Wife and I drive there a bunch. We also fly out of Denver because it's much cheaper. 

There is a board gaming community (many) but I'm not part of it. I was invited but I'm so busy with other things I never joined up lol 

Quite a few shooting ranges to choose from

The big horns has some of the best camping / backpacking around in my opinion.

"Hello!

My wife and I are from New Orleans most recently. We are starting to love Casper now that we’ve almost been here a year. 

1. You can go on top of Casper Mountain to the archery range. There are also plenty of open spots to shoot rifle / whatever you like - I really like Wyoming Gun Company in Casper to shoot pistols and AR’s. 
2. I’ve not heard of any board game communities. There are honestly not a lot of niche communities like you would find in bigger areas - at least that I’m aware of. 
3. I think your husband would be in RC paradise here especially near Casper Mtn or any other areas. Not sure if there are any places specifically for RC but I feel like this whole area would be great for it. 
4. Internet speed is super quick. My wife works in IT remotely from home and we have more than enough internet strength. Best Buy has a surprising amount of tech stocked in house too. 
5. Ok, I’ve seen others say there are food options here.... but truly there isn’t a whole lot of options. We weren’t expecting it to be like New Orleans by any means, but there is essentially no variety - there are just a few really good places like Raccas, Fire Rock, Ludivicos - we pretty much eat at the same 6 restaurants all the time. They are great don’t get me wrong, but we have to go to Fort Collins / Denver area for foodie restaurants. 

We like being so close to incredible natural beauty, and it seems like Casper is growing every day in terms of things to do and places to eat. 

There are some great breweries and great people here - super down to earth. Pretty awesome place to raise young ones with the lakes and mountains so close.

"Definitely brace for the wind! But, you kind of ""get used to it""--meaning it drives you crazy but it just becomes ""normal"" after a while.

We have some great restaurants in town! 

I think the biggest adjustment will just be that we ARE a little more ""chill"" than bigger cities. We're not in a rush to get everywhere. We'll stop and chat and say hi to people . . . in the middle of the street, etc.

"Welcome to Wyoming! 

Culturally it is very different that California. I think people are nicer generally than the west coast. Shopping is limited- no Costco or Trader Joe’s but you can generally find the basics. 

My wife and I get around just fine with a All-weather tires and just front wheel drive on our cars. Casper seems to plow the streets pretty well. 

Try and get out for some day trips while you are here. There is so much beauty in the state to see.

"Driving in the snow is not bad at all assuming you have good tires. If you have a sedan a set of stud less snow tires will do wonders. Drive slower and leave more starting and stopping distances. You just need to pay a little more attention to the road than in summer. 

Wyoming winter is harsh for sure. Not the gentle snow fall, more like blowing sideways snow from the winds. However, good layers, coat and hat makes all the difference.

"My wife and I have lived in Kansas CIty, Cincinnati, New Orleans, and Houston before moving to Casper. We really like it here. 

Our one complaint is the lack of diverse food options. You can pretty much get a great steak or burger. 

Other than that, we love the outdoor culture in Wyoming and Casper specifically. It’s “small town” feel, but still has all of the good stuff like Target, Walmart’s, etc. 

The downtown is really fun with bars, food and shopping. When COVID isn’t destroying our vibes, there’s generally a ton of events and fun things to do there. 

Also: zero traffic. Some people here would consider a 15 minute drive across town “traffic”.... no. There is no traffic here.

"I lived in Casper for a few years, but recently moved away. It's hard to meet people in Casper in my opinion. I think it depends a lot on where you end up working. I worked at Michaels and made a few good friends there. It was a layed back atmosphere for a part time job. I also met people by going to events downtown or going to a show at the Gaslight Social. You could also try posting on Casper Classifieds on Facebook, but I will warn you that there are some toxic people on there that might respond to your post in a negative manner. 
Also, as a side note, I'm not sure if you're going to be living in the dorms or not, but the Preserve at Greenway Park are decent apartments. They are a little on the pricey side though.

I pay for the upgraded plan through spectrum and get on average 375-450 Mbps down and 20-30 Mbps up.

"Over the past 20 years I've tried all of 'em here. By far and away the best service is from Mountain West - with a caveat.

They're a wireless provider - use a WiFi like, that's not WiFi, system to connect your house with their towers. So, that means you have to be in line of sight with one of their towers. They'll come by and do a site survey before you get hooked up. They will NOT attempt to provision you if they can't meet their minimums.  IOW - they won't blow sunshine and try to sell you on something that won't work.

Good news is, they're adding towers all the time.

These are guys that live here in Casper - they are locals. You call, they show up. You got an issue, you're talking to a local number and they fix it. Word of mouth is a big deal and they work hard to keep their reputation up. You're as likely to see 'em at the local eatery having lunch as anyone else you'd know.",t2_4agkg,Wapiti-eater,0,1585933187.0,0,t1_fmbu0i3,fmbu0i3,True,406john,t3_fu2csh,https://www.reddit.com/r/casper/comments/fu2csh/hows_the_internet_speeds_in_casper/,How's the internet speeds in Casper?,/r/casper/comments/fu2csh/hows_the_internet_speeds_in_casper/fmbu0i3/,3,r/casper,0,3
