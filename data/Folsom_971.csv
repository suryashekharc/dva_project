"Assuming you meant 50. I think those houses are going to crowd Folsom a lot more than city planners think. The houses are new and shiny but from what I have seen of the plans, they will be glorified condos with communal amenities. It’s fine if that’s what you’re going for, but my assumption is that Bay Area folks are moving up here for the good life, and those houses are just bringing what sucks about the Bay Area up here. El Dorado County won’t let that happen like Sac County does, and your investment in a home and community is likely much safer.

Pro Tip: You may want to consider the fog line. If you want to have way more sunny days a year, be at the top of EDH. Upper Serrano, by Bass Lake Rd. Even lower Serrano gives you more sunny days.

"From the article: 

“Davis-based University of Beer, which is known for offering a wide assortment of craft beers on tap, is planning to open its sixth location later this year.

The family-owned company's next restaurant and bar is planned for 1009 E. Bidwell St. in Folsom, formerly occupied by an IHOP.

University of Beer currently has locations in Davis, Sacramento, Vacaville, Rocklin and Roseville.

Founder and owner Nate Yungvanitsait said the Folsom location is approximately 4,000 square feet and will allow for both indoor and outdoor restaurant seating. The bar area will also feature 40 beer taps.

The location was selected because University of Beer doesn't currently have a presence in the Folsom market, Yungvanitsait said. He said he likes to select locations that are within quick driving distance from his Davis residence in case he needs to be there to help.

The Folsom location is expected to employ about 50 people, he said.

Yungvanitsait said he is currently going through the process of obtaining the necessary approvals to begin renovations of the facility. He hopes to open in the second half of the year, he said.

University of Beer opened its first location in 2012 in Davis. The company describes itself as a ""beer lover's paradise"" with rotating taps that showcase a wide variety of craft beer styles from small and independent breweries.

Its restaurants menu features burgers, sandwiches, wraps, salads and signature dishes like beer-battered fish and chips and mango habanero fish tacos, as well as starters such as sliders, macaroni and cheese, and ahi poke.”",t2_6xf7u,95musiclover,0,1644270993.0,0,t1_hw00two,hw00two,True,95musiclover,t3_sn26jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/folsom/comments/sn26jk/university_of_beer_expanding_to_folsom_later_this/,University of Beer expanding to Folsom later this year,/r/folsom/comments/sn26jk/university_of_beer_expanding_to_folsom_later_this/hw00two/,2,r/folsom,0,2

But the Midwest, the south, and even the Chicago area, including surrounding states like Michigan, are probably the least common people in this state. Idk if Idaho or Montana folk are similar to who you're looking for, but there's likely more of them than Michigan people.

"In this video, I help an extremely nice lady named Julie, who was out enjoying the day with her 3 kids at Folsom Lake when unfortunately, the battery on the RC boat they were using lost power in the middle of the lake. They had a drone with them and a couple other items and decided to MacGyver up a rescue drone. They attached a leash, with a mask and rock on the end, and attempted to snag the boat and drag it back to shore. They eventually managed to snag it and start towing the small vessel back to shore but because of the extra power being used to tow the boat, the battery on the drone also died and it plunged to the bottom of the lake, dragging the boat down with it. Julie wasted no time in contacting me on Facebook and we came up with a plan to go try to find her lost valuables. When we got out there, the water level was extremely low so there was a bit of a walk with all the gear just to get down to the water but luckily Julie and her kids helped carry the boat and we managed to make it work! To my relief, the drone had taken a coordinate right before it went down, so Natasha was able to easily navigate us to the point using her phone. One I dropped down to the bottom I set up my search grid and began looking. I didn't even make it one full rotation around my focal point before I ended up not only finding both the drone and the boat, but even one of the pieces that went on top of the RC aircraft carrier!",t2_n93yuyw,Merman_Mike,0,1643594787.0,0,t1_huxskyu,huxskyu,True,Merman_Mike,t3_sgpe5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/folsom/comments/sgpe5d/i_found_returned_an_rc_boat_drone_while_diving_in/,I found & returned an RC boat & drone while diving in Folsom Lake!,/r/folsom/comments/sgpe5d/i_found_returned_an_rc_boat_drone_while_diving_in/huxskyu/,4,r/folsom,0,4

"> I was married with a 6 month old daughter- I went into the military 

So, you bailed on your wife and infant daughter and took your GI bill to get yourself an education. Given the skeezy comments you're making in porn and relationship subs, your abandoning of your young family rather than supporting them _in person_ when they were at their most vulnerable, and the transphobia you've displayed in other comments, I think nobody needs your opinion on how the current generation is surviving.

Any success you think you've set yourself up for was and _is still_ being paid for in part by the wife and daughter you abandoned, and you should never forget that. You should feel shame for that.

If you don’t live in Folsom that means you have to commute which is an added expense via a vehicle plus gas, insurance, etc. If you do live in Folsom, $2,200 rent per month means you need to make roughly $20 an hour just to survive in a town like Folsom.

"I’d go Folsom, Rocklin, Roseville, based on your criteria. All are growing. Folsom will probably make you feel more at home if you like the Bay Area feel. That’s what we actually refer to it as since they’ve really built it up. If you’re commuting west, traffic will be annoying, but manageable. During off hours around town it’s really easy to get around still. Weekends and rush hour it’s a little congested, but not horrible. The same can be said for Rocklin and Roseville. Rocklin has always had a very tight community. From the time I lived there, ‘73-83, until now, they really have held that bond. Rocklin and Roseville are both in the southern half of Placer County. You’ll find politically they are on the more red end of the spectrum, Roseville going a little more purple. While Folsom is trending purple with the influx of Bay Area transplants, and is in Sacramento county, just on the cusp of El Dorado county on the east side. As far as neighborhoods, in Folsom, if you are going to do Briggs Ranch make sure you check the build date, and builder of the house. There are houses located there that were involved in class action suits due to faulty waste lines (plumbing) installed. The abs pipe was manufactured wrong and was disintegrating in sections. Also, near Folsom high school there are houses that had issues with copper pipes pitting and leaking due to an issue with the water treatment. My father lives in one of the neighborhoods and has had two neighbors with slab leaks.

"My comment over there:

Definitely keep the pressure on and follow up on it, but I'm 99% sure that this is a glitch in their website.

My bill ended December 17th, and in the estimate, it's showing $4.50/therm for the days in Dec in tier 1, just like everyone else.

However, in my bill, it has the tier 1 in Nov at $2.01237 per day, and tier 1 in Dec at $2.02574 per day. So the estimate, is showing the higher rate, but the bill is showing the lower.

In addition to this, the ""estimate"" on that bill is screwed up ANYWAYS, since it's showing the tier 2 at the end of the bill (instead of per-month, where I have a small bit of tier 2 in November and none in December, where the estimate is showing the opposite).

"It is high traffic on game and event days for sure! Also some areas get blocked off due to that so as far as commuting, you may get turned around ore rerouted going home. In that immediate vicinity there isn’t a huge amount of crime because there are security guards and some traffic cops when it comes to events, however, K street which is just on the other side, can get rowdy. Lots of drunk people and noise. If you’re looking for peace and quiet, it’s definitely not that. Search KCRA news and type in downtown Sacramento. There have been a few recent incidences with shootings and homeless. I’d say while the area is vibrant and very exciting, keep aware of your surroundings. They are actively working to restore peace daily but it is a hotspot for demonstrations (anti vaccine and Black Lives Matter) and nightlife shenanigans (drunks, and some destructions such as looting).",t2_4nm3eozb,spaceangel7,0,1640194842.0,0,t1_hpkwiqk,hpkwiqk,False,[deleted],t3_r9rixf,https://www.reddit.com/r/folsom/comments/r9rixf/things_to_do_in_your_20s/,Things to do in your 20s?,/r/folsom/comments/r9rixf/things_to_do_in_your_20s/hpkwiqk/,1,r/folsom,0,1
"They have underground secure parking! But no parking for guest… so that will prob be a challenge. Most ppl aren’t gonna want to pay $30 to come over or park several blocks away lol so may have to be the one to pick up friends and stuff. 

I heard there’s a concerning lack of good quality grocery shopping on the grid. Luckily I don’t mind driving tho, I’m use to driving 10min or so to get to a Walmart or supermarket. 

I guess my concerns would be the crime level and what not in that area since it’s a high traffic one. Is crime more prevalent in areas like that or would you say the fact that it’s always got something going on, would make it less of a target for criminals since it’s well lit and near main attractions and not some apartment in a sketchy alleyway? I also may be overplaying it… it may just only be super crowded and packed on game days or whenever there’s a concert in town.

"I think you would love it there. Great location and if you’re looking for a good nightlife, it’s right outside your door. Ask about parking though because parking in that area isn’t always available and it can get a bit sketch at night. Great choice, so many cool things right outside. Another option is to look in West Sacramento. Either way it’s a short commute to everywhere since it’s pretty centrally located.

"I'll suggest some totally different options:

fusion taps - best tai or Cambodian in the area, they will not make it legit thai hot unless you talk them into it or pay in advance, but they will do it.

most of the indian places are pretty legit, some are better than anything outside of the bay area - the Intel location (edited)  is in town and that is great.

Best mexican is La Fiesta, nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be.

I like sutter street for atmosphere but maybe less for food. Sammy horn is the best option there for beer selection - and while they have a thin menu most of it is well-executed, Fat Rabbit is a great place to hang out for a drink, but it is english food, so expect english food quality (the have some good poutine options, if you think canadian food beats english).

"Ahh yeah certainly.  Waterstone on Gopher Ridge Drive.  Roughly 3400 sqft.

Interestingly prices have changed sometimes significantly as time has passed.  My brother was in the buying process maybe a little less than a year after me and certain items were more expensive for him than for me.  I'm guessing it reflects market conditions and if they can get certain items on time.

Biggest costs will be floors generally.  I wanna say i paid 15k give or take for LVP on the first floor only.  The fancy tile that looks like wood would have cost 30k+.  Overall, I'd say low value items are kitchen upgrades (eg cabinet hardware, soft close).  Just choosing grey cabinets cost me an extra 5k.  Other things not worth were window treatments for the house--shutters cost in 20k+ if I remember? Cheaper to get it done with a local Business, but obviously you can't finance that into the mortgage.

"You have to ask yourself what you’re into and then find a place that supports that. I’ve lived all throughout this region and know as a person in their young 20’s, you’d love mid town and downtown Sacramento. However, this is before Covid as the pandemic has slowed economic development, enforced the appointment only lifestyle, and changed working hours for many businesses and some businesses have gone under. It can also be a bit sketch out there so I would caution you if you aren’t in a larger group. Land park can be nice visually but fairly quiet unless you’re into the more hipster scene. Sacramento proper has its draw backs, check crime maps to see any ongoing issues. Folsom is a great place to come home to. Yes there are a lot of families but there is plenty for single people to do as well if you have social media and are willing to put yourself out there. The people are friendly, the streets are pristine, and the businesses are aplenty. Folsom is a drive for most Sacramento people so also keep that in mind that if you meet someone, they may moan and groan about how Folsom is “soooo far”, it’s really not but it’s a general consensus and that’s fine because that’s what keeps the charm about Folsom.

Elk Grove might be cheaper but houses there seem to be selling way over listing and most to cash offers.

I used to live in Rancho as well, seemed soulless (15 yrs ago) Would never live there again but it might work for you.

"We moved here in May and absolutely love it.  I lived in LA for 20 years prior to this, but grew up one town over from Folsom.  I hit the trails nearly every morning and go to a lot of the parks with the kids and it doesn't feel congested at all.  Traffic wise, you can pretty much get anywhere in town in 10 minutes and I can make it to midtown in non rush hour traffic in about 25 min..  No opinion on the schools yet, as my kids aren't of age, but I hear good things and from what I have observed, kids here seem pretty nice to one another.   
 Politically, it definitely is a bit more on the conservative side, but everyone is friendly and respectful towards one another which is more important to me than one's political views.   Also, it is surprisingly diverse, more so than any other place in/ around the foothills that I have seen.

"Folsom imo is a mixed bag. My wife and I have lived here for a few years and the area is beautiful but some of the culture is not that great. There is a very conservative vibe here and seeing a ""fuck Joe Biden"" is not rare. Many businesses and people refuse to wear masks and quite a few were having mask less house parties throughout the pandemic. We haven't had any break ins into our cars but a few that I have seen on next door have. My kids don't go to Folsom high but they do go to a nearby school and they like it. They don't have any issues with bullies. They also have friends their age that live in Folsom and do go to Folsom high. The trails for running are pretty nice, my wife runs recreationally but you should avoid them late at night or in the early morning as there are homeless encampments along the river and the trails can be unsafe for people that are alone. Once when my wife was running she was alerted to a nude homeless man coming up from the river by another person on the trail. I second what others have said about the snow but there are a number of really nice places to camp around here less than two hours away whether you like car camping or backpacking. The folsom lake beaches can get very crowded in the summer but there are other places where you can cool off if you know where to find them. Old town can get a little busy on some nights but it can also be a fun place to go out.

"Best thing about Folsom: it's a well organized and safe suburb with plenty of stores and activity opportunities. Can do a lot there without ever leaving the city limits.

"I've lived in Folsom for around 13 years now. 

-Usually it takes around an hours to get to some good snow. It will be difficult to find snow nearby, even if you go 30 minutes up highway 50. 

-Personally, i do not really think Folsom is congested. Generally the main roads seem crowded, but parks and public areas are usually open and less crowded.

- I did first grade to high school in Folsom and in my personal opinion, the schools are amazing, especially the high schools. The schools have great resources and teachers, and there def is a lot of support for students. Personally, i have heard about bullying but it is not as common as you would think it is. I was not an athlete and more academic oriented, doing engineering and taking AP classes. Even still i was able to maintain good relationships with everyone and was never looked down upon in middle and high school. As long as you respect others and can communicate with them effectively, they will reciprocate the respect independent of your background. Even still, there is a huge diversity in the achools because of large student populations, so your kids can easily find friend groups and connections.

-Politically more conservative, but the liberal to conservative ratio is closer to 1:1. People will respect your opinions and will not force their beliefs onto you or your family. 

-Best thing: climate and quiet in the suburbs.

"Definitely more than 30 minutes for actual snow, unless it’s a light dusting . Just under an hour is more realistic.

Yes, in the past ~4 years folsom has definitely felt more congested. Not at parks so much though. During the summer some parts of the lake feel congested. City as a whole though? Pretty congested. The main thoroughfares are always busy these days, traffic can get pretty bad. This wasn’t an issue a few years ago, so I expect it’ll get worse as more people move here.

Schools are like they are in any other nice suburb, all types of kids attend. Yes, athletes are the popular kids.

Republicans are a definite majority in Folsom, and there are some very loud types out here ever since trump was elected in 2016. Majority of people aren’t outwardly political though. Local politics are mostly a joke, the city’s politics are controlled by property developers.

"I think Folsom is great. I've been in Folsom for 20 years.

Schools are awesome. I find school culture to be accepting, and tolerant. Of course any idiot can ruin things in a single situation, but there is no ""culture"" of bullying.

30-40 minutes for snow play. An hour and a half for the first resorts, and 2-3 hours driving for other resorts.

It doesn't feel congested IMO. Folsom did a better than average job of balancing development with parks and open space. There are miles and miles of multi-use trails in the City of Folsom. Auburn SRA can get congested, but frankly there are better options for hiking, running trails, biking etc. Spend some time on trail websites, and you will take years to explore everything that is within an hour and a half of Folsom.

The political vibe leans a tad conservative, but most people are really nice, and let people be themselves. I don't like putting people in boxes politically. I think you find most people very tolerant on social issues, and more conservative on fiscal issues.  
Best thing about Folsom, is recreation and outdoor opportunities, along with high quality public education. There is a good food, drink vibe with historic Folsom, which is where I live.

Worst thing: It's expensive.

"We moved out here almost 3 years ago and our toddler isn’t in school yet but the schools was one reason it was appealing. I’m not sure about 30 minutes up 50 for snow play, but possibly once it hits Pollack Pines area. Sierra-at-Tahoe is about an hour 20 away though and is the closest actual resort. I do a ton of hiking off 50 and 80, I’d say you can find trails pretty easily within an hour or so. 

I don’t think it’s congested yet, but they’re building a shit ton of new construction pretty much anywhere they can. I imagine in the next 2-3 years, it’s going to get worse unfortunately. Auburn SRA is packed on weekends. You’ll have to get there early for trailhead parking. I went there a lot during winter due to the snow in the mountains. Don’t spend a ton of time at Folsom lake to be honest but in the summer, it’s a bit of a shit show but there’s so many access points I think it’s not that bad. Some areas are pretty packed though for sure.

I haven't lived there but I know people who have. Not sure exactly the details but there is low income rentals available  there. Relatively new small complex that has pool and sits directly on the bike trail system and green belt. So you get nice access there and the river or Lake Natoma is maybe mile away on the bike trails.  Has shopping all with in close distance. I've seen police there plenty but I don't think that reflects on most of the tenants. There is a homeless population that moves thru the area probably due to the greenbelt and bike trail but not to bad.

A rich engineer, barely code'n in the dark,

And then one day he an idea strucks,

And people seemed to trust him, what dumb fucks.

Data that is, black gold, To the Va-alley!

Well the first thing you know ol Zuck's a Billionaire,

The VCs said ""Zuck move away from there""

Said ""Cali fer sure is the place you ought to be""

So they uploaded data to Sil-i-cone Va-alley

Alto, that is. Server pools, all rockstars.

---

The Valley Data-Thieves!

Well now it's time to say good bye to Zuck and his fucks.

And they would like to thank you for not noticin' he sucks.

You're all invited back next week to this locality

To have a heapin helpin of crap security

Thieves that is. Set a spell, shoot some selfies off.

"I'd been a long-time PacBell/AT&T customer.  When I had ADSL, it was rock-solid ... I seriously can't recall any outages lasting more than a few minutes, and they were super rare in the few years I was on that service.  

When U-Verse ""fiber"" became available, I made the switch.   Initially it was good, and customer service was good since it had dedicated support staff.  Over time, it became very unreliable and never lived up to advertised speeds... it'd be fast for a few hours, then get horribly slow for a few hours.   I tried many times to get some support regarding speeds, but they'd always do down-the-wire testing and claim it all looks good.  

I switched to Xfinity about two years ago and speed has been great, price is better, but the outages are very frustrating...  especially when we rely on the service for working remotely.  

I'd rather have some occasional slowness than total outages like we've seen with Xfinity, but I'm not at all eager to switch back to AT&T.",t2_3vcyt,dlregis,0,1628178800.0,0,t1_h7tkc1f,h7tkc1f,True,killjoy9411,t3_oyb9t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/folsom/comments/oyb9t4/xfinity_outage_yet_again/,Xfinity outage yet again,/r/folsom/comments/oyb9t4/xfinity_outage_yet_again/h7tkc1f/,2,r/folsom,0,2
"Idk what happened this year with Xfinity, they've had like 4 major outages in the last 6 months. Almost one a month, after a few years of basically no issues. In fact over the last 20 years, in 3 different cities, 2 different states, I've never had issues with Xfinity like this before. Also this time around it affected all of Sacramento valley when I looked up the down detector sites. People were reporting from all over the area. 

Idk what the infrastructure they're using looks like out here, but it really feels like there's a choke point that for some reason this year has been breaking. Because each time it's gone out like this, most of the valley is also affected. It hasn't been isolated to just Folsom yet, it's always the whole valley this year. As if there's just one node or cable that the entire valley relies on. Which is hard to believe, I always assumed theres got to be at least a few cables to reroute traffic through. 

I just wish some news outlet or Xfinity themselves would follow up as to what specifically was the cause each time. Only one of the outages was an accident from a truck hitting the fiber optic cable. The other 3+ were just for no reason apparently.",t2_10enhs,-Infinite92-,0,1628177306.0,0,t1_h7tgsbz,h7tgsbz,True,killjoy9411,t3_oyb9t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/folsom/comments/oyb9t4/xfinity_outage_yet_again/,Xfinity outage yet again,/r/folsom/comments/oyb9t4/xfinity_outage_yet_again/h7tgsbz/,3,r/folsom,0,3

"I grew up in Folsom, but lived in San Diego for nearly a decade before moving back here in 2016. The weather is the big change, obviously. The Delta Breeze is great when it's here to cool off the area, and reminds me a bit of the San Diego breezes coming in off the ocean. The other thing to notice is traffic. We only have a few freeways, and generally they are not as jammed as SD freeways. You will likely be driving surface streets a lot more. Housing is not as crammed, and neighborhoods in Folsom are suburbia, so you won't find a neighborhood bar a few blocks away, like you might in SD. Along those same lines, you've got to drive everywhere. However, one thing I love about Folsom are the bike trails that run throughout the city. They are like the trails along the beaches in SD, but your scenery are trees, brush, creeks, and the backside of homes. Still nice, though. The thing I miss most is not being close to the ocean. The river and Folsom Lake are nice, but just not the same. 

Anyway, if you come up, you'll adapt to living here.

"you will lose the seaside but it's warmer, no wind and you have a great American River so you will still see water all the time :) There is Folsom lake too but I heard its a bit low in water this year :) 

San Diego is a tourist city I would say Folsom is more on a quiet side which I personally enjoy a lot (I used to live in Santa Monica and it was a nightmare to get to the pier). You will see more locals, that you can actually bond with rather than ""random"".  We have a great historic downtown too and it has a great vibe. It's kinda like a hidden gem and let it stay this way :)

I think you will have more options to travel for a weekend. You will be probably going to Tahoe I believe it's 1h drive or so, or Reno. You can also visit San Francisco if you like its \~ 1.5h drive.

You will have a pool, you need to have a pool here. I don't think in San Diego it would be a must.

I am guessing  but there should be less crime here in Folsom too. You can check it online same for the weather (weatherspark I believe).

"We bought a Lennar in Rancho for off of White Rock and have been happy with the workmanship. We are coming up to our year review and have had minimal reasons to use the home warranty. There are some small drywall cracks that we have noticed, which we will request to have fixed under the warranty, but during our walkthrough, we found out these cracks are very common as the house settles.

We picked Lennar because of their 'everything included' and didn't feel the need for a lot of customization. 

Talked to our neighbors to see if they had any issues, and mostly all had positive things to say. One neighbor had a roof tiling issue that affected his gutters, but due to the one year warranty, it was fixed.",t2_19d780ww,stephk90,0,1623777552.0,0,t1_h1vb8mx,h1vb8mx,True,Dr_O,t3_o09wsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/folsom/comments/o09wsz/new_home_company_opinionsreviews/,New home company opinions/reviews,/r/folsom/comments/o09wsz/new_home_company_opinionsreviews/h1vb8mx/,4,r/folsom,0,4
"When buying a new construction home, my advice would be to understand what you're buying.

Homes built are with constraints of the construction timeline, workmanship of the sub contractors, the level of supervision of the work being done, builder grade materials/finishes.  You can't expect immaculate work or a superb product.  Doesn't mean the home cant be enjoyed or lived in comfortably though. 

I purchased with Tripointe.  Overall, I think it was worth it. Bishop, the construction manager has been the highlight of the experience.  I can only compare to Lennar and Richmond American in Elk Grove, but I do feel the workmanship with Tripointe is better.  Generally though, builders will make fixes to whatever you point out within 30 days of close. 

Be proactive and persistent with new home builds no matter who you go with though.  If you see an issue during the construction or something you don't understand, ask the builder about it.  

The preferred lender may be worthwhile, but I would still look for other lenders as well.  I found out a few weeks before close that I needed more money.  I didn't need to pay more, but the underwriter wanted to see more liquid cash to reduce their risk.  Also found out they had reserve requirements that had to be met as well. Luckily I was able to piece things together, but the preferred lender process was not communicative to say the least.  It was incumbent upon us to make sure deadlines were met--otherwise it would have been even more of a scramble. The buying process would have been much easier if we had just stuck with an easier to access lender/loan officer.  Your  experience may vary though with other builders though. Additionally, our experience may have been worse considering our original loan officer took and unexpected leave.  Bottom line, the process would have much less of a headache if we knew all the conditions of underwriting well in advance - - no excuse when you're waiting 8 months for the house to be built. 

Despite how much of a pain the buying process was, I'm still very pleased with our home.  It was worth it at the end of the day.  I still have some things I need fixed or inspected in the house, just compiling a list before I submit it.",t2_87g89,KingCilantro,0,1623777165.0,0,t1_h1vaarx,h1vaarx,True,Dr_O,t3_o09wsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/folsom/comments/o09wsz/new_home_company_opinionsreviews/,New home company opinions/reviews,/r/folsom/comments/o09wsz/new_home_company_opinionsreviews/h1vaarx/,4,r/folsom,0,4
