"I love Nina Nell, she's out of Coldwell Banker in Blue Bell. We used her to buy our first house, sell it years later and buy our current house. She's very knowledgeable and will tell it to you straight about a property. We tried not to contact her at weird hours, but had to once or twice in those transactions and she was always easily reachable. I work in title insurance and have come across A LOT of realtors, and would honestly only trust a handful. She's at the top of my list.

"Hey there, we're just getting our Reddit presence up and going, and saw your post. If you've ever been interested in something that combines skills from both soccer and volleyball (plus a little basketball and football) you could come check out a Philly Hawks practice and see if Aussie Rules is for you!

We're Philly's representative club in the USAFL, and we are looking for new members interested in learning the game! We work with all skill and fitness levels - we're not just looking to grow the team, but to expand the knowledge of the sport as a whole. We have a bunch of training and Social Footy events to start the season that are great non-committed opportunities to learn about the game, meet new people, or simply get some great exercise without slaving away on the treadmill. 

We have Saturday practices at 11 AM coming up this week (March 5th) and in 2 weeks (March 19th), then on March 30th we start having both Wednesday (6 PM) and Saturday (11 AM) sessions. We practice at Edgely Field in Fairmount Park as well as at West Memorial Hall Field, in front of the Please Touch Museum - best bet is to follow us on socials at @ PhillyHawks (remove the space) on all the platforms for last minute updates. 

Hope you come check us out - any questions, let us know!",t2_dunpjzxe,PhilaHawksOfficial,0,1646140433.0,0,t1_hywor1e,hywor1e,True,Nickalicious420,t3_sjmzrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/montco/comments/sjmzrd/spring_rec_sports_in_the_area_lansdale/,Spring rec sports in the area?

"No prob :-)

My cat came from a hoarding situation and is absolutely terrified of everyone all the time. It took him like 8 months to even come out from under my bed.

My vet prescribed him gabapentin, and we gave it to him about 45 mins before his appointment. He was *in love* with the groomer. Drooling and purring and rolling around. We tried it the next year when I decided to shave him on my own and omg, he was like a stuffed animal, he was so compliant.

If you're comfortable giving your cat a downer for the amount of time it takes to get him groomed, then I'd say go for it as it's not hard to get a cat to swallow a pill, but I completely understand if that's not your cup of tea. Good luck either way :-)

Just joking, sorry. John Clark Sims built his estate at this spot in the 1890‚Äôs, later selling it on to Isaac Starr in the 30‚Äôs, who then passed it on to his daughter, Hope Starr. Later, in her 90‚Äôs, Ms. Starr sold the property to Lloyd Hansen Associates, a tract home developer and real estate speculator.

The place was bananas, like, it was just so insane to see so much vacant/abandoned land in Montco, especially in the particular spot it is.

"They were in use as residential rentals until about ten years ago. A developer bought the land in these pics as well as the *massive* estate next door, with the intention of bulldozing it all to build a series of high rise apartments for the 55+ crowd. Eventually, after a decade of wrangling with two townships (the property straddles the Cheltenham/Springfield line) the developer secured all the variances they needed  and modified the plan enough to get it all through the township boards and we find ourselves in present day, where the estate, farm, and mansion are gone along with most of the trees and other geological features and in their place a neighborhood of million dollar homes on postage stamp sized lots is rapidly taking form.

If you‚Äôre traveling east on Willow Grove Ave toward 309, it‚Äôs hard to miss. Just before you reach the bridge over 309, to your left you‚Äôll notice an intricately detailed brick wall that runs for the better part of a quarter mile, with a break in the middle for the brickwork gate and driveway entrance. The mansion was at the end of this driveway until early 2020. The place photographed in this post was up the long and gravelly driveway located just before the start of the brick wall. Lots of construction signs now, you can‚Äôt miss it. At the far end of the brick wall is a second driveway which until recently had a decaying greenhouse complex tucked up against the wall close to the road. As of this writing, there may or may not be other buildings nearby, the former Groundskeeper‚Äôs House and other outbuildings, though last I stopped by there they really didn‚Äôt want to tell me anything so‚Ä¶

The greenhouse is now gone and the fate of the other outbuildings at that entrance (again, not pictured) is unclear - my town and community group contacts have dried-up of late, conversationally suggesting they‚Äôve been ready to put this all behind them for some time now.

" Hello everyone!

This is a fictional rail network map I have created for the Delaware Valley region of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. I was inclined to create this because I felt that the Philadelphia area could still use some better connectivity and frequency of rail (although it is still quite good under general US commuter rail standards), especially across the Delaware River itself to give more southern New Jerseyans rail access other than PATCO and the infrequent NJT Atlantic City line. I also noticed that there are a decent amount of urban centers in southeastern Pennsylvania such as Allentown, Reading, and Bethlehem that would surely benefit from connections to-and-from Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs.

The ""Suburban Lines"" listed in the bottom left are the commuter rail services which serve a lot of what SEPTA already does today, yet with added lines branching out to other underserved areas that could use the rail equally as much. The ""Regional Lines"" extend out further distances than the suburban lines, skipping many of the stops along the way in order to make for quicker journies between high demand cities and suburbs. I intentionally did not include one of these regional lines on the Northeast corridor since Amtrak would most likely be taking on that intercity-connector role. Stations served by Amtrak are indicated by the logo next to the station name. The thin, light grey lines are services ran by other operating companies, which in this (fictional) world would have their own maps, trains, rights of way, etc.

I made this map entirely out of pure enjoyment. I am totally open to constructive criticism and/or suggestions on what I could add, fix, or change on the map (especially if you are from the area represented in the map), but please do not take this \*too\* seriously as I am just a teenager with a wandering imagination :).

If a single family home,  it's likely that you will have to see a variance and, assuming no neighbors complain and there is enough parking, you may very well succeed, especially if you can show the need.

"I agree with the sentiment that we should all do our part and visit shared spaces as little as possible.  We are in a pandemic after all.

"We‚Äôll, I feel the Lockdown wasn‚Äôt strong enough.  People seemed to get the picture the first two weeks, but after that, they didn‚Äôt care.  I saw a FB friend that‚Äôs a nurse post a selfie with her national brand coffee ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without my coffee‚Äù.  Why is the pretzel place around the corner open?  The Italian ice place has a line at all times.  I don‚Äôt think these are essential businesses.  That‚Äôs just my opinion.  I think it should have been much stricter.  At least in the counties that are hit the hardest.  I‚Äôm in Montgomery which was one of the first and is still has a large amount of cases.  I also haven‚Äôt checked the numbers in about a week.  People don‚Äôt care at this point, and I understand it.  I have friends going to New Jersey and Delaware for liquor.  My neighbor went to Nashville to visit a friend.  Just doesn‚Äôt seem like the smart thing to do. 
When the lockdown started, my work didn‚Äôt have gloves, masks or sanitizer.  They had ran out before that.  Also, there were no guidelines in place.  So it was a little bit weary of the unknown.  We probably have about 60 employees at our facility that has to punch in, log your jobs all day and log out on only 3 computers.  Not to mention our jobs include sharing tools, helping with moving parts that need to be replaced/repaired.  There‚Äôs no social distancing there.  Finally they put some guidelines in place.  No more logging into the computer, face masks, gloves are available.  People are walking around a few times a day spraying sanitizer everywhere.  So I feel that the majority of essential businesses probably weren‚Äôt prepared as well, which didn‚Äôt help.  
I think we can open at this point.  The people that want to go out will and the ones that don‚Äôt, won‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm also hearing that 80% of the cases are nursing homes.  That‚Äôs like a scale going back and forth in my head.  
-It‚Äôs mostly older people in homes getting infected.  They‚Äôre not going out anyways.  
-If I was in a nursing home, I would want people to stay home. 
I hear a lot of people haven‚Äôt gotten their unemployment checks yet.  I‚Äôm starting to feel guilty about working.  It‚Äôs not a good situation for people. We do need to get economic going, but at what expense?

"Everything needs to shut down.  As much as I would like to still keep working, everyone needs to stop what they‚Äôre doing for 2 weeks.  People are not taking it seriously.  I was inline getting food yesterday when a lady was talking that Monday her bathroom is going to get remodeled.  Stuff like that can wait.  I was told SEPTA can‚Äôt shut down because some essential people take the train.  Ridership was down 80% this week before the news from the governor on Thursday.  SEPTA has been on strike before, important people still found a way to work.  If anything, there‚Äôs going to be no one on the roads, except important people.   Me personally, just my opinion, shut it all down.  You would need to give everyone a few days notice.  Super Wawa‚Äôs can stay open for fuel only, no cash.  One person inside.  Maybe supermarkets can be open in way they handled the gas crisis in the 70‚Äôs.  One item only on certain items.   Ex. One can of sauce, one can of corn, one bag of rice etc.  People out better have proper paper work of what they are doing.  Ex. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the guy that delivers the fuel, here‚Äôs my papers ‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking my father to his weekly dialysis, here‚Äôs proof‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs my time to go food shopping‚Äù.  

I don‚Äôt know.  We‚Äôre Americans, we don‚Äôt like to be told what to do.  But I‚Äôm starting to think this getting very serious.  As a 44 single male, I‚Äôm getting a bit scared of what can happen.  And if we don‚Äôt get our act together there‚Äôs gonna be no Jersey Shore this summer.  No brewery hoping on a sunny Saturday afternoon, no Phillies game to have fun at.  

Maybe that‚Äôs too drastic, but I‚Äôm fine with losing two weeks of my life to make other people safer and be able to do their job without interfering.

"Thanks for the reply. 

I've definitely read a lot about how the federal government overtly drafted policies to keep black families from acquiring equity and force them into certain areas.

What the FHA did to returning black veterans is unjust to say the least.

Do you draw the parallel that Abington, like a gated community, is using exclusionary amenities to control its populations racial make up?

I could see this if there were separate, unusually high dues required ""for maintenance "" of the townships amenities required for all residents. But that's not the case. 

Actually, I found this article explaining why it's the way it is.

""Only township residents and their guests are allowed in - a stipulation made by former Sears, Roebuck & Co. chairman Lessing Rosenwald when he donated the land in the early 1960s.

Aside from the stipulation from the Rosenwald family, the park is closed to outsiders also because it is paid for exclusively through township property taxes and user fees. Some parks receive funds from other levels of government, such as the state, and are thus obligated to remain open to the wider public.

We have 56,000 residents who use it quite regularly,"" Conway said of the park. ""To open it up to others would make it overcrowded.""

The same year (1960) they broke ground the board of supervisors also approved the Crestmont housing project. 

I'll have to dig a little deeper on the history of the township during that period, but I would assume that there could be some merit to your assertion about underlying intent. Though Rosenwald may have had a covertly racist intent, the housing project approval makes me question the involvement of the township in that regard. 

Do you feel today, 60 years later, the intent is the same? Is the township not justified in protecting amenities wholly paid for by its residents? 

It still eems like a gray area to me. 

Is there legal teeth to getting Rosenwald's covenant overturned?

"That would be fine and dandy of an analogy but those apartment buildings are private property whereas a public park isn't.  Intent and subtext also matter.

When you have an active desire to actually monitor the IDs of person entering the park with a checkpoint at the entrance for every car and walker, it means you care more strongly about the exclusion aspect than who you are including.  When you make a concerned effort to evict a happy, harmless couple simply for living 1000 feet from an imaginary line, it's because you actively want to keep people from the ""wrong side"" of the line out.

Remember your history - in the days of segregation blacks and whites did not have equal access to many things, including swimming pools.  When segregation ended, white flight took off with those who could afford to leave going to the suburbs.  Funding to maintain parks and pools in urban environments declined.  Meanwhile, the people who left founded community pools *for residents only* and private swim clubs with paying dues that just so happened to replace segregation but still be legal.

Alventhorpe Park was built in 1960 and opened in spring of 1961.  It was one of those community parks with a pool that although is a public park has exclusionary access to only verify and IDed residents.

"Ok, I conceed my facts are wrong. It was the result of quickly searching the internet. 

Let me try and express my view another way.

Please don't take it as an attack, I genuinely would like to know the fallacy of my thinking.

Here goes:

Two apartment buildings next to each other. 
We can assume that the demographics match the two townships we're discussing. 

Building A has a nice outdoor area that the tenants have all agreed to chip in to keep maintained. Tenants that pay less rent, aren't required to pay as much towards the upkeep as ones whose premium apartments command higher rent. They all have agreed that, since they pay for it, they should have exclusive access to it. Everyone in the building has access, no one is denied based on how much they pay, or ethnicity, race etc.

Building B has an ok space but definitely not as nice as their neighbors. Some of their rent is also  allocated to maintain common areas available to tenants, but clearly they don't have as much revenue as building A. 

A tenant of  building B feels that being denied access to the nice outdoor space at building A is discrimination. I mean it's right nextdoor. Why shouldn't they have access to it?

Is the tenant of building B correct in your opinion?

Should building A be forced to open access to every one on the block because it's unfair that the other buildings don't generate as much revenue, so in turn don't have outdoor spaces as nice as it's own?

If it is discrimination, it definitely isn't racial in nature as the OP is inferring by sourcing population based on ethnicity. 

I assuming you could make an argument that building A is discriminating based on average income?

Im not sure we agree on the definition of discrimination. 

OP isn't correct about Cheltenham being much poorer.

""The median income for a family in Cheltenham in the 2010 Census was¬†$72,584""

""The median income for a household in Abington township was $77,363

So the residents of Cheltenham aren't less ""privileged"", at least not on paper.

Doing it on paper first ensures that your actual work is the physical record of accuracy, and the digital copy is for quick tallying only. When done digitally first, there are all sorts of honest bugs and malicious acts that can take place.

If you aren't willing to do more than push two buttons to vote, maybe the issue isn't the ballot...

"**Kennedy Mansion (Valley Forge)**

Kennedy Mansion (Valley Forge), also known as Kennedy-Supplee Mansion, is an Italian-villa-style residence within Valley Forge National Historical Park. Now squeezed between PA Route 23 and U.S. Route 422 (Pottstown Expressway), it once overlooked the 19th-century industrial village of Port Kennedy.

Port Kennedy was named for Alexander Kennedy, a major figure in the American lime industry. Limestone was quarried from the Valley Forge hills and processed into lime, which was shipped on the Schuylkill Canal and, after 1849, on the Reading Railroad.

Stein's thoughts on vaccines:

Did she think vaccines were harmful?

""I think there‚Äôs no question that vaccines have been absolutely critical in ridding us of the scourge of many diseases ‚Äî smallpox, polio, etc. So vaccines are an invaluable medication,"" Stein said. ""Like any medication, they also should be ‚Äî what shall we say? -- approved by a regulatory board that people can trust. And I think right now, that is the problem. That people do not trust a Food and Drug Administration, or even the CDC for that matter, where corporate influence and the pharmaceutical industry has a lot of influence.""
