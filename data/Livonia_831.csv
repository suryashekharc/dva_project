So, we (white guy, Japanese wife and 6 year old daughter) bought a housein Livonia in summer 2020 after moving from out of state in 2019 (Werented for a year in Farmington). Livonia was not our first choice - welooked hard at Farmington Hills, Novi and Berkley but couldn't findanything in our price range or were outbid when putting in offers. Aftera few months of not finding a place we decided to give Livonia a secondlook and settled in on the 6 mile area between Farmington Rd andNewburgh Rd. We love this area. Excellent access to Detroit and AnnArbor, plus my wife and I both work in Novi. Schools in Livonia aresolid (underrated I'd argue), it's quite safe and becoming more diverse(albeit slowly). We really like living off 6 mile and having quickaccess to Northville and Novi as well. We were a bit hesitant to move atfirst due to the history of racism and lack of diversity, but afterliving here it's nice to be a part of a changing Livonia.

"Yes, it's racist. The city is over 90% white, but in 2020 data came out that is publicly available that around half of LPD's traffic stops were made against nonwhites. 

I've grew up both in and around Livonia and live here currently. It is changing. Slowly. But ive been called everyword under the son here as a kid. As an adult I've had offhanded rascist remakes made against me and my family. Rascist notes left by former neighbors, people mean mugging me at the park with my son. Outside of incidents in highschool I've never felt like I was going to be assaulted or lynched or anything. 

I don't spend enough time in Novi to say anything about it racially. People saying move to northville are basing this I think solely on crime stats. Northville is VERY rascist. The flavor is just different. NPD, while I haven't seen the stats, I'm sure based on my experience is just as if not more rascist than LPD. You're paying fat premium for your racism in Northville as well. 

In my decades of life experience you don't really get to move away from rascism, you just change the flavor. 



All that said I live in Livonia, on the south end. I have good relationships with all of my current neighbors. My street is becoming more diverse with younger people moving in.  most older people around me ,while they've said ignorant thing's, aren't actively malicious, but more the ""I know who you voted for type."" They are nice enough and have even have gone out of there way to buy special gifts specifically for my kids on Halloween during trick r treating.

"Hi so currently a Livonia resident for 2 years now. We moved here because this is the area my boyfriend wanted to be. Let me tell you this man does his research. He does say to move a bit farther west if you can because where you are looking at isn‚Äôt the best area if only do to that area being close to Redford and he says you don‚Äôt want to be there because crime is worse the closer to Redford you get.

I (and my boyfriend) are both curious about the others that posted here about Livonia being openly racist, as neither of us really see any racism. The store I frequent is full of all kinds of different ethnicities.and I‚Äôve never heard or seen any form of racism. I admit sometimes I‚Äôm pretty oblivious to things around me. That‚Äôs why I asked my boyfriend if he‚Äôs ever felt like he wasn‚Äôt welcome here. If you haven‚Äôt guessed it he is a black man. I wondered if he felt our neighbors didn‚Äôt welcome him or if he felt he was ever followed in a store either with me or without. He said no he didn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt feel our neighbors are racist either. He says yes Livonia has ties to racism in its past, but it‚Äôs changed in the last few decades.

"I haven‚Äôt been over in that area of Livonia in a while, but it‚Äôs not the nicest side of Livonia.

I would have argued that fact a couple of years ago, but the past couple of years people haven‚Äôt exactly been shy about showing their true colors. It‚Äôs been a super big disappointment. Also, while your child has a little ways to go before you start thinking of school, if you‚Äôre going to choose public, I‚Äôd choose somewhere else. I don‚Äôt know what the heck happened, but I am very unhappy with how downhill LPS has gone in the past decade. I‚Äôll be thrilled once my kid has graduated. I love the tiny village we‚Äôve created, and my child has certainly thrived, but I credit that more to the people we choose to allow into our lives and his strength than to the city and district as a whole. My opinion, look elsewhere. You‚Äôll be much happier in the long run, I think - and it really breaks my heart to say so, because I‚Äôve lived here for most of my life. 

On the other hand, because it used to be a placed I loved so much, I desperately wish more diverse people moved in, and change was forced upon the racist twats.

"Well , there is Livonia ,MI , USA.  
I asume thats what this redit is about.  
As for the name - Grand Dutchy of Livonia , Also know as The United Baltic Dutchy  , was feudal teritorial entity in the teritory of modern day Estonia and most of modern day Latvia.

"Island Lake State Park at I-96 and Kensington has decent running trails and is about 30 minutes from Livonia.  When you enter the park turn right and go down to the trail head with the big parking lot before the Spring Mill Pond area.  There will be the blue trail or the yellow trail.

"Equal playing ground at this point involves Equity more so than Equality. Because, as you've experienced, not everyone has started equally. White people have been ahead for 400 years, so it'll take more than just treating people equally to reach true equality.  The way you talk about Detroiters and low income people, and then become upset when challenged, is what comes off as racist against Black people. The main contribution to crime rate, is poverty and joblessness, so of course cites with lower income will have higher crime rates. People can barely feed their families, and have to rely on government assistance to even have a home for their children. Drug use is nationally equal among all races and genders, with age usually being the only difference. However Black men are arrested and jailed at a much higher rate for drug crimes, even though the white upperclass kids at Stevenson are selling coke to each other, laced with who knows what. Instead of being mad about or judging 12 people living in a one bedroom, why not work to dismantle the system that put them in that position? None of them can be HAPPY with that situation either. So saying they shouldn't be in Livonia because of it is rooted in internalized racism. I'm not saying you're racist at your core, or have any malicious intent, but some of the things you've said definitely sound that way. And that's my biggest problem with Livonia. All of Metro Detroit looks at us as racists, traffic data has shown racial profiling is rampant in the city, my Black friends are not always comfortable visiting my home there. But it seems like the non Black residents would prefer to pretend these problems don't exist because *they* haven't experienced it.

"If it's impossible to have higher than 12% Black population, why is Detroit over 58% Black and many surrounding cities are less than 10%? Couldn't possibly be because the Detroit metropolitan area is the second most segregated in the country. You're throwing out random numbers and calling it facts. It's funny that your ""calculations"" matter, yet the data released by the city I cited somehow is skipped over. The AG, state rep, 2 council members, and state senator all saw those statistics and made public statements about them being problematic. The fact that you're so offended and hurt that racism exists in a city you haven't lived in for 20 years is laughable. You're also very quick to assume my race after being so upset that I implied you're not Black (which you aren't). My family is from Detroit, we're some of those ""undesirables"" in low income housing. Ask a Black Detroit resident about Livonia before rage crying over a reddit comment. Again, you are speaking from a place of privilege to assume 1) racism is not an issue in a city you don't live in and 2) That anybody who isn't Black or Indigenous can afford a university when student loan debt is a financial crisis in our country. 
I truly hope OP sees these ridiculous comments and realizes this internalized racism is exactly what I referencing when I spoke about my city, that I grew up in and have watched for 10 years get more and more *Openly* racist.

The comments about them being 'undesirables' from Detroit is very indicative of Livonia's attitude about poor and Black people. A lot of work has gone into the city to keep 'Detroiters' out. After growing up there, I wouldn't raise my kids in that environment.  We moved to a more diverse and welcoming city. I agree the schools really aren't the best, not awful, but definitely not good for students with learning disabilities. They allowed my brother and sister to be bullied for years and refused to step in no matter how bad it got. Eventually my sister, who has autism, wouldn't even go to school most of the time. Stevenson being the only ""good"" school is kind of laughable to me, they had a huge prescription drug / opioid problem when I was in school. I did have quite a few teachers that I really loved, though. I'd look into Plymouth, Canton West Dearborn, or Ann Arbor.

"Something for all to consider as you head to the polls in August.

In April, 2019 our building department in Livonia issued PO19-0102 for a business on 8 Mile near Milburn.  The stated purpose for this building is as ""a growth facility of marijuana, no dispensary allowed.""

In the November election 55% of voters in Livonia voted in favor of Prop 1.  Immediately after the election without any thoughtful discussion or research, our city government opted Livonia out of any and all marijuana business prospects.

So, the question I want Laura Toy to answer is how this building was given a permit in April, 2019 to operate as a grow operation in the city of Livonia when your council unanimously opted us out of the industry in late 2018?

I have confirmation that this building and it's operators do NOT possess a cannabis license from the state, yet our city has granted them a grow permit.   Who is this person growing for and why are they allowed to do it without licensing?  Why is Livonia giving this building a special consideration?  

Join me tonight at city hall to try and get an answer to these questions and more from those begging for our votes.",t2_42d5wl9e,loubens_mirth,0,1563887607.0,0,t1_eukfhma,eukfhma,True,3PointOneFour,t3_c6sra4,https://www.reddit.com/r/livonia/comments/c6sra4/livonia_mayoral_election_in_november/,Livonia Mayoral Election in November,/r/livonia/comments/c6sra4/livonia_mayoral_election_in_november/eukfhma/,1,r/livonia,0,1
"  I attended the Mayoral Primary Candidate Forum last Wednesday night at the library.  I was stunned to see that only two of the three candidates were in attendance.  While her contenders were on the hot seat answering questions on the fly from the voting audience, Ms. Laura Toy chose to not attend this forum.  I understand that there was a City Council meeting that was scheduled for the same time as this public forum and that is why Ms. Toy was not in attendance.  Does Laura Toy feel these types of public forums are beneath her that she is a shoo-in for the primary vote?

As voters are we to understand that Ms. Toy doesn‚Äôt consider it important to address public forum questions BEFORE the primary?  The forum is available via twitter and the chamber of commerce site.

It is very middle class, family oriented community, if your not a family with kids in some way shape of form you probably won't feel like the city is designed for you. If you are a family with kids, it is very much a city designed around family friendly, working parent households. It's suburban, which means subdivisions, and each one is going to have a different feel and for many will have a larger impact on your comfort level.

 You can tell what's important to a community by how they spend their money. Livonia spends a lot on schools, and on community recreation.

"My guess is it just keeps the city council from having to deal with older constituents.  Livonia is home to many, many elderly people and older parents, and a good deal of them are conservative.  So they are not going to piss off that group by opting out, will make many more happy, and the group that will most care are 18-25 year olds who are super unlikely to vote in future city council elections, so despite passing their safest bet is to opt out. 

Another example, the mayor really wants to renegotiate the waste management contract to get all of Livonia bigger recycling carts at no additional cost, right now to get one is $75 I think. Anyway, a very vocal minority of older Livonia residents are raising Hell about it because they think it will make the cans too heavy, completely ignoring that the carts would have wheels (current small bins do not) and it will still be only as heavy as what you put in it. No good reason not to get the bigger tubs. But we likely won‚Äôt get them because members of the city council have said they‚Äôve heard from elderly constituents who are scared of the change. 

National politics or super local, the trends are the same. The young and idealist will want things but either be too busy or not bother to vote or contact their representatives to make their voices heard, and the old and grouchy who don‚Äôt want to bother to learn something new have a ton of free time and are more than happy to make their voices heard and stop off and vote on their daily drive at 10 under the speed limit during rush hour.

"I live in Livonia currently and grew up in Northville next door.  I don't have any personal experience with Livonia schools as my kids aren't in them yet but it's pretty well known if you are in Livonia you want Stevenson High School.  Not that the other schools are bad, it's much higher rated.  It was like that when I was a kid as well.  The best school systems in the immediate area are probably Northville/Novi/Plymouth/Livonia in that order though.  Then you have your Birmingham/Bloomfield Hills/Troy which are considered slightly higher in the overall Detroit area.  

We're in the Stevenson area now but have outgrown our current house and would like to move partly for better schools as well, but it's fairly difficult with the current housing prices to do that and get what we'd ultimately want.  I don't know your friend's situation or why those two specific schools but if there is an option I'd suggest NW Livonia (Stevenson) or Plymouth as you should be be able to find at least a few options in the Franklin area budget range.

* Get a quesadilla mixta with grilled steak and add peppers and onions, and it's one of the best quesadillas I've ever had.

* Order their hot salsa - it's roasted and fiery, with amazing flavor.

Finally, they've been offering good drink specials daily on Facebook lately.

"UPDATE:
7 out of the 9 reptiles have been found and returned back to the store. They were in rough shape, but are making speedy recoveries. Also, the man who broke in and stole them has been arrested and is in police custody. He is being very silent and not cooperating with police.

Looking to transfer my lease to someone else.  We are in the process of buying a house.  It appears there may be a few months overlap from when we get the house to when the apartment rent ends (8/31).  It would be a lease transfter from Mid June ish until 8/31.  On 7/31 you can give the apartment a notice if you want to renew for 12 months, 3 months, month to month, or not renew the lease.

"Little things to note: 

the greasy spoon burger joint is called Bates, and is in the dead center of the city. Farmington and 5 mile. 

There's a phoenix theater tucked away in an office complex next to Laurel Park mall. It doesn't get much traffic, and has big comfy seats. It does get lines when big movies come out. 

The industrial park is between 275 and Plymouth spanning pretty much all of Livonia. The waste disposal for things like used oil and other things you can't just trash is down there off of Farmington. There's also an archery range down there. 

Hines park stretches from northville, down and around the southern edge of Livonia, and over to dearborn. Hines drive follows the park with minimal stoplights and a lot of scenery. It's a nice drive. There's also a lot of picnic areas, a dog park, and a frisbee golf course. Also Segway tour of nankin mills. 
During the winter there's a winter light show setup along the road.

"No, but it's the standard WOW offerings they have been rolling out other places.  The 1Gb top tier is like 1Gb down 50Mb up, the next tier is 600/50.  1GB is definitely coming but I don't think it will be initially offered in Livonia. I believe the 600/50 package is like $75 a month just for internet but there is a bundle or their full cable lineup + HBO and internet for $95 on a two year contract.  That's $100 less a month for cable+HBO+200/30 service that I pay for Spectrum right now. 

That being said it's WOW.  They are looking for someone to come and buy them out so who knows what happens to the no caps and decent pricing if someone does.  They also don't have the best peering.  I know someone that has the 600/50 service a few towns over and he says he gets the full speed but latency is a little high. I'd much rather have rocket or lightspeed build out their fiber to the home and full 1Gb synchronous service but until then it's good to have a viable 2nd option.

"Livonia is pretty large so where you are at makes a big difference.  The better side of town is the Northwest, west of Farmington, north of 5 mile.  

Boring suburb is accurate. There's no downtown to speak of, so really no nightlife at all.  Most all the decent restaurants are west of 275 along Haggerty road or in that general area.  Those are all chains though, there's really not any places to eat, do, or stores that are unique to Livonia that stand out.  

The main benefit of Livonia is the (super convenient) location.  You can switch jobs and pretty much still have a short commute.  You've got Ann Arbor, Detroit, Royal Oak, the airport etc all within 25 minutes, and Plymouth/Northville/Novi within 15 as well.  There's plenty to do in those areas.  It's a very stable, safe area, with decent schools (although Northville would be better).  Despite it almost all being built from the 1950's to the 1970's people tend to take care of things and there wasn't a huge number of empty houses when the 2008 crisis hit. You have a mix of older original owners and a lot more young families moving in.  On my street the houses have been  getting 5+ offers and selling at/over asking in less than a week.  City services are pretty good and the taxes are low.  I don't belong to it because the hours don't work for me but the rec center is pretty impressive.  The Library has some good stuff going on for the kids.  Greenmead is nice, and there are a good number of parks.  It's not a Comcast area which is a plus. It's Spectrum (Brighthouse after Charter buy out), which has no caps and generally never gave me any issues.  WOW is in the process of building out here will be offering up to 1Gbit for like half the price without caps.

"Brighthouse is a lot better than WOW.  WOW cable offering sucks and it's internet speeds are not as fast.  

The only real issues with Bright house are:

* The cost is too high, but that's the general state of all internet providers in the US until Google fiber or similar come in a wipe them off the map.
* They have TERRIBLE communications about service work and outages. They have unannounced mystery outages 2-3 times a month (at least).  Whenever these happen it is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to call them, 99% of the time their phone number goes completely offline.  It they have planned work they need a map showing us, the customer, what's going on and when so we can make backup internet plans.  I often work late from home doing my own maintenance work and this has been a major issue for me.  The also need a reliable hotline to call, even if it only plays a recorded ""we are aware of a service outage"" message.
* Their upload speeds suck compared to downloads 90/5, 150/10.. really?
* The techs they sent out for Lighting when that first came out had zero idea what they were doing (I wanted passthrough to my our router, not to use the router functions they offer) and they were rude and tried to leave multiple times when my service was clearly broken.  I'm a network engineer, so when they try to tell me absolute nonsense why it's not working that's not going to fly.  They finally broke down and let me tell them what they needed to do and surprise.. it worked right away.

What's good about Bright house:

* They have more HD channels then just about everyone else out there and are good at adding new ones.
* The speeds they offer are decent, at least compared to other cable providers.

"Livonia itself has no downtown or nightlife.  It's all houses with some office buildings and strip malls thrown in.  Most of it was built up in the 60's-70's so it's primarily mature neighborhoods.  There are a lot of young families moving in but it's not the place for a social scene.  People seem to really care about their properties so even though they are older homes it's well maintained and more desirable then some of the other surrounding suburbs.  Royal Oak and the surrounding area is the more active social scene for the 20 somethings.  Housing is older and smaller (50's) and it has gotten expensive so people are moving more to the surrounding area instead.  It's right by the border with Detroit which is effectively a 3rd world country.  Personally I wouldn't live there because of those reasons which is why I'm in Livonia.  You can get to there and pretty much any other important surrounding city from Livonia in under 30 minutes (except Troy, 45 minutes) which is nice for social stuff and work.

"Brighthouse is the only cable provider in (all/most?) of Livonia.  They have a franchise agreement with the city given them a monopoly.  If you want something else it's DSL, which is what AT&T is and not remotely worth it.  As far as cable companies go Brighthouse is better than most, and way better than Comcast.  On the internet side they offer decent speeds, I get 60/5 but you are go up to 90/10 or you can go lower too.  I'm pretty annoyed that they keep adding new tiers and charging more instead of just bumping everyone up like they used to.  I get everything I pay for 24/7 though and they don't seem to care at all what I do with it.  No caps or letters etc... On the TV side I'd say they have been probably one of the best cable companies out there.  During the HD race they had a lot more HD channels than pretty much anyone.

"Good to hear they are improving. I do agree that their speeds are relatively reasonable for the price. 
Bright House, to my understanding though, is owned by Time Warner. So, that might bring more issues back to the latency and/or throttling for popular streaming mediums like Netflix and video game servers during their merger with Comcast (if allowed).",t2_byshh,dravenkitty,0,1398232316.0,0,t1_cgzppmx,cgzppmx,False,GoyfAscetic,t3_23pckv,https://www.reddit.com/r/livonia/comments/23pckv/moving_to_livonia_would_like_to_hear_from_others/,"Moving to Livonia, would like to hear from others the pros and cons of the different Internet providers in the area",/r/livonia/comments/23pckv/moving_to_livonia_would_like_to_hear_from_others/cgzppmx/,1,r/livonia,0,1
"I have the same problem, though it has been MUCH better the past month or so. I have only had Brighthouse, but I wouldn't do AT&T no matter what. I will say that other than the high latency / disconnect random times, the speed for Brighthouse is very good. I have been able to play MMORPGs and stream video out at the same time with no internet-related issues. I even reduced my speed because I didn't need all of the high level plan (and I use Netflix and other servers along with MMORPGs a lot).",t2_4k4pz,notimeforthis,0,1398225865.0,0,t1_cgznfpj,cgznfpj,False,GoyfAscetic,t3_23pckv,https://www.reddit.com/r/livonia/comments/23pckv/moving_to_livonia_would_like_to_hear_from_others/,"Moving to Livonia, would like to hear from others the pros and cons of the different Internet providers in the area",/r/livonia/comments/23pckv/moving_to_livonia_would_like_to_hear_from_others/cgznfpj/,2,r/livonia,0,2
"""I'm being Brighthoused!"" is now a phrase accepted among my friends that describes the instances of random extreme latency/ping issues that effect gaming. It isn't that big of a deal when streaming video, but any real time video games suffer a lot with that issue. I've moved in and out of the area, but always preferred Bright House prices compared to AT&T. But the ping issue has really been annoying for the past two years ish, and they haven't done anything to fix it.

Though I'm not very helpful because I have never personally had AT&T.

I don't live in Livonia anymore, so I've been using Comcast. They're less expensive for faster speeds and more reliable in my experience.

Also if you need any info on what to do, where to eat, and where to go, please feel free to message me.  It is not going to be nearly as active as Miami but there are plenty of places nearby for you to do whatever.

"The only area of Livonia I wouldn't recommend to anyone is around 7 mile area, east of Middlebelt. This is only my personal opinion, but the houses there tend to have a lower value because of the mix of home styles. When I was house hunting the houses there were not as well kept. I would say the Clements Circle Sub (around Plymouth Road and Middlebelt Road) and Rosedale Gardens Sub (around Plymouth Road and Merriman/Farmington) seems to be the most popular for young families. There are definitely affordable homes in these areas. Castle Gardens Sub (near 5 mile Road and Newburgh Road) has nice homes that tend to have long-time home owners, but are a little more costly.
