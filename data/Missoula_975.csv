FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"I think the nature of gun shops becoming politicized is due to the fact that gun rights dwindle by the decade and those people are scared, and in turn scare people away inadvertently. It’s a shame, but gun rights are a fairly right wing issue that the left simply tramples on too often.

That being said, the right and the left politicians aren’t as far apart as individuals are.

"I have no idea why people get so pissed about this. I saw someone splitting lanes while I was stopped at a light literally last night on reserve st. near S. 3rd. W. My only thought was, huh - didn't know that was legal here... wish I was on a bike instead of stuck in this car! The guy was doing it nice and slowly at like 15mph. We don't typically have long backups here in regular traffic (unless there's a wreck) that lasts miles, so splitting lanes at 90MPH like they do in CA for 2 miles straight isn't necessary anyway. Frankly i wish more people rode bikes. Better for traffic, better for roads, better for environment, gas mileage/finances etc. all good so long as you don't die.

I grew up here and after having lived in lots of other states/countries, I find Missoula has some of the most toxic and unskilled drivers in the entire country. I find them to be far worse than your average person in say Phoenix, LA, Denver, Seattle or Portland. Just really oblivious. Un-aware of most other drivers and traffic laws. Unaware of what's going on around them, especially behind them and even next to them and really couldn't care less about others on the road. I don't get it. And everyone around here seems to think the wrecks are all ""cause we're driving too fast."" Agree to disagree, it's because people here are discourteous, entitled (with their cars anyway), and oblivious. God be with all you bikers.

"/r/liberalgunowners

That's a common misconception. The vast majority of liberals are for *responsible* gun ownership. 

For me, that means universal background checks, mandatory gun safety courses, registration of firearms (required to be carried at all times with the firearm, just like a driver's license for driving), and some kind of centralized sale/transfer tracking, and reasonable limitations on what kind of weapons can be sold. I even go further sometimes and think ANY kind of firearm that isn't against international law should be allowed to be sold, but with significant restrictions on where it can be stored, used, and how it can be transferred or sold.

If you're a level-headed individual with no history of violence, some safety training, and you purchase a legitimate firearm registered to your name, most liberals I know wouldn't have any issues with you having it.",t2_3y969,OutsideObserver,1,1648247140.0,0,t1_i24gma6,i24gma6,False,_claimjumper_,t3_tnku5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/tnku5l/not_right_wing_gun_shop/,Not right wing gun shop?,/r/missoula/comments/tnku5l/not_right_wing_gun_shop/i24gma6/,-2,r/missoula,0,-2

"Security at the homeless shelter makes sense, patrolling random alleyways and streets does not, which they are doing, read all the emails in the nbc article. 

Aside from training issues, I wonder if they even finished training for the whole team, apparently according to the emails between the city and them they have been working 30+ days without the ""mental health first aid"" training laid out in their contract

They aren't finishing the training because they are too busy patrolling and they are short staffed because (paraphrase) ""it's really hard to find anyone who wants to work right now"" . Yeah right, you pay 30 an hour in Missoula and can't find anyone to work... My ass

Fuck these clowns, and fuck their contract, they are supposed to be hired specifically to help security at the poverello center, which they won't be able to do much because firearms aren't allowed in the facility so they aren't either, the emails lay out the director of the poverello center telling the city that they aren't allowed in the property armed.... 

This whole thing stinks too much and the more I look into it and the more I read the actual contracts which aren't being met the more disappointed I am with them.

Edit:
From those emails;

The goal is to maintain safety for folks seeking shelter services and for the surrounding neighborhood.

 Security is in the area to help with non-urgent public safety concerns, to include things like: loitering around businesses; people blocking accessto streets and sidewalks particularly during daytime hours or with an ongoing presence; concentrated groups of people in parks and other public spaces; needles in parks and public spaces; unwanted behavior such as vandalism and theft; and other similar concerns. We are not criminalizing houselessness and expect that security interactions will be conducted from a place of relationship, humanity, and de-escalation at all times possible.

"I mention every time ""just get an ESA/make your pet an ESA"" comes up that it's also not always that simple. ESAs fall under a ""reasonable accommodation request for housing"" under HUD and FHAct guidelines. Your documentation must meet reasonableness tests, which can include contacting the provider that writes you a ESA letter to verify that the letter came from them, and asking other questions like how long and often they've seen you, if it's in person or online, and so on. They can't ask about your disability, but if you've been ""seen"" once online by a provider which has never seen you before, and they saw you the same day your letter was generated, that probably won't be considered reasonable. You can then go to court over it, but that's expensive and if you have no history of a disability you're probably not going to win anyway.

Pets are expensive - food, vet, supplies, and sometimes pet rent. That's a commitment you take on when you take responsibility for one. Pets do tend to introduce more wear and tear on housing, even if they're well-behaved. While I understand the sentiment, trying to use the ESA process to save some money isn't really cool when it means the ESA process gets tightened down for everyone due to abuse, including people with actual disabilities who legitimately have a need for an ESA.",t2_6tcte,RBZL,0,1647957212.0,0,t1_i1nt3ch,i1nt3ch,False,Learned_Stuff,t3_tju20l,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/tju20l/its_about_to_get_really_ugly/,It’s about to get really ugly.,/r/missoula/comments/tju20l/its_about_to_get_really_ugly/i1nt3ch/,11,r/missoula,0,11

"Good Question!

The specific part of this scenario that does not sound fair to me is that Black Coffee takes what their employees have deemed an inappropriate percentage of tips to subsidize their entire workforce. Potentially as a means of avoiding paying all of their employees a living wage.

It sounds like Black Coffee baristas make 12 an hour, and that the percentage of tips they get does not add up to a livable wage.

The employees see a chance to restructure so that Black Coffee could have a local staff that is paid a living wage and still be totally fine as a company.

It's not on me to decide what is fair within the company - I am a patron of the place and have been for years, but in this scenario, unless I come upon contradicting details - I support the workers rights to negotiate for what they consider a living wage.",t2_5p1pgzl5,Snowden2024,0,1647904505.0,0,t1_i1ldxjh,i1ldxjh,False,Snowden2024,t3_tipjub,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/tipjub/black_coffee_steals_tips_from_their_employees/,Black Coffee steals tips from their employees...,/r/missoula/comments/tipjub/black_coffee_steals_tips_from_their_employees/i1ldxjh/,0,r/missoula,0,0

"I don't disagree with you personally. But I also have a very different life situation as you inevitably do too. Keeping this focused on student experience, remember that in-state tuition takes years to become eligible for - moving starts that clock over. When you are already very deep into earning a degree and the subsequent debt, walking away becomes less of an option.

We as a society shame people for not going to college and we shame them for taking too many loans for college - let's not shame them for trying to go to college no matter the sacrifices might look like. 

A shocking amount of adults have no one to turn to for financial help through no fault of their own. A rigged economy where the super rich only get richer and the plebs bicker amongst ourselves has given us multiple generations of decently educated Americans who do not have much of a chance at financial stability. Intergenerational wealth that used to be the foundation for buying a home, starting a family, or pursuing a degree, doesn't exist for today's young people. We churn out 23 year olds with 100k in debt who then realize they need at least a master's to compete in the job market. We charge hundreds of dollars for parking passes, meal plans, localized and limited health plans, overpriced textbooks. The system of student loans is also predatory with colleges jacking up costs because students can use loans and subsidize their costs all in the name of college experience.

 I work with lots of students and I can tell you firmly that people in school today are pushing against a deck that is stacked out of their favor in many, many ways. I have a tremendous amount of respect for people trying to better themselves through hard work and determination and I don't see how we can tell anyone their dreams aren't worth it.

There are oodles of reasons someone couldn't leave the town they consider home and we are in the crisis we are in partly because of people in other cities who could no longer make ends meet there who ""just moved"" to somewhere like Missoula.

"There is no job that should not be paid as if someone is living off of it. Not everyone is suited to ""careers"" and sometime someone loses a job and still need to make a living. These jobs can't only be worked by people that are only going to work there temporarily. Some of those people have a hard time getting better jobs because circumstances they can't change, like being a single parent and needing something with flexibility so they can be there for their kids when those kids are out of school or you just graduated and need to have a job while trying to leverage your degree into a career, as you say.

But we're not talking about being paid as if it was a career, because a career should be able to buy you a house, eventually, and a new(er) car every few years. We're talking about jobs that people need to pay rent, and repair their beater cars and be able to handle more than a $400 dollar emergency. 

Just because you don't think a job has value, doesn't mean that someone isn't trapped in a place where they have to make that job pay their bills.   


Thats not to say that these careers you speak of are getting paid enough either. School teachers are barely paid more than minimum wage workers and I know of at least of person that quit being a teacher to become a waitress and make more money with less stress. 

Not everyone was born into a middle class family that has resources to help make sure their kids can go to college and even then college graduates often dont get jobs that are equal to their qualifications for 5+ years, and almost rarely ever get a job in the field of their degree, then they have to take 20+ years to pay their tuition back. 

We no longer live in a world where most people can get a career, because there are fewer career jobs being created, people are worker later into their retirement years, meaning lower level career position take longer to open up, and because companies are often downsizing and moving those jobs overseas.",t2_7f71h,Dracron,0,1647837869.0,0,t1_i1htgbf,i1htgbf,False,Snowden2024,t3_tipjub,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/tipjub/black_coffee_steals_tips_from_their_employees/,Black Coffee steals tips from their employees...,/r/missoula/comments/tipjub/black_coffee_steals_tips_from_their_employees/i1htgbf/,6,r/missoula,0,6

"So this idea of employees determining in coordination with the employer - from what I understand was attempted. That is why they are forming a union.

PS - there are other ways that a living wage can be negotiated - it is through a Union. 

This is not shaming - I am talking about facts without emotion. If Black Coffee is making undisclosed profit - while redistributing tips that go to baristas (+/- fair distribution among local team) holding them below a living wage - then I support them forming a union to use as a form to negotiate - 

...so this idea of serious effective negotiations one on one, that might be how your world works, or your life has shown you - but there are other situations that you might not be aware of or fully understand how bargaining works in different industries.

Like I said - I wish I could edit the word STEAL, but that word on ONE post on Reddit isn't gonna put black coffee in the ground.

"It's been my experience that tips tend to be split more evenly (aka ""redistributed"") when the front of the house employees aren't as actively ""waiting"" on customers. For example the kind of service at places like Black Coffee, The Break, or even The Bridge Pizza - where someone takes an order and gives it to you, but then doesn't have to come ""wait"" on customers or provide active table service- which makes sense in most situations when you think about it. They simply aren't having to fill waters, take specific orders from a full menu, refill drinks, carry 40lbs of plates, manage multiple courses, negotiate the complex dance of delivering a variety of foods at the same time while also schmoozing and keeping people happy with 100 different touch points. 

Just hearing that BCR employee policy might mean that employees split tips is...well it's not a situation that should cause outrage and certainly not something to make me reconsider buying their coffee as that's not an uncommon practice in places

">But they love guns

What does that have to do with anything? Abortion is a difficult topic because some Libertarians believe the fetus to be a human with it's own individual rights and aborting it would be an act of violence, and then there are other Libertarians who believe Women have a choice over their body and that the fetus can't be considered a full human being at that point. I align with the latter.

 And yeah, we love guns, Libertarianism is all about individual choice and freedom. Also, you care about women? Then why are you complaining about guns?

"The article is getting their data and analysis from Zillow, a company that is a big part of the reason for the problem. They literally say “the problem is caused by supply and demand”, but conveniently forget to mention their role in buying up all the supply so that the demand would drive prices up. Wall Street, investing in housing through companies like Zillow, is what is causing the nation wide issue. We didn’t all of a sudden run out of homes, corporate investors bought up almost a third of the inventory last year just to rent it out at high prices. If this was supply and demand, then as the demand went up in rural areas like Missoula it would go down in urban places from which people are “fleeing”, but that’s not happening at all.

"I totally agree, the loss of rights is a question that would need to be weighed against the betterment of the citizenry on whole. I think it is a good thing for a governing body to deliberate and can see how rent control is preventing a land/home owner from charging what the see is fit for the use of their property. But that’s the rub with every single law that is enacted. 

For the question of what people can build or use their property for, there are two things at play and that is the Zoning vs the Building Code. Which are in my opinion are different things and draw from different levels of government. The building code in my understanding at its most basic form is set by the state and focuses on an idea of “life safety”. For example; how a building should perform in an earthquake, to how many means of egress are required, to how to protect structures against fire. This code originates at the state level and can be adopted as is or amended (ie made only more stringent) by a municipality. Where the zoning code is set solely by a municipal government for the delineation of acceptable uses for land with in a city. In this case assuming all life safety requirements are met it is solely the per view of a city to determine what a home owner can and can’t do with their building or land. 

In my opinion the introduction of rent control is not a life safety concern. This would make it an issue that defaults to the municipalities as it is not an enumerated power to the state in the state’s constitution, as far as I’m aware. Thus by preventing the institution of rent control, the state is over stepping its authority by preventing the enactment of such a law. I say this while firmly believing that the enactment of rent control will at best will do very little to prevent the types of increases in housing costs we’ve seen in Missoula and other western states in the last couple years. 

I could write on and on about this topic (I’m not a lawyer or anything like that) as I’m just passionate that generations which follow the baby boomers should have the opportunity to own homes and make a better life for their families like my parents were able to.

"Done I won my court case in July of 2021, I thought I was free from city bullshit. I had police officers follow me and was even harassed by animal control a few times for a year and a half, then nothing. A few weeks later I had undercover cops follow me. Lately I thought they were still UC, but I've had a close look at them.

The city of Missoula, which still call me ""the man who threatened to kill city council"" even after it was proven that I wasn't the one who made the stupid video. They still use that phrase in emails, they tried sending the police after me a few times for unrelated incidences.

Anyways, The City has a couple of these guys keeping tabs on me and my dog whenever I leave the apartment.

Engen killed Missoula and doesn't give a fuck about any of the locals or problems he's caused. And now Gwen Jones, a lady who will do anything to sabotage people, is going to be put in change when fat old drunk Engen kicks the bucket.

You better be ready for even more bullshit 

And incoming shills and psycophants... *Sigh* and they're always the same.

*Edit* Christ Almighty, the same people keep downvoting me as if that will cover up all the horrendous shit the city officials have been doing. How is it, that my town became this way? Who are these cowards covering this up? What is going on here?

I mean.. like.. I've got an international reputation for telling the truth and when I point something out here, when I tell people what's actually happening to me to let people know what exactly their tax money is being used to do (silence an international renowned whistleblower who walks free because I haven't done anything illegal or even morally wrong.)

You'd think that after 10 years of dealing with fellow man's bullshit, I'd get used to it. But I just keep running into more and more stupid fucking people who just can't do anything right to save their fucking souls. And who are these people? Christians. Republicans and Democrats. People who can't live up to any moral code. Hypocrites, cowards.

How many hundreds of thousands of dollars do you think has been spent to make my life miserable? Because I can tell you that it's a lot and for some God awful reason either my fellow citizens think I deserve it or they just criticize the fuck out of me from their armchairs.

"Check out this peer reviewed examination of the effects of rent control and the repeal of it in the Boston, Massachusetts area.

It is fairly impartial and just analyzes the numbers. ""Rent control decreases the quantity of rental units supplied, as well as rent and unit maintenance. It also lengthens renter stays.""
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119006000635

This would further exacerbate the supply shortage in the area and stifle Missoula's economic growth potential for the future. It would make Missoula unaffordable for the next generation and entrench the existing renters while their rentals deteriorated due to lack of incentive for maintenance.

I looked pretty hard for articles with hard numbers to support your stance but couldn't find anything authoritative.
