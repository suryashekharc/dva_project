">By being so upset about the fact that her child might not be straight that she talked her friend into going before the school board to argue that the club should not exist. How are you missing that?

That is one explanation for what happened, but just because it confirms your bias doesn't mean it's accurate. I don't see this as an LGBTQ+ issue alone. Sexuality can be confusing for teens even without obfuscating things. Would you agree that it's not always the right time to discuss sexuality with a preteen? Sure, they'll learn a lot talking to friends at school, but to me this is just a parent retaining their right to introduce sexuality to their kids. The mom was blindsided by this school club; I can understand why that might be frustrating

I'm sure you could write compelling novels based on things that you imagine *really* happened. I don't think there was grooming going on, and neither seemingly did the mom. But I can understand why she wouldn't want school administration approaching her child and personally inviting them to a club that they felt they were *perfect* for, only to find out later that it's about discussing sexuality.

">In what way is the club grooming?

I don't think the club is grooming, but I would defend a parents right to challenge a school organization when it's not operating as it said it would.

Just how much vacillation there is in this post on how this mother is ""under"" parenting or ""over"" parenting shows that it's difficult to know what to do in this situation as a parent. I think most of the vitriol on this post is just because the parent's intent could be interpreted as being anti-LGBTQ+, despite what she actually said and did.

By being so upset about the fact that her child might not be straight that she talked her friend into going before the school board to argue that the club should not exist. How are you missing that?

1. The child likely knew the teacher was involved in the club
2. The child likely talked with the teacher about what they're going through
3. The teacher said they'd be perfect for the club

Who can I contact? It is illegal to allow a dog to ‚Äúrun at large‚Äù, howl, or create an unpleasant odor in the neighborhood. To report a violation, you should contact the Animal Control Division of Midland County at 989-832-6856. After regular business hours, you can call 911.

"Spectrum is most likely your best bet, given that no providers in Midland offer fiber to the home at this time. I run a telecom services business and can sell Spectrum Business 200mbit internet with phone service included for $69.98/mo, no contract and no hidden fees. Their business class service includes higher quality equipment and better support than residential.

Spectrum Business would bill you and you'd pay them directly. I can put together custom bundles with faster speeds, TV service, etc.

For businesses or IT workers who work from home and are interested in dedicated fiber internet, I also sell enterprise-grade fiber services through Spectrum, Everstream, Windstream, and AT&T among others. All of them have fiber in various parts of Midland (especially downtown, near Eastman Rd, and near Dow locations). Dedicated fiber is quite costly at $500 or more per month, though.

I used to live in Midland up until last year, but I live in Flint now. I've helped several small businesses in Midland and a few redditors find the best internet, telephone, and telecom solutions for their needs.

For psychiatry, there's always MidMichigan physicians group psychiatry in the hospital complex, but I didn't have a good experience with them. If you have a borderline pd diagnosis stay away.

"My family and I like it here.  We live pretty much right in the middle of town and it's mostly a quiet neighborhood.  Downtown has started closing Main street for the summer and they setup games, live music, events, etc.  That might be a nice ""social space"" to meet folks.  The flood is considered a 500 year flood.  So the chance of seeing something like that again is pretty slim.  Sure we get floods, but the town was built in a river valley so you kinda expect some every year.  Most of the town has recovered though. The folks with their homes flooded are the worst.  Also, Sanford was much worse off.  As far as housing I can only speak to what we have.  $125k for our 4 bed, 2.5 bath in 2013.

"Indian food: Cinnamon on Wackerly. It's my favorite restaurant in town.

Sushi: Maru is good, a lot of people like it, but I prefer Fuji Sushi near the mall.

Basil Thai bistro is also good as others have mentioned.

Witchcraft had a good menu, but slimmed it down quite a bit, their wraps are good though. If you're looking for a place to have some drinks and a bite to eat, they're a good option. Maybe look at their menu online first to see if the food is appealing to you.

Coffee: Espresso Milano, they've been around forever, and for a reason, good coffee, good atmosphere, fun to get a drink and walk around downtown, checkout the Tridge.

Breakfast: M's cafe is one of the only breakfast places in town, nothing fancy but good food. Has your breakfast staples.

"Bay City is about 30 minutes away and it has a better night life. As far as meeting new people though you would probably have better luck on something like bumble. Because of Dow Chemical, there are a lot of young engineers/scientists that get brought in to Midland right out of college. Most of us have met through work, but a lot of people meet on bumble friends just to kinda broaden horizons.

 Floods don't happen often at least not like last year. That was because two dams broke in quick succession.

"Hey, recent college grad here! I‚Äôve lived and worked in Midland with family for a few years now, and I‚Äôve come to really enjoy Midland! Downtown is quite beautiful, and there‚Äôs no shortage of good restaurants to try and parks to explore. The flood did do quite a bit of damage unfortunately, a lot of which is still being cleaned up here and there. My house, as were most of the houses in my neighborhood, was completely soaked, but most everyone has rebuilt what they lost. Significant damage was done to our library, which is a bigger loss to some than others, and it still has not resumed full operations. Housing (specifically rentals) is definitely much cheaper here, but may be somewhat hard to find considering there are a lot of Northwood students in Midland. Northwood is a smaller school, so Midland isn‚Äôt a typical ‚Äúcollege town,‚Äù but there are enough students in town that you‚Äôll know it when you go out and about. 

There‚Äôs not much nightlife since most of the population is aging, with many people being Dow higher-ups and retirees. However, downtown is usually very busy in the summer. There‚Äôs often live music on Saturday evenings, and there‚Äôs a three-day event in late summer called Riverdays that brings in live music, food vendors, craft tents, and best of all, hot air balloons. Northwood University also puts on an annual student-led auto show in the fall that showcases vehicles of all types and origins. 

There are plenty of jobs in Midland, and there‚Äôs plenty to do to keep you occupied if you look hard enough. Hopefully it works out for you!",t2_e1nfh493,memesnstuffs,0,1633953379.0,0,t1_hg7vw8m,hg7vw8m,True,NoelleMcKenzie,t3_q5oyc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/midland_mi/comments/q5oyc0/from_oregon_to_michigan/,From Oregon to Michigan,/r/midland_mi/comments/q5oyc0/from_oregon_to_michigan/hg7vw8m/,3,r/midland_mi,0,3
"I'm going to be a bit of a contrarian here, but it is my genuine opinion...

**Great places**

* Cafe Zinc (attached to a hotel, but very good food)
* Idli Dosa (Indian)
* Gratzi (Italian)
* Mancinos (""grinders""/subs)
* Maru (sushi)
* Maple Creek grill (farm to table American fare. 10 minutes out of town, but worth a trip)

**Good**

* Rancheritos (Mexican)
* Crepes et amis (crepes)
* Zitoon (Mediterranean. in the Midland mall food court. Weird I know)
* Cinnamon (Indian)

**So bad I genuinely don't understand how they're in business**

* Thai basil (Thai. 4/10 on a good day)
* Bone daddy's (bbq. Dog food)
* Elvira's (admittedly Ive only tried them once)

I'll add more if I think of them. I grew up in the Thai community I'm Texas, so I'm perhaps more harsh on Mexican and Thai food than the average person.

"Hey, I've lived here on and off since 1985 So i think I can speak with some authority. 1. Some of the worst drivers I have run across and I was a truck driver and have driven through about 45 states. Having said that this is a super safe town and very friendly. Neighbors, depending on where you live I guess have always been great to me. I didn't love it here when I was in my young 20's around 2000 era because there really was no night life, and not a ton in terms of culture. Like you won't find a decent Lebanese restaurant. As more of an adult though I kind of like it here. I think there are plenty of employment opportunities and decent local colleges. A benefit to Midland is that you're fairly close to Bay City and Saginaw which both provide access to things that maybe lacking in Midland. 

Major bicycle town and plenty of bike lanes, the size of the town isn't huge and often I can ride my bike around the whole place in a couple of hours depending on where I ride. The Tridge area and parks in downtown promote a lot of outdoor activity, there is a frisbee golf course or at least there was probably 10 years ago or so I haven't recently checked honestly. Also a very dog friendly community. Also as far as tattoos go I would recommend Electric Chair tattoo in Bay City and See Josh Gerics. 

As far as where to go to meet people I'm somewhat at a loss. My experience living in Michigan is that the whole state is kind of a ""mind your own business"" type of place and maybe that's changing. I'm saying this having lived in So Cal, Virginia, Florida, NC. Other states have seemed much more friendly than Michigan.  Though it's not like people are ""rude"" particularly but its just like a different attitude around here. That said your milage may vary on that item. 

The Flood; appeared to really effect housing on the west side of Midland more than anywhere else but I was living 30 minutes away when it happened so I really couldn't speak to being here at the time. That said you wouldn't really know anything happened in Midland proper, its the local small town of Sanford that suffered the most I believe. On a plus side it will likely take 10 years depending on who you ask for the lake that was drained to regain its water so I'd say it's unlikely for anything like that to happen again. If you have any other specific questions just ask. There are roughly 80K people in this town and its all held in a relatively small space, so if you have a town with a comparable population it should give you an idea of the size here.",t2_4wkdljol,Mediocre-Enthusiasm,0,1633946368.0,0,t1_hg7mwq4,hg7mwq4,True,NoelleMcKenzie,t3_q5oyc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/midland_mi/comments/q5oyc0/from_oregon_to_michigan/,From Oregon to Michigan,/r/midland_mi/comments/q5oyc0/from_oregon_to_michigan/hg7mwq4/,6,r/midland_mi,0,6

"Egyptian Koshery in the Eastlawn Plaza.  So delicious, husband and wife owners are lovely people.

M's Diner has best breakfast imo.  Kind of hidden behind the SoS office on Eastman and little signage.  Hidden gem.

Rancheritos on Main St. is best semi-authentic Mexican in town, but if you want some really good Mexican then check out Elvira's on Saginaw heading west towards Sanford.  Easy to miss small white brick building.

Some thoughts on others' suggestions:

-Boulevard Lounge is good lunch IF you don't mind bar food.  Not knocking it, I eat there often, but the only thing that makes them unique from other bars/taverns is the portions (big).

-Mancino's isn't bad (I eat there semi-often), but it's not the best pizza in town.  For that I'd recommend Pizza Baker on Main (wood fire oven pizzas).  Pizza Sam's, also on Main, is pretty good, too.  Mancino's does have some more options than the other two, though, and I think the only one of the three to offer calzones.

-Cannot recommend Basil enough if you like Thai/Thai fusion.  Little pricey but worth it.

-I'm not big on BBQ but I've had Bone Daddy's several times and was never impressed.  I did try Clarence's Smokehouse on S Saginaw recently and that was really good.

-Only tried Crepes Et Amis a couple times but it was good every time.

-My wife's the sushi eater but I think she'd agree that Maru is the spot in Midland.",t2_6rre9,gungirspear,0,1633921892.0,0,t1_hg6pf68,hg6pf68,True,legainz_,t3_q5jpc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/midland_mi/comments/q5jpc0/will_be_visiting_midland_in_november_for_work/,Will be visiting midland in November for work.

"Where do I look? Who do I ask? Seeing if there any clubs or activities in the hours I can get a ride would be cool. I don't know anyone besides my neighbor still and we've only sit down and talked a couple times. I was kinda in my feels a few days ago when all my neighbors were having a big party n she didn't say anything üò≠üò≠ I told her I would have came over and introduced myself to everyone cause it sounded like everyone was having Hella fun - I texted her after the fact cause I didn't even know she was involved in said party and I was like ""someone must've been having a party or something cause every time I'd cut the mower I'd hear people"" 

When I went downtown a couple people said they liked my dress or hair but I received more mean looks from (mostly) old people than anything. Not at the park but when I went to the little boho-chic arts district style type part of downtown. (I went to get ice cream. I was amazed how cheap a cup that big was. It was awesome!!! I brought $17 for ice cream cause I'm used to how downtown is where I'm from and I only needed $4, but I was so hypeüòä) When people stare at me my therapist has taught me to stare directly back. This woman with kids was starting to stank eye me when I sat down and was eating my ice cream and typing on my phone. Whenever I'd glance up this woman was staring at me. So I took my attention away from my phone and ice cream and stared her straight back, she whispered to her husband and they left. 

Idk what it is. My hair, my facial piercings, the way I carry myself, the way I talk/my voice.
Cause you guys all have like, this accent here. Idk how to describe it, but almost everyone I've spoken to talks like that. Idk if it really counts as accent. Maybe a way of speaking? Kinda like how people from Boston talk a certain way. But everyone's voice sounds like that, and then there's my voice, I have like, that slow relaxed chill west coast voice (that's how an old friend of mine from the south described the way we talked in Vegas)

Sorry. I'm rambling. I ramble so much cause I don't got anyone to talk to. Esp not here. Even back home, I'd always be able to walk up to the gas station by my house and talk to someone and play a couple bucks one of the slot machines. I knew all the people who worked there at all times. Here, it feels like I go so long sometimes without using my voice. And then when I talk it's usually to a pet or for work. 

I called that number earlier and they said they kept asking me for my address and I kept questioning why they needed my address here when my legal address on my i.d. is in Nevada. I started with my Nevada address and she asked me the county and said she just needs to know the county to make sure they have services, so I said Midland county and idk why she needed more than that. It weirded me out. Idk any place that would ask for your address on the first call for an appointment or even assessment. But I gave it to her and then hid cause I was scared she was gonna send people to L2K me. Then I discovered that it wasn't assessment paperwork and that it was a live assessment on camera. My hair was in a sloppy bun and I had been crying so my face was red, and hadn't been awake very long, hadn't done my makeup, the cutoff was 3 tho. So I just have to do it after work in the morning ig.

"I'll have to look into that. I didn't even know that was a thing. All I knew was Uber and lyft. And where I'm from Uber would go in and out of the city to a few tiny places near the valley cause they made bank doing it. With the Uber I just really needed to go to the ER cause I have physical problems and back home I'd always just take an Uber and bring a bag God forbid I were to get sick and the driver couldn't pull to the shoulder. 
I was sick af, I have been, and I keep tryna fight it myself cause it took FOREVER to get in with a PCP for some reason. I have a ride to that appointment on the 5th. But I had to schedule it Hella far out. 
I thought it had been bad enough that night to need to go to the hospital cause my BP was high and I had a fever and I was getting Hella sick but I got back to feeling sick-but-normal in a few days. I won't resort to hospital unless it's a legit emergency. 
My PCP back home told me to deal with stuff when I got here and I've been like, trying.

The Uber situation sucks in general. Not only for medical appointments but now until I get a car in the spring, I'm literally stuck at/around this property most the time. I'd walk somewhere but there's literally nowhere to walk to. Nothing. When I go on night time walks I have to bring 2 lanterns and a flashlight cause it's so dark, no streetlights. There's no sidewalks either which is the weirdest thing.

On my first night time walk there was an oncoming car, the Vegas instinct in my head told me to immediately kill any light on me so I wouldn't be seen and robbed or worse. But then I remembered I was walking on a pitch black country road and I don't want to get merked by a car so I switched the latern back on. There aren't many cars when I usually go on my walks during break from work or just those hours, but when it's been nothing for a while and then there's one lone one my city brain tells me ""turn off the light"" ugh

I've only really walked around downtown once so far cause it's a transport issue. Uber and lyft just don't come so I can only go out if I have a ride. I buy literally everything but food off Amazon cause I barely ever even get to go to the store. It just sucks. I work from home and my schooling is online so not much chance for meeting people. 

My therapist keeps telling me I'll adjust to being here but it feels like it keeps getting worse. I'll have a good day or maybe even a few good hours but it always seems to be getting worse. I still have the hope of it getting better. I hope it's just home sickness. But it's homesickness for a place ig.

"Thank you. I'll step out and call them now cause my Nevada providers are just taking my money and not helping me.... I'm paying $100 every ""appointment"" for the Nevada MD now. Before my doctor couldn't do anything I kept telling him I don't want to be a statistic. The last appointment I was walking down the road. There's not sidewalks. And he just wouldn't hear me out when I paid $100 just to get him to hear me. So I told him I was gonna merk myself on that road, he didn't care. But the person in the car thought I was tryna cross and stopped. Idk what I would even be crossing to SINCE THERES NOTHING HERE. But they still stopped, my doctor told me to go home and said goodbye forever and the MD would call me soon. And then I started ugly crying and didn't want anyone to see so then I just went back home. It was Hella cold and rainy that day. The MD called and kept laughing at what I was saying (literally laughing at me) and I already brought to my providers concern that the MD does not like me. He kept reminding me how great home was and every time he would say another great thing about my home city i would break down and cry more. I was asking for help and told him I'm deteriorating out here and he literally laughed at me.

"If you haven't discovered it yet, please try the ""Eqyptian Koshery"" in Eastlawn Plaza.  It's owned/operated by a local couple who started down at the Farmer's Market a couple years ago and have since transitioned into a brick and mortar shop.

The food is so...damn...good.  It's also vegetarian.  I'm not vegetarian or any permutation thereof, but I love their food and it helps me not feel quite so piggish after gorging myself.

Highly recommend the koshery (don't forget the garlic sauce), samosas, and baklava.

Strive to support local business and any non-franchise owned shops whenever possible, especially restaurants since there's so few in town.  These guys definitely deserve your patronage.

"There are lots of restaurants outside of Midland in Saginaw,l and Bay City , and Mt Pleasant (all about 30-40  min away).    Lansing has lots more at 90 minutes.   Big college town (East Lansing).   Much within 2 hrs.   But I think most people don't road trip to eat.    There is good BBQ acceptable to Texans (Bone Daddy's).  One Brazilian BBQ in Bay City.   

There are lots of outdoor activities north of here.     Some skiing if you are not expecting Rocky Mountain sized runs.     Lots of camping (tents to land cruisers).

The Center for the Arts pulls in a variety of things you might not expect in for a small town.   But for most contemporary entertainment you will need to travel.   The Soaring Eagle Casino 39 minutes away has some.  https://www.soaringeaglecasino.com/shows.html

Day to day living though is pretty good.   Midland City provides lots of services you might not expect  (eg free big item pickup at your curb once a month).

"The mall is doing better than the malls I grew up with downstate but it has still lost a lot of stores. I think the closest outlets are the Birch Run outlets about a half hour away.

There aren't any 'bad' parts of town. There's some low income housing in a couple parts but crime is very low here. A lot of Dow employees live in Sanford just north of Midland because of the lake, however, a year ago, the dams broke so the lake was emptied and they're not due to be fully repaired for 5 or so years.

There's some brand new townhouses right near downtown that look really nice called Pathfinder Commons.

"Thank you very much for taking your time to reply, I really appreciate it. 

Do people that work at Dow tend to live in the same neighborhood and send their kids to the same schools? That might not be perfect but it could at least be something regarding exposing my daughter to other cultures while she's still very young. We do travel a lot since we have family in Brazil and in Europe and good friends in Asia as well so we can try to make up to the lack of diversity by spending longer periods abroad. I'm a bit concerned about bullying at school or that she might learn a few unpleased behaviors from the lack of daily contact to different people. ( And I'm sorry if it's a bit hard to understand what I'm trying to say, sometimes it's difficult to express what I really mean when English is not my primary language).

I've already made peace with the fact that I won't be able to eat out as often as I would like and am willing to drive to Chicago a few time to get something different. Which local restaurants do you suggest and truly like?

Regardless Michigan being a blue state I was not surprised by the fact that Midland is a republican town. Personally, we are a liberal family but we tend to mind our own business and won't get into political conversations or arguments with people. But I will be lying if I said I'm not satisfied with the idea of a new Lockdown. Things here in Texas are out of hand and we worry about our daughter's health, so I'm ok with the government taking care of people. 

About the housing market, we are definitely looking into buying. We'll probably rent for a few months before deciding where to buy but it won't take long. Do you have suggestions on where we should look for houses? Should we consider living at another city's suburbs? Are there townhomes or apartments we could rent online while we search for something to buy? Also,  are there any nice builders in the town with developments in a good area?

I'm glad to hear we can hire people to shovel the snow for us. This is something we will definitely budget for. 

Your plan about moving to a bigger city later on sounds great. I love the idea of growing in a small and safe community but I think it's equally important for our kids to learn and experience the rest of the world.

> * I'm aware that the winter is brutal and honestly, I have no idea of how hard it will be for us. What do people do? Do you go on with your normal lives when it snows? Houston closes down if it rains a bit harder or if the temperature goes below 50 hahaha. What should I do with my home? Are there any special precautions for the winter that we should be aware of?

There will be snow on the ground from December through March, plus or minus a month on each end. You should expect it to be below 50 from November to April. It rarely gets below 0 F, but there's often several days where it's in single digits. Midland is relatively sheltered from lake effect snow. The west side of the state will get snow in feet and we get it in inches. We average less than 4 feet of snow, which sounds like a lot but spread out over the season it's more like 8-10 snowfalls of 3-8 inches. You'll want a couple snow shovels at least, and probably a snow blower if you stick around. You'll also need a brush and a window scraper for every vehicle. Remote start is a godsend. You definitely want to keep your cars in a garage, too, or you'll be scraping the windows and clearing snow.

You're going to be outside shoveling or clearing snow, and probably outside with your child having fun in the snow. You will want:

* Winter coats that are water resistant like a ski parka. Snow often melts when it lands on you. That apparently confuses some new people.
* A touque to keep your head and ears warm
* A scarf to wear under your coat
* Gloves or mittens
* Boots are nice, but only necessary if you're working in or walking through deep snow.

You may want snow pants (insulated pants) for your daughter if she likes to play in the snow.

When you have to shovel snow, it's best to do it when it's fresh. It gets heavier and more packed down the longer it's on the ground, and shoveling snow is back-breaking work. Remember to clear the sidewalks, too.

Remember when driving on snow that you can get up to speed without much difficult, but stopping distance doubles, triples, or more. It takes practice and experience to drive on snow, but it's not that difficult and when the roads are correctly cleared and salted (usually within 24 hours) it will not be a problem. Beware that you will not always see ice! *Go slow*, drive very conservatively, and try to feel how well your tires are working. You'll learn to tell when they're spinning or skidding. There will always be idiots who drive the normal speed limit. Ignore them and be safe. Remember to turn *out* of a skid (against it) and that ABS breaks allow you to keep control but in exchange require even longer stopping distance. If you've never experienced ABS, you'll know it when the brake pedal starts vibrating.

School will be cancelled for a day or two when the roads are dangerous for bus travel in the rural areas, but otherwise... the expectation is that you report to work. It's okay to be a little late if you need to dig yourself out, but we have snow for 5-6 months. We can't just sit at home because it's cold and snowy. In the 40 years I've lived here, I remember them closing the chemical plant maybe 3 times due to snow or cold weather.

The latest I ever remember getting snow was mid-June. It was just a dusting and it melted an hour later, but it was definitely snow in June and we all agreed that it was wholly inappropriate.

Oh, if you get a two-story house, open the vents on the ground floor during winter (closing most of them upstairs), and open them upstairs in summer. Heat rises, cold sinks. People in Arizona didn't know you had to do that.

Probably. I grew up in town here and one of my best friends was Ecuadorian.

"> * How do people there deal with foreigners (specially non Americans/non european)? I look eastern European and my husband was told here he looks indian or Arab. Our baby is a mix and we are worried about people treating us differently because of that. Are there a lot of foreigners because of the Dow hq?

There are a fair number of foreigners here due to Dow, yes. Lots of Indian and Chinese immigrants. However, overall I would describe Midland as white and conservative. Midland is so white that you could drive past it in the winter and not realize it was there.

As a rule, people are *not* rude (at least not in public) but by and large they watch more Fox News than CNN. There are still Trump flags up, though fewer as time goes on. Freeland, Bay City and Saginaw are more liberal than Midland -- they have a background of union labor for the auto industry. Mt. Pleasant is very liberal because it's a college town, but that's quite a ways away.

> * How is the restaurant/bar scene? Is it easy to find international cuisine nearby? Also, are there any asian and latin grocery stores?

I lived in Tucson a couple years before moving back to Midland. You will not find anything like the Tex-Mex you're used to. It sucks and I'm sorry. I miss it, too.

There are not really any good specialty markets. There are big box stores with some selection, but if you want quality specialty items you may be ordering them online. People living here are the descendants of people raised on recipes out of Good Housekeeping. I believe there are some specialty markets in Bay City and Saginaw, but I don't know of any that are in Midland.

Another way to look at it: If you go north of Midland, a small city of 50,000, there are no towns larger than Midland. In that sense, it is the edge of civilization. There are fewer trucks bringing the benefits of civilization here.

Bar scene was alright when I was going to them 20 years ago, although Bay City and Saginaw always had a better scene. The bars... exist. They're fine. Nobody really goes to bars outside of their 20s.

Restaurants are okay. It's a town of 50,000 people in the midwest where you have to drive over an hour to get to a significantly larger town. Temper your expectations; even the good stuff is very Americanized. The Egyptian Koshery downtown is decent, and I'm a fan of Idli Dosa (Indian food) north by the mall. Midland Brewing Company is good, too, but it's what you'd expect from a brewery. Genji's (Japanese steakhouse and general asian) is also good, but expensive. The same family also runs Pi's Asian Express which is good takeout, and Pi's Chinese which I used to eat lunch at but haven't since COVID. The Log Cabin in Freeland serves excellent steak.

If you want good wine or beer: 
Eastman Party Store  
Oppermann's Cork 'N' Ale (under new management I think because it's been renamed, but it used to be where to go)  

Otherwise:  
LaLonde's Market has good meat, but they run a bit expensive  
Meijer is a regional equivalent of Walmart but generally better. Go there first.  
Jack's seems to be very hit-or-miss with people. You either like their food a lot or not at all.  
Kroger is... Kroger. You will understand how long it's been there when you see the parking lot.  

We did just get a Costco in town, so that's the new hotness.

> * Is it better to live in Midland or should we look at neighbor towns for more diversity and things to do? We are used to 40-60 min commutes since we live in the Houston suburbs and before that we had to deal with the traffic from Rio de Janeiro.

I would live in Midland. It's pretty boring, but it's a very good place to raise a child. It's so safe it's insular.

I drive halfway across town to work. It's a 10 minute commute if I hit all the lights. I used to drive all the way across town. It took 15 minutes no matter which route I took.

> * We are looking to rent for a few months while we look for a house to buy. Our budget is around 400-500k for a 4 bedroom home and around 1800 to rent a 2 to 3 bedroom place that accepts large dogs (70lbs Aussie). Which areas should we look into? We would prefer an area with great schools, that is safe and has newer or recently remodeled homes with fenced yards.

The only place I would avoid is the City of Saginaw (Saginaw Township is okay). It's the most economically depressed area by far. That would be quite a drive, and no realtor would take you there.

Midland as a whole is very safe and very low crime. If you're looking at a map of Midland, the city limits on the east stop at the county line. That's basically the fork where US-10 splits into US-10 going north around town and business 10 going downtown.

So, you'll want to look at [the 2020 flood map](https://www.newsweek.com/michigan-flooding-midland-county-evacuations-map-dam-breaches-1505525?utm=newsbreak) from when the Edenville dam failed. That's was called a 500 year flood level, but homes closer to the river were absolutely damaged. South of the river more so because it's lower.

Getting north and south of the highway is a little obnoxious. Getting north and south of the river is even more obnoxious, IMO.

It's currently a seller's market, but rent is atrocious.

Here's the back-of-the-napkin history:

The city started as the part that goes diagonally northwest to southeast by downtown and Main Street. The city grew northeast from there. The old rich district is west of Eastman, north of Main St, and south of Saginaw Rd. That's why Midland Country Club is where it is. The ""circle"" where Saginaw Rd, Ashman, and Jefferson meet, was built in the 1930s or 1940s and it was the edge of town when it was built. Then US-10 was changed from Saginaw Rd (some people still call it Old US-10 when you get west of town) to the route around the north of town that you see today. 

The town expanded north from the circle, and they changed the road orientation from following the river to north-south. This, and some odd road orientation with the circle, means new drivers find Midland confusing and like it has a lot of one-way roads. The main roads to try to keep track of are Eastman, Saginaw, and Ashman/Rodd (paired one-way roads). Those are the major roads in town.

Everything north of Saginaw Road, north of business 10, south of US-10, and east of Dublin Ave, roughly, is what was built from the 50s to the 90s. It's all a pretty standard range of middle class home.

In the late 90s, the Midland Mall north of US-10 was built (the old mall was a 10 shop building with no anchors that now serves as the city police station behind Kroger). Since then, development has continued north. The city can't spread east because that goes into Bay County. The city cant spread west because that runs into Sanford (and Averill). The city won't go south because the river is a bit inconvenient. So everything new is going north.

> * About medical care.. I have to see a neurologist and a neuro ophthalmologist regularly for a rare condition that I have, will I be able to find good care in Midland or will I have to go somewhere else? If so, where?

It varies. There's not a lot of selection here, and it seems like a lot of doctors don't want to stay around the area anymore. I've had trouble keeping a GP.

Around here if people want a real second opinion or a high quality specialist, they go down to the U of M medical center in Ann Arbor. There's nothing wrong with the healthcare in Midland or Saginaw, or what have you. But the best in the field in Michigan tend to congregate in Ann Arbor. It's about a 90 minute drive, so it's not too terrible.

> * Any recommendations on daycares that follow a Montessori or a Finnish model of education?

There is a Montessori school in Midland:  
http://www.midlandmontessori.com/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Montessori_School

I work for Midland Public Schools, so I don't have any experience with them other than occasionally getting transfer students. As far as school districts, Midland Public Schools is the best funded and largest district in the county. It does well in the state and nationally.

In general for Midland Public elementary:

* Woodcrest (Jefferson Middle, Dow High) and Chestnut Hill (Northeast Middle, Midland High) seem to be where new people are always told where to send students.
* Siebert and Adams are pretty well split. They have large attendance areas.
* Plymouth is one of the oldest buildings now, unsurprising because it's an older part of town.
* Central Park is a STEM initiative school that was just build a few years ago, but it is a Title I school if that's important to you. The next newest building is older than I am, however. Midland has had a pretty stable population since the late 60s. It's growing north of town somewhat because people tend to avoid the older homes that are closer to downtown.

Here's the US News site for our district:

https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/michigan/districts/midland-public-schools-107179

There is a developmental Kindergarten program for young 5s (publicly funded), as well as a 3 year old and 4 year old preschool (tuition-based), although space is very limited.

Other school districts in the area are [Meridian Public Schools](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/michigan/districts/meridian-public-schools-108947) (Sanford area) and [Bullock Creek](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/michigan/districts/bullock-creek-school-district-104968) (south of the river).

I love Mediterranean food so it's great to know there will be a good place nearby. How is the Midland mall btw? Do you have any outlets in the city or close to it?

I think housing prices are going up everywhere. Houston market is crazy at the moment and it's an amazing time to sell. Our house value went up almost a 100k in the past 3 years. It's totally out of control. Do you have any recommendations on neighborhoods or builders in the area that we should look at or that we should avoid? Also, we will need to rent for a while, do you have townhomes at apartments that I could look up online? I'm not having any luck trying to search by myself.

"Hey! Thank you for your answers. So, did you ended up returning to Midland or did you keep your promise?

Funny you mentioned that Midland feels like a suburb without a big city nearby because that's exactly what I said to my husband after researching a little about the town. We were actually thinking that Lansing would be the ""big"" town closest to it and that everyone would go there when looking for something different to do but I haven't seen Lansing being mentioned anywhere here, so I guess we were totally wrong. 

We're not outdoor people but I guess we'll have to start enjoying being out. I think it helps when it's not 100 degrees outside. My husband actually plays football twice a week here (the original one, not the one you guys invented hahahha). He was VERY excited when you mentioned the soccer club. Also, isn't the country club a things for fancy people? I always had this idea of country clubs... We are not fancy people at all. 

Are there specific areas you suggest we look for when buying? Do you know of any builders that are building in one of those areas?

I'm glad that there will be a lot of things for our daughter to do. It will be fun for her to grow up in a small community and to be able to experience the outdoors more often. 

I'm hoping to meet some other Brazilians in the area. We have a lot of friends here and will definitely miss having people at our house all the time.

"Thank you for taking the time to answer some of my questions. I really appreciate it. 

I've read that people in smaller and majority white cities can be a bit racist and unwelcoming to non Americans so that's a real concern to us. I'm as white as it gets but have dark hair and don't look American at all. My husband is a bit darker and to some he can look like he's from India. We will probably be fine but I'm concerned about my daughter growing up. She's white as well but I would like for her to grow up in a place that welcomes and respect others regardless of their color or social background and to have contact with people from different races and cultures. 

As for the food and bars, we can always drive to Chicago for the weekend if we really crave something specific. We love travelling by car and are really used to drive a lot because everything is so far away in Texas. Also, how easy is it to drive to Toronto? We have good friends living there and would probably go there every other month if it's an easy drive. 

I'll definitely check the Saginaw township suggestion, sound like a good fit for us. How about Lansing? Is it a big city with a lot of things to do? Is it possible to live at one of Lansing suburbs and drive to Midland?

The university of Michigan hospital sounds like a good fit for me. I'll probably try to establish care there as soon as I arrive. 

I'm excited about the snow since we don't get a lot of it over here but also terrified of having to deal with it for more than one month.

"Hi! Thank you for your answers! 

I've heard nice (and bad) things about Detroit. Things seems to be getting a bit better over there, right? It will be nice to visit and try different foods over there. 

As for our looks, I don't really stand out since I'm as white as it gets but my husband is a bit darker so it's good to know that people will be welcoming regardless. 

As for bars and eating out, I se people mentioning Detroit, Ann arbor and the other two cities nearby but they don't talk about Lansing. How is it though? Is it a nice city? We even considered moving to a Lansing suburb since it seems to be a much bigger city but now I'm not sure. 

I'm still trying to get my head around going out and living my normal life with snow. I hope I'm fit to the challenge.

"Native Midlander here who moved away for college vowing never to return. Well .. 

Basically, consider Midland as an nice suburb but without the city nearby. There are a few upscale neighborhoods outside of town, but I'd suggest staying in the city limits. It gets very rural outside of town.  People are very friendly. You should make plenty of friends with your neighborhood, work, a plethora of kid activities, etc.  There's a ton of great activities in town ... Sometimes the hard part is knowing they exist. Tennis, socc ... er, football, art, on and on. (Tip: check out the Midland Soccer Club. Adult teams LOVE new Brazilians and there are kid leagues down to under 6. Great way to meet people, coach a kids team.)  Try new things. Ask people about their interests. It's nearly all here. Oh, except much of a nightlife. The shopping too ... TG for Amazon. Consider joining the Country Club. It's quite reasonable. Decent restaurant and bar. 

With your price range, you can buy most any home in town. The general rule is $100-125 per SQ ft. Your price range puts you in the nicest neighborhoods. There are beautiful homes in town; Midland is renown for Mid century Modern/organic design. We even built an app for it. (Mid century modern Midland). There's plenty of other stuff too.

Schools are generally excellent; some folks who work in neighboring cities reside in Midland for the schools and ease of life.  Lots of parks, concerts, again, tons of activities for kids. Short commutes. There are 2 Montessori preschools in town.

I have had several friends from Brazil ... I believe there is an informal community here. And each has suffered mightily with their first winter. Here's a tip: don't try to dress with style for your first winter. Good warm winter clothing may be ugly, but don't fret that. Forget the leather coat and the stylish boots. Warmth over style. Get a pair of pak boots for everyone, a big puffy down coat, mittens (not gloves) ... And another tip: try to find a cold weather activity. Then you won't curse the winter.  The curling club is top level and they have classes for beginners.",t2_2w56qnc8,LooseACL,0,1628259110.0,0,t1_h7xqtp4,h7xqtp4,True,feelin_hot_hot_h0t,t3_oyyrih,https://www.reddit.com/r/midland_mi/comments/oyyrih/relocating_from_texas_to_midland/,Relocating from Texas to Midland,/r/midland_mi/comments/oyyrih/relocating_from_texas_to_midland/h7xqtp4/,5,r/midland_mi,0,5
"To give context, I am a married, white ~25M with no kids who has lived in Midland for most of his life. I'll answer what questions of yours I can, but my primary reason for responding is because someone said Midland is ""very diverse"". Midland is somewhere between 90-95% white. People from all over the world do work at Dow of course, but the city is mostly homogenous. I don't think it's an unwelcoming city by any means, but again I'm white and have lived here a long time. I wouldn't want anyone to move to Midland expecting diversity because there isn't much of it.

As for (some of) your other questions:

I can count on two hands (and maybe one foot) the number of good, non chain restaurants in Midland. Most of that is downtown, but there's a few others as well. There are not a lot of bars here at all. Nearby Bay City has plenty of great bars. (And dispensaries if that's your thing) There are a few good international restaurants in Midland, but not many. I can think of ""Basil Thai Bistro"", ""Cinnamon Indian Cuisine"", and ""Egyptian Koshery"" off the top of my head. As for groceries, there is ""Asian Market"" and ""International Foods & Spices"", both right next to each other in Saginaw, about 25 minutes away. 

Speaking of Saginaw, you may want to look into living in Saginaw Township. Saginaw is a much more diverse city than Midland. The township is a much safer area then the city itself. I have worked in Saginaw for four years and drive all over town as a part of my job. Most of the city is fine, but there is some violence and the township is closer to Midland anyway. 

There is a hospital in Midland, but you'd probably have to go (or be better off going) to Covenant hospital in Saginaw for your condition. They have a pretty large facility and I've had mostly positive interactions in the past. If they didn't have what you need, I'm sure the hospital at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor would be as far as you have to go. They are a huge system and very well regarded. 

The winter will surely be a shock coming from Texas and South America but it is not particularly brutal, and will certainly not get in the way of you going about your business most of the time. For most of the winter there is light snow and potential danger of icy roads, and then there's a few storms where we get several inches of snow. Driving in the winter is all about leaving a little earlier, going a little slower, and having a 4WD vehicle (You can do without, but it sounds like you have the budget for it and it's so much better)

"Midland tends to be very diverse. People come from all over to work at Dow. I feel the further you get from Midland to the surrounding towns in Midland County the less diverse it gets but I've never met someone *unwelcoming*.

There is a bit of international food, especially downtown. My favorite 'international' place is Zitoon in the Midland Mall that has Mediterranean food like Kebab and Schwarma.

Mid-Michigan tends to be a low-cost-of-living area. Housing prices in general are pretty high right now but I don't think you'll have any problem finding a nice place with your budget.

Mid Michigan Medical Center is right in town. I don't think you'll have a problem with that.

As for Winters, life continues as normal when it snows unless we get an obscene amount overnight, then they would probably call off school for the day. Homes are all pretty well suited for the climate. A couple homes I've lived in, I had to turn off the outside faucet in the crawl space so it doesn't burst.

"A few things. 

The ‚Äúoval‚Äù I can‚Äôt explain without crossroads. There are various bodies of water in the area. Don‚Äôt feel like sharing that info if you don‚Äôt want to. 

The ‚Äúriver‚Äù is a bit too generic. The Pine and Chippewa come together over there. Then the flow into the Tittabawassee. That flows to the Saginaw River, then out to Saginaw Bay (bay on Lake Huron over in Bay City). There was a lot of pollution back in the day, a lot from Dow. Some from a company upriver in St. Louis that is no longer there. Supposedly a lot has been remediated and it‚Äôs safe. I see people swim in the river confluence at the Tridge. I personally wouldn‚Äôt, but I would kayak or canoe, especially upstream from Dow near Chippewa Nature Center.

I don‚Äôt think it smells by the river that often. It can occasionally (it was bad for a few weeks after the flood last year). But we bike there a lot and it isn‚Äôt smelly.

If you think the river is gross just from looks, I assume you mean the murky brown look. Many rivers in the mid-west look this way. It is because of silt from agricultural run off from all the farming. It‚Äôs literally just fine dirt silt and nothing bad. Just looks funky. Lake Huron north of Saginaw Bay, or Lake Michigan are great if you want crystal clear water and beach. But the bigger the lake, the colder it is.

Bugs won‚Äôt be bringing contamination to your house. We do have mosquitos. That‚Äôs just part of Michigan. The county treats for them though, so it‚Äôs only usually bad after big rains.",t2_1bf0nhn,Onimaru1984,0,1625696722.0,0,t1_h4eoctm,h4eoctm,False,schiz0phrenicpotato,t3_o80fa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/midland_mi/comments/o80fa9/hi_im_moving_here_in_43_more_days_whats_it_like/,Hi I'm moving here in 43 more days.

"The nature center is by my house actually, it might even be walkable to get there but I'm not too sure yet based on just looking at google maps. 

There's also a ""park"" near my house but im confused because it doesn't look like a park and that seems to be the closest thing.

There's no benches or playground and its just this weird above ground empty oval. Idk what it is honestly but it sucks its not a park park. 

And is that river like, safe? One of my concerns is being so close, bugs carrying contamients to my house and stuff. Mosquitoes. And the smell. Someone told me it doesn't smell but I feel that living close to a river is going to stink. And I joined a few FB groups but rn im just lurking, and people say its gross.

"rail trail, tridge, chippewa nature center, city forest, pine haven out in sanford (haven't been since the flood and i'm like 65% convinced i saw a bigfoot there once like 3 years ago lmao) are all great for walkin' around or riding bikes (though i think chip doesn't allow bikes). dow gardens is awesome as is the Whiting Forest just across the street there, you can visit the alden b. dow house & museum just adjacent to the dow gardens for some super nice architecture if you're keen for that. the H Hotel has two nice restaurants (come eat at Cafe Zinc). not one but THREE great bike shops if you're into roadie, mtb or casual pedaling at all. i'm biased to Ray's because i love Brad and Taylor but Kevin over at Tri-City HQ is a homie 100%, just depends on which brands you're into.

As far as safety, it's quite safe in most regards. My biggest worry is keeping my head on a swivel driving downtown because they got those electric rent-a-scooters now. Every town has scumbags and tweekers, but you're unlikely to meet any unless you seek them out. the city police are (in my limited experience) firm-but-fair and professional.

"We have bikes, we don't have scooters like those. The scooters we have are like rascals. (Seated scooters) It was funny cause there was the ""vegas scooter epidemic"" during lockdown because it was so cheap for people to from California to come here, the strip was deserted, everyone was bored so they rented out those rascals and that's where we had the scooter wars of 2020. So many people were doing dumb things with the scooters. They were riding scooters up escalators. So many people got arrested so use of the scooter things are now reserved ONLY for the disabled or elderly. 

People were blocking off Las Vegas blvd with them, people were getting DUIs on them, one dude jumped off one and stabbed another dude. Someone did basically a drive by but.....  *on a scooter*. Escalators actually had to be replaced. The scooter thing was actually one of the biggest things that happened here during lockdown. Now they ruined it for everyone and you have to prove you're disabled to ride one....

"Everyone here who actually cares about the lake doesn't plant unecassary plants or lawns. Thats why theres not a lot of green. All the fountains at the casinos including the famous bellagio is old Grey water found the sands golf course. All the parks are feilds are watered with reclaimed water (cleaned toilet and shower water) as to cut down on water use. Our biggest offender is the university now and the state is trying to fight them because they use fresh water for their grass and they waste so much. 

Having to unlearn being as ""water smart"" as I am will be hard for me. I make sure never to take too long of shower, when I shave my legs water is on off on off. Low release sink foucet for dishes. We learn being water smart in our public schools but sadly many people don't listen and now our lake is the lowest it's ever been and our *great friends* California want to take our water cause they weren't water smart. Not enough people are water smart. They move here with the mentality its okay to cover their huge property in grass and water more than the mandatory watering schedule allows. 
With water safety it is to a point is affects my diagnosed OCD. Because the lake wont sustain for than what, 10, 15 years at the rate its going? Vegas is growing. The bureau of land management sold off so much beautiful land (and sacred land but i wont go there rn) to expand. 
Without water there wont be life. If Lake Mead goes, Las Vegas goes with it. 

We might be going into tighter water restrictions (or should I say they cause im leaving) soon. The lake has gotten so low the historical town of St. Thomas is starting to resurface. 
((Dumb/cool fun fact: there was a town by the hoover dam when they were building it. When it was time for the lake to fill, they just evacuted, *moved* the cemetary to Overton, and flooded out the town. They just left everything. There's a whole town structure (or whats left) under the lake sustains Las Vegas. Historical St. Thomas.))

I have a neighbor, she waters her grass EVERY DAY for like 40 minutes at ones. Even in the winter. I can't stand her because of this. In the winter it's supposed to be one day a week. Most times a year its 3 days a week. As deeply as I care about our lake I dont snitch so wont call water enforcement. That's where a big fear of slipping on ice comes from too. This woman waters her grass in the middle of winter at 3am. And i go on night time walks, it hasn't rained so i normally wouldn't expect ice. I slipped multiple times and learned to walk in the street instead. Theres no snow but its gets cold enough for sprinkler water freeze on the sidewalk.

Sorry see, there i go again talking about water conservation and the lake and stuff. I could be on those ""what subject could you talk about for an hour"" podcasts I swear lol.

Is it snow or even cold like half the year or more? How much is the weather nice? Like how many months is a doable. Oooh i've heard of polar vortex. Gotta wrap your pipes and stuff cause they can explode and what not. ((Or atleast i've heard))

"First and foremost, welcome. I think the main points have been covered rather well by folks so all I'll add prepare for trees. Plants. Vegetation everywhere. One thing that got me when I was in Vegas was the lack of plant life which of course made sense, but was odd to experience. Here at the right time of year you can enjoy a small feast just walking down a farm road. I think our raspberries are particularly choice.   
Second is yes, our winters can be horrible and you will hate them with a passion for the first few years. Especially if we get hit with another polar vortex. Even having lived here most my life, those things are evil. Drifts higher then your car, white out conditions and a temperature that no longer even feels cold, it literally just hurts. Take any and all advice about winter with a certain seriousness because certain conditions can do a lot of damage in a very small amount of time if you're unfortunate enough to be caught in them.

"I don't drive. I just take Uber everywhere. I am going to get my own vehicle when I get out there cause my doctor has approved me to drive. But why would they come down on you? It's not illegal to be outside right? When I get my car I would make sure the meter is paid. They won't impound it just for being there right?
If I'm walking around is it illegal? 

I was going to ask about the marijuana in public thing. I Nevada it's the same. You can only smoke on your own private residence. It can't even be a commercial property you own. If it's not zoned for residential it's technically not allowed. But the cops here are more of ""just put it out"" instead of actually doing anything. But I guess smaller town cops have a qouta to make. They also can't take your weed as long as it's in state regulated dispensary bag. And they are not allowed to take your piece. Pipe, bong, etc. I also have my NV medical marijuana card and will be getting a MI one when I get there. Even though both states are rec I still have a card. 
I don't take very much out with me at a time. Never more than I will be smoking in the time i will be out. But i smoke in the car via pen (as a passanger, don't worry) and if my mom or step dad go in a car I sometimes sit in the car and smoke. 

I've never been caught by cops, even had them walk right past me smoking a j outside Food4Less once before it was legal. I'd bring a whole dab rig and torch to the bus stop with me. The only time ive ever been told to put it out was by a casino employee. They said put it out or leave their outdoor so i just listen and put it out and put it away.

I actually wanted to ask if people smoke in public there though its not allowed. Cause thats the norm here. I think its more of just a culture here that no one cares. If you go to the strip you just smell weed lol. I took a dab in the middle of the hoover dam a few years ago because it was on my bucket list.

So i take it they don't just ""look the other way"" like they do here? I'll make sure i'm careful and only use a pen. But a majority of my smoking will be on my house. But if I go and sit somewhere pretty I would wanna atleast hit the pen. 

It's also better for me to smoke than pain pills. My doctor is 110% pro weed and thinks its very important to my treatment plan because it elimates other medications I would otherwise need.

For employment i'm not worried. Me and my mom are the only ones who use marijuana and we both have a job coming with us online. My dad doesnt smoke so he'll be clean for work.

They had to call in Swat and shut the road down at a point and escort the workers home. I drove by when peopoe were going insane.

"It's in the Lake Mead National Recreation area so it's a federal state park. Its on that land. You have to pay to go to the lake or even on the land. And most of the Colorado river areas too. It's only $10 a day for locals for a pass for everything. So it's not too horrible.

Wait til you hear the people who WORK in the big casinos still have to pay for parking. But they get a discounted rate for working there. Locals don't get free parking even at the place they work. It's honestly kinda messed up. Like it's their job and they pay to park there. It's $40 a month anywhere downtown FOR EMPLOYEES to park their car.

"Road salt unfortunately doesn‚Äôt work that fast. When freezing rain comes around or a ton of snow falls around freezing temperature, the driveway will need to be shoveled off and the road salt will be sprinkled, and can take anywhere from usually 20 minutes to a few hours to work (depends on the thickness of the ice). When it‚Äôs icy, you need to make sure you wear shoes with more traction, converse‚Äôs are way too slippery on their own and would probably cause issues.

Midland is largely flat so slipping from inclines isn‚Äôt too much of an issue. Most, if not all, businesses keep their property salted so no ice is built up, but I‚Äôm not sure about whether the rail trail is salted or not.

"I'll try to answer your follow up questions as best I can.

You're in one of the best places in the entire state for medical care.  The only place better might be Ann Arbor as it's home to University of Michigan and all of its associated medical schools/services.  Midland hospital is actually in the same medical ""network"" as U of M, and the two cooperate to provide care.  Practically this means that if the hospital can't provide some medical need directly they will refer patients to U of M directly.  Regardless, the hospital itself is large, well-funded, modern, and provides a wide range of services.

Don't be too quick to write off Detroit.  It's a very large city and it has a lot to offer.  It's also mostly not as bad as most people think.  It's gone through a bit of a renaissance in the past decade or so, too.  Like any big city it has its rough edges, but there's also a lot of to offer that can't be found anywhere else in the state.

If a personal anecdote helps, I've walked the sidewalks and streets on and around Detroit, including the mythical section of 8-Mile, and felt perfectly safe.  In contrast, I'd be much more hesitant to do the same in most of Flint.

Back to Midland, though, there's a few nice cafes and coffee shops down on Main St. that will be ideal for people watching.  Even better, though, would be to head a block north and find a bench or grassy spot near the Tridge/Farmer's Market/Rail Trail.  Lots of good people watching to be had, especially this time of year.

I hope I didn't mischaracterize Michiganders for you.  ""Cold"" might have been a bit strong, and only true in comparison to other regions.  For example, I just got back from a trip through West Virginia/Kentucky area and wow do they make us look withdrawn in comparison.  Every gas station or restaurant we stopped at I'd witness strangers chatting with each other like old chums or something.

People in this area are generally polite and warm, but they won't go out of their way to initiate a conversation with strangers.  It would probably have been more accurate to say that people around here generally seem to mind their own business moreso than other regions/cultures.  It's regarded as the polite thing to do, to do you and let others do them, whereas the culture in WV I referred to before seemed to be nearly the opposite:  the polite thing to do was to initiate conversation and ask lots of questions, even with strangers.

I imagine the fact that most of the population is locked inside their homes for a third or more of the year probably contributes to that, too.

In regards to weather, expect the unexpected.  It changes frequently and without much warning.  In the past few weeks it's been ~70F at night.  This past week or so we've been tickling 40F.  You can rely on 70F to 100F in the summers and -20F to 30F in the winters.  110 isn't unheard of but pretty rare.  This will vary a lot depending on where you're at, too.

Another point to consider is that Michigan has a much higher average humidity than Nevada, which is going to feel a lot different.  90F feels much different in Nevada than Michigan.

Read up on ""Lake Effect"" weather.  Michigan, being surrounded by the massive Great Lakes, is subject to unique weather patterns.  Midland is far enough inland to not be affected very much, but weather along the shorelines can be intense.  Any time of year, you can expect a 10F to 15F difference between the Lower and Upper Peninsulas.",t2_6rre9,gungirspear,0,1624713942.0,0,t1_h33rcvs,h33rcvs,False,schiz0phrenicpotato,t3_o80fa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/midland_mi/comments/o80fa9/hi_im_moving_here_in_43_more_days_whats_it_like/,Hi I'm moving here in 43 more days.

"My care team is able to work with me up to 90 days after I leave Nevada. Atleast that's what my main Pyschiatrist says. I keep asking and confirming and confirming and confirming it will work. He promised it will. But I will start looking up mental health options. Right now I get weekly care. Psych every Thursday and therapy twice a week.
I'm concerned cause on daily Ketamine mateinece and i'm not sure how the transfer works for that cause it's not FDA regulated. I get 200mg a day and i've heard MI docs don't dose like that and that scares me because these treatments are the only thing that stopped me/is actively keeping me from unaliving myself.
I don't know how my compound pharmacy will transfer. 

I will make sure to request no students. I just don't roll with that because a student made a mistake and I went into liver failure and crashed in a hospital. 
I also once had to explain how a urine sample cup works to a student doctor T__T he really didn't know what the needle on the lid was and how it worked/what it was for.
So now I only go to hospitals with independant doctors not contracted with the hospital.
I have accees to 15 or so hospitals. So it's gonna be hard having such little access. 

The medical care thing is what scares me the most. But I'm going to look into the options you recommend. I know the psych hospital is a really really bad place. I thought the psych hospitals were gonna be better there. But i looked it up, and boy I was wrong. I haven't been hospitalized since 2014 but there's always that fear haha. *nervous laughter* 

I just wanna find a good doctor. I wanna keep all my medication as it is. I want to find a good therapist. 

I know I'll never have a psychiatrist as good as my current one again. But I'm trying to stay optimistic the doctor will atleast be nice to me. I'm trying to stay hopeful.

I actually texted my therapist about 10 mins ago but its 5am here. I keep crying about my doctor :( 

I'm excited for change. I'm excited to get out of here. But i'm terrified the care I'm going to recieve will be bad or inhumane.

"I‚Äôm a therapist and my wife is a nurse, we live in Midland.

Mid Michigan Health is the major hospital here.  I‚Äôve had very good experiences there so far.  You‚Äôre going to have a hard time finding a hospital setting that doesn‚Äôt have students working there due to Saginaw Valley University and Central Michigan University being pretty close in proximity but you can ask specifically to not have students working with you.  There are urgent care centers but they aren‚Äôt equipped the same way a hospital is.  Aetna is pretty good insurance so you‚Äôll have options for providers in the area.  You may need to travel for some specialists.  University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is a common place people get referred to for assessment purposes.

For your level of mental health needs there are a few options.  Mid Michigan Physicians group (at the hospital, but there are fewer students that work in this department and you can again request to never see a student and it will be respected) has an integrated team of therapists and psychiatrists, so your coordination of care is going to be much better.  Other options are Partners In Change or Behavioral Health Medicine who offer outpatient therapy and make referrals to psychiatrists.  I personally and professionally know therapists at each of those locations and I think they are the best in town.  You can‚Äôt go wrong at any of those spots for therapy.  If it were me, I‚Äôd try to get set up with psychiatry sooner than later as the waitlist to get in to see someone tends to be about 6 weeks for new patients.

Changing a care team is always scary and stressful.  You may want to ask your current care team to help you make phone calls or make referrals with you to ease the transition.  Talk to your therapist about your fear and ask them to help you.  I don‚Äôt know your specific treatment plan, but as long as it isn‚Äôt contraindicated (as in you‚Äôre working on anxiety or life skills and part of where you‚Äôre at in treatment is to practice making these calls yourself) they‚Äôll likely help you with it, or at the very least give you tips and ideas on how to make it easier and more on what to expect.

Good luck!  The worst part is the anticipation and things rarely go as badly as we think they will.  As other comments have mentioned, there‚Äôs lots to love about Midland and Michigan, but you‚Äôll have to do some exploring to find it.

"Someone plz tell me about healthcare. I'm so scared. 

My doctor is the only person it's hurting me to leave behind. It's really hard. And I cry a lot because i'm scared of the doctors and treatment I will recieve there.

1. I have aetna POS first choice
2. I refuse to go anywhere that has students because of mistakes they have made in the past. I need to know a hospital with no students. I saw the main one has students bubbling around. And I can't do that.
3. I need a new care team (Primary, Psych, and therapist) as soon as I cannot work with my Nevada providers anymore via telemed and transferring.

I am autistic with schizoaffective disorder. I have cPTSD and that's part of why i need to leave Vegas behind. OCD. ADHD, depression, anxiety.

I also have a really severe circadian rythem disorder and I went to see a sleep specialist here and they said i'm leaving too soon to start the process. 

Fibromaylgia that could possibly be MS but the doctors are making me go through a bunch of testing. My testing is starting in NV and Idk how it's supposed to just continue. PCOS, RA, chronic migraine, immune problems (I get sick a lot because a crappy immune system). A herniated disk. UC and IBS.

"Thanks for the extensive info. I joined some groups on FB to lurk and see how people are as well.

 But I want to know about medical care still . I think that's by far my biggest concern. I keep crying and losing because my doctor can only work with me so long after I move via telemed and prescription transferring (basically it goes to the walgreens in NV and they just scoot it over to MI). He's still on telemed but making an exception to see me one last time in person before I go. It hurts. It hurts. My doctor is the only person i'm going to miss about this town. I spent half my life looking for a good doctor. I got a GREAT one off a spoof. (Healthcare in Nevada is REALLY bad so finding a good doctor is rare). I keep crying because the COVID loophole will only let him work with me for a certain amount of time after I get to MI. I'm really scared of the doctors there and if they will even bother to go through 400+ pages of medical records. If they will listen to me. I am very scared of the doctors. 
I have 2 doctors and therapist (my team) but they can only work with me a few months after I'm gone. Losing my medical team is like losing my life. 
I'm scared the doctor is going to be hesitant and not give me my medication as i am on 3 controlled substance meds and array of other medication to cover my problems. 

I'm autistic and have schizoaffective disorder. Fibromyalgia that could possibly be MS and was diagnosed wrong. I don't have enough time to get all the testing done in time. I'm doing what I can. But my parents tend to think everything is just gonna slide over. I'm TERRIFIED of the doctors. 

I will not go anywhere near Detroit. I've been held at gunpoint in my own city and I don't intend to get robbed again. I will always be carrying pepper spray, a taser, and knives, everywhere I go, like I do now, for my own safety. But if someone has a gun, non of those things will help me. My dad is also getting me a belt crack whip for added security. 
I don't intend on going anywhere near Detroit.

I'm honestly happy to hear people are cold to outsiders. I was afraid my neighbors were going to come over and try to talk to me or something. In Vegas we do not speak to our neighbors. We don't call the cops on them. We leave each other alone. My neighbor has lived next door for like 7 years now and the only words we've ever exchanged are ""sup"" ""sup"" *head nod* . If someone is doing something stupid we tend to mind our own business. Even if someone is screaming, in Vegas most are smart enough not to call the cops and escalate the situation. There are cop callers but not in my neighborhood. 
I'm glad people will not talk to me. I intend on sitting in a cafe and people watching for a bit. Probably a few different cafes. 
But this is good reasurance because everyone tells me ""oh people in the midwest are so friendly"" . that gave me anxiety. If someone approaches me in public its a red flag. I pretend I didnt hear them and walk away. As I go everywhere by myself. If someone approaches me, I go into fight, flight, freeze. 
So I'm glad they'll be cold. I was scared everyone was gonna be super friendly like a Dutch Bros üòÖ

I'm not sure if I will make friends. I'm not sure if people will like me. But that's okay. I spend 90% of my life alone. It's a two bedroom house, just gonna be me and my pets. Parents will be next door doing whatever they do. 

With the weather I wont go outside anything below 20-30¬∞ unfortunately. I don't think i could handle it. Probably better to just order from instacart and postmates. 

How are the summers? Anything over 95¬∞ I dont like going out. But i'd say 110¬∞ is my breaking point and I KNOW it doesn't get hot like that there.

I'm am am older guy who grew up in the area, left for a while after high school, traveled pretty extensively, then moved back, got married, and started a family.  We've lived in Midland for a decade now.  Wanted to share some of my own insights with you:

First off, in the larger geographic sense, Midland is a great spot to be based out of in Michigan.  You're basically right in the middle of the state. 

You can go a short ways (30 mins - 1.5 hour) south and locate any metropolitan/urban culture/amenities/shopping you might desire.  Saginaw, Lansing, Grand Rapids, Detroit and all its surrounding suburbs all provide a good variety.

You can go an equal distance north and you'll start to enter ""Northern Michigan"".  Things start to become more rural and spread out, and there's plenty of great opportunities for any outdoor/nature activities you might take interest in.  Hiking, camping, kayaking, etc.

There's lots of beautiful towns on the west side of the state to visit.  Traverse City and other small towns in the northwest corner of the lower peninsula are beautiful and worth investigating at some point.  To the east is the ""Thumb"" area which is mostly rural farmland.  Mackinaw is the gateway to the Upper Penninsula and there's lots of things to see and do there, but I'll encourage you to research the UP and all it offers on your own time.  Culturally and geographically the UP is basically a second state.  It offers some of the best natural wonders in the state and some unique places you won't find anywhere else in the country.  See Pictured Rocks, the Keewenaw Penninsula, and lots more.

I would recommend that until you get settled and comfortable in the area (and possibly after you make a friend or two who can help guide) you avoid Flint completely and stick to the high traffic areas of Saginaw.  Both cities do have good to offer, but both (Flint especially) do have some dangerous areas that, until you know the lay of the land, would be safest to avoid.

As others have mentioned, Midland is part of the Tri-Cities which include Saginaw and Bay City.  To compare and contrast the three:  Midland is the well-to-do, old-Dow-moneyed, slightly stuck-up sibling.  Things here are nice, clean, and quiet, and the city/Chamber of Commerce likes to keep it that way.  Midland also has a slightly more varied population as Dow/Corteva draws in employees from across the world.  Midland is very much a ""family"" town in the sense that the infrastructure and culture and municipal organizations all cooperate to make this town the safest/quietest/arguably most boring of the three.

Bay City and Saginaw both have their own vibes and opportunities.  I'll let you discover them in your own time, but if I were to provide a super brief synopsis on each I'd say Bay City is where most go for bars/night life.  There's a good mix of everything from dive bars to dance clubs and dining.  Saginaw is the most spread out of the three, and has the largest urban center and all the amenities associated with one.  Saginaw County is large, though, and you'll find everything from rural woodlands to bustling city center inside.

To answer your question regarding working nights, Dow/Corteva/DuPont are going to be the biggest/best opportunity.  As someone else mentioned, Midland is the home of Dow/Dow Chemical and they have essentially funded this town for over a hundred years.  The economy in Midland largely depends on them and their employees spending their income at local businesses.  Most of these overnight employment opportunities are going to come in the form of swing  shift, as the plants operate 24/7.

Lastly, I just wanted to share a personal opinion/insight on Michiganders.  As a native son who's traveled the world and interacted with all sorts of people and cultures, my opinion is that we can come off as kind of withdrawn or cold to visitors/transplants.  Don't take offense to this, we're really not.  People tend to be more reserved up here, it's just the culture.  If you can crack through our icy exteriors you'll find great, warm, welcoming people underneath.

Best of luck and safe travels!

PS:  Winter is cold (10F to -10F often) and, unless you're prepared with the equipment and enthusiasm to make your own fun with things like ice fishing, snowmobiling, skiing, etc, is generally a time of hibernation up here.  My best suggestion is to not cheap out on winter gear!  We're not built for cold weather up here, we just know how to dress for it (layers!)",t2_6rre9,gungirspear,0,1624699141.0,0,t1_h339oz3,h339oz3,True,schiz0phrenicpotato,t3_o80fa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/midland_mi/comments/o80fa9/hi_im_moving_here_in_43_more_days_whats_it_like/,Hi I'm moving here in 43 more days.

"Wait, what do you mean the traffic lights shut down?? They turn off? They stop working? How is that safe? 

Vegas is old news. I lost my father to addiction. Growing up I watched friends and family get picked off by addiction. The purple fent just got here and it's getting worse. With half of California moving here, it's just turning bad. They're building another new stadium so the price of everything is going up. There's a lot of reasons it's no good for me to stay here anymore. And the sunmers are getting worse. We got to 116¬∞ the other day and its only June.

Cost of property and living is also very cheap there compared to what it is here.

"The safety I hope is legit.
I'm glad to hear about the safety aspect because i live somewhere where you always lock your door. Even if it's only going to be running back in the house cause you forgot to grab something.

So i've never really had the need to use them cause it's just ""give them what they want, you can replace it but you cant be replaced."" It'll be nice being somewhere safer.

It's not really looking for ""something to do"" for me. But somewhere to be other than home. Even sitting at the casino or an ihop myself. I don't club or party or anything like that. I do like outdoor stuff. I smoke weed and have my NV medical card which I plan to transfer over to MI when I get an i.d. and stuff. I know MI is rec like Nevada but it always helps to have a card.

Having grew up in Midland, many areas are not prone to flood, many, many are.  I would also point out that someone commented earlier they‚Äôd personally avoid areas that are described as in a 100-year flood zone.

"Regarding you first inquiry about the level of conservatism, it‚Äôs pretty up there. Predominantly white population, picket fence style neighborhoods. Coexistence is definitely possible here, their more the type to talk behind your back than to your face kinda folk. But generally nice. 

Now about your appearance, you and me definitely are on the same page with that. I have normally had bright colored hair, and now dreads as well as many visible tattoos. You will definitely be looked at and some may just not get it, you‚Äôll be good if you can ignore that. But still coexistable. I mean I did have a car with many bumper stickers on it and got pulled over for that once ‚Äútoo distracting‚Äù, but I think it was just the Halloween window clings that caused alarm for him. Pretty much if you have a good attitude and smile, your not bothered. 

Food wise, we have the normal Walmart/Meijer situation. ALDI has some better options for fresh foods, as well at Jacks food market and the farmers market in the warmer months. Some better restaurants are coming into town though that have a wider variety for you, Basial Thia is my favorite.

Midland does have a wonderful, growing hospital with many great departments. Covenant is another great option in Saginaw that‚Äôs not too far of a drive. Really anything in the tri-city area is within a 40 minute maximum drive. Close to the interstate and the main I75 highway. 

In the end, midland is great for a growing family. It‚Äôs safe and secure (so much so that if anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù happens it pretty much stays on the back page of the paper in small print). Great schools with lots of extra curricular options. Local community theatre to join, and community activities. Most things however shut down around 9pm, so not ideal for night owls.

"I couldn't help but add my 2 cents. I hope my and others' comments help you make a decision! In short, I'm going to attempt to ""unsell"" you on Midland and to instead ""sell"" you on Pittsburgh, PA. When I read your questions and concerns and how you described your family, all I could think of was how absolutely perfect Pittsburgh would be for you and your family. I hope you'll hear me out!

I grew up in Midland and left at 18 to attend college in Pittsburgh and never came back. I haven't lived in Midland for 22 years, so I obviously don't have my finger on the pulse as much as some of these other commenters do ‚Äì I acquiesce to them. I visit my family in Midland several times a year. As I see it, Midland is making progress in the LGBTQ community, but in my experience is still by-and-large, miserably close-minded. There's an air of frigidity about the people of Midland that I'm reminded of every time I visit. Of course I'm painting with a broad brush and I don't mean offense to any of the other commenters in this thread. In every community there are good and bad apples. But in general, I find Midlanders very guarded people. They're leery of outsiders. My husband and I hardly ever feel welcome by strangers when we visit and we're straight white people who look somewhat ""conventional."" 

Midland's ""growing arts and culture scene"" is a straight up scam. I'm just going to say it. It was ""growing"" when I lived there, and it continues to ""grow"" at a snail's pace. To be perfectly honest, I‚Äôm baffled when people defend Midland by claiming the town is ‚Äúfull of art and culture.‚Äù By what standard they‚Äôre measuring this against, I‚Äôm not sure. As far as I can see Midland is quite void of art, culture and diversity ‚Äì not just diversity of people but diversity of thoughts and ideas which make art (and life) so enjoyable. You can‚Äôt have a singular Center for the Arts and claim to be some sort of mecca for art and expression. Midland has always loved to roll around in its own proclamations of being a ""cultured city."" As an Art Director and creative person, I reject that notion. 

The inertia of Midland is unlike anything I've ever seen ‚Äì there‚Äôs no vitality to this town, no vigor, no spunk ‚Äì and I feel many older Midlanders work tirelessly to keep it that way. Perhaps as the local government grows younger and more progressive, that will change. I feel Midland lacks options in just about every department: unique restaurants, vegan options, bars, nightlife, concerts/live music, theaters, museums and Pride events. You'll never want for Churches though. Also, if your kids like soccer or tennis, you've hit the motherload, I will say that! I invite anyone with kids to shine light on what activities kids can enjoy in Midland, as I am not well versed.

Is Midland safe? Incredibly. Does Midland have a great school system? It does. But here is where I sell Pittsburgh: it too, is incredibly safe and has great school systems, depending on which area you live in. But there is also diversity, culture, art, music and all the wonderful things a larger city can offer. Pittsburgh has 300,000 people and is often called ""Hometown USA all grown up"" because it has world class amenities that larger cities have, but maintains its ""small town"" feel. Pittsburgh is a blue collar community at heart, but has grown to be so much more.

In general, the people here are delightful, friendly and helpful. Born and bred Pittsburghers are very unique and welcoming. They are unguarded and warm towards a very well established LGBTQ community. We have an awesome Pittsburgh Pride parade and Festival that has grown by leaps and bounds the past 5 years. PNC Park (home of the Pittsburgh Pirates) hosts pride nights, and we have one of the largest libraries dedicated to LGBTQIA+ authors. The general political attitude is Liberal, but as you move further from the epicenter, there are also a lot of conservative residents. I find Pittsburgh residents to be incredibly inclusive people. They live in diversity everyday and it shows. Pittsburghers love their city, and they're fiercely proud of it. Fred Rogers was born in Pittsburgh and I can honestly say his philosophy of kindness and ""loving your neighbor"" live on in his name here.

You'll never want for vegan-friendly options, amazing restaurants, nightlife, concerts, festivals, theaters, museums, things for your children to be involved with... I wish I could list it all. We have a Children's Museum, the zoo and aquarium, an aviary, botanical gardens, Science Center, an amazing fine art museum, natural history museum (with dinosaurs!), an amusement park, a waterpark, countless theaters showing old movies and new, concert halls, outdoor venues, arts programs...  This doesn't include the infinite enrichment that all the communities within Pittsburgh offer. Nature is literally a step away at all times. There are multiple hiking and biking trails that run through the city and beyond, nature reserves, parks, and campgrounds. You can kayak on the Three Rivers, take a boat ride, or fish within city limits. 

Two of the largest sectors of the Pittsburgh economy are Healthcare and Education. There are 29 colleges or universities here. We are consistently ranked as one of the safest and most affordable cities in the US [https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2019/01/17/pittsburgh-safe-affordable-city-to-live-in/](https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2019/01/17/pittsburgh-safe-affordable-city-to-live-in/) I can't imagine your husband would have problems finding a job or furthering his education in Pittsburgh. I feel confident in saying your appearance would never be an issue when trying to find a job in Pittsburgh. 

There are countless ""nook and cranny"" neighborhoods and boroughs, some bustling with excitement, some young and ""hipsterish"", some quiet and more suburban. Most are affordable. Our counter-culture is strong. Pittsburgh is truly an undiscovered gem of a city.

I just can't say enough about Pittsburgh. I apologize this post is so long. I would be delighted to talk to you personally if you were curious about anything I've said. If you do decide on Midland, I hope you can be the kind of change that town needs!

My big dream is being able to let the kids go play outside with their friends without having to worry too much about it. It's okay with us if it's not a hopping scene all the time.

"Just thought I'd throw in a few thoughts.  I've lived in Midland my whole life, minus the five summers I spent working at summer camps, and the four months living and working at a terrible job in Minnesota.

&#x200B;

Midland is mostly white, conservative and Christian.  There are people  here that don't fit that mold, but when you're the rare single, lesbian who is also a christian and liberal without a partner or kids, there isn't much to do around here.  I haven't had any problems due to my sexuality, but then I don't tell just anyone about my sexuality unless I feel comfortable telling them.

&#x200B;

There is a recreational spring and fall soccer league for kids if they like that.  There also is some youth lacross and football in the area along with the school sports.  If you like anything arts related, the center for the arts is great--they regularly have big name people come through to do concerts and have been having a couple of Broadway shows come through, as well as traveling exits in the museum and local productions of shows.  The school bands are also great, especially having been in the Midland High band over a decade ago when I was in high school.

&#x200B;

One thing a lot of people won't talk about is that there are drugs here.  In the past couple of years my parents, brother and I have known at least three people who have overdosed and died in Midland.  Midland sure does like to keep up it's appearance!
