"It's really weird to me that people are still replying to a comment I made 10 months ago in my local subreddit.  You guys don't even know what the first comment in the thread said.  Neither do I, because it was so long ago.  Maybe it put the rest of my comments in context.

When someone donates to street performers they are often doing it because they were entertained (in which case, aren't the donators still entertained even if they don't understand what they were being entertained by?  Lots of artists lipsync in concerts and people still manage to enjoy themselves.)   Otherwise, they are donating out of pity.  I can feel pity for people who are just sitting despondently on a sidewalk.  I can feel pity for people who are pretending to play a musical instrument.  I can feel pity for people who actually can play a musical instrument.  

Only being willing to donate to actual musicians is a mindset I can't understand - it would mean wanting to donate for reasons other than entertainment or pity.  What is the motivation here?  Hence my comment that the apparent motivation is widespread belief that the free market is disproportionately not compensating good musicians adequately. It's a ridiculous comment but it's the best motivation I can gather by people's indignant responses on this post.

"It's 100% about what you like to do, and what you like.

Downtown Bellevue - A super trendy, expensive, city experience. People say it's the best area for nightlife, but I've always found it completely dead after 8pm. If you want to live in a hi-rise it's the only option outside Seattle. Plenty of expensive bars, and places to eat.

Bellevue Crossroads - A little bit more chill, w/ plenty of nice places to hang out. If you like board games, MTG, and D&D then Mox, and Uncle's are popular hangouts. Lot's of good restaurants, or take-out places. Some of the apartment complexes are really crappy though (e.g. sandpiper).  Crossroads mall is pretty neat because it's not what I would consider a normal mall. Mostly lesser known shops, and the best food court I've ever been to.  Bellevue Brewing is pretty good, but there seems to be a distinct lack of good bars.  Mustard seed 2, and Damian's are the only 2 bars that come to mind, and I think Damian's is technically Redmond.

Redmond - While Redmond is becoming more and more commercially developed it's still got a lot of small town vibes.  It's great for nature walks, and the nightlife is much more concentrated than Kirkland, and Bellevue so it seems more lively.  Plenty of great restaurants, and probably the safest area to be in. Black Raven, and Post Doc are great breweries, plenty of bars from hi-end like Matt's, and Matador to dives like Palmer's.

Kirkland Downtown - Downtown Kirkland used to be the place to go on the eastside for 20 somethings, but it's dying out. Flatstick is a nice beer bar, and chainline brewing is good. They have top golf, and tons of waterfront events over the summer.  Wild Rover is closing so you know the area's nightlife is dying.

Woodinville - if you want something more rural or you want a ton of wineries, breweries, and/or distilleries then Woodinville is the place. Don't expect much nightlife, or city luxuries, but it's not a horrible place to be.

Downtown Bothell - is sort of a mix between everything. You got Zulu's for nerd stuff. A lot of places for beer if  you consider Kenmore's beer row close enough, and a few decent bars. Everything seems like it's trendy development, but it's not really as bad as it seems. There's still plenty of trails, and a popular frisbee golf course.

"I think it really depends on the individual. Personally, we rented a house in Bellevue (Lake Hills) when we first moved to the area.  Nice area.  Very clean and green, but we are early 30s/no kids and while we are definitely over the downtown living, the eastside felt a little too sleepy.  Personally, I am not the biggest fan of Downtown Bellevue, I think it feels a little sterile (downtown park is nice though!), also I think rent is pretty expensive downtown. We do have some friends who live in Totem Lake in Kirkland and they seem to like it there. 

In the end, we left the Eastside to  buy a house near Columbia City (Seattle) and we are pretty happy here.  It has a good balance of residential character with parks/greenspace but still  walkable to shops and restaurants.

"Kirkland, Bothell, Bellevue, Woodinville are all good places to live on the north end. If you're commuting from south to north I'd suggest no further south than Renton. On a good day that would take up 1.5 hrs daily both directions. If you're in Bellevue you're already half way there and have more routes open to take. Kirkland is in the convergence zone for weather so you'll end up seeing more snow up that direction in the winter time. 

Start watching google maps for traffic patters so you can get an idea of what's what. it'll also help you familiarize your self with the roads a bit before coming over. 

Prices are about comparable from dc to here so you'll be use to high expenses. As long as you're earning $18/rh at full time you're doing well. If you're pulling in 38k-45k annually you'll be fine.

"An architect is trained to figure out efficient use of space as well as make things look good and draw up the necessary plans and documents for a permit.  I personally believe that using a good architect will *save* you money over not using one, because they can optimize the use of space, getting more utility out of less square footage.

Your architect will talk to you about budget and what you are trying to accomplish, and can steer you toward remodel plans that give you the finishes you want and the spaces you want while staying within the target budget.  They will also work with the builder throughout the construction project to make sure things are done as intended.  

For a remodel of a 1964 home I'd suggest looking at CTA Design Build who can do the architecture as well as the remodel.  I haven't worked with them myself, but Julie Campbell who cofounded the company is one of the most knowledgeable people about the history of Mid-Century architecture in the PNW.  Here's a gorgeous remodel they did of 1960s house: https://ctabuilds.com/project/kirkland-mid-century-modern/
One of the things I really like about CTA is their ability to work very well in a variety of styles, which you will see on their web site.  Also, because they do the building themselves they have a great handle on ""what dials to turn"" to get the features and finishes you want within your target budget.

Another local architect I really love who works with mid-century houses is Chesmore Buck  (I personally know Rick Chesmore, and he's a genuinely nice guy.)  They showcase their ""fancy"" projects on their web site, but they have also at least half a dozen remodels in Lake Hills, the mid-century neighborhood at the SE corner of Bellevue that was always Bellevue's lowest-income neighborhood.  Rick thinks about the environmental impact of the work they do, and is a strong believer of remodeling rather than rebuilding whenever possible.  Here's a stunning remodel of a mid-century house done by Chesmore Buck: http://chesmorebuck.com/projects/233614

I also have a soft spot for SHED Design of Seattle, who has also done some gorgeous remodels of mid-century homes in Seattle.  I discovered them through their [stunning remodel of a 1959 Madison Park Ranch House] (https://www.shedbuilt.com/portfolio/madison-park-ranch-house/) but they have also done some amazing remodels on the eastside including this Bridle Trails remodel: https://www.shedbuilt.com/portfolio/bridle-trails-remodel/  I casually know one of SHED's project managers, and I know that they're also very interested in considering environmental impact of their work.  They lean more towards ""showpiece"" architecture than the others I've mentioned (meaning it catches attention compared to surrounding buildings) so that may or may not be your style.

If SHED is out of your price range but you like theer style, you could also try Alex Hale, who used to work for SHED and was the lead on the Madison Park residence. 
https://www.alexhalearchitecture.com/

I have a 1957 house in Lake Hills, and when I'm ready for a remodel these are the 4 firms I'll be talking to before I make my final decision.


An architect will charge something in the range of 8-15% of the build/remodel cost.

"So there are remodeling companies that will include design and the actual remodeling service. This is the more expensive route because they will already have everything. They’ll have an electrician, a carpenter, a floor guy, a designer, etc etc. This option costs a lot more (I was quoted almost 100k for a very basic kitchen remodel), but is easier. 

The other option is you hire a designer (or an architect in some cases), depends on what you are doing. Some designers may have a contractor that they work with, some will just provide the design/plans and you bring it to your contractor. 

I guess a third option is doing your own design, but you’d have to know if a wall is load bearing and if electrical, plumbing runs through it. This is what we ended up doing, but we also did our own remodel and hired a structural engineer to verify that walls were not load bearing.

"OP clarified elsewhere this is for his mother and reverse mortgages are for owners aged 62 and older.

The reason I didn’t recommend a refi or HELOC in this situation is the requirement to make regular payments - which OP’s mother can’t do independently meaning any traditional loan package she gets would be cannibalizing itself. If she got a reverse mortgage, she is only on the hook for origination fees and things she already should be doing (ie. pay property taxes, homeowners insurance, general upkeep). The article you linked says “There's nothing inherently wrong with reverse mortgages, which allow seniors to stay in their homes while borrowing against a percentage of the equity.”

If OP’s mom is already heading towards losing her home by not being able to pay her mortgage, property taxes, utilities, etc. - then her options are either sell or talk to her financial advisors about finding a loan package that is built more for her situation to extend her homeownership.",t2_13w54y,Bastardly_Poem1,0,1647347089.0,0,t1_i0qotkx,i0qotkx,False,kxserasera,t3_te6nyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastside/comments/te6nyx/property_tax_increased_so_much_how_to_afford_if/,Property tax increased so much… how to afford if home owner has no income?,/r/eastside/comments/te6nyx/property_tax_increased_so_much_how_to_afford_if/i0qotkx/,4,r/eastside,0,4

"It’s really hard, and scary, to find work as an older woman who’s been out of the workforce for a long time. I’m only 46, and I stayed home with my son while my husband worked.

If you haven’t been in that position, you can’t know how hard it is. 

I’m really lucky, I eventually just started freelancing again and then found some work that’s significantly below what I should be earning. But since my husband’s salary has always been enough, I could take the low paying job. I enjoy it, I have flexible hours, but most of all, it’s keeping my foot in the door.

"Landlords do not get a free pass on rental income for taxes. That would be too good to be true. There are things you can do to deduct some of it like depreciation and business expenses and mortgage interest.

I didn’t mean paying the bills as in utility bills. I meant the mortgage, the maintenance, the property manager, etc. These are expensive and it’s hard to cover them without a tenant paying rent. During the pandemic some landlords had a tenant living there for free causing wear and tear, and not allowing them to find a paying tenant. Either everyone should get a free pass or no one should.

It’s unfortunate that your landlord sucks. I think I’m better than that, try not to increase rents if possible, and my rentals are well maintained but in return I need to have good tenants. Being able to select from candidates and make sure they don’t have a criminal history is important to me. Since I can’t do that in Seattle I’m now an exclusively east side landlord.

"Biggest problem with Duvall are the arterial connections, whereas NB has the biggest E-W one in the state. This is anecdotal between friends and my commutes from Duvall/NB to KSEA. Depending on commute time, traffic will build on you once you hit Issaquah, but still nothing like I-5 (405 going into Bellevue in AM and out of in PM can be ""special""). Honestly--plan routes/trips in Waze at the times you're expecting for the best idea.

I am NB, so sticking to what I know (North Bend) forward.

If you like the outdoors, we ARE the play area for MTB, gravel riding, hiking, etc. in this part of the state. That stated, it also becomes a love/hate with being inundated on the trails with visitors from the west during the summer months/nice weather. If you don't hike that much, probably not as big an issue.  Just take that into account. I'm sure locals in Moab have the same issues.

That said, if you don't handle rain very well (already), NB has a microclimate (s) that is hard to prepare for. We have rain...unlike just about anyone else on this side of the Sound. Sun in Seattle, Bellevue, Issaquah? Just wait until you head down the hill past Exit 27...wipers will come on more times than you can count. Sunny days...are glorious. But seriously don't underestimate how much cloud cover gets bottled up in the Snoqualmie Pass (and out into North Bend).

Schools-have two school age kids, but their mom is a teacher in Issaquah...so they go to Issaquah and we don't have personal knowledge of Snoqualmie Valley SD. As I understand it, not the top, but definitely no where near the bottom.

Crime-relative, but honestly very little depending on neighborhood. Aggravated/serious crime IS rare. Thefts at the Nike Outlet Store as thieves escape back onto I-90...oh yeah. Edit: trail head break ins are a thing all over-the same in our area although it sounds like Hwy 2 is worse).

"When looking for housing years ago my wife and I checked a place in Duvall.

Across the freeway is your standard fast foods including McDonalds, Wendys, Drive Thru Starbucks, Pho, a QFC and an Olive Garden.

The city is aware of the problem, and it looks like they’re focused on knowledge and drainage. They have tons of docs online, and you can call the city to inquire about a property as well!

"Yes, we got them the basic kit years ago and they liked it, and that's a step in the right direction. I should probably look into what other kits there are. However the reason I'm looking for classes and not just kits is because I myself have almost no tech literacy, so I can't provide much additional context to what is happening.

They are very interested in being able to build their own stuff independently, and I'm looking forward to the day when they talk excitedly about all sorts of systems and concepts I can't understand. But they want to start moving on that path now, and I'm not sure that a few quality science kits will do the trick given that I've got no follow-through for them.

For example, the have a cool toy lightsaber but they want to build their own, and they're asking me how they could, and I'm like ""Well you'd need some kind of battery mechanism and connect it to some switch mechanism which then connects via wiring to a light..."" and they say ""ok, cool let's order those parts and put them together"" and all I can do is shrug and now try and figure out how to get connect them with a proper mentor who could actually explain how that is done.

"Redmond is 2.5x the area of Evanston and has a smaller population. It should hardly be surprising that much of Redmond is a further walk from downtown when it's larger and less dense. But then again, how many parks like Marymoor or 60 Acres does Evanston have?

You're picking up SFH in particular, but there are tons of apartments and townhomes in DT Redmond that are highly walkable to everything you need and then some. There are some nicely walkable SFHs near Marymoor and also Redmond Ridge (which is its own island), but you're right generally most of them are further from downtown. It's just a matter of how city limits are drawn; to be the same distance from downtown Evanston, you'd be in Wilmette or Skokie instead.",t2_n8ktn,oren0,0,1645897656.0,0,t1_hyje9fa,hyje9fa,False,UnamiWhale,t3_sz82em,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastside/comments/sz82em/the_eastside_suburbs_are_kind_of_underwhelming/,The Eastside suburbs are kind of underwhelming?,/r/eastside/comments/sz82em/the_eastside_suburbs_are_kind_of_underwhelming/hyje9fa/,1,r/eastside,0,1
"I disagree.  It's not just downtowns. How walkable is Redmond downtown to where the SFHs in Redmond are?  Not at all.  In Evanston, the surrounding neighborhood to downtown is highly walkable all over.  There is several mile radius of tree-lined sidewalks you can take to push a stroller to every part of Evanston.   It's not just one concentration of chains, parking and condo developments surrounded by roads and highways.

Kirkland downtown is better in that regard.  But to say Redmond downtown blows away Evanston and Palo Alto, means you actually haven't spent anytime LIVING near those areas in Evanston and Palo Alto to appreciate the fundamental difference between those suburbs with Redmond.

"As an Eastside resident/owner in both downtown Bellevue and crossroads (east) Bellevue, I don’t think the city itself is overly interesting and from the people I know that’s not why they moved to this location. I personally bought in 6-7 years ago because I saw the potential of the small city and what it would become and continue to be. Glad I got in when I did. But besides that, it was the mix of city and suburb that was appealing, low crime rate, future development plans as seen through the city gov portals and of course generally very clean comparably. BUT also, here in the PNW and Bellevue too, we have access to so much like beaches, mountains to ski/board, places to hike, bus or soon to be train to Seattle and then come back to the safe/clean Bellevue. Public transportation in Bellevue is also pretty dang good and will be really good Q1 2023 with the light rail going. Both my places have the B line rapid ride outside and both are walkable to grocery and food already within 5 min or less. Not sure the price points you are comparing to though in other cities.

Specifically what the Seattle region lacks that all those other areas have is a mixture of business and non-high-rise residences. Issaquah as well as North Bend has that mix.

"You are correct. Especially compared to the New York exurban areas, it's not delivering on the value. However the thing to remember is that those places are hundreds or thousands of miles away, so in many respects this is the only game in town. I'm very much in favor of more culture and cultivation being brought to this area, though I'm not sure exactly where to start. However I would suggest that the tech industry isn't going to be the avenue for that. Google and Redmond and now SpaceX being on the eastside has been more the cause rather than the solution to the current imbalance, in my opinion.

And highway noise? I mean, ok, sure, but c'mon that's not really the issue.

And also the park system here is much better than most suburbs I've been in before, though I can't speak to the Chicago area. But really, the parks are pretty good compared to most expensive suburbs I've been around.

Fundamentally, this is an area that is growing too fast in many respects. So the price of the area is ahead of the actual development. This is a sort of mutation in progress we are living in.

But the development is happening, like Bellevue (which is a bit misguided) or Totem Lake (also misguided, but slightly less so) and hopefully they'll figure it out in the next 10-20 years. Apparently 85th is going to see a lot of new building in the years ahead.

The area needs more arts / culture investment, badly. That's the main thing. The money is already here, the infrastructure is here, the clientele is here, the services are here, but the culture is not.

Great schools, community enclaves, and generally good parks/outdoors access it’s not a bad place to live - I could name some fantastic parks that aren’t close to a highway. Doubt the latest tech influx will change anything, this area has had a gradual stream of tech money coming in for three decades now. 

The big difference between here and Brookline/Palo Alto/Evanston is, outside of Bellevue, you can buy a house that is only half-insanity.

"In this crazy housing market (and I don't mean the 2021-2022 market; I mean the American market in general), price is only partially driven by factors like aesthetics and walkability. I've lived in suburbs across multiple states and on some level they're kind of all the same: subdivisions of single-family homes of various sizes, connected by streets that make no sense and are designed for driving (i.e. have no sidewalks or lighting), plus amenities that all assume that you are driving to them as well (i.e. giant parking lots and drive-thrus).

Really, it's more driven by location and the competition of the market. Seattle has the good-bad fortune of being populated by many techies, many of whom have moved from more expensive markets and therefore have money to drop on housing. Also, being a favorite of investors who have cash and can pay up front drives the competition and the overbidding for houses.

Being from a Sun Belt city, I too am kind of appalled when I see what some of these fairly ordinary (and often outdated) houses tend to go for in my Eastside suburb and its surrounding towns. Even some of the mini-mansions with all the nice marble and electric fireplaces would sell for half their price, if not less, in my hometown. But that's because no one would pay those prices where I'm from, where here they're sold in a week, sometimes for over asking.",t2_oeiny,roseofjuly,0,1645595089.0,0,t1_hy2g21j,hy2g21j,True,UnamiWhale,t3_sz82em,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastside/comments/sz82em/the_eastside_suburbs_are_kind_of_underwhelming/,The Eastside suburbs are kind of underwhelming?,/r/eastside/comments/sz82em/the_eastside_suburbs_are_kind_of_underwhelming/hy2g21j/,6,r/eastside,0,6

I also found 4800-5500 sq ft homes with guest houses for 700k. Granted this was north of the loop, but a 5500 sq ft home in Tacoma would be well over $1 million. You put that in an eastside town here and looking at $2.7-3.4 million.",t2_15oyld,I_see_something,0,1645549112.0,0,t1_hxzfdk6,hxzfdk6,False,redmondapart,t3_sxwbb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastside/comments/sxwbb8/looking_for_an_apartment_to_share_in_redmond/,Looking for an apartment to share in Redmond,/r/eastside/comments/sxwbb8/looking_for_an_apartment_to_share_in_redmond/hxzfdk6/,1,r/eastside,0,1
"again - depends where.. out in humble? sure - down by the galleria? prices aren't far off from here, in fact looking by my old house i'm seeing 3.89, 3.83 vs. 3.79 at the safeway up in the issaquah highlands or 3.75 at costco..

other things to consider, electricity's cheaper here, natural gas is cheaper (figure that one out), when you own - property taxes are ridiculously lower (paying about the same total $ on a house here than i was in texas on a house worth about 3 times less.. plus no ridiculous HOA fees can't be written off like taxes)

overall i won't argue that it can be a little more expensive for the non-real estate things, but it's far more nuanced .... plus, it's not miserably humid for 90% of the year, nor is it all flat - can you really put a price on that? :D",t2_8l8kj,notmyredditacct,0,1645548269.0,0,t1_hxzd682,hxzd682,False,redmondapart,t3_sxwbb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastside/comments/sxwbb8/looking_for_an_apartment_to_share_in_redmond/,Looking for an apartment to share in Redmond,/r/eastside/comments/sxwbb8/looking_for_an_apartment_to_share_in_redmond/hxzd682/,2,r/eastside,0,2

"I rent in a rural area in North Bend. I like it because I'm an avid outdoor recreation person, but it's definitely not for everyone. It rains about twice as much here as it does in Seattle or Bothell; somewhere around 90"" of rain last year. And it's colder, windier, and snowier.

Given the cultural diversity that the tech companies attract, I think they'll prefer the more convenient access to work, shopping, health services, restaurants, etc. Combined with the climate difference, Bothell will be more attractive and see a larger growth potential for real estate investments. 

That said, I think the floor here in North Bend is more accessible (lower prices/easier entry?), but in this market, it's all relative.

"Your first step should be talking to your neighbor. He probably doesn't even realize that other people can hear his music. Asking them to turn it down almost always works, in my experience.

If he won't turn it down, then your next step is to complain to the building management. If enough people in the building complain, they can threaten to evict him if he doesn't quiet down. If they won't do anything, then ask to break the lease. If you can find a replacement tenant (probably not hard in this housing market), they will likely agree.

Breaking the lease without your landlord's consent can likely put you on a blacklist. I would try anything else first. Perhaps some earplugs will help you make it to the end of the lease.

"Market variance and decreasing tech multiples may tamp down on the enthusiasm, but the fundamentals will not be fixed anytime soon.

On the supply side, lots of SFH zoning and no big changes coming onboard over the next 5 years - the geography of the area can also limit outward sprawl. Meanwhile owners that have locked in low rates will be loathe to sell and lose those low rates, further reducing supply.

On the demand side, the PNW isn't getting any less desirable - environmentally it's somewhat isolated from climate change (versus California, even if the heat dome and wildfire air quality are still an issue), and tech Bros tend to be a pretty conservative bunch with a ton of cash in their warchests so even a dip in RSUs won't hold them back.

The housing crisis in America isn't going down anytime soon. If you're certain you will be in this area for the next five years and have kids, you should buy.
