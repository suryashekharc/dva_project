"I'm done with SP and Vail, at least for several more years. It is very clear that the fortunes have not turned there, with the announcement of reduced night skiing next year and the continued inability to open lifts and terrain on time and predictably, the non-existent customer experience, and constant operations breakdowns.

That $150 rebate? That's bullshit, they should have offered all 21-22 SP pass holders a free pass next year given how the resort was basically non-operable through January. Regardless, the crowds will continue next year due to the rebate and previous over selling of passes, your services will be reduced (the reduced night ski announcement is a perfect example of 'shrinkflation'), customer service will remain horrible. 

Sad to leave SP, it's my favorite WA resort, and conveniently located for me. I'll check back in a few years when and if I hear you've gotten your shit together. But I'm not holding my breath. 

Where will I spend my money the next few years? 

I think the Crystal model is a solid model, at least for the discerning WA ski consumer. You pay a premium to have a quality product. The opposite of the way Vail is going, to discount and oversell a shit product and not bother to invest in the infrastructure, staff or customer experience. Vail is doubling down on the Wal-Mart experience of skiing at Stevens Pass. 

Mt. Baker remains the shining example of the heart and soul of WA skiing, family-owned and catering and serving a high quality experience to a passionate user base. Such a long drive though, maybe I'll look again at those eTrucks that are coming out.

The old reliable standard, Snoqualmie, so accessible to the Puget Sound masses for so many years, has run an impressive operation this year. I love the support they provide to their uphill community, that's some bad-ass customer focused love right there. Oh, and Dru Bru!

"Nice. Just bought an epic local pass.

Vail turned around the season around at Stevens, announced they are paying their employees more than any other major ski corporation (I'll happily support them for this alone), and hands down have the best bang for you buck pass (unlike Crystal who is making skiing less accessible for everyone who isn't wealthy).

So yeah, ignore the person who wants to support a company for announcing a huge raise for all of their employees and listened to their customer base's outrage and turning Steven Pass's season around.

"Second what everyone else said. You got it! The lift looks intimitqfing and the off load is a little sketching feeling first couple times and the traverse over to the more mellow lines can get pretty gutted. Once you clear the offload and traverse you can pick your line and go at your own pace and will be amazed how easy of a run it can be! My suggestions for the first time:

- Load solo on the tbar.  That will give you more space and make the offload feel more comfortable (esp if snowboarding)

- dip down a little and then traverse over to avoid the gutted out upper traverse lines

- further you hang right the less moguls you‚Äôll deal with.

"You‚Äôll be fine. I promise. 

I psyched myself out about 7th for the longest time until I finally just sucked it up and went up there. The offload is the only part that can be rough. Just bend your knees and aim yourself away from the group of idiots who always crowd the offload. It‚Äôs not nearly as steep or fast as you‚Äôre thinking. If you‚Äôve ridden kehrs you can offload 7th. 

After that it‚Äôs just a matter of making your way down. Go at your own pace. There is so much open space on 7th you don‚Äôt need to worry about slowing people down. They can go around you.

"If you can ski down the chairline under jupiter, or pegasus when its moggly you can ski down 7th without much issue. 

The hardest part about 7th is

1.) the chair offload is a steep very narrow ramp with no real room to lollygag around with once you clear

2.) Because its perma-shaded, it can get icey

3.) The mogals can be pretty damn big near the top.

So as long as you can handle the offload (look on youtube for videos off it), and can control your way down big mogals, its fine.

Also fwiw. Cloud 9 used to be marked as a single black a while ago. And honestly it really is.

"Skiing has become incredibly expensive and that really sucks! I‚Äôm with ya, it is a problem . **But** I also respectfully disagree with the proposed solution in the post.

Is it greed to charge more when you offer an in demand but limited service? That‚Äôs like saying it‚Äôs greedy for an experienced and in demand employee to ask for a higher salary as they progress in their career. Should companies demand that employees stop being ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù for higher salaries just because they are in demand?

Though I agree with the problem I don‚Äôt think demanding prices be lowered is a **viable solution**. Here are some alternative routes that make more sense to me: 

1. Petition that WA state allow for the creation of additional ski resorts. If demand is increasing let‚Äôs **increase supply**.
2. Increase regular ticket prices by 3% and use proceeds to discount tickets for **low income families**.

"There are lots of fun ski maps from Stevens at [https://skimap.org/skiAreas/view/190](https://skimap.org), but I really like this one.

Notice that back then, 20 days was the break-even point for buying a season's pass - they were expensive. 

I had also forgotten that the barrier lift (pre-skyline) was aligned on the ridge side and that you had to take a rope tow to get up above the bowl to ski that side of the run or get on 7th.

And the backside originally just had one lift - southern cross - and if you weren't interested in skiing double-d to get back, you had to ski the divide and fly at the bottom so you didn't have to climb up to get to the front. Or I guess you could ski wild katz or schim's.

"**[Peter principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)** 
 
 >The Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to ""a level of respective incompetence"": employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was explained in the 1969 book The Peter Principle (William Morrow and Company) by Peter and Raymond Hull. (Hull wrote the text, based on Peter's research.

"I agree with the OP's general sentiment we shouldn't be shitting on anyone else's stoke - but it's hard to ignore the reality if you peel away the new PR. Some back of napkin math it seems like maybe 10-15% of the hardest lines are open mid-week. You've got Seventh heaven and that's it. By 10:30am it's skied out as it's the only steep terrain open, and you're waiting 20min at Skyline for another lap. We're missing Big Chief bowl, wildkatz, double diamond, Schims, and a huge amount of terrain off Polaris. 

I've been skiing Steven's for 15 years and a typical midweek you can get fresh steep turns almost from open to close without waiting in line. 

Between my partners pass, and my three kids passes and their 6 weeks of lessons and rentals I'm personally almost $5k into every ski season. $600 in hamburger credits next year is a massive slap in the face. If Vail was transparent about these issues over the summer we could have spent that at Alpy, and given them a break and been back next year. No big deal, no hard feelings - shit happens.

There's two sides to the coin here. For those that are stoked given the current situation, I really am happy for them. Some of us are into this season a lot more than $500.

"What I said to Amex:  
\- not enough staff to open retail & restaurants  
\- only 1 of 3 lodges was open  
\- huge lineups to get into the parking lots because they were unplowed without staff to direct traffic, (several people reported accidents in the parking lots)  
\- due to the lack of lift staff, only about 30 ‚Äì 40% of the terrain has been open on any given day resulting in huge lineups and excessive wait times  
\- When I purchased my pass in September, I expected that this year would be similar to previous years. That never happened. This problem is unique to Vail and not due to Covid or the weather. Other resorts in Washington, faced with similar challenges, were able to open all or most of their terrain.

Its Feb 1st, they knew they were understaffed well before the season started, bullshitted us, fired (moved mgmnt. around) some people and opened the backside for a weekend, and you are all happy with it.

I am also a 15+ year pass holder, and fuck your notion that this is normal, not totally their own fault is illogical. **Vail fucked up big time, and continue to fuck up.

You are just accepting the bullshit they feed you. When they get the backside open 7 days a week then this problem is fixed till then its fucked.

This isn't some small business, this is a fully formed business that was purchased by a mega ski corp. They tried to squeeze as much profit from the resort while paying employees the bare minimum. Because of that no one wants to work there.

">Here is my official submission to the AG:  
>  
>Dear Attorney General Ferguson,  
I am the author of a petition to Stevens Pass and Vail Resorts that has been signed by more than 44,000 people (please see www.change.org/epicvailfail). This petition outlines how Vail Resorts has failed to provide the product they have sold people. The product marketed and sold by Vail Resorts included reasonable access to the terrain and lifts that are prevalent in their marketing materials and on their trail maps, as well as on Stevenspass.com. We were not sold passes with the understanding that Vail Resorts intended to keep 50% or more of the terrain and the majority of lifts closed for the season. We would not have bought passes if we knew this. It is illegal for a business to accept payments for products or services they do not intend to supply. Intentions were made clear after the season started in company communications as early as December that more than half of the ski terrain would likely not open, demonstrating a clear violation of consumer trust. I purchased an ""Epic Pass,"" season ski pass, with the expectation that I would have access to the trail map (or 1,125 acres) as advertised on Stevenspass.com, however, less than half of this trail map (or <400 acres) has been accessible since opening date on Dec 15, 2021. As a result, I don‚Äôt feel I was provided the goods and services I purchased since I‚Äôm unable to use the product as advertised.  
Vail has included questionable anti-consumer clauses in their terms of service that prevent customers from being issued refunds for their inability to operate the mountain as advertised. it is clear that Vail Resorts deceived a substantial portion of the public and committed this deception in the conduct of commerce. The 44,000 signers of this petition and I believe that Vail Resorts' failure to refund at least part of this year's pass purchase, if not all, is a violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act. The petition explains how other ski resorts in Washington with similar, if not more terrain complexities, have been able to run the majority of their lifts and open the majority of their terrain, considering similar snow safety (avalanche) precautions and weather. Please consider this a formal request to make public the request to Vail Resorts to refund our Epic Passes.   
Sincerely,

Tons of people ski Snoqualmie. Tons of people ski during the weeks.

"No offense taken. The standards at Snoqualmie are atrocious and I get close to rage quitting every year I go back to work there. But I feel like you‚Äôre dismissing what I‚Äôm saying because it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative, not because it doesn‚Äôt fit your standards.

Also mission has four lifts, and chair four is frequently not open. Whether it‚Äôs because of weather or lack of employees I honestly have no idea.

Crystal has 8/11 lifts running today. Not sure whether it‚Äôs because of weather or staff shortage but that‚Äôs not unusual, and not 100%. (Looks like chair 6 and northway are closed for unspecified reasons. I bet they just don‚Äôt have staff though). 

The narrative that other resorts aren‚Äôt being affected is just a false narrative to fuel outrage. People should be outraged, but let‚Äôs stick to the facts and not throw around baseless bullshit. 

I do think the way these resorts describe the shortage is bullshit - that‚Äôs what we should be outraged about. There‚Äôs a shortage of desire to pay a decent wage to incentive workers, which of course causes a worker shortage. They conveniently want to leave out that first part and shift the blame from themselves. But every resort is experiencing it and handling it poorly resulting in a less than optimal experience.

"Pretty tired of hearing how it didn't impact any other ski resort. I work for Snoqualmie and while we definitely have more terrain open than Steven's, I don't think we've had a day this year where we're fully open, except maybe this weekend. They've announced on their Instagram they don't have enough lifties to open all of Hyak for the first three weeks it opened. They've not been running the additional green lifts at Central. Gallery is a fifty fifty chance of running. There have been days where they didn't open chair 2 at Alpental because of lack of staff. 

I get that everyone's mad, but it's untrue that it isn't affecting other ski resorts.

Side note: Snoqualmie is a complete shit show this year (even more than usual). They pulled every instructor off private lessons because one of the higher ups literally forgot to turn off sales for multi-week group lessons and they sold too many.

""Vail Resort Management Company has demonstrably failed across nearly every metric in managing Stevens Pass Ski Resort, and has failed to provide the service I expected when I purchased my Epic Pass. While every other ski resort in the area is fully open, Stevens Pass/Vail has struggled to open more than 40% of the terrain available, due to employee shortages which I believe are primarily self-inflicted due to questionable corporate priorities.

I assert that Vail has operated in bad faith when it comes to providing me the service I purchased. Their company posts significant annual profit while materially failing to honor the spirit and promise of the product and contract they offer. I do not believe they ever intended to take the steps necessary to provide the services I paid for.

Their Epic Pass contract is written in such a way that prohibits me from seeking a refund due to lack of services.
