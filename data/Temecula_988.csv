"IMO this depends on where exactly you are and when your home was built.  We do have a fairly big fault (the Lake Elsinore Fault) which is capable of 6.5-7.5 ... for reference, Northridge was 6.7.  In 1910 there was a magnitude 6 just north of the lake.  That likely wouldn't have done much to newer construction around the greater Temecula area though.

&#x200B;

After Northridge, construction laws changed and houses are much better prepared to handle earthquakes in the magnitude 6-7 range.   All this said.  I do not have earthquake insurance.  Mostly because the cost was more than my normal home insurance and the deductible was high enough I wouldn't be able to afford it.  Since the values went up so much in the last few years my equity has also gone up so I am reconsidering it now.

We moved to the Lake Elsinore USD and that seems a lot better - in fact, though people look down on LE and Wildomar, I think that might actually be racism surfacing rather than the place being ""bad"".

"I think the term you are looking for is NIMBY.

Temecula will put up every single possible roadblock to denser housing  (new apt complexes) and try to prevent the poors from moving in.

And really - the only leg they have to stand on regardless of your political views on that - is TRAFFIC.  It's already more-or-less unbearable here.  The existing roads and infrastructure can't handle or barely handles it now.  Adding in some dense housing (a sore point for all of California) will greatly add to that issue.

Not too sure about the ""tough on crime"" claim - since it's so rare that I see the late 2000's era Temecula Crown Vic's that when I do see them it stands out.  Like - how exactly are they ""tough on crime"" compared to any other medium sized suburb anywhere.

I started exploring - cause lets be real here - it's pretty freakin sweet from here we can hit a beach or mountain or the desert.  So much to explore - thats how I've been getting out.

"Hi there! I actually commute from Menifee to Banker's Hill/downtown San Diego every day for work and it takes me about 1hr20min with traffic (75 miles each way). Your commute will be much less. It's actually not that bad for me compared to what every one else is saying. Maybe it's because I've dealt with much worse commutes in LA and SF/Bay Area - those commutes are way way worse!

For reference, I leave my house around 7:30am and leave work around 5:30-6pm and there's very minimal traffic. Most of the traffic is the evening commute between Rainbow and the I-15/I-215 junction (roughly 20-30min delay but not bumper to bumper). You can also take the alternative local road which avoids all the traffic.

"As someone who grew up here, 25, moved here when i was 14, try to stick near the north side near murrieta/french valley zone for the mall. I can't express how much my social life relied on walking and cycling to the mall from Chaparral HS and Day Middle, anyone and everyone would congregate there after school and on weekend. The south sides reall nice in terms of houses and local parks but it's an ocean of nothing for kids. The nearing things in that area are grocery store shopping plazas after a long time of walking or cycling. Same kind of goes for the French Valley/Dutch Village/Winchester area up the big hill right past Chaparral, it's an ocean of houses with nothing much but the schools and parks. Even living by the Rancho Cal/Margarita intersection is a really good spot but once you get to Temecula Parkway it's kind of socially isolating outside of school. Especially if you're near Great Oak/Pechanga. For wineries/breweries/bars they're like littered across the entire city left and right, if you just take a main road and go a little further out you'll always find them! Adult and kid fun can always be had in Old Town by the way, during the day theres the retro candy shop, Pennypickles, the local theater, tons of seasonal events, and in the evening it's a walkable bar hop zone.

"I used to live in the Central Park community for nine years. The community, under normal circumstances, was underneath the take-off path of every aircraft from Cessna to Leer jet at full throttle.

At some point after a couple of months, you just stop noticing the sound. It becomes background noise like yard work, fire engine/ambulance sirens from the near by fire station, the ebb and flow of traffic in the area, etc. 

Central Park, by the way, is a great low tax neighborhood. There’s been a lot of turn over recently with the inflated property values and such, but when I lived there (as recent as 2021), the neighborhood showed such great pride of ownership. 

I would imagine the noise from the airport is much less over in the Spencer’s Crossing neighborhoods because they are across from the airport, not directly in the flight path. Even homes in the Benton rd area don’t experience much noise pollution from the airport because the engines are at low throttle during landing.

Also, there are no restrictions on the airport. Planes can take-off and land 24/7. I’ve never been woken up due to this, but I have been awake at 0430 and heard planes taking off on a few occasions.

Anyhow, that’s my take on it.

">they said if nobody hit each other etc then there’s nothing they can do??

Sounds like a bunch of crap to me. They can pull someone over for just about anything - ""following too closely"" can certainly be twisted into some interpretation of reckless driving. Any ""normal"" person evading a traffic stop would get a gun in their face and a few nights in jail at a minimum. I stand by my assessment - it was either an off duty cop, some other fed, or a relative of one.

>Like we can really rely on them when there’s a serious problem obviously lol

I live in French Valley.  We use Temecula’s school district.  So the schools are good and area is fairly crime free.  You can still get a nice single story 3br house with a small yard for the mid to upper 500’s.  Not sure for how much longer though.  I don’t think you can find homes in Temecula for the 500’s anymore.  Unless it’s a real “fixer upper”.  I definitely prefer French Valley over Hemet or Menifee.

"I think the Fresno area would also work for you in CA.. One of my employees just bought a house in the 500s up there.  We just moved to Murrieta from Orange County, CA and it's VERY affordable down here compared to OC.  

Also #1, don't expect the market is going to cool any time soon.. I'd buy ASAP if I were you.  

Also #2, be very careful looking in the Murrieta/Temecula area as new homes or newer construction can carry quite a premium when it comes to the property taxes.  If you're interested in a house, look up their property bill on the Riverside county tax collector's office and look at how the taxes are calculated.  There's usually a 1.% tax rate that you'll want to re-calculate at the same 1.% x your purchase price plus some properties carry special assessments that tend to be flat $##.  Add the two together to determine what your new annual taxes will be and factor that into your decision.  Older homes that are 20 or more years old tend to carry very little if any special assessments whereas newer homes will carry more.  DO NOT USE THE EXISTING ASSESSED TAX AMOUNT AS AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOUR FUTURE TAXES WILL BE OR YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET BURNED. 

Also #3, keep an eye on the HOA fees as that will also add a significant amount to your mortgage payment.

"Try Dr. Cho (he took over Dr. Nelson’s practice) on Jefferson by the old Sizzler.  He is independent and prices used to be very reasonable, but I haven’t seen him in a few years.

Also, there is Dr. Dave Cutts on Margarita and Paula in that little strip plaza by TVHS.  He is my new dentist and I really like him.  Cleaning and check up’s are very reasonable $199 and only cleaning $99 or $89...BUT, if you need more you may have to outside Temecula.  I just had a cracked tooth and needed a root canal, etc.  this tooth is costing me $4,000!!!  I cannot stand the dentists on my HMO plan, so I just put a little away every month for my teeth.

You will love it here. It's unbeatable quality of life in most regards.

I just visited Florida to visit my wife's family in the Bradenton area.  I was SHOCKED how expensive homes were plus there running costs. Water bills are $300/m.  Gas is almost double. Electricity rates are higher. The propert tax rates were also very high.

No state income tax was the only benefit but after everything considered, there wasn't much of a difference in total costs.

Having a modern, functioning city takes money to run.

"Temecula all the way up to Riverside is heavily conservative, however it sounds like you’re all going off of some weird backwards stereotype of what these people are. I’m not aligned with either party, but I will tell you the reason this place is not destroyed like LA or SF, is that they don’t vote for the same policies you’re fleeing from, again, I would leave your politics in the city you’re running from. It’s safe here because they’re tough on crime, and they don’t allow for all of the sickness with drugs and homelessness to develop through what appears to be compassionate policy, those policies are destroying lives and making the coastal cities uninhabitable.

It’s very expensive to become a realtor and if you’re not the listing agent right now you will have a very hard time and be out of pocket.  The fees go up faster than anything I’ve ever seen - worse than the average HOA fees for any home owner.  There are other avenues you can pursue. Escrow agent or TC -transaction coordinator that process all these home sales.  They work constantly and get paid more steadily.

"If you’re going around starting political conversations with random people, I gotta say we’ve all been online and understand how volatile the conversations can turn, why even put yourself in that situation  talking about politics (general statement not a personal assumption about you).

We’re never changing peoples minds, we’ve had different life experiences that have lead us to different opinions and a lot of people lack that understanding and empathy to that fact.

"I love Temecula too and I’m a Democrat.  We do have Trumper’s in my neighborhood but most try & keep their opinions *less* displayed. We now only have one (college age) with his Trump flags on his truck parked on street for all to see. Also most of my anti vax neighbors all caught Covid and don’t spew their crazy anti-vax messages anymore.  Temecula is gorgeous  and slowly turning more blue.  I actually saw Biden bumper stickers in my neighborhood.  An Obama bumper sticker would’ve had your car keyed in 2008.  So that’s progress.  Prior to election there was several MAGA rallies at our Duck Pond ( the Tea Party held rallies their too in 2008).  Now, after January 6th the Trumper’s are much less noticeable.   So that’s the politics side.

Now, Temecula Balloon & Wine Festival is in early June and fabulous also the Crush in the Fall (when local eateries & vineyards all come together with live bands too.  Truly awesome).  I never get tired of Wine Country either.  I have lived here almost 15 years.   We have Farmers market on Saturday mornings in Old Town.  Goat & Vine in Old Town is my favorite restaurant.  Comedy clubs/improv & Trivia nights can be found but kinda disappeared during Covid so keep an eye out for that returning.  The Coin Op (Old School video games is charmingly retro & fun).  Local Theater has tremendous plays & local talent & childrens theater.  We have a museum in Old Town too.  If you have kids, you must take them to PennyPickles workshop in OldTown too.  Temecula is the Napa or Sonoma of Inland Empire.  It’s a gem.  The weather is two seasons mostly Spring & Fall-  but in August & September is 110 in the shade.  Driving thru the vineyards helped me to when the world shut down.  My daughter & I called them our lockdown drives.  The natural beauty kept us sane.  Some music, some mountains & forests make the world a better place.  The schools are excellent too.

"at the end of the day, it's still California and we're near 2 large democratic cities, the republicans here aren't too bad as long as you're friendly and don't talk about politics, hopefully you decide to move here! we definitely need more blue votes in the area and I think by the next election that's possible",t2_1stw0d9x,JattKhalsa,0,1645996557.0,0,t1_hyozklj,hyozklj,False,Easy_Toast,t3_t2o39z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temecula/comments/t2o39z/moving_to_temecula_in_august_question_about_the/,"Moving to Temecula in August, question about the political climate",/r/Temecula/comments/t2o39z/moving_to_temecula_in_august_question_about_the/hyozklj/,4,r/Temecula,0,4
"I just moved here, super liberal and wear a turban (practicing sikh) 
I haven't had any issues with anyone so far everyones been super nice and friendly, as long as we don't talk about politics lol
But I have gotten a few stares some out of curiosity but some I can tell are just plain dirty stares 😂
I usually give them a super dirty stare back and they'll look away 
You'll find quite a lot of other liberals in the area!
The trumpies just like to show their ""patriotism"" a lot more that's all 😂",t2_1stw0d9x,JattKhalsa,0,1645996348.0,0,t1_hyoz1n6,hyoz1n6,True,Easy_Toast,t3_t2o39z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temecula/comments/t2o39z/moving_to_temecula_in_august_question_about_the/,"Moving to Temecula in August, question about the political climate",/r/Temecula/comments/t2o39z/moving_to_temecula_in_august_question_about_the/hyoz1n6/,8,r/Temecula,0,8

We moved here this year and are very liberal.  There are a lot of conservatives and conservative bible thumpers.  Overall we have found everyone really friendly.  Let's all remember to VOTE and see if we can change the political climate here.  Voting by mail is very easy in CA.  The I15 gets a bit jammed during commute hours.

"Come on guys no matter what political affiliation you have people still have more in common than they have differences. 
I think you guys pay attention to social media too much and are learning to paint with broad strokes! 
I’ve lived in Temecula 25 years I’m very conservative and I’ve had political  differences with people here but never a problem. It’s a great mix of people here with plenty of diversity and you can become understanding and learn to compromise here, so hurry up an move here all ready are New Democratic socialist neighbor.",t2_673dcnxb,Nacho_Beardre,0,1645988966.0,0,t1_hyogf5q,hyogf5q,True,Easy_Toast,t3_t2o39z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temecula/comments/t2o39z/moving_to_temecula_in_august_question_about_the/,"Moving to Temecula in August, question about the political climate",/r/Temecula/comments/t2o39z/moving_to_temecula_in_august_question_about_the/hyogf5q/,4,r/Temecula,0,4
"The area is nice. Cheaper housing than other places in SoCal (though prices are quickly going up). Crime rate is low. And school districts are generally pretty high regarded.

Like others mentioned, you see trucks with trump flags around. That’s the most I see about politics. Idk where people go where they’re constantly running into everyone that only talk politics. 

I’ve lived in San Bernardino county, Orange County, and LA county and this is my preferred area by far.
