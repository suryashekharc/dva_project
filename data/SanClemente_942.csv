Cox has definitely monopolized the area 100% I live in the pier bowl and the internet is god AWFUL. They ran me around for a few months and finally I got to the bottom of the issue. The wiring infrastructure is wildly out of date/not sufficient for the amount of users and we all get lower than advertised speeds and lag spikes that slow our speeds to a crawl. I’ve lived elsewhere in town and had reliable connection but something about the pier bowl and certain alcoves in town having bad wiring. The tech told me initially they would be changing the node box on the street to upgrade in Jan but still having issues. Also it’s good to know that they offer a “pay as you go” option for people who don’t want full service. Check your wireless connections and see if there is a “cox wifi” if so that is drained directly from the paying customers without even asking as you can pay 20$ for a week wifi pass with no router needed. They are a scam and I hate the fact we have to solely use them with zero alternatives.,t2_hwptenf,PersonPicture,0,1644438605.0,0,t1_hw9t1wd,hw9t1wd,False,lizdotgov,t3_som2dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanClemente/comments/som2dm/opinions_on_internet_providers/,Opinions on Internet Providers,/r/SanClemente/comments/som2dm/opinions_on_internet_providers/hw9t1wd/,5,r/SanClemente,0,5
"In many places your only option will be Cox, they’ve basically got a monopoly in the area. I’ve never had many reliability issues with them, but the price is ridiculous.

I recently moved to North Beach and AT&T gigabit fiber was available for a much better rate than Cox offered ($60/month for the first year, $80/month after that) so I jumped on it. It’s been great.

"I've lived in Talega 20 years now.  It's a great place to live.  I know lots of people with 2 and 3 dogs and haven't heard of any kind of limitations on the # of pets you can have.  There are lots of trails to walk on and I've met many friendly dogs and their people over the years on them.

There are for sure rules, and I'd advise you to understand them before you move in.  Street parking overnight is the biggest one but it's really not a big deal.  

To clear up a couple of points:

You can park on the street overnight - just get a pass at Patrol-One.com.  Limited to 7 nights per month, per car.  I rotated 4 cars on a weekly basis for a while.  😂 You get 3 warnings before being towed.  Ask my teenage son how I know this...  Also if you have a kid home from collage or something staying with you for summer, you can get a street parking pass for the duration.  I do it every summer for my kids.

No problem working on projects in the garage.  I've been wood working, metal working, or doing mechanics on my cars since I've been here.  Never had any issues.

Plants - They do prohibit ""invasive species"" which in my mind is a good thing.  Artificial grass and water-wise plants are fine and you are ""technically"" supposed to get an approved landscaping plan.  No problem with putting solar on your house either.  

On the downside, it's incredibly expensive here and going up by the month.  I'm talking $1M houses a year ago is now going for $1.5M+.

Is Talega for everyone?  No way.  But if you like a clean, orderly community, maybe it is for you.",t2_sp9v,h3yrick,0,1630556425.0,0,t1_hb9zkvw,hb9zkvw,True,[deleted],t3_pfrwrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanClemente/comments/pfrwrm/dog_restrictions_in_talega/,Dog Restrictions in Talega,/r/SanClemente/comments/pfrwrm/dog_restrictions_in_talega/hb9zkvw/,3,r/SanClemente,0,3
"You should be fine With three dogs but the hoa in talega is one of the strictest I’ve ever encountered. Prepare for them to have a say in absolutely anything you want to do in your house, and don’t ever park on the street overnight or you will be immediately towed. They are super strict about enforcing their rules. Wanna work on projects in your garages? Not allowed, strictly for cars, can’t even use the garage as storage. Wanna plant some flowers or something in your front or backyard? Must get it approved with detailed plans first, and all plants must be on their approved aesthetic lists.. honestly so glad to not live in talega anymore.

[Don’t Be Gullible: Being Aware of Genealogical Fraud (Part One)](https://blog.ancestorcloud.com/2017/01/26/dont-be-gullible-being-aware-of-genealogical-fraud-part-one/)

> In 2012 news broke of an identity theft ring operating through a paid subscriber to Ancestry.com. The woman was mining information from birth records and the Social Security database, primarily selling them for the purpose of filing fraudulent tax returns. Changes were made and now only Social Security numbers of persons who have been deceased ten years or more are accessible on the site.

"Aliso Viejo is more suburban but it is more affordable. Not a far drive from Laguna Beach & Dana Point. Also close to Irvine, SNA airpot and all major highways/toll roads.

"I found this on fb. Here’s the text and link. 


Hi, I’m trying to help this young man. We found him roaming the highway near Loreto, Baja California Mexico hills which is about 12 to 14 hours driving distance from the nearest US border.
His name is Duke Thomas Sechler
His father's name is Jeff Thomas Sechler. Mother's name Elaine. Sisters Elaine and Deborah. Older brother Seth
Lacks coherent speech 
His birthdate is April 15, 1994
He is about 6'2"", thin about 150 to 170 pounds.
Wearing the same clothes in the picture
White, dirty blonde or hazel color hair, and blue eyes. 
He is from San Clemente, CA
Initially, we gave him money, food, and water but returned to help him further as he looked long lost. We asked what he wanted and he said he wanted to go back home to work.  We gave him a ride to the nearest Mexican immigration services in Santa Rosalia, Baja California México, about two hours from where we found him, but Mexican immigration was of no help.
He was not found in the Orange County Sheriff Department's  (OCSD) missing person list.
We took him to the nearest US Border Station - Calexico, CA.  We arrived there at around 11 PM on Nov 16, 2020, where Customs agents took him in for re-entry into the US.  I asked the Customs agents to check the national missing person database for him as recommended by the OCSD.  That's as much as I could help.  He should be back in the States, not sure if Customs were able to help further, but this last known location was Calexico, CA West Port of Entry which is immediately located next to Calexico city downtown area (small town) with San Diego to the west and Yuma, AZ to the east (Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico located south of the border).
He says his last known address is: 351 West Escalones, San Clemente, CA 
Favorite band Red Hot Chili Peppers, also likes NSync, American Rejects

"Midday Saturday isn’t usually too bad for getting through LA.

Choke points on I5 southbound last Saturday were at I-210 (ramps from I-5 closed). I think that was real short term, probably won’t still be there when you come down.

Next bad area is construction through Burbank. Sometimes it is faster to take the Hollywood Freeway through downtown LA, other times not. If you have a nav setup with traffic, use it. 

Construction again from just south of Commerce to the Orange County line. Not too bad now compared to a year or so ago.

Once you get into Orange County it should be smooth sailing. The construction from around Lake Forest to about San Juan Capistrano doesn’t (yet) slow down traffic too much.

"The missus, our dog, and I just moved from northern VA to SC a couple months ago. It is great, we got a good spot on Santa Barbara. During our apartment hunt prices fluctuated a lot. One thing we noted was unless we were ready to move in within week(s) of signing most landlords weren't interested which made total sense. Way different from apartment complexes where you can sign months in advance.

We used hot pads for the apartment hunt and finding a place that allowed a dog was a pain. There are few and the majority of them have a weight (not breed) limit. It's funny, I got annoyed with it and started to look without the dog filter, realized many listings did not select a pet policy so I started to reach out to them, came across one that did not explicitly say no dogs, reached out and they wound up accepting the pup.

Great question- all fiscal paths need to be explored and re-evaluated to determine priority with transparency to residents.  There is outdoor space at most school sites used for lunches and recess.

"This is a perfect example of completely contradictory thinking. Self awareness is needed. 

Let’s get some things straight. Are there some bad apples in every group of people? Yes. Does that include cops? Yes. Yet you’re claiming that because of trends we see in society, there is a problem with 100% of the police force, that they are racist without there being proof of it if there is a shooting involving a black person, and we need to do what, in your opinion? Different BLM members propose we defund them entirely and abolish them, strip away their guns, give them more training, the list goes on and on.

You need to learn about how to actually read studies and draw conclusions between all of them, keeping an open mind. The one I linked, and I can link more, repeat over and over again that it’s difficult to even make conclusions on this topic by examining thousands of cases related to race. They don’t even know how to prove it conclusively, and are still researching it; the one I linked said that if anything, trends reflect a disproportionate amount of hate crimes against white people. Yet this entire movement is based on the apparently established fact that cops single out black people on the basis of their skin color, a false premise. Any death of a black person is because of corrupt racism, according to these people. Go read that study, that’s not the case. It has many surprising details that I won’t list here. There are others like it, conducted by universities, it’s not the only one. 
According to you, all cops are guilty until proven innocent based upon flimsy at best logic, but all victims of cops are innocent no matter what evidence there is to suggest otherwise.

If you are a San Clemente resident, be very cautious of your personal contributions to the attention that could be brought to your community given your proximity to LA, a hotspot for riots and civil unrest. The worst, most violent rioters are people mostly concentrated in areas such as Portland and Los Angeles, a hop, skip and jump away from Orange County. 
And j walking shouldn’t even be considered a crime, it’s not deserving of even a fine. Every area of human activity has flaws, including law enforcement, that’s inescapable. Even if we reformed it, its flaws would appear in no time (I hope we do reform it).

We the people don’t have to destroy certain concepts, such as innocent until proven guilty, in order to establish justice for a system that is clearly flawed in many ways, we have to hold a standard of accountability for everyone, and we have to hold a standard of judgment for everyone, including cops.

You say your argument is that the victim deserved a trial. He did. This argument was never about that. This argument was about BLM presence in San Clemente, the citizens of which in this article, are being painted out to be racists. 

Not all situations are the same. Why is Dylan roof relevant? He lived on the other side of the country and his case was handled by a completely different department. Is this discussion about what we personally believe about every individual case, or is this discussion about rule of law and a civilized society? Is this discussion about every shooting ever, or is this discussion about a cop who killed someone four days ago, that people are already writing biased articles about, that people are defending at the cost of their own community should the rest of the country decide that everyone there is a white supremacist? 

I’m not afraid whatsoever, because I’m armed. I’m afraid of no one attacking me.

No wonder you're afraid if you're buying into rhetoric like that. 

You say I can't know anything until there is an investigation. First of all, I can say Kurt did not deserve to die without a trial of any kind. It doesn't matter if he reached for the gun (and we dont know if he did). The police are supposed to be able to incapacitate people, without killing them. 

Other countries manage it. Police in the UK don't even carry guns, but can still manage to arrest and give a trial to even the worst criminals. 

Second of all, police in the US have managed to arrest many of the worst cold blooded murderers without killing them. In one famous case, they even bought the mass murderer burger king on the way to the station.

"You surmise that from some comments on reddit? Cut out the psychological evaluations from now on, and argue based on the facts. 
A jury is not the system that you’re speaking of, a jury is a group of citizens who are part of the community they’re serving for in that court case. To claim that our entire system is broken to the point that the court of public opinion is more valid than our justice system is absurd, especially when pieces laced with the journalist’s opinion, like this one, are taken as fact. And the answer to the court systems being broken isn’t to riot, block traffic, attack people walking in their own cities, set things on fire, and so forth. That’s why San Clemente’s people are unwelcome of BLM, not because they’re a bunch of racists trying to protect the KKK. 
People die, that’s life. Am I going to riot in the streets with a movement that aligns itself with falsehoods? That slanders people the day of the incidents? Read this https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877 

I wasn’t there, I have some grainy videos to go by. Do I want people to die? No. But it happens and then vitriol is spun by certain organizations who create upheavals over misconstrued stories and blatant lies, costing the lives of officers involved who were upholding their oath- by protecting society at large, not one individual person whose behaviors I don’t know of yet, because hardly any information is known about in this case. I’m supposed to believe some random lady who says he’s a nice person? Nah, I’ve been around the block a few times and am familiar with journalism. Do I trust police just because they’re police? Mostly. Does that make me a sheep? No. That’s based on observation and experience, and the statistical fact that I am more likely to die because of a dog attacking me than I am a crooked officer, and statistically, that goes for black people as well.
Also, which laws were the ones that forced an officer to kill someone? I’m not aware of any laws that exist that tell officers to kill people.

"I think there’s a lot going on that you don’t fully understand, or choose to willfully ignore. I think a lot of the downvotes aren’t necessarily calling you wrong, however just downvoting what appears to be a bad faith argument.

I don’t pretend to be the brightest, but I’ll do my best to explain it to you better.

The laws that the police officers obeyed is the problem. So a trial of his peers won’t matter as its the laws that need to change. If we’re measuring people on a broken system then it doesn’t matter. The trial only sparked more outrage as this is something that should not have happened from the start. Why is there not more footage, more body cams, why isn’t there a clear report? There are certainly more questions, and I think the issue isn’t so much whether or not the police broke the law, but the fact that a person is dead at the hands of people sworn to protect her.

I understand some things are complicated, but the simplest way to put it: this should not have happened like this, full stop. - I think you can at least agree with that, and if you can agree with that then you can at least stand by us and demand a change to the system designed to protect us.",t2_2nusojq,CheeksMix,0,1601181848.0,0,t1_g6sawaz,g6sawaz,False,Exastiken,t3_j0hq8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanClemente/comments/j0hq8t/orange_county_coastal_enclave_becomes_ground_zero/,Orange County Coastal Enclave Becomes Ground Zero of Police Violence Controversy and Protests,/r/SanClemente/comments/j0hq8t/orange_county_coastal_enclave_becomes_ground_zero/g6sawaz/,7,r/SanClemente,0,7

Take a video circulating a few months ago, of a “racist Karen attacking an innocent black woman and her daughter”, as an example. Everyone reamed the (pregnant) white woman because the video showed her pointing a gun at the two black women. Her husband lost his job over it. 
Turns out, a good few minutes of the incident hadn’t been shown. And what happened? The black women were harassing her, blocking her from being able to leave, she continually tried to neutralize the situation as her husband escorted her safely to her vehicle, and they refused to stop screaming and threatening her, until eventually one followed her car out into the parking lot, hit it, while screaming she would “beat their white asses.”

"Well there’s a ton of issue such as San Clemente police not having mandatory police body cameras. Even then, they don’t get enforced till July next year. The Homeless man (name William) was family friends with the man who videotape the confrontation and was considered a great guy, the only issue was that his vision was going away, but the Florist and 7/11 cashiers said he was a great guy who would come by and ask for money or help moving around. 

Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more protests because of it.

So we can all agree that jaywalking isn't something that should result in a police shooting, but

\- If I didn't want to stop and talk to them, I wouldn't expect them to just let me ignore them and walk away.

\- If I was combative I'd expect them to put me on the ground.

\- If I was wrestling with them and got into a dominant position where I could do them real harm, I'd expect them to shoot me.

Also, take into account that the temperature is essentially the same year-round: winter cold is ""maybe I should bring a sweater"" and summer heat is ""fuck wearing socks until October...or maybe Thanksgiving.""

"You can definitely find spots for under $2,000 around here, but it will take some patience and persistence. For the most part they will be one bedroom, small, and on the older side. Sometimes you'll get lucky and find a sweet spot that exceeds your expectations for the price... Usually put up by a nice older couple who aren't trying to be your typical ""landlords"". But you can bet those places go fast.

For instance, my girlfriend and I just moved into a 2 bedroom apartment, $2200 per month, right across the street from an empty lot on the cliff so there's an ocean view from the deck. It's awesome, but we paid close attention to Zillow for 3 months before we moved on this one. We signed the papers 5 days after it went on the market.

I love San Clemente, but if you don't find an amazing place at the right price I recommend checking out Oceanside/Carlsbad. Similar vibes as far as ""beach town"" goes, but it's younger and more up-and-coming while also being a little cheaper. There's more to do and the food is better.

However, I think they’re just that; our most vocal group. I’m not sure I would say there is an overwhelming majority of conservatives living here, but they definitely do tend to be the loudest. I went to the San Clemente Black Lives Matter expecting another 10 people to attend and was so pleasantly surprised to be joining another couple hundred (to be fair though, I should mention there were a handful of town nazi’s heckling us along the way). If you are moving to Orange County, I would also argue that San Clemente would be one of the more liberal towns, after Irvine and a handful of other cities. 

That all be said, change happens when people like you move to town, please know that there are many of us who would welcome you with open arms!",t2_7lxuq3id,H_D_R_C,0,1599518804.0,0,t1_g4dx8oj,g4dx8oj,False,dnkwtu,t3_iog096,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanClemente/comments/iog096/is_san_clemente_right_for_me/,Is San Clemente right for me?,/r/SanClemente/comments/iog096/is_san_clemente_right_for_me/g4dx8oj/,8,r/SanClemente,0,8
"Short answer: no, you will not like it here, unless you’re comfortable seeing San Clemente as a beautiful place while ignoring the political/social environment. But yes, there’s a place for you here.

San Clemente is extremely conservative, and in general, so is south Orange County. As the other comment is alluding to, the county is potentially heading in a better direction, but to say “come join us liberals,” that is an overstatement. “We” make up a very small population and I would add that most liberals are moderate. I can only contribute this to the fact that the population of San Clemente is relatively old. If you want a sneak peak of the underbelly of San Clemente, take a look at the Facebook groups like “San Clemente Life” or any of the “uncensored” pages. If I haven’t swayed you away from San Clemente just yet, take a look at this video (https://youtu.be/Dn-gHeOnL9c), it’s satire but the responses will give you some insight into the Qanon following here and the numerous people who have never taken the pandemic seriously (most people don’t wear masks in public or follow social distancing mandates).

"Right now, with Covid 19, many universities are online only or are restricting new international student acceptance. 

You would have to find a semester or year-long program at a university and go through the process to apply to go to school there (and therefore be able to get a visa) before you could get an internship. In the California, internships must either be paid or for educational credit. Educational credit internships must have credits accepted towards your degree and must be educational, not doing actual ""work"". Visas make this increasingly difficult as there are limitations.

You may not even be able to legally work off-campus if you do enroll in a US university because F-1 visas restrict employment:  [https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment) 

Since you have your BArch already, you may instead have to look for direct-hire internships but those can be very, very competitive. In the US, architecture graduates must spend years as interns before they are qualified to become full-time architects. You must be able to pay for travel, housing, food, and insurance on your own since many of these internships will be low paid positions.

"No.

We are just going to have to disagree.

You call it ""good faith"" and think there is a ""spike in cases"".

I call it government overreach, and by no means is the number of ""cases"" a problem since there is more than enough hospital capacity for potential cases.

By citing ""spike in cases"" you are moving the goal posts since there is no hospital capacity problem, which was the fundamental reason for the ""lock down"".
