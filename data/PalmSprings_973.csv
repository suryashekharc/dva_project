"I’ve lived in Palm Springs for the last three months having lived in Washington state most of my life.  

Things I like:
45-55 mph on city streets.
Lush gardens 
Cops seem cool 
Couldn’t ask for better winter weather
1:45 to Laguna if you crave ocean. Also, close mountains, Joshua Tree, etc.
Seems like the desert cities have a lot of big city attractions like big name tennis and golf tournaments, mid-tier and up entertainers, and festivals.
50+ crowd seems agile and spry compared to other places.  This weather seems good for longevity.
Things I don’t care for:
Short turn lanes make for long waits at lights if you’re going left during rush hour.
Incessant wind
Blowing sand
Hard to enjoy a grassy park (like Ruth Hardy) without dog walkers everywhere.
Lack of public restrooms.
Restaurants seem chronically understaffed and even when I place a mobile order well in advance they often don’t start it until after I wait in a long line. 
Plenty of shade parking at schools. Why not at shopping centers and parks? 
I know flash floods are a thing but do we really need massive dips at intersections that cause some folks to slow to a crawl to cross?
Landscapers bring traffic cones and shut down lanes where it isn’t necessary.
Inconsistent four-way stop behavior. Part of the problem is that people aren’t actually stopping, but rolling and improvising.  If I come to a complete stop, it seems to make it worse.
Broken sprinklers with massive water waste seems to be a thing.",t2_d193nu9x,DiligentExample207,0,1648033925.0,0,t1_i1s432x,i1s432x,True,tripacrossamerica,t3_tkc4c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/tkc4c9/palm_canyon_dr_palm_springs_ca_2022/,"Palm Canyon Dr., Palm Springs, CA, 2022",/r/palmsprings/comments/tkc4c9/palm_canyon_dr_palm_springs_ca_2022/i1s432x/,1,r/palmsprings,0,1

"Wondering when ""a couple of weeks"" might land?

Only because Coachella (aka Glastonbury of the Desert) is coming in mid-April, which might make availability of places even more challenging.

Farm is one of our more ""white tablecloth"" kinds of places - they may be able to accommodate but check with them.

If you are willing to venture a bit away from downtown, there's a great new place called Willie's in Rancho Mirage. Same great small local restaurant group that also owns/runs 849, Roly China Fusion & 1501 Uptown Gastropub. Willie's is a bit more high end $$$ but very good.

"Rentals are almost impossible. They were never plentiful here - few apartment buildings (a big chunk are on the south side of PS) and most homes for rent are managed as vacation rentals.

You probably want to be south of where the hospital is unless you like constant wind. You may find more availability as you go farther away from PS.

Your budget may make a difference. If you have over $2000 or $2500 you may find something more easily. In many places, you will have to show proof that your salary is 3x the price of rent. There are some people who rent and work here who live 45-60 minutes away, because towns like Beaumont, Hemet, etc are the nearest affordable ones.

(I know Ponoma's 90 minutes away but for real, if you were in Redlands or Riverside I'd tell you to stay and deal w/the commute.)

I would have whoever's working at the hospital (sorry, I wasn't sure if it was you or fiance) and ask them if they have any resources or if they connect people with a realtor.

"The Saguaro and Ace are both prime spots for 25y.o LA party scene, if you really are trying to avoid that, those are top of the list to avoid.

Caliente Tropics is probably your best bet in that area, but will be a risk for children at the pool.

If you are spending time east valley, you might consider hotels in Palm Desert and Indian Wells - Shadow Mountain is a good value and location, not flashy, but well maintained.

You are in luck for tacos, the valley has top notch Mexican food - and I spent the last 20 years in San Diego. Cathedral City and east valley cities are hotspots for great authentic spots that easily rival what you find in San Diego.

Salsas, Taqueria San Miguel, and Tortillas are our favorites in Cat City.

"To answer some of the questions I've read throughout this post....

Spring break is happening NOW. By the time you'd be here in May, most colleges are wrapping up for the semester and academic year. Coachella will be done as well.

Your goal for $200 a night will be challenging but not impossible. You may find something because of your timing - May is generally when the snowbirds leave, as it starts getting really hot then. I'm not sure you'll get something with a great pool scene at that budget, though. Travel & hotels seem to be astronomically expensive this year any and everywhere you go, because of the pent up demand from COVID.

As for great food, there isn't a lot. Our two biggest audiences here are tourists and old people who think mayonnaise is spicy, so a lot of what's made here tends to land on the bland/middle of the road side. (Others have decent suggestions but tbh in any of the things I've tried, I wasn't overly thrilled.)

In fact, to be honest, looking at your dates? If you are renting a car, you should consider spending a few days in San Diego, or somewhere on the coast. SD in particular would give you some seriously great, authentic Mexican food. You could still have two or three days in PS/Bombay Beach area, too. And there's a wide range of hotel options there and slightly outside of the city that could be affordable. Just a thought. (We often did the same before we lived here - came for a week and spent a few days in PS and a few in either SD or LA/Long Beach.)",t2_1ztrsw3n,WavingOrDrowning,0,1647359422.0,0,t1_i0rg8ac,i0rg8ac,True,Slash_Dementia_67,t3_tehvy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/tehvy5/hotels_tacos_etc/,"Hotels & Tacos, etc.",/r/palmsprings/comments/tehvy5/hotels_tacos_etc/i0rg8ac/,3,r/palmsprings,0,3

I think Spectrum is the only real option in PS proper.  We have the 400mb tier and it’s fine for video conferencing during the day & streaming TV at night.  And it’s been pretty reliable for $50/mo.  The killer is the upload speed though.  Sitting beside my router (wi-fi) I’m seeing 235 down/22 up.

"To kill time I suggest Oak Glen. It’s 15/20 minutes off the freeway, up the mountain a bit on your way from the airport. They are a beautiful little u-pick farm area. They specialize in apples but depending on the season have berries, pears, peaches, etc. They have a village with tons of old fashioned food, desert and candy options as well as decor and souvenirs. Great antique shops. 

Each farm is a little different. 

I love Snow-line for their mini apple cider donuts and amazing wine and hard cider. The best apples I’ve ever had come from here 🤤 The staff is the sweetest. Even the farm hands tending to the field are so patient when people get it their way. Great raspberry field right next to the grass picnic area. 

Riley’s was great but the owner is a very opinionated man who treats his employees terribly. I refuse to support his business anymore. 

Rio’s has self guided nature paths and amazing pies. They also have BBQ. 

We usually hit at least two farms, Snow-line for donuts and a picnic then to Rio’s for pie and ice cream on the way back down the mountain. It’s easily done in a couple hours if your not looking to spend too much time exploring. 

Yucaipa and Beaumont have great antique stores as well but I wouldn’t spend time in Beaumont doing anything but antique shopping and checking out local farms. Very hit and miss area as far as inviting and touristy. 


On the right of the 10 (the freeway to PS) about 20 minutes up that mountain is Idyllwild. They’re a small touristy town worth some exploring. Great antique shops and cute restaurants. 

Temecula is out of the way. You’d be flying in then going the opposite way to get there. Even for a tasting, you’re correct, most would be closed. Dinner and a tasting at a restaurant would still work. If you’re going for a vineyard tour and tasting, stay in Temecula, schedule it for the morning and enjoy lunch at one of the many amazing places that usually also have wine and cider tastings. 

If you do go don’t miss Villa Di Calabro’s olive oil tasting. They have a wine and olive oil tasting as well as the most amazing peach sangria. Gorgeous little patio garden area right in the middle of down town Temecula. Their Rosemary olive oil on a steak is incredible. 

Call and find out but if you get to town earlier than check in most hotels will hold your luggage. This is most helpful after checking out but it could help before in your case. 

Cabazon is a huge gross casino. I felt dirty after touching the check in counter. Rooms are decent but the atmosphere is ehh. The pool area is awesome if not over run by people not handling their liquor well (holidays get nuts). So if you’re looking to gamble or chill by the pool it could work for you. There are outlet malls and bowling near by but not much else. 

Cabazon does have a travel center with cheaper gas prices. Hadley’s, an old school type farm stand turned bigger better store is next to it. Their date shakes are amazing! They usually have other local produce and snacks as well. 

We’re SoCal so there’s a ton to do within a couple hours any way of us. If you don’t mind driving more I can keep giving suggestions. East of PS also has tons of interesting things to explore. 

I hope this helps.

"What do you consider cool? A contemporary condo downtown? An indoor / outdoor pool with a midmod in suburbia? A trailer with lots of empty desert with a dragon sculpture in progress? Price range would be good to know too. 

I live in the design district, which is north'ish and love it, the winds here just make the palm trees russle and dance, but there are areas where they can be too much, but occasionally that is true everywhere in the valley. Noise can be a problem everywhere, you don't want to be on the flight path, even in Rancho.

You might want to be careful buying next to resorts. Their rhythm of noise is kind of opposite to normal living. Hotel guests are here to party and don't particularly care about the long-term relationship with their neighbors. I have a friend who moved to the other side of his apartment complex just to get farther away from the neighboring resort's pool.

"Downtown Palm Springs is incredibly gay friendly. Another poster here replied ""literally anywhere"" and this is really mostly true.

PS is not exclusively gay, but let's just say that in most downtown bars and restaurants, you wouldn't have to look far for a friendly face. But those faces will have a few lines and wrinkles...there's a reason PS is known as God's Waiting Room!

Some restaurants are LGBT owned or launched by LGBT folks, including Trio and Roly China Fusion. Farm is definitely the most high end, white tablecloth restaurant in downtown, and there are a few others. But PS cuisine is mostly aimed at tourists - middle of the road stuff best described by the word ""inoffensive.""

"I bring up housing because California ranks 49th/ 50 states in housing production. We’ve not been building enough homes since the 70s & the Valley prefers building luxury golf resort communities as opposed to middle class single family housing or middle class apartment housing so that does exasperate the issue when there’s not enough housing because it drives up the cost of rent on even lackluster housing & that affects people when the value of their income can’t cover their housing costs.

"Across the desert, the homeless population has been growing for a few years but I’d say certain areas have more concentrated populations & Palm Springs, DHS, & Indio have it the worst. There used to be two homeless shelters in the Valley, one in DHS, one in Indio. A few years back the city voted to close down the homeless shelter in DHS. So now only the Indio one is left in the east Valley. The problem is the shelter in Indio is always full & it’s on one end of the Valley, so everyone on the West end of the Valley has to find transportation to the east valley for a chance at a spot which is never guaranteed, & so many of them just choose to stay in place in Palm Springs or DHS. Palm Springs has the strip in downtown + a welfare office, Palm Desert has El Paseo + the mall + the college, La Quinta has Old Town, Indio has the courthouse + jail & a casino + a welfare office, Rancho Mirage has the River, Cat City has the Mary Pickford + a casino now + a welfare office = all of these places are hubs for the homeless to panhandle, find food, find shelter.",t2_d6vqovtu,peacelovelesbians,0,1645246710.0,0,t1_hxjk3q2,hxjk3q2,False,gomphosis,t3_svlzr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/svlzr6/how_safe_is_it_to_walk/,How safe is it to walk?,/r/palmsprings/comments/svlzr6/how_safe_is_it_to_walk/hxjk3q2/,3,r/palmsprings,0,3
"Yeah I don’t know if other areas have as bad of addiction issues as the desert does, but since we’ve been a meth & heroin haven for a few decades— that really affects our homeless hard. I’d say 8/10 homeless in the area have addiction issues, & mental health issues goes hand in hand with that. It’s not that homeless people in the area are a nuisance, it’s that they’re all addicted to drugs & that brings a slew of issues (aggression often being one). People used to just move out of the low desert to the hi desert areas when they’d be down on their luck but now even the hi desert is becoming expensive & there’s such a lack of housing options that it’s not as easy to just move north anymore.

"A lot of the homeless population in Palm Springs are on drugs, & some are aggressive. I’d agree with the person who said it’s nothing compared to LA/ NY & some other areas of the country, but that’s also not to say it doesn’t happen. I worked on the strip last year off Baristo & we had security outside our work for a reason. You do encounter some aggressive homeless people but more so like shouting/ yelling at nothing or random people walking by, catcalling especially when they’re in groups of older men, & I’ve seen fights happen but amongst themselves not necessarily against random civilians.

"I think you'll definitely enjoy Joshua Tree and/or Coachella and those should be easy and smooth experiences. The Atlas Obscura stuff is good too.

Did you just randomly plan this visit? Or did you time it to coincide with [Modernism Week](https://modernismweek.com/)? If you didn't know, Modernism Week is starting today. It is probably the biggest event to draw people to PS and one of the few that actually has people IN Palm Springs (vs Coachella or the tennis tournaments).

At almost any other time of year you could easily book a guided house tour, but this weekend may be a challenge, as many things for Modernism Week have been booked months in advance (and some events related to Modernism week are [sold out](https://modtix.com/e/mw22)).

Most restaurants will have a wait (and make sure you look at the most [updated info on COVID](https://www.palmspringsca.gov/government/covid-19-updates) here as you may be asked at some restaurants). A few of the very high end ones like Farm will likely require a reservation. But there's a lot to choose from in downtown.

"I moved here last year so I'll share some of my experiences from living here so far.

I have a unit that backs up to the wash. There are homeless people walking around and some under the bridge, however the police seem to come by nearly every day and so a lot of them scatter away towards the KFC or closer to Wang's. I feel pretty secure living here with the gates closing at night and the cops are really fast to respond here. 

My backyard has a pool and spa but not much else. Some units' yards are too small for pools. This can be a negative if you really want a pool and a yard. For me, other than the pool, I'm happy to not have a lot of upkeep in the backyard.

The neighbors (on my street) all seem really nice. It's mostly gay men and a few straight families. I've got to know a few of them as we commiserate some of the things that weren't completed in their homes on time.

Speaking of which, there were a LOT of incomplete repairs after moving in. It was annoying to have to be on top of contacting them, coordinating, waiting around for them to show, etc. There's still some repairs that Toll Brothers is aware of but we don't yet have a firm date for the repairs yet. Though the building manager is very respectful and helpful, the Toll Brothers management for this location was really poor. So many homes closed here with things that should've been repaired before closing. My neighbors had the same problems. Toll Brothers do send out people to make the repairs but the process is slow, which is really unfortunate. I put the blame on the higher ups at Toll Brothers who pushed for earlier closings to make their bonuses. So, if you do decide to move here, (on the walkthrough) and 2nd walkthrough, be sure to note every little scratch, check to make sure that all of the drawers close properly, check for paint splatters under sinks and poorly detailed painting around the bottom and edges of doors and on each step of your stairs. I'd also check to make sure that the garage door closes and opens properly and that they painted the wall where the garage door raises.

For the positives, I do really love living here. The views are fantastic. Most PS homes are one level so you are given one of the most unique views in the city. I also enjoy being able to walk to local gay bars like the Toolshed, PS Airbar, and even to the bars on Arenas. Walking around, it feels like city living and less residential, which for me, is a positive. I also really like that it isn't that windy down here. 

I'm excited for the development across the street, which will make this area even more unique and interesting. I'm also looking forward to the businesses that will open up near the front of the complex. It will make it feel even more like that city feel.

If you ever have any more questions about living here, please feel free to DM me.",t2_3mb9k,mikeyos,0,1645127458.0,0,t1_hxcm98s,hxcm98s,True,sharklasers805,t3_stjrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/stjrpn/cody_place_condos/,Cody Place Condos,/r/palmsprings/comments/stjrpn/cody_place_condos/hxcm98s/,3,r/palmsprings,0,3

"My husband and I live in Cody. We have one of the early phase 2 units along the wash like you were looking at. There's a decent amount of homeless right now in the wash but it's not even as bad as it was a few months ago. It's getting better as people move in. Plus there are big plans to expand the area with more retail and another visitors center. It's an investment in the future of the area right now. It's also very walkable to everywhere.

That being said, the executives on the sales side pushed construction way past the practical limits of our current environment. The core construction is solid, but the sub contractors are all pushed way beyond their limits, after MONTHS we finally had the painters come  to fix issues from our first walk through. That's how far behind they are. It's not just paint, everything is like that. We thought new construction would alleviate some of the stress of buying a new home, it only relieves financial stress (because repairs are free). We basically have to micromanage and nag constantly to get anything done. The work is sloppy and slow. Now that the prices are higher, my suggestion is to buy one that has already closed.

"I really don't want to be a Debbie Downer but my one major big red flag concern would be the homelessness issue.

Cody Place is being developed in an area that has had conflicts with homeless people - in both the areas closer to town as well as farther south on Palm Canyon/111 toward Smoke Tree. Law enforcement has interceded on several occasions and the Starbucks nearby had to close its indoor access because a homeless person was in some way harassing an employee.

Other downtown communities that are in single family home areas are getting hit hard by petty thefts. I think the parallel would be what happens in Hillcrest, but it seems to be very much concentrated in South Palm Springs.

It doesn't mean it would make a unit there unlivable - I agree they do look nice, and Palm Springs & surrounding areas are a bit low on (a) new builds (if that's your focus) and also (b) things that don't look like the lobby of a Cheesecake Factory. But you may want to research it more from that perspective.

PS: Personally, I would sooner buy something small and not a new build than live anywhere north of Vista Chino. I'm on NextDoor, and aside from the usual veiled racism and grumpy get off my lawn style of complaining one expects, it is 24/7 people who live that far north complaining about the wind and the sand.

If it were any other city I'd encourage you to rent before buying here, but rentals are almost non-existent in PS because anything not owner occupied seems to go up for vacation rentals. I am personally hoping the market drops a bit here - it feels a bit overvalued right now.",t2_1ztrsw3n,WavingOrDrowning,0,1645028963.0,0,t1_hx6unnu,hx6unnu,True,sharklasers805,t3_stjrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/stjrpn/cody_place_condos/,Cody Place Condos,/r/palmsprings/comments/stjrpn/cody_place_condos/hx6unnu/,4,r/palmsprings,0,4

"We looked at Cody Place last summer.  The finishes are quite nice inside but it was a bummer that every floor plan is 3-levels and there is really no room for a pool outside (maybe a small spool depending on the lot).  We were moving from the East coast and wanted something more traditionally PS (1 level, some yard, pool/spa, etc.) so we purchased in a less dense community just north of the downtown and was able to get 2 of those 3 things.  We also didn’t like that Cody Place feels a little cut-off from nearby stuff.  Kind of isolated in a no-mans land right now.  That very well might go away with more development though.  It was also maddening that, as we were touring the place, they were giddily updating the pricing sheets b/c they realized they could charge whatever they want.  It was pretty off-putting.

"Year round rentals are either very difficult or impossible here. And it's not only based on your budget - even higher priced year round rentals are next to impossible to get, because so many property owners set their spaces up as short term/vacation rentals, which are more lucrative. 

The thing that a lot of places do that make it even harder is that they make you show proof that your salaries equal 3 times what you pay in rent. So for even a $1500 studio, you'd have to make $4500 a month combined to afford it. (This might be some kind of legal thing in CA, it seemed to be the same everywhere we went when we tried to rent.) 

I've heard in the past about people traveling as far out as Hemet, Beaumont, near Joshua Tree and Coachella to find more affordable spaces.
