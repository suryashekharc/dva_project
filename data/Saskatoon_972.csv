"I don't recall any others on that TV show, but the host has mentioned a few (below) and a some other local restaurants have been mentioned on other TV food shows and in general foodie content.

Prairie Harvest Cafe has been mentioned by John Catucci. Bon Temps Cafe too.

Best in Chow: Burger Wars Saskatoon had three restaurants. Ayden won (it's still available by pre-order and I agree, in fact the best I've had across North America), and the others were Park Cafe and Jerry's.

I remember Homestead Ice Cream on a TV food show or two. And in the national written foodie scene, Primal is known. Jin Jin Dumpling House as well, it has a number of international people who've literally sought it out and reviewed it on food review sites. A few of of those sites have more national and international reviews than local ones. The local foodie scene has more good restaurant recommendations still... a number of our Mexican (and related) restaurants are excellent.

"Most online e-commerce platforms will let you self-build and self-design it for free and only charge you when you want to go live with actual transactions and domain names and particular customizations. Beware; you do not own the website or its assets and are generally not able to transfer your website to better or more competitive service providers. You're renting your own website and are in proprietary lock-in with their platform. Eg. Shopify, Square, etc.

If you want to have a professional take care of the details, ask you the right questions, and you want to actually own your website as an asset, I'd recommend going with an independent website developer because they want to do outstanding work for a fair price. Pricing is usually as flexible or demanding as your website needs are. When you own your website instead of ""rent"" it, there are generally zero limitations and zero lock-in which allows you to customize and grow it exactly how you want over time. If preferred, new or different website developers can be used to continue and extend your website, and hosting can even be separate in order to optimize it and its costs according to your current and new needs.

I don't generally recommend going with a website firm because you have to pay more due to their overhead like receptionists, buildings, etc,. Using a firm is best if you think you'll have a team of employees needing technical support when they're using the website and thus you'll need a pricier support contract with commitments that most independents aren't able to provide.

If you want to seriously compete with other businesses, hire a more pricy marketing firm that also does websites because they provide online marketing services that are built to differentiate and compete against competitors. It's a larger and more long-term investment for businesses that want/need to seriously compete.",t2_emm92fkd,rvision7MD,0,1648258325.0,0,t1_i254jf7,i254jf7,True,Flickirl,t3_tnexoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatoon/comments/tnexoz/ecommerce_website_designers/,ECommerce website designers,/r/saskatoon/comments/tnexoz/ecommerce_website_designers/i254jf7/,1,r/saskatoon,0,1

"I had a terrible experience at FFUN's Volkswagen dealership a few years ago. First I test drove a car and waffled and they called me a few days later to see if I still wanted it and I said yes, but my current car was a drivable total loss, so I took it to SGI to get my money, got a ride to VW to get the car, and when I got there (same day they called me to see if still wanted it) they told me they just sold it. Then they tried to sell me a more expensive car and I said no. Then they said they could bring in the same car I test drove from PA, but they'd have to charge an extra $500 and I said no, so they said they would eat the $500, and I agreed.

Then me being young and stupid came back when the car arrived and signed the contract before seeing the car, and it didn't have several features that the car I test drove had. This, after I specifically asked the salesperson if it was an identical car before agreeing previously. When I confronted the GM, he lied to my face and said it was the same car. I later called a different VW dealership and they confirmed the missing feature was never sold in the trim I ended up with.

Have things gotten this bad in this day and age that people are this  afraid to talk to their fellow neighbor?  

I'm curious what it is about the vehicle owner that makes you think they are an idiot with no empathy?  Is it the vehicle they drive? Are they male?  Do they look poor, or from a rural area?  Or perhaps they are of an ethic group, you dislike?

The owner of the vehicle either is unaware of the issue, is incapable of fixing it, or just doesn't care.  If you reach out and contact them they you can confirm they are aware of the issue, and this would be a perfect time to diagnose and fix the problem.  Ten minutes of your time would be all it would take to stop the noise.  You can teach someone some new skills, and everyone in your neighborhood would appreciate the issue being resolved.

"I mentioned this is another comment, but I'm still going to say this directly:

Based on the info provided in your post, **there is a fairly good chance that your neighbour has no idea this is even happening.** I had a vehicle that did this. It turned out to be a moisture issue with one of the door locks.

I thought it was going off once or twice for a couple minutes every few days. My roommate is the one who pointed out to me that it was actually happening several times a day. I had no idea. I was either not at home, asleep, or had headphones in when it was happening. To make matters worse, it would often shut off on its own. Sometimes, it would go for 10 seconds, sometimes 10 minutes, sometimes I had to physically get in and start my car to make it stop. Then, when I took it in to get fixed, there were shipping delays with the part, and it ended up taking an additional 2 or 3 weeks to finally fix it.

Don't automatically assume your neighbour is an idiot or a jackass. Like I said, they may not even know it's their vehicle doing it! Think about it, if you hear a car alarm that shuts off without you even moving, you probably won't assume it's yours. There's also a chance that they're in the process of fixing it, but it's taking longer than optimal. Maybe it's an expensive fix, and they don't have the cash to deal with it. 

If you don't want confrontation, start by putting a note on their windshield that says, ""just wanted to let you know that your car alarm is going off several times a day and it's disruptive to your neighbours.""",t2_111k2h,slightlyhandiquacked,0,1648232076.0,0,t1_i23g8ve,i23g8ve,True,[deleted],t3_tnpke0,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatoon/comments/tnpke0/what_to_do_about_neighbours_car_alarm_going_off/,What to do about neighbours car alarm going off?,/r/saskatoon/comments/tnpke0/what_to_do_about_neighbours_car_alarm_going_off/i23g8ve/,1,r/saskatoon,0,1

"(Not a lawyer disclaimer; validate and double check everything below. However I had a similar question recently, so this is my understanding)

What is your lease type? Is it month to month, or a fixed term? In other words, does it say something like ""from $DATE to $DATE"" or is it recurring?

For a fixed term lease, the rent cannot be raised during the period of the fixed term. If you then want to stay longer than the term, you are essentially signing a new lease, not renewing. For that, there is no notice required; it is a completely new contract and the rent can be set to any level.

For a periodic lease, you're right; there are notice periods required. If you do have a periodic lease and they are not abiding by notice periods, you can reach out to the [ORT](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/government-structure/boards-commissions-and-agencies/office-of-residential-tenancies) for help and advice. But make no mistake: for a periodic lease it is within your landlord's rights to raise your rent on a periodic basis. They just cannot do it without notice.

"I really wish SGI had some responsibility in their accreditation.

OP, you should be able to take your separate inspection reports to SGI, and SGI should be able to pull their accreditation, and you should get a monetary reward at FFUN's expence. At the least, SGI should potentially pull the accreditation based on their record, or provide a reputation score for accredited shops.

A few years ago I brought a dealership purchased car into Sask and the first place that did my inspection sabotaged the car and wanted to charge me thousands. I also took it to a different shop, and they pointed out where the first shop cut and removed items. I cost me hundreds to repair the malicious damage.

When I contacted SGI, their response was 'what are we to do about it?' and 'why do you think this is SGI's responsiblity?'

Come on SGI, It is your accreditation, It is your website I used to select my inspector. Take some responsibility to protect people. I've rebuilt engines, I can smell BS (only sometimes). How many people have you enabled being robbed of their hard earned money?

">Both my parents were addicts actually, ended up with me a ward of the state,

There it is, I knew it had to be something more than a one sentence 1/2 serious 1/2 facetious comment that set you off. All makes sense now.

>but nah you are definitely inventing the angry or emotional stuff.

Am I? Maybe you should have a sober second look at what your posting. It's a pretty objective fact you were having a tantrum.

>Not the first troll on here to pretend your brilliant use of buzzwords was emotionally devastating all those in its path haha.

Now you call me a troll. After I called you one hey. Would that be a case of, as you say, ""I know you are but what I am I""? I find that a ""sad little response""

&#x200B;

>You were convincingly denounced by probably a dozen people on this thread alone,

12 WHOLE people on a Reddit left wing echo chamber? Oh shit, I must be wrong. All those downvotes.

>I would imagine anyone could figure out the common denominator.

Or you lack any perception outside r/saskatoon . I hate to shock you but Reddit is actually not a great representation of reality, especially here. Or do you think the NDP has 50 seats and Scott Moe is being charged with murder? Maybe it's time you go outside if you actually think getting downvotes on Reddit is any indication that I'm wrong.

Besides if you actually think this, which you do as per the fact you stated it, looks like I have much more Karma than you with a 2 week old account even after you've been being woke around here for 4 fucking years haha. By your metric (not mine) the only common denominator is our post histories and the fact I have much more Karma on a 2 week old account.

>(Ps its not that everyone but you is triggered by your brave selection of words to type)

I never said everyone. You now need to make things up to justify me as literally Hitler. You lefties are cute.

Most on here are not. A couple tantrums.

You were obviously triggered.

Maybe go get some therapy, you obviously need to work out a few things. Sorry you were raised by meth heads, no kid deserves that. And we all know our foster system is broken. Kind of fucks people up in the head being raised that way.

"I spreadsheet all my finances.  I can say, without a doubt, that (in my case) the rebate more than covers my carbon tax bill.

Here's a glimpse:

* **Sask Energy**:  $21.95 on my last bill, and $20.38 for the month before that.  Two expensive heating months.  Lets call it $20/mo for half the year when I'm actually using the furnace, which is a huge over-estimate.
   * That's $120/yr.
* **Sask Power**:  Usually between $3 and $5 a bill, throughout the year.  Lets just call it $5 to be generous.
   * That's $60/yr
* **Gas for the car**:  I work from home for the most part but prior to the pandemic it was approximately 40L/mo in fuel.  Which works out to $5.72/mo in carbon tax.
   * That's $68.64/yr
* **Groceries**:  I'm a meal prep person.  I buy lots of chicken, pork, rice, salad, milk, eggs, frozen veggies etc.  Mostly at Costco.  There are so many factors that go into food costs that attributing them *all* to the carbon tax is honestly nonsense.  That being said I'm spending about the same on food as I did 4 years ago, within $100 (some years I spend less, some more).  My habits dictate it more than anything.  Not carbon tax.
   * To be extremely generous, lets call this $100/yr.  Realistically, its more like $0.

So in total, I'm spending between $248.64 and $348.64 in carbon tax per year if I had to actually use my car for a commute every day.  Which I haven't for two years.

I get $500 back from the climate action incentive rebate.

That means I'm coming out ahead at least $151.36 to $251.36 every year.

"Your very simplistic take doesn't apply here unfortunately. Fascism is national socialism. Under the Nazi's the German state had complete control over the means of production. In your magical unicorn socialism, yes it's quite different. As in the workers themselves actually need to own their own means of production. But since in reality, which hurts some people I get it, the state never actually is able to give up control of the economy to ""the workers"" they only differ in theoretical ideology and absolutely are similar in the way they are implemented in the real world.

The Nazi's are arguable closer to national socialism then state Capitalism, like China, because of how they ran their economy. But that's arguable. 

But it all boils down to one thing. Authoritarian government control. Can call itself what it wants. And Socialism is the big dog for authoritarian government control, especially in the 20th century.

So again, when you understand the context of what he said. He is correct.

I'm sure the plan for every ""real socialist"" was to dissolve the state and give full control evenly to the workers. Eventually. Any time now. Gonna happen. Just a few more years comrade.

"I will reiterate what some here have said:

Pizza: 13 Pies hands down.

Italian/Pasta: Me and my GF can't get enough of Primal right now.  We also love Taverna.  Little Grouse is a little more niche and very different but nice flavoured stuff.  I think Little Grouse is a little more pricey too.

Ukrainian: Take it from a Ukrainian, Touch of Ukraine is probably the best we have to offer for a restaurant.  Baba's has very little flavour and is overrated.

Asian: Red Pepper, best spring rolls in town, and very good Banh Mi if that is your jam.

Summer roll restaurant also has some very good Pad Thai.

Keo's Kitchen is also very popular in town and have converted me since my last visit.

"Let me try and explain things in a way that you and this city sub may comprehend. It requires self awareness, But here goes. I generally find that my political leanings align more with the CPC and the general ideologies of the NDP I find ridiculous. So I support one and not the other.

And my criticisms of the CPC tend to be on how I think they can govern better and my criticisms of the NDP tend to be how out of touch they are. Agree or not, I don't really care 🤷

The self awareness piece comes in now. Would you say the same thing to the majority here with their unwavering support for the NDP and the daily tantrums I read about Scott Moe and the SP? 

If you're truly interested in examining fanatical political behavior may I recommend sticking around here for the daily ""Scott Moe is the antichrist"" posts, comments, meme after meme after meme.
