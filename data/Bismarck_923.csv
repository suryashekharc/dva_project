"Letter to the Tribune today:  
Recently Bismarck High School had an electronic marquee installed on its property. This was a long-time wish come true for the school, allowing for increased flexibility of messages to relay to the public about the whos and whats of BHS. However, that dream came with a price. If you haven’t driven past 800 North 8th street in the past week, you will have missed the new marquee, branded with enormous signage: Mann Signs. A great local company, Mann Signs donated the structure to BHS, so I agree: They should leave their mark. I just don’t agree with the discrepancy in font color and size. “Bismarck High School” is nearly invisible atop the marquee in letters significantly smaller than “Mann Signs” which is at the sightline in bold red letters atop a white background. I love that there is finally an electronic marquee, but I’d like to see the tradition of Bismarck High School continue without it appearing they’ve sold themselves out.

"I'm not an authority on this. I'd suggest calling the city. They say ""For code interpretation, please call the Building Division at 701.355.1465 and for fire code interpretation call the Fire Division at 701-355-1400.""

Meanwhile, section 4-07-2 of Bismarck local ordinances adopts the International Fire Code, version 2018 I believe. See Title 4 at [https://www.bismarcknd.gov/90/Code-of-Ordinances](https://www.bismarcknd.gov/90/Code-of-Ordinances). 

It looks to me like IFC chapter 906 lists the rules for apartment buildings as ""R-2 occupancies"" (see Chapter 2, Definitions for ""R-2""). See [https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IFC2021P1/chapter-9-fire-protection-and-life-safety-systems#IFC2021P1\_Pt03\_Ch09\_Sec906](https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IFC2021P1/chapter-9-fire-protection-and-life-safety-systems#IFC2021P1_Pt03_Ch09_Sec906). This seems to say that extinguishers are required in each dwelling unit. I don't know if it says who has to provide them, but I'd be surprised if the landlord weren't responsible for this. To the extent that the units are ever inspected (not sure what the rules for that are), I'd expect this is something the inspectors look for.",t2_23noqcx4,dmartin-ames,0,1645911252.0,0,t1_hykb30s,hykb30s,True,transcending_pork,t3_t227c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bismarck/comments/t227c4/apartment_building_fire_code/,apartment building fire code,/r/bismarck/comments/t227c4/apartment_building_fire_code/hykb30s/,4,r/bismarck,0,4

"I’ll see if I can come up with some answers to your last questions about things you can’t easily find online about Bismarck.

Bismarck and Mandan are home to the McQuades softball tournament held every year in June. So many people play softball and joining a team isn’t terribly difficult.

Bismarck generally doesn’t get many people who aren’t from the area so someone from the PNW will make you interesting. Use it to your advantage ha.

People who live here are proud of it so when someone asks how you like it here saying that you really enjoy it here is nice to hear, probably make more friends easily.  It some NDSU or UND apparel and start fitting right in if you want.

Bismarck is kind of an island as the next closest large town is Fargo and then from there is Minneapolis.

Joining a gym could be a way to meet people, in my opinion the YMCA is one of the most Bismarck place in town, if that makes sense.

Don’t be afraid to also look at places to live in Mandan or even Lincoln. 

Bismarck has great things to do outdoors in the summer, great paved and hiking trails, great parks, lots of outdoor events, and don’t forgot about pontoons. The Missouri River and pontoons is a great time. The Missouri River has a ton of sandbars that fill up with pontoons and everyone loves to grab beers and have a great time there.

YouTube is your friend- Google, too. Look up the laptop by model number and see how close you can get to finding exactly what you're trying to do, or at least a general dissassembly guide or, if nothing else, any diagrams you can find.

"As someone who owns two retail businesses and a consumer I understand where you are coming from.  Unfortunately in my and many others situation there is nothing we can do about it. When purchasing product in smaller amounts like I and so many other small local businesses do because of their market share, we don't benefit from bulk pricing.  I buy a case at a time (12 to 24 pieces).  Big box stores or stores in areas in highly populated areas buy by the truckload or at the least by the pallet (hundreds of pieces)  They get price breaks we don't. 

The profit on the products we sell, has to pay for retail space, employees, power, heat, water, insurance, licensing(tobacco, liquor, health department, business) property taxes, trade name, Unemployment insurance, freight costs, cover any losses of damaged products, building repairs and maintenance and a slew of other things i cant think of off the top of my head right now. Whatever is left after can be used for owner compensation and reinvestment back into the business. 

We support the small businesses in and around our area the best we can.  There are things that we do order online because the price point is just too high for us personally and for the businesses. I hope you don't give up on all of us small business owners. We are not trying to fleece you, we too are only trying to survive.

The Ramada downtown is nice because it’s easy walking to a few shops and restaurants. There’s a used book store a couple blocks down and peacock alley is a nice place. 

North Dakota is weird. Call ahead to restaurants to check if kids are allowed. Like no kids are allowed in Blarney Stone. 

The heritage center is really cool. It’s the museum. You park on the east side, the parking lot next to the big window with the sculpture inside it.

Most of the city is pretty safe, job opportunities are decent, and you have access to some good amenities. The main headache is housing prices.

As some have said, it's a pretty conservative social culture. That has its pitfalls, but I like it overall.

"According to [this PDF of issued building permits](https://www.bismarcknd.gov/DocumentCenter/View/37402/March-MTD-Issued-Permits-Issued-with-Valuations-and-Census-8), it was planned to cost $335,300.

According to [this information](https://www.bisparks.org/tom-oleary-tennis-courts-parking-lot-closed/), it was paid for by ""Bismarck Parks and Recreation District, with supporting funds from the Bismarck-Mandan Tennis Association. St. Mary’s Central High School Booster Club and Bismarck Public Schools.""

The bonds to pay for 7 capitol projects including these restrooms had the ""Initial Resolution for General Obligation Park Facilities Bonds"" approved unanimously by the park board at their 2020-12-17 meeting, [PDF minutes here](https://www.bisparks.org/wp-content/uploads/BPRD-Park-Board-Meeting-12-17-20-Minutes.pdf).

The actual contents of that ""Initial Resolution for General Obligation Park Facilities Bonds"" appear to start on page 17 of [this PDF](https://www.bisparks.org/wp-content/uploads/BPRD-Park-Board-Info-Packet-12-17-2020.pdf).  But a cost breakdown by project is not included.

The 2021-04-15 park board meeting [minutes PDF](https://www.bisparks.org/wp-content/uploads/BPRD-Park-Board-Meeting-4-15-21-Minutes-Corrected-6-17-21-1.pdf) shows that they plan to apply for funds from the ""Garrison Diversion Recreation Grant"" to cover part of the costs of the restrooms, and also other projects.

The 2021-03-18 [minutes](https://www.bisparks.org/wp-content/uploads/BPRD-Park-Board-Meeting-3-18-21-Minutes.pdf) show that they accepted the low bid for $335,300 (makes sense that this matches the permit amount).

"Just to be clear, you are talking about Medicaid recapture, right? AFAIK there is no Medicare recovery. Also, I don't believe Medicaid appropriates any assets. The individual is either eligible or not for Medicaid. If Medicaid does provide services, the government is entitled to recover some or all of the benefit from the estate after the individual passes.

A study was published [2 days ago](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaa733/5934827) that is attracting all this hype because ""80% of COVID patients were vitamin D deficient compared to 50% of controls"".

small and on different dosages to draw solid conclusions on its role in the clinical outcomes of the disease""**

"FARGO — Bismarck city commissioner Mark Splonskowski joins the growing list of North Dakota officials to say silly (and potentially dangerous) things in their opposition to a mask mandate to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.

At a six-hour meeting Tuesday, Oct. 27, Splonskowski punctuated his opposition to a mask mandate (individual choice, freedom, liberty, slippery slope, etc.) by continually saying the science behind wearing a mask is unsettled (no, it isn't) before deciding to play doctor (he's a Burleigh County tax appraiser for his day job).

Late in the meeting, in what is clearly a ""I'm just spitballing here"" moment, Splonskowski suggests that instead of a mask mandate, the city of Bismarck suggest to its citizens that they wear a mask, social distance and ... take vitamin D.

He says vitamin D is ""scientifically proven"" and ""scientifically backed"" to be effective against COVID. It is not.

That is a top Bismarck official's solution to a pandemic that has seen record cases and rising deaths as it has spread uncontrolled through North Dakota: Take vitamin D, an unproven and possibly completely ineffective way to stop a person from catching or recovering from the coronavirus.

Splonskowski also says that among the reasons he can't support a mask mandate is that ""rape and strangled victims"" will face psychological issues if they are forced to wear a face covering.

""They have some psychological issues going on, major psychological issues,"" Splonskowski said. ""I don't even want to know what they go through when their breath is stifled.""

But Splonskowski's main issue was that he wanted to tell citizens to take Vitamin D, as an apparent safeguard against COVID-19.

""Maybe a lot of people don't know about the Vitamin D, this vitamin or this vitamin,"" he said. ""Just trying something new, completely out of the box that nobody's ever tried before because we might get different results. People might say, 'Hey, you know what, I've never heard of that. They didn't force me to wear a mask so you know what, out of respect for them, out of respect for me, I'm going to try that. I'm going to do that.'

""We might not see our COVID cases go down, but we'll sure as heck see our deaths go down. And that's the important thing. Just food for thought.""

There is no evidence — zero — that taking vitamin D increases an infected person's chances of surviving the virus. One recent study in Spain showed that 80% of coronavirus patients tested had low levels of vitamin D. But there are so many other variants in the patients that it's unclear exactly what role the vitamin deficiency played.

""Researchers ... didn’t find any link between vitamin D deficiency and severity of the illness, with no significantly higher rates of ICU admission, ventilator use, or death among those with inadequate levels of the sunshine vitamin,"" according to one media report.

Again, there is no evidence to show vitamin D helps prevent COVID infection or lower the risk of death from it. Yet the commissioner states, as fact, that taking Vitamin D will result in fewer COVID deaths, a claim that is easily found to be false.

The Mayo Clinic web site has a COVID question section and one of the questions specifically asked is whether vitamin D protects against or is effective in the treatement of the coronavirus disease.

The answer, Mayo says by citing major health organizations, is that there isn't enough information to say definitively.

""There isn't enough data to recommend use of vitamin D to prevent infection with the virus that causes COVID-19 or to treat COVID-19, according to the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization,"" the web site says.

Mayo does say there was one study showing ""that those who had a vitamin D deficiency were more likely to test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 than people who had normal levels of vitamin D"" and other research ""has observed high rates of vitamin D deficiency in people with COVID-19 who experienced acute respiratory failure. These people had a significantly higher risk of dying.""

Mayo said the jury is still out on whether Vitamin D reduces COVID infection or mortality.

""Further research is needed to determine what role, if any, vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency might play in the prevention of and treatment of COVID-19,"" the web site said.

Splonskowski joins Fargo city commissioner Dave Piepkorn and Mandan mayor Tim Helbling in the pantheon of North Dakota local politicians who'd be better off rethinking their reasons for opposing mask mandates.

Laughing sun has some fun stuff on sundays, they have bands most nights, and it’s a nice place to hang out. Thomas & moriaty’s is a neat cocktail place in mandan that does stuff like fancy meals or whiskey tastings. Bobcat hockey and bombshells are some sports to watch. My favorite brewery is buffalo commons in mandan. 

In the summer there’s farmers markets. The one by the Kiwanis Park/ baseball field is kinda ruined because there’s more people selling soaps than selling veggies. 

There’s food truck festival in the fall. There’s bar league darts and pool teams and softball teams.

"If your around Bismarck, I like fishing where the mouth of streams, creeks, etc. are along the Missouri .. Heart River, Apple Creek, Burnt Creek, etc... ...  use rapalas, spinners, spoons ... you'll catch more than walleye, but not be disappointed.

imo, The best, from shore for walleye on the missouri at night, is just a bit downstream from the chutes at Garrison Dam ... use a diving rapala (6, 7) ... the fish will typically hit your lure as it is floating ... if you don't reel a fish in every time, your doing something wrong ... when the bite is really on, you'll have to get there early to get a good spot ... plenty of others know about this ...

Secret tip: If you got a boat, during the daytime, use the triple swivel set up, drift down the tailrace and catch huge cat fish until your arms are tired or run out of bait...

But the Missouri River is the greatest fishery on the planet ...  you almost have to try to not catch fish... and if that is the case... just move to another spot...

My favorite bar for socializing: Peacock Alley (accommodates groups, a lot of cool places tend to be smaller)

My favorite Mexican: La Tejana, but haven't been since they moved to their new location. I also like La Carreta

My favorite consistent meal (which is actually significant out here): Blarney Stone

Honorable mentions: Luft, especially for atmosphere, the Bistro, the BBQ place in Mandan that I forgot the name of

Overrated, IMHO, especially as a transplant/not native (but still worth checking out): Butterhorn, JL Beers, Starving Rooster (although good cocktails), Toasted Frog, Terra Nomad (coffee/lunch), Anima Cucina

"Eh I don't think people here are unusually selfish. People are people everywhere. I have lived all over the world and would say that people here are much more thoughtful of others and polite than anywhere I have lived. In general people are very helpful here and there and it is a high trust environment, but there is the crucial element of the bystander effect, particularly with homelessness. Also, homeless people are scary to many people; not only for safety reasons, but because they force you to acknowledge how thin the veneer of society is and the fact that we trust in social constructs much more than we should. To face homelessness head on you must acknowledge the humanity of the homeless which makes the entire situation they're in much more real and requires real thinking.

But I think the lack of leadership in this area is the biggest element at play here. I think if there was a big push to address the homelessness issue I think it could be very successful very quickly, but the truth is there is poor leadership in this city/state and no serious actions have been spearheaded.

I work nights downtown and when I step outside at night, I have seen people curling up in back entryways and looking through dumpsters and it seriously baffles me that I (an average sized female) am seemingly the only one of my coworkers that isn’t concerned about going outside. The people I’ve talked to that are doing these things are just people. They’re fucking cold. Or they’re hungry. Or they’re ashamed. So I’ve given small bits of money for coffee or the other half of the sandwich I had saved in the fridge. Its sad but it’s whatever. I work at a bar, and I’ve had to kick people out for loitering or asking other tables for money. I’ve seen these people come in and pay in change for a beer or drink instead of food. I get that people don’t always make the best choices. It’s frustrating as fuck. But that doesn’t mean they don’t deserve fucking shelter or warmth or food. 

Sorry for that small tangent, it just drives me absolutely mad how close minded and fucking stupid the majority of this state is. We don’t offer services for our struggling.

"Bismarck is a nice and peaceful little town. I’d say there’s a fair amount of opportunities to make friends and join clubs/activities. The Bismarck magazine has a calendar in the back of it that’s full of events going on around town. The magazine is available downtown or at most grocery stores. I think it’s online too. That might have some info for what you’re looking for.

As far as outdoor activities there’s a decent amount of things to do. Bismarck is an active community with a LOT of trails in it. Mostly paved trails around town for commuting/running/biking, but also some more off-road types trails if you look hard enough. I like that it’s right next to the river. In the summer it’s easy to drive to a shore and fish or spend a Saturday sitting on the beach. There’s also a wildlife management area (look up MacLean Bottoms) that is open to public. It’s a fair amount of public land for hunting pheasants as well as deer if you’re into that. Also birdwatching or photography could be cool out there also. There’s a boat dock and a shooting rifle range there too. The trails here definitely are not like the ones in western Montana. There aren’t near as many trees as there are there. There’s 0 mountains as you know. The Badlands are the closest thing you’ll get to mountains and offer some more activities to do there. 

However, North Dakota in general isn’t really for everyone.. some people say there’s nothing to do. But personally, I think it’s what you make of it. There’s not a whole lot of night life stuff but as you mentioned you’re not huge into that so that’s not a huge deal. There are a fair amount of breweries/bars especially in the downtown area that are fun. I personally like the Luft and the Blarney Stone. Both offer a fun atmosphere.

People of North Dakota are pretty friendly for the most part. I would argue that it’s a pretty conservative state. However, recreational Marijuana is on the ballot so if you support that or not might be something to consider (if it passes).

To me I think Bismarck would be a nice place to settle down in. As long as you don’t mind cold cold winters. I mean COLD. They can really get to be a drag. Winters can last from October all the way up until the end of March sometimes (in horrible years). Oh and the wind is real here. It’s almost always windy. 

I would recommend visiting here and staying in a hotel for a weekend or so. Ask around for activities to do or do some research online. See how you like it and kind of test the waters.

If you have other questions I’ll try to answer them! Hope this helps.",t2_1vzham1k,tjozone,0,1539035883.0,0,t1_e7f07su,e7f07su,True,cnirvana11,t3_9mitfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/bismarck/comments/9mitfz/thinking_of_moving_to_bismarck/,Thinking of moving to Bismarck,/r/bismarck/comments/9mitfz/thinking_of_moving_to_bismarck/e7f07su/,3,r/bismarck,0,3
">  How hot does it get in the summer? Stats show that the average high in July is 85, does that sound about right?

that seems pretty accurate, we usually see 100+ degree days in August

> Politics: I notice that it is right-leaning – is this more a libertarian right or a social-conservative right?

I try to avoid politics personally, but I feel like there is a mixed bag here

> What are the outdoor activities that people do there? Is there much hiking? Snowshoeing? If so, are the trails easy to find or are they local secrets?

There is Fort Lincoln State Park 7 miles south of Mandan with hiking trails as well as well established walking/biking trails all over the city, in the winter time, Huff Hills isn't far away, they are the closest thing you will get to a ski resort without making a long drive.

Other outdoor activities you may come across  - I enjoy Frisbee Golfing, we have several courses around town (BSC, Sibley Park, Lincoln, Mandan, and United Tribes College)

> Are people accepting of outsiders moving in?  

I feel like generally they are

> I know the winters are long, but is gardening something that is possible here?

Absolutely my dad plants on every spring and there are several community garden plots around as well

Huffington Post! LOL! You're so fucking pathetic it's sad! All you have to do is look at many parts of Europe to see what's in store for us if we allow Muslims to gain a foothold here. You remind me of the couple that just went on a bike ride through ISIS controlled territory to prove Islam isn't evil and got stabbed to death. You're a mindless fool that can't be bothered to look at the actually history of jihad across Europe and see that it's still taking place.

Am white, don't hate myself. Sorry for any confusion on your part.

Also don't hate Christians, have plenty of good Christian friends. But they're not shitheads like you, so it's not that hard to like them.

> Have any Christians done anything like that recently?

Do I really have to dig up a bunch of links to random shit that Christians have done? I don't have time for that. I mean, go look up some news from the Catholic pedos if you want to.

However, it appears that there is still *no legal definition* available for either one of these terminologies.

"On a broader front than the specific domain of the question that you asked, I agree with @RagtagCoach completely.  It's damn good to see somebody, especially around these parts, who understands the issue at a deeper & fundamental level.  That's the only real path to really fixing these issues that we really have, and so many people just don't seem to be able to think that deeply.

Having law enforcement/military experience, and taking the question just at face value though, I'd like to address this question as well...

School shootings are, no doubt, a product of mental health issues gone unchecked, and social norms and values being utterly shot to shit in our country's quest for rugged individualism, consumerism, and materialism, over *compassion and humanity*.  That being said, *what about when school shootings DO happen*, being as the problem isn't going to be fixed overnight?

In the event of an active shooter, especially mixed amongst innocents/hostages, a semi-automatic (**NOTE**: *assault rifle* has no actual definition, it's a term used to demonize semi-automatic rifles that are black and 'scary looking') rifle, such as the AR-15, that is accurately zeroed for the individual law enforcement officer can be **much** more useful for avoiding unnecessary injury to innocents, and for more rapidly neutralizing the active shooter.  It's a simple matter, boiling down to accuracy over long range, vs. whatever kind of sidearm the officer normally carries.  Of course, this is *very* dependent upon the training of the officer utilizing the weapon, as well.",t2_1cn75fzw,transcending_pork,0,1534086146.0,0,t1_e427tz5,e427tz5,True,theduckanddragon,t3_96ipmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/bismarck/comments/96ipmb/curious_to_hear_if_others_think_this_is_helpful/,Curious to hear if others think this is helpful or harmful or somewhere in between,/r/bismarck/comments/96ipmb/curious_to_hear_if_others_think_this_is_helpful/e427tz5/,3,r/bismarck,0,3

"Since I know anybody versed in 'standard model' physics is going to bring this up, I'm also just going to jump on the grenade here, and throw out a link about ['electromagnetic gravity'](http://www.holoscience.com/wp/electric-gravity-in-an-electric-universe/).  


If there's not enough time, or motivation, to read the write-up, I'd suggest that you do a google images search; the first 2 or 3 slides that come up are pretty good. After that, you get into the pseudo-science and cray-cray. All you really need to see are the elongated & polarized molecules, all attracting towards a common center, and things start to line up (quite literally). I haven't done the math to see if it's viable or not, though, admittedly. I would think that it may have a bit in common with 'electrogravitics'... Before *that's* touted as pseudoscience, please note that I've had to guard stealth fighters that use that very concept for at least a portion of their acceleration. and handling. while in flight.

"I don’t know the details of your situation but here’s my recommendation: 
1. Consider different coping skills. 
Looks like you just moved here. That’s a great opportunity to try new things and do things you haven’t done before.
2. Consider why you need an emotional support animal.
There is a difference between wanting a cat and needing a cat. Anyone can desire the companionship that an animal can add to our lives. Emotional support animals are reserved for those suffering from psychiatric disabilities. 
3. Consider moving.
There are a ton of places here in Bismarck that allow pets and are affordable. Also, many places will not let you adopt a cat unless you can prove you live in a building that allows animals.

"I've lived in Bismarck my whole life, and consider myself quite the foodie. Here's my take, I disagree with some of what the others opinions are, but hey that's what discussions are for right!. 

**Pizza:** Nardellos/Brunos toss up. Both pizza styles are different enough for me to give them a tie. Won't be disappointed with either. 

**Chinese:** China Garden in the northbrook mall is the unsung hero. Rice bowl is great, but I like garden a bit better. Noodlezip is also fantastic, but not strictly Chinese. 

**Fine Dining:** Bistro

**Breakfast:** Blarney Stone dinner in Dublin for over 21, little cottage Cafe in town, rolling hills truck stop for a short ways out of town. 

**Sandwiches:** Grand Junction subs

**Burgers:** There is lots of great burgers here, Jl beers, blarney, Broadway, I miss Rezas.. But the bistro burger is one of the best burgers I've had anywhere. Bistro wins

**Mexican (sit down):** Taqueria El guerro ( on the strip in Mandan) this place has the best Mexican I've had anywhere. I've recommended it to everyone, and have been told it's just as good as authentic Mexican from down south. 

**Steak:** this is the one category I don't have strong feelings for, I feel steak is pretty easy to please with. Any of the upperscale places, or Texas roadhouse will serve a great steak. 

**Seafood:** -- East 40, or kobes for sushi 

**Wings:** Wings are another food I don't feel has a clear winner in the area. Sickies, toasted frog, peacock, but Buffalo wing places, all solid choices. 

**Favorite LOCAL restaurant in general:** Peacock is really the iconic OG. Anyone visiting from out of town, I always recommend Peacock and a bistro burger.

"I've lived in Bismarck since 2001, seen a lot of places come and go...here's MY take...

**Pizza:** A&B (House special is worth it every time)

**Chinese:** Rice Bowl in Mandan for traditional, Noodlezip for asian fusion

**Fine Dining:** Not sure on this since I usually don't do the fine dining scene

**Breakfast:** Avery's or Peacock Alley

**Sandwiches:** Bread Poets or Which Wich (when it opens)

**Burgers:** I honestly can't say I've had a good burger here...maybe when Culver's opens in Mandan

**Mexican (sit down):** Los Lunas

**Mexican (to go):** Taco Del Mar-The meat nachos are worth the trip alone!

**Steak:** Rusty's Saloon in St. Anthony...if you haven't been out there, you are missing quite possibly the best steak in North Dakota

**Seafood:** -- Seeing as our only choice is really Red Lobster.....no

**Wings:** Buffalo Wings & Rings for variety

**Favorite LOCAL restaurant in general:** I'm not really sure, but since I live in the area, I like The Walrus a lot.

"North Dakota is pretty well culturally inclusive. We like it when people mind their own business. My childhood was idyllic, and that included hanging out with black kids. The liberals want us too own the floodgates of immigration and that for me is out of the question.Many families adopt poor children around here that are from out of the state or country. We have no precedent and just because we subjugated the Indians 130 years ago doesn’t mean we are happy about it, or mean that they are continuing to be subjugated. The North Dakota I know is racially tolerant. God fearing usually means incredibly compassionate and kind small town folks. I support a steady trickle of immigrants to North Dakota, because an open floodgate would inevitably cause clashes. The land in North Dakota is 100 % settled, and has been over a century. North Dakota landowners I highly doubt will ever back down. They are stubborn sons of bitches and won’t give up their square that has been purchased by sweat and tears. 

If a person such as a Somalian moved in, a community would be happy to accept them with open arms, if they accepted that the community values such as women’s rights, religious freedom, the freedom of speech and expression, and the collective community health trumped all individual preconceived notions.North Dakota is not ready for a floodgate of immigrants. This is coming from someone who personally grew up in small town North Dakota. Let’s take whatever we can handle with a clear mind, for now.

But, Like all problems, we have to realize, through all the division and strife, the United States is still one of the most accepting nations in the world, and there is a reason many want to live here. But, the nations of the world that are suffering from poverty have to realize that coming  to America won’t solve their problems, because we have plenty of our own.",t2_ht0ce,GhengisKongg,0,1519936099.0,0,t1_dv18mkb,dv18mkb,False,[deleted],t3_80pycq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bismarck/comments/80pycq/this_sub_is_disappointing/,This sub is disappointing.,/r/bismarck/comments/80pycq/this_sub_is_disappointing/dv18mkb/,1,r/bismarck,0,1
