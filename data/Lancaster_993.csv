"Absolutely! So, I had 2 cavities which they filled, usually when I have a cavity filled (which I've had plenty, thanks genetics) Ill be sensitive for a week and then I'm normal. I had sensitivity and pain for 2 months after. I decided to call back, got an exam, and they agreed to redo it free of charge. Originally it was Dr. Baird who did the work, she assigned another dentist in office to fix it. They told me to give it another two months. Which I did, and it was still painful/sensitive. They ground down some of the filling but said they couldn't grind anymore down. They said they can totally redo it a third time. I just stopped going and got a second opinion. Which I am glad I did - my new dentist said there was plenty of filling left to grind down for temporary relief (which they did, and pain did lessen but not 100% resolve) and I will be going in soon for another re-do, though this office says they insert a medication into the tooth before sealing to promote healing. Gonna give it a shot. And honestly, there were other red flags there too at Po like 1.) I paid 600$ for a night guard, which I told them I need molded to my top teeth because I have a permanent retainer on my bottom, and after attempting for over an HOUR to get a mold of my teeth, they said the got it, once they had my money and my guard came in, it was for my bottom teeth. They did it without telling me because 'my top teeth were too hard to work with'. Also 2.) She prayed over me after not 1 but 2 appointments. Which if you are Christian may be nice? Im not sure. But she asked, which I admit I did give permission, but I was caught so off guard and did not want to cause an issue by saying no.

"In times past there was

- basically the entire current RRTA system of routes and then some was trolleys, mostly along the turpikes radiating out of the city but also on some of their own ROW.  Connected directly to the Hershey, Reading, and Coatesville systems such that it was possible to ride trolleys from Philadelphia all the way to Harrisburg.

- the existing electrified Amtrak/PRR line (Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy, and Lancaster Railroad + Philadelphia and Columbia RR)

- the currently freight-only Lancaster & Columbia Line (continued to Wrightsville and York over the world's longest covered bridge), used to be electrified and carry passengers

- The current freight line (Reading and Columbia line) to East Pete, Manheim, and Lititz went all the way through Ephrata to Sinking Springs and Reading, and in the other direction to Silver Spring, Columbia, and Marietta.  The Reading Railroad station was located near Prince and James street.

- Cornwall Railroad went from Manheim through Penryn, Mt Hope, and Cornwall to Lebanon, mainly to serve the iron mines (which go back to the Baron von Stiegel who founded Manheim).  The current YMCA Camp Shand/Rocky Creek was the company park/picnic spot.

- The Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad paralleled this line, and even raced passenger trains, from Lebanon to Cornwall, then continued on to Elizabethtown.  Mt. Gretna was their company park and picnic spot, including the lake.  The current hiking trail up Governor Dick was was a 2ft narrow gauge line up to the observation tower.

- The current New Holland freight branch went all the way to another junction of PRR lines at Honey Brook

- PRR went directly through downtown roughly along New Holland ave and Harrisburg ave with the station on Queen and Walnut St.  A branch went right down the middle of water street down to Quarryville.

- The Enola low grade line from Parkesburg/Atglen/Quarryville/Safe Harbor, didn't carry passengers but was electrified and connected to the Quarryville branch

- The Lancaster Oxford and Southern narrow gauge railroad connected Quarryville to Peach Bottom and Oxford.

- The current Safe Harbor line along the Susquehanna used to be electrified and carried passengers into the Amtrak era until the National Limted was cancelled

- and the Strasburg Railroad

"The Conestoga is reasonably clean despite being muddy, the Susquehanna is a lot worse - mine tailings, industrial waste, heavy metals, untreated sewage, and more even though the water looks more clear.  And the Susquehanna I think is a lot better than the Schuylkill and other rivers to the east. 

Lancaster city water is taken out of the creek up by the PRR stone arch bridge by the 23 bypass, all the sewer/stormwater overflows are below that point which are only a problem during storms, the treated water comes out down by Danville next to the sewer plant and is quite clean.  They keep track of the total flow up by the water works and monitor all the contaminant levels, but, like I said, that's above the problem spots.  They must test it at least once in a while below because they do put up warnings sometimes in the county park when they say it's bad.

If you want to clean up trash I think just volunteering for trash pickups in the parks, or the adopt a highway groups, would be good.

"The signs greatly exaggerate the risk. As for removing the sewer overflows, that’s not really feasible. The city uses can treat 32 million gallons of water a day and that all has to go somewhere. For smaller municipalities things like ground application work great but that’s impossible for the amount we produce, so it goes back into the river where it came from, after being fully treated and disinfected. The real issue comes from the city’s combined sewer and storm water systems. This causes untreated waste to bypass the treatment plants during storms. The city has actually go a lonnnng way to separate storm and sanitary sewers! They’ve also installed all the rain gardened down town and incentivized homeowner to do the same. You’re honestly more at risk from manure/fertilizer and pesticide run off then the cso’s.   If you have sensitive skin, have a compromised immune system or are a young child or are old by all means avoid the water but even after heavy rains there’s very low risk.

"So the Progress Flag was released in June 2018 by Daniel Quasar. The main section of the flag includes the traditional 6 stripe LGBTQIA+ flag as seen in its widely adopted form so as not to take away from its original meaning. The trans flag and marginalized community stripes were shifted to the Hoist of the flag and given a new arrow shape. The arrow points to the right to show forward movement, while being along the left edge shows that progress still needs to be made. As a Trans man, I like this added part. While the T in LGBT does stand for Transgender, oftentimes transgender people feel excluded from the LGBT community due to our sexual orientation not necessarily being what makes us different, but instead our gender not matching our assigned gender at birth. There has also been a long history of transphobia within the LGBQIA+ community. Over the past few years the transphobia has decreased but it is still an issue. Same goes with racism. You’d think with the LGBTQIA+ community being a marginalized community, there wouldn’t be any discrimination towards other marginalized communities, but of course that’s unfortunately not the way it works.",t2_3ru0s2op,Cptp93,0,1647891047.0,0,t1_i1khmue,i1khmue,False,Cptp93,t3_tjg50m,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/tjg50m/progress_flag/,Progress Flag 🏳️‍🌈,/r/lancaster/comments/tjg50m/progress_flag/i1khmue/,9,r/lancaster,0,9

Judges have so much power and are basically accountable to no one. There is some oversight at the state level but they only intervene in the most insane cases. They are theoretically able to be voted out of office but I wonder how often that happens in this state. There was that judge that got pulled over and pulled rank to get out of a traffic ticket. There is another judge at the Lancaster country court that just berates and yells at attorneys on both sides and is super unprofessional and rude. Constitutional rights and justice mean nothing if a judge can just do whatever they want with no accountability.

The problem is that a lot of American public transport at the moment is very useless since vehicles run late, lines radiate from the city center (most commutes are made from one suburb to another), and lines are just a disheveled mess anyway.

The city had a trolley network back in the day that was ripped up (it’s destruction funded by car companies just like many other light rail systems) to make room for the car. Light rail, rapid bus transit, and bike infrastructure will work very well here and will alleviate a lot of car traffic IF built correctly and maintained correctly.

"Or like, dependable bus travel at all in the city.

I live close enough to walk into downtown, and one day I found myself on my way home and it started raining. I was by the queen street bus hub and still had about 20 minutes of walking to do. Thought to myself, hey I’ll take a bus home to keep dry!

After navigating the awful website to see which bus rout I should take (seriously look at the “city map” on RRT’s website… a borderline unreadable pixilated jpg) reading the confusing, loopy, circuitous routs to try to wrap my head around where the bus would even go once I actually got on the one I needed, and then deciphering the schedule to see when my bus would arrive and when I would reach my destination, I realized I would have to wait for 30 minutes for the bus to arrive and then *another* 30 minutes to reach the station closest to home.

I said *fuck* that and made better use of my time walking home.

"I’m worried about the future of electric vehicle charging, and how it’s going to effect living and working in the city in the next 20 years. 

I’m shocked at how many people don’t have parking or alley access behind their city homes. Alleys are either too narrow, or sold off along with sections of back yards (I believe during the depression) to create those mid block self storage garages that are all over the city. With a lack of access, Lancaster is going to end up forced to install and maintain a curbside charging network. If we don’t, I think the lack of availability of charging along with a lack of good public transport infrastructure is going to drive people out of the city to homes where they can get what I believe will be a necessary utility. 

My thought is to try to reconnect people with their alleys. It’s a block by block specific mission, but removing these storage units and widening alleys for off street parking would lessen the need for on street parking, and in doing so make bike and public transport lanes more palatable for car drivers. I believe, in my inexpert math, that it would be more cost effective for the city to figure out how to adjust these lines and give land back to home owners (with the understanding that the home owner would be required to pay for installation of charging stations/disconnects) than it would be to build, administrate, and maintain a city wide charging network. 

It wouldn’t work everywhere. Some blocks would be easy, some would be difficult, and some may not be worth the trouble. In those places we’d need to assess a need for a charging station network. But building a couple hundred charging stations city wide vs a couple thousand seems a lot more tenable. 

Worth mentioning that I don’t have a dog in this fight. My home has a garage on an alley, and once one call gets out to mark up my yard, it’ll have power for my own eventual car charger. If this never happens it won’t really effect me, but most of my neighbors don’t have that same luxury.",t2_ravhy,TapewormNinja,0,1647641827.0,0,t1_i17ln5j,i17ln5j,True,toarm,t3_th34m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/th34m4/i_cover_development_and_transportation_for_lnp_i/,I cover development and transportation for LNP.

"Housing has gotten so far out of hand it's insane.  I was looking earlier today...I can't comprehend how anyone just starting out today could even begin to consider Lancaster to do so...Baltimore and DC rents at Lancaster wages is untenable, and medium term is going to threaten the city's revitalization.

The exact same model of unit I lived in between moving to this city to start out, and getting my current home:

* Greenfield Estates: $890/month \[2004\], now $1650-$3200/month \[range covers with/without fireplace, with/without furnishings, and middle/end unit\]
* Park City Apartments, formerly the unflatteringly-nicknamed ""Meadow Ghetto"": $630/month \[2006\], now $1100/month
* Pioneer Woods: $850/month \[2012\], now $1200/month

So far it's been covered up by people fleeing the even higher prices in Philly/DC/Baltimore...but for the locals, Lancaster is in the middle of a housing crisis.  At the standard ""rent as 1/3 of income or we reject your application"" policy, those three complexes expect an income of $59,400, $39,600, and $43,200 respectively...in a city where the median household income is $45,500.  

Prices are so out-of-whack that a full half of the households in this city can't afford to live in *Meadow Ghetto*.

"I honestly think they need to do something about the goat path.

"My partner and I rented at Greenfield Estates for a couple of years.  We had a 2-bedroom apartment, access to a fitness center, indoor and outdoor pool, and a quiet community near great walking trails.  I think we paid $1170ish the first year, then rent went up $100 the following year.  We bought a house last year, but the rent was going up another hundred bucks.  The last time I checked their website, the starting rate for a 2-bedroom was still under $1300 a month.

We really liked living there, it was clean, quiet, and well-kept.  Maintenance was very responsive if you had an issue.  There are cheaper places available in the area, but we liked the indoor pool!

"Gotta say I do love owl.

I play a lot of magic/pokemon

There used to be a decent magic scene at 4th wall, but outside commander Saturdays, and pre release events nothing really ever has enough people.

I've been drafting at owl, and we've consistently gotten 8+ players every week so far. The pioneer scene has been consistent for quite sometime, and they throw bigger events (1k's) if your feeling up for a challenge.

If you want the most laid back scene it's probably going to be pokemon. It also has the lower barrier to entry with any top tier deck being $100-$200.

"The statute in question usually establishes a conservator who gets court permission to make changes / improve the property. In exchange for doing this, the conservator then gets the right to sell the property to recoup their costs + some small profit.  Any money that is left over is; however, sent back to the original property owner or used to satisfy other liens on the property.  However, in order to do this -

1. There has to be an entity that has the financial wherewith all to pay for the repairs / development on the property (i.e. act as a conservator).
2. There has to be a prospect that sometime in the future, said property once repaired can be sold at a profit (otherwise the conservator has no incentive to do this).

Accordingly, this leads to limited applicability (i.e. relatively small projects don't have enough profit potential to entice would be conservators; bigger projects may have more potential payoff for a would be conservator, but there are not many entities that have financial where with all to take on really big jobs).

Again, getting a conservatorship established often involves a long drawn out process in court with numerous hearings as it is hostile to the legal property owner's interest (and hence significant additional legal costs beyond whatever the repairs and development costs would be).",t2_29u5if8g,Face_Plant_Some_More,0,1647377520.0,0,t1_i0sr438,i0sr438,False,HalfbakedArtichoke,t3_texnjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/texnjd/abandoned_homes/,Abandoned homes?,/r/lancaster/comments/texnjd/abandoned_homes/i0sr438/,2,r/lancaster,0,2

"Legally, there is no such thing as ""abandoned"" property. Property always has legal owner(s), though said ownership is often disputed.  As a practical matter, the City may condemn, or otherwise take ownership of property via eminent domain.

Similarly, the City could also move to force a sale of property for delinquent taxes, or for fines / penalties for property maintenance violations that were reduced to judgement / liens.  But as you can imagine, any process in which the City takes ownership of private property, judicially -

1. Takes a lot of time (i.e. lots of court appearances, lawyers, etc.). Depriving people of their property rights is not something that is taken lightly.
2. Costs lots of money. I don't just mean legal fees here. Indeed, when taking property by eminent domain, the City has to pay ""fair market"" value for the property in question. It is not ""free"" by any stretch of the imagination.

Accordingly, as you might suspect, due to costs, and effort, forcibly taking ownership of property is often a solution of last resort to the City.

Note there is also a class component as well (i.e. Poor condition property is often owned by folks who have less money, or are persons of color, or both).  While getting unsafe and dangerous property remedied is a valid interest for the City, this is tempered with concerns about fairness too (i.e. don't want to be seen as unfairly beating up on poorer residents of color).",t2_29u5if8g,Face_Plant_Some_More,0,1647374164.0,0,t1_i0siay8,i0siay8,True,HalfbakedArtichoke,t3_texnjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/texnjd/abandoned_homes/,Abandoned homes?,/r/lancaster/comments/texnjd/abandoned_homes/i0siay8/,23,r/lancaster,0,23

"I support the effort to reduce vehicle noise in the city 100%. I do, though, want to acknowledge that in my neighborhood the police set out last year to reduce the horrendous amount of noise caused by dirt bikers by tracking down the illegal bikes, investigating garage rentals in the area where they were being stored. The noise problem has improved significantly. Given of course that it's been cold and wintery and that is a big help with holding down the dirt biker problem, the improvement was apparent in the late summer/early fall last year even before the cold weather set in. It's not perfect. There are still plenty of jerks, but it is very much improved and I appreciate the work law enforcement put into this issue. Still much to be done, but at least in my neighborhood it's mostly loud engines in cars now and many fewer screeching dirt bikes. Fingers crossed the improvement holds and that things continue to get better.
