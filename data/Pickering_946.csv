"Thanks for all the help guys! I was 99.9999% sure it was a scam but with a potential $5 million on the line I had to do my due diligence.

For a back story, I received a fax at my work that was addressed to me regarding funds of a deceased late relative and they were working to distribute his estate to next of kin, if it is not claimed within 3 years it becomes property of the state. And yes, a ‚Äúrelative‚Äù I have never heard of. 

I know I know. It sounds like a scam up front, but I felt like I needed to do my investigation. 

I responded to the email they provided and received a response on a letter head as well as a death certificate.

According to google maps, it showed the address given but didn‚Äôt specifically say it was said law firm. 

Being in the US I couldn‚Äôt call the number to see if a receptionist would answer. 

The website provided was very thorough and very well put together, something you would expect from a real business. They definitely took their time.

No obituary could be found for the deceased, but that had me thinking, if they could never contact a next of kin, who would have wrote the obituary? 

Anyway, it made for a fun little investigation to pass the time and work, and I appreciate those of you who helped with my goose chase!

"There has to be. I've never seen so many ""help wanted"" and ""We're hiring"" signs in my life. Granted, many probably require some level of experience. Maybe you should focus on something that interests you and start there.

Tip: Walk in with resume in hand, introduce yourself, ask to speak with manager. Shake hands with a smile and eye contact then give him/her your resume. Follow up by adding that you've also filled out the online employment questionnaire.  Project some enthusiasm and explain who you are and that you're looking for employment. You'd be surprised, you might just land it...experience or not.

"It's interesting for sure, in my opinion it's going to be a very long time before even half of these become reality.      

The one thing that strikes me is why are so many of them like 50+ story buildings? It seems almost too much.     

Kingston Road is due to get a rapid transit line installed for buses, a bit like Markham has in the middle lanes, but I sure hope the Go Train gets expanded service to accommodate al those extra people.

"Thanks for the reply, good to know. I hope the retail portions do well, i hope its designed in such a way to encourage people to visit those areas and not just assume that ‚Äúoh, they are just condo shops‚Äù and not worth the time, or that their sole purpose is to provide small services to condo residents. 

Has there been any discussion as to how this may affect property taxes (if at all?).

"Thank you!

I hear you - traffic and infrastructure are super valid concerns. From what I know, they are going to be making the necessary upgrades to support these over time, but it is indeed a point worth stressing.

City Centre (around PTC) is definitely my favourite project of them all too - so exciting for us as a city! And lots of it is communal for all area residents to enjoy for free :)

One distinction I will make between the retail you see at San Francisco by the Bay and much of what you see in this video is the sheer scale of everything - and the types of retail/spaces/parking allotments. Many of these buildings - including VuPoint Condos and the City Centre buildings - will have very large podiums that will have additional space for retail, office, etc. (as compared to tiny, low ceiling shops at SF)

At VuPoint, they have a 6 storey podium and 5 levels of covered above ground parking, plus 5 levels of underground parking. At the City Centre buildings, most buildings have large podiums that will serve other uses than just residential, with many being offices as well.Other developments have plaza's built in, while some are offering higher quality retail on the ground floors (higher ceilings, larger stores, etc). 

What they all have in common is lots and lots of underground parking. So this all will be quite different, and large scale!

There are obviously some downsides to growth and development - many of which you mention here - but I am excited to see what we can become as a city. From my deep dive into all of the available info - I don't see plain old condos condos condos, I see the basis for an incredible, vibrant city!

With regards to rental units - some buildings mentioned are rental towers only. That's where most corporate capital is flowing. The builders that will be selling to consumers tend to really only do just that - sell to end users or individual investors, generally opting to keep a good mix of both. 

All in all, esp with the prices on these compared to everything else that's out there, I do believe it will bring much relief to both buyers and renters. Supply is brutal for both right now!

Thanks for your feedback, as well as for reading this far. Happy to engage and talk about this deeper, and I will 100% be making follow up videos so we can all keep on top of these developments, weigh in, and try to nudge this thing towards the better through advocacy (more on this coming soon as well).

Ciao for now!

"This was a great video. I knew of about a 3rd of these developments.

I'm not so sure 75 Towers is a ""great and cool"" thing for Pickering. Because all I see is massive traffic problems. The 401 will be a bigger nightmare both ways than it already is. How are all these towers going to impact things like sewage treatment and garbage in Pickering?

Also, more units to buy may sound great, but a big problem is large corporations buying up places and then renting them out. How will this not happen in Pickering? There by exasperating the housing problem. 

Some of this does sound good, I am particularly interested in the developments around the Pickering Mall. But knocking down every plaza that Pickering has to throw up Condos? I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

The San Francisco by the Bay condo on Bayly, west of Liverpool has ""retail at the base"", but who is that for? Mainly the Condo people, because there is limited parking and the units are tiny. I don't know if anyone actually drives to those areas for those retail shops.

Is this how it will be with all of these Condos?",t2_6w0v8,G8kpr,0,1642546648.0,0,t1_ht8q8yx,ht8q8yx,True,NextGenRealEstateTO,t3_s77csq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pickering/comments/s77csq/hey_pickering_family_i_know_many_of_us_have_heard/,Hey Pickering family!

"I would call the bylaw office and report it. Essentially what they'll do is send an officer over, however I don't know if he can do anything if he doesn't witness the dog off the leash. He may go talk to the owner.

In Pickering, ALL animals that are outside must be on a leash of some sort, be it Cat, Dog, bunny rabbit, ferret, whatever. So all those ""out door cats"" you see wandering around, yeah, that's against the bylaw.

People in pickering don't care apparently. We have a guy down the street that is sort of like your neighbour, but his dog isn't aggressive. He lets the dog loose in the front of his house, and the dog will run down the street, and he just calls it occasionally. It came up to my wife once while she was gardening in our backyard.

I've seen it do the same to our neighbour in the front yard. 

Dog owners often have this attitude of ""I love my dog, ergo, the entire world loves my dog"". My daughter is 10, and she has a real discomfort around dogs. She just doesn't like them, and will usually stay away, unless there is a physical fence between her and the dog, then she might approach it.

Last winter I was walking with her to school, and this guy is walking his dog with those shitty leashes that can retract or let out more lead. So he lets the lead out so the dog can rush my daughter, who then freaks, and the dog chases her, the leash wrapping itself around us. Then my daughter in her panic state slips on ice and falls down, crying and screaming. The asshole gets his dog under control and quickly walks away without so much as a ""sorry, is she ok?"".",t2_6w0v8,G8kpr,0,1637743936.0,0,t1_hlvpi77,hlvpi77,True,Beneficial_Pattern98,t3_r0xjwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pickering/comments/r0xjwz/neighbour_keeps_agressive_dog_off_leash/,Neighbour keeps agressive dog off leash,/r/Pickering/comments/r0xjwz/neighbour_keeps_agressive_dog_off_leash/hlvpi77/,5,r/Pickering,0,5

"Not to mention that the first company working on it, never built pedestrian bridges, and ended up putting an entire floor section in upside down. They had to fire that company and hire a new company.

Then they found out that the first company made the stairwell on the north side too large compared to it's design, so the mesh sections that they had made no longer fit properly and had to be thrown out and new ones created.

The thing sat half completed for like 2-3 years, pickering's eyesore. 

I am glad that it's here now. I think they should extend it straight into the mall, and branch a section off to the new condos being built on the south side, east of the GO Station (where the old Ice Rink once was). 

If I was a condo dweller, the option to walk to the mall without being rained on would be amazing.

Heading north is my normal choice. By the time you get to Taunton you're past most of the traffic. Get north of the 407 and it's even less. I find a small town and shoot for that. Lake Simcoe might be a reasonable distance for your weekend rides.


Most of the paved roads will have a speed limit of at least 70. I don't know of any long sections of newly paved asphalt. Scenery is mostly flat farmland.


The city of Pickering does have a cycling route guide, I don't think it's very good and the region doesn't put effort into cycling infrastructure.

"Pre-covid, my commute times from Pickering to Caledon were roughly an hour, an hour-10, give or take. It's now roughly 45 minutes to an hour, and steadily creeping up. During the start of COVID, early march of last year, my commute times were an incredible 30-35 minutes, with the roads being virtually empty. In addition to less commute time, gas was cheap, they were giving out bonus pay, banked hours, AND I was getting overtime/double-time like nobody's business - really a golden opportunity in an otherwise shitty situation. 

&#x200B;

Post-COVID, or at least until everything is open back up, I'm seeing the commute times lengthen, again. 401 W around Leslie/Bayview/Young, on the express - before the D.V.P exit - has started pooling up, like pre-COVID times. Although it doesn't come to a complete stop, yet. I'm having to wake up earlier to get to work now, as opposed to sleeping and leaving an hour before my shift start.

"This post is about a question in parliament asked about the lack of transparency around lobbying efforts for leases on a billion dollar piece of public land set aside for the pickering airport. It is about the extent of the power and influence of lobbyists, the request for information about when and who they influenced and the local MPs involvement.

I understand that you have other questions, specifically about the infrastructure paradox( how building an airport can reduce emissions), and I encourage your to answer them by reading some of the environmental focus posts such as:

https://pickeringairport.org/aviation-to-beat-road-transportation-to-net-zero-carbon-emissions-with-saf/

https://pickeringairport.org/planning-canadas-electric-flight-future/

https://pickeringairport.org/aviations-two-paths-to-a-net-zero-carbon-future/

https://pickeringairport.org/how-pickering-airport-can-be-carbon-neutral/


But to get back to the original topic, I would also encourage you to become aware of  the politics of influence in our democracy.

"Yea, valid thing to be concerned about. Many people alive now have lived through two serious nuclear incidents contaminating large areas. But I think those incidents can be traced to three caused - earthquakes, no containment building, and poor procedures - that aren't a concern for us.


Canada is a very geologically stable area for the most part. If it is a less stable area (looking at you BC) there are no nuclear reactors there. Large earthquakes and their effects are not a significant risk for our nuclear reactors.


CANDU reactors, like any modern western design, each have a containment building. They are thick buildings made of rebar and where they couldn't fit more rebar they poured concrete designed to contain incidents (I don't know, maybe caused by an earthquake).


Safety procedures are strong in Canada. Nothing happens to any system even if it seems completely safe to you and me without being reviewed multiple times. Nuclear operator jobs require significant training.

"Hi, 

So the EI has been extended because of worsening codification, but when it does in fact run out, as far as the specifics of this question, there are webinars with the CRA where you can ask these specific questions, cause I'm not myself sure of the specific framework for that.

If you want to know about the webinar, DM me for the link, they happen every month with Durham Region Unemployed help Centre.

Direct from the CRA website about CRB:

""What happens if I am expecting to exhaust my benefits by March 27, 2021?
The government has approved an increase in the number of weeks available under the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) of 12 weeks, extending the maximum duration of the benefits from 26 weeks to up to 38 weeks.

"This time of year in Pickering I'd say Petticoat Creek Conservation Area.  It's closed for the season, so it's mostly local foot traffic.  A close second could be Rotary Frenchman's Bay WEST park.  

Don't tell anyone, but...  There are 3 options for parking.

1. East side go down Park Cres. until it ends.  Park there follow bike path in. ( this is the closest parking available)
2. North side go down Whites to the end.  Park in lot by soccer field, and walk down the driveway.  (Most parking, but furthest away)
3. West side go down Rosebank Rd. to the end swing a left on Rodd Ave.  Entrance to Park is at the end.  Entrance to Bike Trail/Rouge Park is immediately on the right after tracks.

Rouge Park / Waterfront trail is a good walk, but everyone is on the path so it get crowded in places.

"Depends on your lifestyle and what you're looking for. Moving from downtown, you're probably going to be disappointed as here has less walkability and less diversity of stuff to do. However it should be cheaper (recent rent and buying process beg to differ), and you can get all basic needs meet with a 10-15 minute drive.

Demographic: 95% brown, 5% everything else.

Age: Around Pure Springs and Taunton is mostly young families but you still get intergenerational families with 20 ppl per house. 

Friendliness: Everyone is pretty friendly and keep to themselves. Be patient on the road though.

Pros: Good access to active stuff (hikes, dog park, golf, Rouge Valley), decent spread of restaurants of all types, good diversity of grocery stores, good sustainable development plans from the city. Will be booming in 10-15 years. Imo the next best thing if you can't afford to live downtown Toronto.

Cons: It's not downtown, isn't necessarily cheaper than Toronto.

The pickering mall is a fine mall,  not huge, but Scarborough Town Centre is about a 15-20 min drive, and the Oshawa Centre is about a 30 minute drive.

GO station is nearby and can get you downtown in 40 min approximately.

Just be aware that a new casino was supposed to open last summer (halted due to covid) which will be bringing more traffic to the area. Plus there has been a constant fight for an airport north of us, that goes back to the 70s.

People want to live here and so towers will go up. You can whine and kick and scream all you want. But the pressure is on and developers will develop. Get over it. It's urban sprawl and it isn't new.

"Growing up in a blissful corner of Scarborough, I was all for jobs and change until I didn't recognize where I lived. My old home is now overdeveloped and depopulated with empty store fronts and decaying towers.

I moved to Pickering for the peace I thought the nuclear plant would guarantee. Now, the boss hogs want to urban creep me out again.

Communities grow, but I don't see how undervaluing our workforce through low paying jobs and degrading our community with cheap entertainment for itinerant visiting party animals strengthens the community fabric. Contrary to what the boss hogs think, it is not every Durham mother's dream to see her kids slinging baggage at Mirabel 2 / passing the shoe at the tacky casino.

I, too, am having a hard time visualizing ""downtown"" Pickering. Have you ever visited Downtown Brampton or Downtown Mississauga? I haven't. And when I wanted a good time (precovid) I went to Toronto or Montreal. Driving ten minutes into downtown Pickering for a lousy meal at the cheesy casino steak and seafood restaurant is not my idea of a good time.

I can only hope that the boss hogs will continue to dream on and leave us local folk alone in our pretty freaking wonderful community.",t2_7gt18ag2,Flashy_Pen4771,0,1613850739.0,0,t1_go5fw35,go5fw35,False,[deleted],t3_loa41l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pickering/comments/loa41l/drunk_building_schemes_ignore_post_pandemic_world/,DRUNK BUILDING SCHEMES IGNORE POST PANDEMIC WORLD,/r/Pickering/comments/loa41l/drunk_building_schemes_ignore_post_pandemic_world/go5fw35/,4,r/Pickering,0,4

- world won‚Äôt change.  Good and bad elements are going to be part of the society in one or the other way.
- People need to educate themselves about sexual orientation in general.  Not sure how and when this can happen.  Till then JUST BE YOURSELF! 
- Generally a person has to mature early in life to handle these situations.  Hope you can do that instead taking some bad decisions for yourself and your partner.  Better to invest your effort and time to improve yourself, life  in general.  Those who are investing time in taking your pictures is a clear waste. It means NOTHING!

"You'd have to ask the company that runs the complex about how the visitor parking works. I know that some places want you to register visitors otherwise they're towed. If there are no rules like that then it's really just common courtesy to not use it unless you're a visitor.

Considering the area you're in, I assume you're referring to the Walmart plaza. Pretty much all of these plazas will have some kind of parking enforcement after a certain time (E.g., 10PM) that will ticket you for parking there overnight. Not always, but it happens. 

Regarding residential streets, there are a few bylaws to keep in mind about parking on the road. First, you can't park within 10 ft of a stop sign; second, unless otherwise stated you're not supposed to park overnight on the street (if bylaw is coming around they will chalk your tire and if they come back and the car hasn't moved you'll be ticketed); finally I'd advise that if you're truly stuck to look on the City of Pickerings website and see if there's are street passes you can get.

">The Altona Group has a development proposal for the corner of Kingston Road and Liverpool Road. Under the proposal, Liverpool John‚Äôs, a pub and restaurant formerly known as the Old Liverpool House, would be slightly relocated and restored, and the area to the north would be redeveloped to include a 25-storey building, a 12-storey building and seven, three-storey townhouses. Residents and politicians are concerned about the scope of the project. Early in 2020, the building was added to Pickering's heritage registry. An updated proposal will likely come before the planning and development committee in 2021.

This is the worst idea ever. But Dave ""I have the developers interest at heart"" Ryan will probably jump at the chance to appease a builder.

Pickering doesn't have a lot of heritage buildings, moving the building will disrupt it quite a bit, and something I don't trust at all. i've seen far to many horror stories of ""oh, we're just going to move this heritage building, ooopsie, it's a pile of rubble now. My bad.""

This is just plain incorrect. You can't spread it if neither partner has it, so a monogamous relationship where neither partner is infected cannot magically generate AIDS. Please do not spread misinformation.

LGBT people are most affected because of intolerance leading to unsafe sexual encounters (if you can't have a public relationship you tend to move towards secret encounters with strangers, who's sexual history you may be unaware of). Maybe read a little more into the why instead of assuming correlation = causation.

Also, it's possible to be Muslim without following Sharia Law, just sayin'. Freedom of religion dude. Don't conflate religious views with government. It never ends well. I have no obligation to respect Middle Eastern politics.

Also, who said I was a guy? More assumptions on your part?

As for threatening retaliation? Again, you want people to respect your religion, maybe you should respect other people's beliefs. You want Islamophobia to go away? Don't make threats when someone tells you to bugger off when you're being a dickhead. All you're doing is making things worse for yourself. I try my best to be respectful of different cultures but you're literally telling me you'd rather see me dead than let me live my own life. What kind of religion supports murder?? Goes two ways.

Will the developers be forced to provide some units as rentals / low income housing?  We should be insisting on this.

"""small"" if used to describe density of population, then yes. It's sparsely populated with distinct clusters of communities.

But it's projected to grow quite a bit as it catches some of the people who leave Toronto to find cheaper housing (although prices in pickering are no longer cheap).

However, in size, this place is truly massive. Up until recently the town of Uxbridge was/is part of pickering. In fact the federal riding still calls it pickering-Uxbridge. This area is so massive that the cities of Ajax, Whitby, and Oshawa can all fit in there and still have a lot of spare room.

"Glove point I agree - unless you have ulcers or open wounds on your hands. However, Do not be fooled by what everyone has parroted about masks. Masks absolutely work to protect you from exposure to virus. They are the definitive line of defense, the one and only between you and an asymptomatic person breathing out droplets full of the virus.

Masks are so essential that the Asian countries who have managed to get control over this situation are wondering why on earth are the west not enforcing masks over everyone who is out and about. Austria has at least heeded that advice. But absolutely do not, for a moment, listen to anyone who says masks don't work. Bugger that, they work and that's why nurses and doctors' critical piece of kit is a mask. It's so critical that in such dire times, fda has approved reusing them by sanitizing them.

It's such a dangerous misinformation campaign that was run, along with ""it's just a flu"". Still to this day WHO refuses to recommend masks for general population, yet countries who have won the battle, are flabbergasted. A stance so stupid that CDC is trying to go it alone: https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/cdc-considering-recommending-general-public-wear-face-coverings-in-public/2020/03/30/6a3e495c-7280-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html",t2_elm8w,mobilesurfer,0,1585650069.0,0,t1_fm09kir,fm09kir,False,[deleted],t3_frw99g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pickering/comments/frw99g/glovesmasks_in_pickering/,Gloves/masks in Pickering,/r/Pickering/comments/frw99g/glovesmasks_in_pickering/fm09kir/,2,r/Pickering,0,2
"If you have access to frequent hand washing sink you can probably do without masks or gloves. Its going to be hard to get your hands on those things, and most assuredly the best thing you can do for yourself when out there in the public is frequent hand washing and avoiding contact with your face. And when at checkout put up a sneeze guard like I've seen at superstore and costco. Im not convinced gloves are saving anyone from the virus, and most of the times masks aren't doing what you think that are doing (ie they aren't filtering out germs from the air your breathing in) BUT if you are coughing or sneezing then masks can help stop you from spreading anything around.
