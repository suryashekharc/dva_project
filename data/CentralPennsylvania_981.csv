"I can't say I know a ton about the area but I have rode the Lebanon Valley rail trail just south of Lebanon that extends toward Elizabethtown. There are lots of nice quiet places around there, just south of Lebanon is Mt Gretna which is also a nice little spot with a lake and such. Lots of parking along the trail if you want a quiet walk. 

The Cornwall Iron Furnace site is also kind of interesting if you're into history, just southeast of that is Boyd St that has a bunch of old houses that used to house the furnace workers.

There are specific code requirements when it comes to electrical supply connections and where the spa is located in relation to the house.

"Honestly you're probably boned. Most affordable houses in the area have been bought by property management groups that rent the houses at extortionate rates with ridiculously restrictive requirements. Elite Property Management is probably the worst offender here; I once saw a listing from them for a 5BR rental home with a large fenced-in yard that insisted on no pets of *any* kind.

There's a lot of breed-restrictive assholes too, so if you've got a pibble/GSD/Rottie or similar you'll have even more trouble renting. 

If you can settle for a 2BR (albeit with optional 2-car garage) the Quaker Station Apartments near Lewisberry are probably your best bet. You'll have to pay a per-pet fee but the owner couldn't care less what kind of pets you have as long as you make your payments and follow the rules (the most restrictive of which is a ""no open flames"" policy).",t2_91388,Petkorazzi,0,1645025677.0,0,t1_hx6m3ls,hx6m3ls,True,[deleted],t3_stxgie,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralpa/comments/stxgie/anyone_have_housing_tips/,Anyone have housing tips?,/r/centralpa/comments/stxgie/anyone_have_housing_tips/hx6m3ls/,6,r/centralpa,0,6

"Go to an Al-anon or Nar-anon meeting for support. I’m sure there are online meetings if that’s convenient. There is so much to this you can’t know unless you’ve lived it or seen it up close. Talking to someone that knows the other side can help you help them, and also help you protect yourself.

You seem to understand that you shouldn’t give them money. Don’t and do not, under any circumstances. When I was on drugs all money equated to was drug tickets, even if I wanted to have good intentions.

My times in treatment (yes, it rarely sticks on the first try) were paid for through the state, primarily Medicaid I believe, and grants. Assuming that these people are ready and not just using treatment as an excuse to ask for money, try calling treatment centers and asking if they have a bed and how a patient might get funding. This could really save you money and the truth is, if a person wants to get clean a fancy place is as good as any other. 

My suggestion is White Deer Run, especially the newer facilities. They seem to be well dispersed through PA. Sometimes they will bus to and from other towns/cities but it depends on the circumstances.

"One of the coolest local spots I've found to urban explore with my friends, is an abandoned coaling tower in West York, off the side of E. Berlin Rd. It sits right next to a massive abandoned limestone quarry that you can also hike to the far end of and go cliff jumping off a 35 ft cliff, and also has a sunken factory sticking out of the middle that you can swim out to and dive off the conveyor belt. The tower itself is super sketchy to explore but I've successfully climbed it a couple times and haven't died yet. The only way up is a rusty, corroding spiral staircase and as you climb it, it feels like the whole thing could collapse at any moment. The bottom of it is already collapsed so to get on, you have to parkour your way up to a grated platform and then use a little paracord rope swing to repel across the side of the concrete Tower onto the staircase. If your ballsy enough to do that, each room continuing up the tower has some really interesting machinery and the very top is basically a lookout deck over the quarry and the city of York as a whole wall is just ripped out!

"I totally get your point- but my quick math seems to show this makes a lot of sense. It just costs a lot of money to run a business. To me- this is the perfect example of the kind of business that was devastated by a govt forced shutdown (not a political statement, a fact). This is a very bizarre tourist trap, in a place with no real way to sustain itself if not for events, and the steady stream of tour buses rolling down Rt 15, or coming to it as a weird destination.  


They had 160 employees. Even at an average of $20k per that's $3.2M a year, JUST on salaries. That's not counting paying taxes on FICA, Insurance, workers comp, and other employee related costs. That's also JUST the labor- not keeping the place open, buying food, inventory, etc. So 2 years of labor is already $6.4M, and frankly I feel like that number is likely a low guess.  


This place went from ""how does a place like this work?"" to empty- once people were not allowed to show up, or do so much less. So while I completely agree people need to be held accountable for their PPP spending- this makes perfect sense to me as a candidate to need the loan, and I'm not shocked at all to see them shut down.

I can say I'm surprised that they are closing as they have a fairly large footprint in the area. They catered to so many businesses and events that I find it hard to believe they were hurting all that much even with the pandemic. They weren't closed very much during the worst of it. Yes, the number of busses stopping and disgorging flocks of senior citizens certainly went way down but even so, was that enough to sink them?

And I agree that they should be held accountable for the grants they got and the seeming unfulfilled promises made. But I'm a realist;  nothing will come of it. Just like so many others who took the money and ran.

The other aspect of this is that Evangelical Hospital has been buying up all of the properties along Hafer Road.

"Ok here's how that works. Every square foot of PA is located within a city, borough or township. Areas of counties that weren't part of an established city or borough were split into townships. Originally these were the rural areas and still are in many cases. PA has no unincorporated areas unlike many states. 

This matters when buying a home as townships regulate zoning and building. And school district boundaries are along municipal lines - you typically won't see districts sharing a township but they do cross county lines. Townships have their own government  - a board of supervisors. And their own property taxes, on top of the school district and county. They are responsible for trash, sewer and local road maintenance too.",t2_hagws,openwheelr,0,1642439403.0,0,t1_ht24pwo,ht24pwo,False,FlyHighNoLie,t3_s51fqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralpa/comments/s51fqp/considering_moving_to_central_pa/,Considering moving to Central PA,/r/centralpa/comments/s51fqp/considering_moving_to_central_pa/ht24pwo/,2,r/centralpa,0,2

"I've lived in Montco and have family in Loudoun Co and Alexandria so I have some familiarity with your area and here.  The cost of living here is super cheap compared to Montgomery County, MD and Fairfax County/Loudoun County.  When you mention diversity, you lived in two of the most diverse areas on the East Coast outside of NYC.  Mechanicsburg does not have any diversity in comparison.  You will see some minorities but I'd guess they are maybe 10% or less of the total Mechanicsburg population.  Your choices for ethnic restaurants, grocery, etc is very minimal compared to where you are located, but we have a few.  Mechanicsburg has a lot of new construction homes that are beautiful if you can afford them, and yes they cost about as much as a townhome where you are.  Upper Allen, Silver Spring, and Hampden Townships are the ones you want to live and buy in for the neighborhoods and schools.  We are in the middle of nowhere with Baltimore being the nearest city at about 1.5 to 1.75 hrs.  If you don't mind driving that far to get to a city you'll be ok.  There is no metro system like in DC area.  Car is required everywhere.   It is quiet with no traffic so that part will be wonderful compared to the Beltway, 270, etc.

Lancaster County has a little more to offer than we do and it isn't far from Harrisburg to visit her family.

"Moved here from NOVA in 2006.  It's a great place to raise your kids.  Much less stress and traffic.  You'll be shocked as to how much less time it takes to do regular stuff like go to the grocery store or home depot.  Great community for families.

The downside is there is less of the cultural stuff.  Quality restaurants, events, etc.  I wish there was more actual stuff to do outside of family and child related activities. Feel free to dm me if you have any other specific questions.

"Harrisburg is a great and affordable place to raise a family.

Honestly, the best part of Harrisburg is that it’s easy to get to NYC, Philly, DC and Pittsburgh. I spent most of my life in the South and you have to drive 6 hours to go to a different city. I take my kids on frequent trips to the big cities around here to ensure they see more than Central PA.

"Hi all, we just got back from a weekend trip to Carlisle.  We looked at some houses in Mechanicsburg, but ended up eating mostly in Carlisle.

- Yak n Yeti was interesting and good; I would definitely go back and try more of the menu (what we had was tasty and high quality, but not crazy crave-able). Service was great. 
- LOVED Issei Noodle in Carlisle (both dishes we ordered were fantastic).  The Ramen hubs ordered was even better than that near current home.
- Kanagawa Sushi in downtown Mechanicsburg was affordable and fresh. The sushi chef came by the table to chat; we were impressed and would definitely return.
- Checked out Cafe Bruges in Carlisle, which was good, but somehow a little disappointing... it was perhaps because of what we ordered. Would go back and try something else for sure.

George's:  typical pa sub shop, solid food but the prices have gone up too much imo.

Cafe bruges: my favorite, pricier than average but well worth it.  Belgian.  Good beer.

Hamilton: cheap and quick, somewhere between fast food and standard dining.  Has a sign in the window with some 'not following unconstitutional mask order' bullshit on it if you care about that.

Issei:  East asian noodle joint.  Very good, always jammed, but never slow on service.

Yak N Yeti 2:  everyone I know raves about this place but I've never been.  Pricey.

New vegetarian joint:  never been, not interested, but it exists.

Gingerbread man:  mostly a bar but the food is fine.

Grand Illusion: not quite standard fare  food is fine, but it's really about the cider.

Stamm's: beloved fried chicken  but for sale last I saw so who knows.

Castleriggs:  If you're a wino but not a foodie.

Whiskey Rebellion:  hotel restaurant disqualifies it for me but seldom empty so they must have something

Indian Joint(i forget):  The Indian food lovers i know said it's terrible so I've never been

Hanover grille:  folks seem to either love it or hate it.  I could leave it.

Redd's:  BBQ never disappoints.  Byob.

Market cross:  english pub food, dishes are hit and miss, GIANT import selection.  Mix n match 6 packs.

Mt Fuji:  Sushi.  Not my thing, but my sister likes it better than any others.

Chen's: best chinese takeout in town.

I know a great realtor, DM if interested. He really earned his commission! Not pushy.

Schools - I'm in Cumberland Valley and it's getting very crowded. The high school is bursting at the seams. Good test scores and it's the most sought-after district to live in. Mechanicsburg school district (Upper Allen) is also good and not as crowded yet. We've been happy overall with the teachers our kids have had (4th and 6th grade).

Silver Spring is exploding but Hampden is maybe more livable. We have a growing trail system for example. The developments are a little older but better thought out.

That's a lie. 


Also please remember the CDC changed how deaths were reported for this pandemic so what you're seeing in death numbers is death WITH covid not death FROM covid. If you die in an car accident they'll test your crispy remains if positive you're added to the count. It's said that only 6% of reported deaths were actually from covid.

>""They are seeing a waning of immunity not only against infection but against hospitalization and to some extent death, which is starting to now involve all age groups. It isn't just the elderly,"" Fauci said. ""It's waning to the point that you're seeing more and more people getting breakthrough infections, and more and more of those people who are getting breakthrough infections are winding up in the hospital.""

Wow it works so well!

before the vaccine only the extremely sick and old died, now it's all age groups.

That's [ADE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8438590/). That's your future.

A little anecdote. The only person I know who died from covid was 99, I've known 2 to die from the vaccine, and I have an uncle who got a heart attack soon after his 2nd shot followed by kidney failure. Tiny microclots in his blood stream from the vaccine may kill him before xmas.

"I am not being melodramatic, and I’m not pretending. The fact is that this sets a precedent that may keep schools from protecting their surrounding communities with safe vaccines in the future. As far as I'm aware, there is nothing in the bill that points to revisiting the issue either, and so as these vaccines continue to be proven effective, the law may not change unless the senate chooses to reconvene. 

The risk of dying from the covid vaccines in the states is 0.0017% which is significantly lower than the risk of dying from the disease its self which has an estimated infection fatality rate that hovers around 0.20%.

The covid vaccines do all of the things you've listed, including preventing infection. They aren't an impenetrable barrier, but they do protect you from getting the disease and from dying of it. Around 97% of all people hospitalized with COVID in this country are unvaccinated, and for a bit of anecdotal evidence-  a family we’re very close with was just infected. The 20 something-year-old son was the one who ended up hospitalized. Their diabetic mother simply had a cough. She was vaccinated. He was not.

The flu vaccine can cause paralysis and anaphylaxis. Vaccines aren't perfect, the covid vaccines included, but they do work. 

Here is an article outlining T-cell response and neutralizing antibodies.

The last source you provided isn't baseless, and it is important that we continue to study these vaccines, but they have been proven to be safe and effective by the data we currently have. AHA themselves noted that that study had several potential flaws

"the fact that they are FDA approved and have been used on a millions of kids for decades possibly. 

the fact that they actually prevents infection, transmission, hospitalization and death maybe be another possible factor.

the fact that traditional vaccines also provide long term protection is probably another factor.

the fact that healthy young adults and teenagers weren't dropping dead like they have this past year could also possibly be another factor.
