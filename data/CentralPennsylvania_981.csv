"Honestly you're probably boned. Most affordable houses in the area have been bought by property management groups that rent the houses at extortionate rates with ridiculously restrictive requirements. Elite Property Management is probably the worst offender here; I once saw a listing from them for a 5BR rental home with a large fenced-in yard that insisted on no pets of *any* kind.

There's a lot of breed-restrictive assholes too, so if you've got a pibble/GSD/Rottie or similar you'll have even more trouble renting. 

If you can settle for a 2BR (albeit with optional 2-car garage) the Quaker Station Apartments near Lewisberry are probably your best bet. You'll have to pay a per-pet fee but the owner couldn't care less what kind of pets you have as long as you make your payments and follow the rules (the most restrictive of which is a ""no open flames"" policy).",t2_91388,Petkorazzi,0,1645025677.0,0,t1_hx6m3ls,hx6m3ls,True,[deleted],t3_stxgie,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralpa/comments/stxgie/anyone_have_housing_tips/,Anyone have housing tips?,/r/centralpa/comments/stxgie/anyone_have_housing_tips/hx6m3ls/,6,r/centralpa,0,6

"Go to an Al-anon or Nar-anon meeting for support. I‚Äôm sure there are online meetings if that‚Äôs convenient. There is so much to this you can‚Äôt know unless you‚Äôve lived it or seen it up close. Talking to someone that knows the other side can help you help them, and also help you protect yourself.

You seem to understand that you shouldn‚Äôt give them money. Don‚Äôt and do not, under any circumstances. When I was on drugs all money equated to was drug tickets, even if I wanted to have good intentions.

My times in treatment (yes, it rarely sticks on the first try) were paid for through the state, primarily Medicaid I believe, and grants. Assuming that these people are ready and not just using treatment as an excuse to ask for money, try calling treatment centers and asking if they have a bed and how a patient might get funding. This could really save you money and the truth is, if a person wants to get clean a fancy place is as good as any other. 

My suggestion is White Deer Run, especially the newer facilities. They seem to be well dispersed through PA. Sometimes they will bus to and from other towns/cities but it depends on the circumstances.

"One of the coolest local spots I've found to urban explore with my friends, is an abandoned coaling tower in West York, off the side of E. Berlin Rd. It sits right next to a massive abandoned limestone quarry that you can also hike to the far end of and go cliff jumping off a 35 ft cliff, and also has a sunken factory sticking out of the middle that you can swim out to and dive off the conveyor belt. The tower itself is super sketchy to explore but I've successfully climbed it a couple times and haven't died yet. The only way up is a rusty, corroding spiral staircase and as you climb it, it feels like the whole thing could collapse at any moment. The bottom of it is already collapsed so to get on, you have to parkour your way up to a grated platform and then use a little paracord rope swing to repel across the side of the concrete Tower onto the staircase. If your ballsy enough to do that, each room continuing up the tower has some really interesting machinery and the very top is basically a lookout deck over the quarry and the city of York as a whole wall is just ripped out!

"I totally get your point- but my quick math seems to show this makes a lot of sense. It just costs a lot of money to run a business. To me- this is the perfect example of the kind of business that was devastated by a govt forced shutdown (not a political statement, a fact). This is a very bizarre tourist trap, in a place with no real way to sustain itself if not for events, and the steady stream of tour buses rolling down Rt 15, or coming to it as a weird destination.  


They had 160 employees. Even at an average of $20k per that's $3.2M a year, JUST on salaries. That's not counting paying taxes on FICA, Insurance, workers comp, and other employee related costs. That's also JUST the labor- not keeping the place open, buying food, inventory, etc. So 2 years of labor is already $6.4M, and frankly I feel like that number is likely a low guess.  


This place went from ""how does a place like this work?"" to empty- once people were not allowed to show up, or do so much less. So while I completely agree people need to be held accountable for their PPP spending- this makes perfect sense to me as a candidate to need the loan, and I'm not shocked at all to see them shut down.

I can say I'm surprised that they are closing as they have a fairly large footprint in the area.

Yes, the number of busses stopping and disgorging flocks of senior citizens certainly went way down but even so, was that enough to sink them?

And I agree that they should be held accountable for the grants they got and the seeming unfulfilled promises made. But I'm a realist;  nothing will come of it. Just like so many others who took the money and ran.

"Ok here's how that works. Every square foot of PA is located within a city, borough or township. Areas of counties that weren't part of an established city or borough were split into townships. Originally these were the rural areas and still are in many cases. PA has no unincorporated areas unlike many states. 

This matters when buying a home as townships regulate zoning and building. And school district boundaries are along municipal lines - you typically won't see districts sharing a township but they do cross county lines. Townships have their own government  - a board of supervisors. And their own property taxes, on top of the school district and county. They are responsible for trash, sewer and local road maintenance too.",t2_hagws,openwheelr,0,1642439403.0,0,t1_ht24pwo,ht24pwo,False,FlyHighNoLie,t3_s51fqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralpa/comments/s51fqp/considering_moving_to_central_pa/,Considering moving to Central PA,/r/centralpa/comments/s51fqp/considering_moving_to_central_pa/ht24pwo/,2,r/centralpa,0,2

We are in the middle of nowhere with Baltimore being the nearest city at about 1.5 to 1.75 hrs.  If you don't mind driving that far to get to a city you'll be ok.  There is no metro system like in DC area.  Car is required everywhere.   It is quiet with no traffic so that part will be wonderful compared to the Beltway, 270, etc.

Lancaster County has a little more to offer than we do and it isn't far from Harrisburg to visit her family.

A compromise would be living in Frederick.  It is just up the road from you but cheaper than Montco.  When it comes to diversity, ethnic eateries, traffic, and housing price, it is less than where you are but more than Mechanicsburg.  It is truly in the middle in all aspects.  It would be more of what you are used to.

"A lot of people are migrating from the larger cities to the suburban areas of smaller cities.

West shore has better neighborhoods and I feel like less crime, whereas East has slightly less nice neighborhoods and a bit more crime (especially downtown Harrisburg).

The downside is there is less of the cultural stuff.  Quality restaurants, events, etc.  I wish there was more actual stuff to do outside of family and child related activities. Feel free to dm me if you have any other specific questions.

"Hi all, we just got back from a weekend trip to Carlisle.  We looked at some houses in Mechanicsburg, but ended up eating mostly in Carlisle.

- Yak n Yeti was interesting and good; I would definitely go back and try more of the menu (what we had was tasty and high quality, but not crazy crave-able). Service was great. 
- LOVED Issei Noodle in Carlisle (both dishes we ordered were fantastic).  The Ramen hubs ordered was even better than that near current home.
- Kanagawa Sushi in downtown Mechanicsburg was affordable and fresh. The sushi chef came by the table to chat; we were impressed and would definitely return.
- Checked out Cafe Bruges in Carlisle, which was good, but somehow a little disappointing... it was perhaps because of what we ordered. Would go back and try something else for sure.
- Tried to check out Josie's German Cafe but it wasn't open. 

We'll visit some other spots on the list the next trip.

"I'll have to try Basil Leaf them. Bangkok Wok does their spice on a 1-5 with 5 being Thai Hot. I've only had three things previously, that were prepared in a restaurant, that I had to say ""no mas"" on. 

The first was a six month challenge with a South American chef who didn't believe my tolerance. One Sunday brunch he brought my omelet out and it was BLACK! The second was a wing challenge in Florida. The third a wing challenge as well. When Bangkok Wok got, what they described as, ""their new hot peppers"" was the 4th. Number 5 (Thai hot) absolutely killed me. It's still one of the few places where I don't order top of the scale heat. Four is still leaving me with colorless lips and death throat.

Schools - I'm in Cumberland Valley and it's getting very crowded. The high school is bursting at the seams. Good test scores and it's the most sought-after district to live in. Mechanicsburg school district (Upper Allen) is also good and not as crowded yet. We've been happy overall with the teachers our kids have had (4th and 6th grade).

">The risk of dying from the covid vaccines in the states is 0.0017%

Vaccine deaths/injuries are [woefully under reported](https://www.theburningplatform.com/2021/10/26/vaers-admits-fewer-than-1-of-vaccine-adverse-events-are-reported/) so this is an incorrect number.

>Around 97% of all hospitalized people in this country are unvaccinated

That's a lie. 


Also please remember the CDC changed how deaths were reported for this pandemic so what you're seeing in death numbers is death WITH covid not death FROM covid. If you die in an car accident they'll test your crispy remains if positive you're added to the count. It's said that only 6% of reported deaths were actually from covid.

>but they do work. 

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dr-fauci-just-issued-urgent-201846228.html

>""They are seeing a waning of immunity not only against infection but against hospitalization and to some extent death, which is starting to now involve all age groups. It isn't just the elderly,"" Fauci said. ""It's waning to the point that you're seeing more and more people getting breakthrough infections, and more and more of those people who are getting breakthrough infections are winding up in the hospital.""

Wow it works so well!

before the vaccine only the extremely sick and old died, now it's all age groups.

That's [ADE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8438590/). That's your future.

A little anecdote. The only person I know who died from covid was 99, I've known 2 to die from the vaccine, and I have an uncle who got a heart attack soon after his 2nd shot followed by kidney failure. Tiny microclots in his blood stream from the vaccine may kill him before xmas.

"I am not being melodramatic, and I‚Äôm not pretending. The fact is that this sets a precedent that may keep schools from protecting their surrounding communities with safe vaccines in the future. As far as I'm aware, there is nothing in the bill that points to revisiting the issue either, and so as these vaccines continue to be proven effective, the law may not change unless the senate chooses to reconvene. 

The risk of dying from the covid vaccines in the states is 0.0017% which is significantly lower than the risk of dying from the disease its self which has an estimated infection fatality rate that hovers around 0.20%. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html#:~:text=Reports%20of%20death%20after%20COVID,COVID%2D19%20vaccine.

The covid vaccines do all of the things you've listed, including preventing infection. They aren't an impenetrable barrier, but they do protect you from getting the disease and from dying of it. Around 97% of all people hospitalized with COVID in this country are unvaccinated, and for a bit of anecdotal evidence-  a family we‚Äôre very close with was just infected. The 20 something-year-old son was the one who ended up hospitalized. Their diabetic mother simply had a cough. She was vaccinated. He was not.

The flu vaccine can cause paralysis and anaphylaxis. Vaccines aren't perfect, the covid vaccines included, but they do work. 

Here is an article outlining T-cell response and neutralizing antibodies.

The last source you provided isn't baseless, and it is important that we continue to study these vaccines, but they have been proven to be safe and effective by the data we currently have. AHA themselves noted that that study had several potential flaws

"the fact that they are FDA approved and have been used on a millions of kids for decades possibly. 

the fact that they actually prevents infection, transmission, hospitalization and death maybe be another possible factor.

the fact that traditional vaccines also provide long term protection is probably another factor.

the fact that healthy young adults and teenagers weren't dropping dead like they have this past year could also possibly be another factor.
