"This is actually not even how college student tennants even are. My grandmother was a landlord for a few decades including around here in Whatcom County. She said college students were actually better tennants than most, because most of them were actually trying to get their damage deposit back.

"They told me about it once, very nicely and thoroughly, back in October and I told them ‚Äúnow isn‚Äôt a good time but I‚Äôll be back.‚Äù I was genuinely curious so I asked questions and listened.

I just got the card now because I‚Äôm getting mad gear for backpacking and why wouldn‚Äôt I want 5% back with no annual fees?

The Carle Place REI on Long Island is a great store. I learned a lot from the employees even when I was asking them dumb ass questions lol. Last time I was there I had multiple conversations that really helped me out and the gear was suggested but not pushed on me. They seemed happy to share whatever knowledge they had to help me.

When I was approached about the membership I already knew about it but maybe she knew something about the benefits I didn‚Äôt know so We had a conversation about it. She handed me a sheet of paper with her name to show the cashier so she could get the benefits when I signed up. She was up front about it.

"Except that‚Äôs not the only reason people get rejected.  Nor is it always possible to cover immediate admin fees vs a small bump in the already exorbitant rent around here.

Not so cool story:  When I was younger, I was evicted for reasons that were never actually explained, but circumstantial evidence indicates it was because our neighbor (the assistant manager) wanted their niece to move in when she went to college.

This happened shortly after we spent what little savings we had to help family and friends.  So, we were desperate for a place, despite the fact that I made pretty good money (for the time and area, mind you).

Problem was, we‚Äôd been evicted, and were as a result rejected by every place we applied to - even though, before we ever applied to them, we asked if that would affect things.  One of them even told us it wouldn‚Äôt, took the application fee, and then told us they couldn‚Äôt accept us because they were owned by the same company and that meant we were barred from all of their properties.

Now, things got better - sort of - but that‚Äôs another story.  Point is, over the course of two weeks we applied to at least five places that rejected us for no (known) fault of our own.

"I gotta say I'm rather confused on multiple different fronts here so maybe y'all can break it down into little words for my lizard brain. Just so I understand this:

 A guy is taking time out of his day to try and cover up obscene,  gang graffiti or just crap, in his personal car, with a political sticker on his car.

Did I understand this correctly? So ponder me this one batman. Y'all are saying its absolutely despicable that he may have ADHD and got distracted by some graffiti down the street he found more offensive. And oh sweet lord how unacceptable and ridiculous it is that he has a ""let's go Brandon"" sticker on his personal vehicle. Even though there's a pretty good chance there's a Bernie, or Obama, maybe even Hillary sticker on the bumper of your Subaru. I'm struggling with how it's ok for you, and a crime against humanity for him, to put a small piece of adhesive backed vinyl with words printed on, to be placed on his car. Kinda seems like a double standard to me.

And now the next part that I'm struggling to wrap my single brain cell around. A comment was made that if a ""let's go Brandon"" guy is out painting, at least hes not getting into real trouble. I'm not really sure what this means because I'm fairly sure that all the trouble I've seen caused in this county as of late, weren't caused by a ""let's go Brandon"" guy. I cant say the crack addict stealing the tools from Home Depot I saw tonight looked like a trump supporter. Neither did the guy who broke into my friends house last week with the gang tattoo on his neck. Or the guy who stalked my wife and her friend outside the mall 2 weeks ago. Seems to me that if people are willing to steal, and stalk, they probably dont have an issue vandalizing public areas.

I just want to end this by saying that I absolutely hate politics and the ugly it brings out in people, on both sides. I'm neither a Biden supporter or a Trump supporter. Both sides yell and point fingers at each other when instead they could shake hands and work together. Or better yet, both sides could pick up the paint roller and work together to make the city better.",t2_2ubgecnq,steamrepairman,1,1648270578.0,0,t1_i25qw74,i25qw74,True,Turtle-Fox,t3_toc2vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/toc2vi/to_the_guy_going_around_with_a_tiny_paint_roller/,To the guy going around with a tiny paint roller down town trying to cover up every bit of graffiti,/r/Bellingham/comments/toc2vi/to_the_guy_going_around_with_a_tiny_paint_roller/i25qw74/,-8,r/Bellingham,0,-8

I read the whole thing. The deposit was just the most ridiculous so I had to bring it up. And of course you need to make 3 times rent.  That‚Äôs a given. Another third is taken up by food and other bills and another third by entertainment and savings. Like it‚Äôs a simple explanation but a tried and true thing. Why would someone want to enter into a contract with another person who they may easily default on their payments (rent). The reason this is done is because renters have screwed over owners and they‚Äôve all learned over time.  And the $100 dollar charge is a bit high I agree.

"It's the kind of measure someone might push to get elected by making people think they're fighting for housing protection because it sounds great, but I don't believe it offers any practical benefit.

Landlords will simply calculate the 'average' cost of background checks and administrative hours for the rental unit in question, add 50% 'just in case' (to protect margins, because most rental owners are answering to investors and will be in trouble if units don't perform), and raise the rents for new tenants by this amount. It's a very simple calculus.

Real protection can only come through substantial measures, like banning corporate acquisition of *residential* rentals, and aggressively phasing out existing instances of this practice.

"Most streets have plenty of space to put in a protected bikeway without taking away traffic lanes. 

The main problem is that you'd have to take away parking spots, and the fastest way to turn a conservative into a socialist (or an environmentalist into a champion of the common car) is to threaten their publicly-funded car storage. 

The second problem is driveways and intersections. Especially with a two-way bikeway it creates traffic coming from a direction that drivers aren't accustomed to. It also creates gaps in the protection, which often means people parked in the bikeway either through ignorance or malice or just not having any practical alternative (Although why not just stop the car traffic if you're in a car? Why do you have to go and block the bike lane?).

One solution to this is to just protect the existing bike lanes with anything from little plastic bollards to full-on jersey barriers, but that requires a special street sweeper, and entirely prevents parking on that side of the road (unless it's outside of the bike lane, but that comes with its own set of problems).

"Off-street trails are nice, but a true protected lane (with planters, jersey barriers, etc. between it and vehicle traffic‚Äîlike the 2nd Ave bikeway in Seattle) can also be safe, depending on the number of driveways and intersections. 

One issue is that trails have a speed limit of 15 mph and often have a lot of pedestrian traffic. So they're not great if you're in a hurry, especially if you're on an ebike that could be going twice as fast. 

The other issue is that most of the places I want to go on a bike are on main roads (because they want drivers as customers, too), which might not be easily accessible from the nearest backroad if there's a hill or just plain no public right of way (like most of Iowa St).",t2_1wf2,frankus,0,1648243664.0,0,t1_i248obb,i248obb,False,sourcrude,t3_tn9og4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/tn9og4/would_you_support_converting_one_lane_of_all/,Would you support converting one lane of all roads in city limits to a protected bike lane?,/r/Bellingham/comments/tn9og4/would_you_support_converting_one_lane_of_all/i248obb/,1,r/Bellingham,0,1

"Hey, since it‚Äôs ALAB‚Ä¶all renters are lazy pot smokers. See how that works?     

People are told to pursue their interests. True, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt change. That‚Äôs the thing about the system you criticize, you have the FREEDOM to change your circumstances if you are willing to do the work. Get a side hustle. Pretty much anybody can do something that brings in a few hundred more per month. Yes it means working on days off. And?  Build up a cushion.   
Look into a trade‚Ä¶there are companies so desperate for plumbers, electricians, hvac techs,  they‚Äôll literally pay to train you and you can easily make 6 figures after a few years.   

Insurance‚Ä¶Apple Care. Next.   

I don‚Äôt own a rental agency. I own a few rental properties. I own a company, plus I have several side hustles. Just booked a  7 day Alaska cruise today, paid for it with one of my side hustles.

Don‚Äôt know about living in a small place struggling? Lol! Son, I lived in a moldy, ramshackle studio in California in my 20s. I was so poor all I could afford to eat was ramen. Ramen twice a day for a month is a recipe to make you sick‚Ä¶been there. My transportation was a bicycle..bus fare was too expensive. I kept the lights turned off, heat turned off‚Ä¶too expensive. Cell phone and Internet‚Ä¶were it available at the time‚Ä¶not a chance. I biked 4 miles to work and back. I rented until I was in my late 20s. Then, I made a change, and I put in the work. Now, 30 years later, I live in one of those multi million dollar homes. It‚Äôs very much possible. 

If you are working on several million dollar homes‚Ä¶maybe on your lunch hour, ask if you could talk to the owners if they are there. Ask them how they made it. Get their advice. You can either bitch about working on a $3m home, or you can get determined to OWN a $3m home. Your choice. I‚Äôm here to tell you that there isn‚Äôt a business owner or property investor I‚Äôve ever run across in my life who wouldn‚Äôt be happy to talk to a young person in person  to help them get ahead. I can tell you that the real estate investment clubs I‚Äôve been in as well as the business clubs welcome everybody, regardless of age or experience or income. But typically, these days, all you get if advice is offered online, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúShut up Boomer‚Äù.

Complaining about the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù won‚Äôt do any good. Like it or not, it‚Äôs still the best system going. Don‚Äôt believe it? Find an older Soviet Era Immigrant and have a chat.  I can guarantee it‚Äôll open your eyes. I‚Äôd say talk to a North Korean, only you don‚Äôt want to risk them being shot in the town square with an anti aircraft gun by Kim.   

Like it or not, this system still does‚Ä¶somewhat‚Ä¶serve the individual. We who are older and politically a bit more rightward leaning have been warning about the degradation of that very thing for a long long time. We Warned as it got rampant in the 8 years of Obama. You said ‚Äúshut up Boomer‚Äù. Somebody got put in place who seriously tried to reverse that course‚Ä¶reverse the conditions that led to less individual freedom. But he said mean things that hurt somebody‚Äôs feewings, you hated him, called him a Cheeto and voted in somebody who is doing everything on turbo mode  to accelerate the very conditions you are bitching about now. Yeah. It why I‚Äôll never vote again and I stopped following politics. We warned there would be serious consequences to the massive property tax increases, rent increase and eviction moratoriums. ‚ÄúALAB!‚Äù Sayeth the youth as they rioted. Now‚Ä¶surprised Pikachu Face when‚Ä¶surprise surprise‚Ä¶there were consequences. If you want to make a change, make a change that allows more people to raise themselves up, instead of lower wring everybody to the same level. It‚Äôs been tried and only a few win.

"OP I was previously a DSHS social services worker and also previously a property manager for rentals. So I have a unique perspective on this issue.

If your lease says that the landlord can change rent during the lease period then that is the case, however that would be very unusual, and while I can't promise, I doubt any judge would enforce it since it could cause the tennant to owe an infinite amount. No competent landlord would ever try to pull that. Check your lease to see what it says about change in rent. 

Unfortunately, you can nearly put whatever you want in a lease and as long as the landlord and tenant both sign it it's legal barring a few exceptions outlined in the Fair Housing Act and Landlord Tenant Act.

Typically the Fair Housing Act prevents a landlord from charging additional fees or in any way treating a tenant differently only because they have a disability. However the FHA does not apply if you live in a building with fewer than 5 units and the landlord lives in one of them.  If your townhouse has it's own address with no apt#, then the FHA will apply.

Legal assistance for renters in Bellingham may be available for free however the organization that provides it might have changed since I was working as a social services worker. Next time you have a meeting with DSHS ask them for any referral they can provide to tenant legal assistance in your area they should be able to provide that.

"What‚Äôs wrong is that at the beginning of the month, the ones that work hard and live frugally, just like generations upon generations before us did‚Ä¶they aren‚Äôt stressed about paying rent or food  and they can eventually afford to buy a house. These same people who say they ‚Äúvalue life‚Äù criticize those that DO make the sacrifices to bring a level of financial stability and peace both in their current life and in their future retirement years. If you seriously think that isn‚Äôt worth a WHOLE hell of a lot, I feel truly sorry for you. You need to spend some time with an older generation from the 40s and 50s who lived frugally. There are plenty of simple life pleasures that don‚Äôt come in a Vente Cup.  

Judging‚Ä¶You‚Äôre judging somebody who is doing what it takes to build a life of financial freedom, free of the stress of living from paycheck to paycheck. If you seriously think a meal out even remotely compares to the satisfaction of working hard and buying your own home, I‚Äôm truly sorry our educational system has failed you this hard. Many in this current young Generation want all the amenities, all the things right away. Things that it took earlier generations decades to build‚Ä¶without the hard work to get them. Delayed gratification isnt a thing anymore for many and that‚Äôs a failure of our society.   
I‚Äôm not saying EVERYBODY in their 20s is like that mind you. Fortunately there ARE still some who do get it. I‚Äôd suggest seeking them out and hanging with them. Try R/frugal or R/sidehustle. 

As for not having anything to show for decades of hard work‚Ä¶how about the ability to buy groceries, gas, and pay the mortgage without stress‚Ä¶or have no mortgage or rent‚Ä¶AT ALL? Or‚Ä¶how about leaving a legacy for your child who you know she will never have to worry about her retirement‚Ä¶though for now, she is living frugally and working hard without any parental assistance because those are valuable life lessons. Trust me, THAT is worth giving up Starbucks for. It‚Äôs pretty much the ultimate satisfaction.   

And no, I didn‚Äôt inherit. I was so poor at one point I literally ate nothing but ramen for an entire month (Do not recommend, great way to make yourself sick), rented a crappy studio, kept the lights and heat turned off because it wasn‚Äôt in the budget, and got around on an old broken bicycle because it was either bus fare or lunch. . Now‚Ä¶after decades of hard work, I just booked a suite on an Alaska Cruise, paid for by one of my side hustles (I was out at 4:30 AM in 5 degree temperatures shoveling and plowing snow last winter‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm in my 50s). 

Nuclear War? I‚Äôm going to guess you are part of a  generation who grew up in absolute peacetime. Nuclear war has ALWAYS been a threat‚Ä¶but it wasn‚Äôt high on the threat-o-meter. Being at ‚Äúthe Height‚Äù‚Ä¶LOL!  I grew up in a time when a nuclear war threat was pretty much an every day thing. For us who grew up doing the ‚ÄúGet under the desk if you see a bright flash‚Äù drill‚Ä¶IN SCHOOL‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just another day. MADD is a thing. It probably will be a thing for decades to come. Nobody, not even Putin, is dumb enough to risk it.   

As for building a business‚Ä¶what does it matter what business you build? If it‚Äôs rental real estate, you are providing housing for people. If it‚Äôs a service business, you are providing services people want and need. If you make things people want to buy, it has value. Criticizing somebody who has worked hard to build something‚Ä¶which, by the way is extraordinarily fulfilling, that provides not only things that people need but helps others earn a living is absolutely worth all the time and sacrifices. Ask any business owner. There is a REASON we do it.

You took your bird to the first vet. You didn't like his diagnosis, so you pull a Karen and go online and argue with anyone who disagrees with you (your comments in the last post paint a pretty clear picture).

Then you take your bird to the second vet. They give a different diagnosis that you do like, so you proceed with their recommended treatment. After a few weeks of the treatment, your bird passed away.

Rent control is illegal in Washington State (RCW 35.21. 830). Landlords can raise the rent as much as they want as long as they comply with the appropriate notice period and have not issued the notice to discriminate or retaliate against the tenant.

"This might be the answer. Your mom moving in means 2 people, not one.

I don‚Äôt know if they can mid-lease, but it won‚Äôt do you any good to fight it, unless you plan to not renew next year. Is this a short term or long term solution? 

Added to that, they may have it in their contract that parties other than the primary party have to go through the application process and sign a lease themselves. And I wonder if that‚Äôs how they could increase the rent? 

Anyway, tenants do have rights, but your parents AREN‚ÄôT tenants. That‚Äôs the problem. Depending on how far the landlord wants to go, and the terms of your lease, they could evict all of you.

"Well, if the renter on the lease will no longer be inhabiting the place as it sounds like is the case, and someone new is coming on to the lease, using the lease as your defense is probably not advantageous for a couple reasons, but mainly because income requirements may have to be recalculated without OPs income factored in as he will no longer live there. The rest of the family may not meet the requirement.

"Do you have it in writing that he might increase rent because of an increase in income? I don't know if that's illegal but it doesn't sound good, especially in response to an increase in disability income and after a hardship. If he brings it up again, you can always tell him you found out more info that the income is making up for increased expenses and medical/caregiving costs and that there won't be extra money for raised rent. Feel free to lie to him. 



Do you have access to the lease? You are going to want to clamp down, stop talking to him about your family's private business. If he asks again, tell him the disability didn't go through or that it will take years to get it (true depending on the type). Again, feel free to lie. Don't give him more information; he's clearly ready to use it against you. 



Communicate in writing from now on, reiterate what he said in person in an email or letter that you send to him and keep copies saved (e.g., ""hi x, i just wanted to clarify our conversation the other day about my dad's finances and any impact on our rent). Keep dated records of your communications. I am not sure of the fine details of this, but I've heard of rent escrow accounts where you can stash the rent owed without paying it right away. If you have to get legal about it, it's a way to keep the rent safe in case you lose a case, without giving it to him and having to try to collect if he loses. Consult with Law Advocates in town, they have a tenant support specialty.

The fact is people are told to pursue their interests and so they do, some of those jobs don't pay well, I'm being payed $2 more than a McDonald's worker and I have no insurance, working with chemicals, and my life is at risk on the daily, except I cannot afford to quit and look for something that pays better, and at what sacrifice? I made $800 this last paycheck and my rent is $600 and I'm living with 3 other roommates which always has it's issues, I am unable to do anything I want to the property including small things without putting paperwork in. I am talking about the Landmarks and the Windermere's, not private homeowners and sucs, there's a vast difference. And yes it is how the system works, and when this trainwreck of a system comes to it's catastrophic end, I will be on the side promoting changes to it, not a continuation of this vampiric system. It sucks you've worked hard and are not big enough of a rental agency to have the necessary income you need to take vacations, and it sucks you felt you needed to give up 5-7 years of your life to buy such a poor investment.

"Such Hate! Landlords are people too. To think your perception of who a landlord is is so twisted that you believe we all either inherited the property or are ""tech bros"" shows how disconnected you are. I didn't inherit my rentals. I'm not a ""tech bro"". I own a small company, have several side hustles and have worked my absolute ass off, taking vacations once every 5-7 years for several decades and even now, rarely ever taking a weekend off. I keep my expenses low, don't buy $5 coffee, and live frugally. Rental property is how I chose to invest my money for retirement and the vast majority of landlords are similar. If you hang out with them, you'll find a group of very VERY hard working people.

Did we buy when things were cheaper? Yup, but anybody who has lived long enough will know that anybody living on close to minimum wage has never been able to buy property. Ever. People who advance, get better positions, start businesses always have and always will be the ones who can afford income property.

I treat my tenants well, fix anything that needs to be fixed and don't gouge. And just because you haven't seen anybody take full advantage of the moratorium to screw their landlord over, that doesn't mean that thousands haven't done EXACTLY that. Just go to r/Landlord and read for a while. Your eyes might be opened by some of what you see. Tenants take advantage ALL the time. Yes its a small percentage, but likewise, bad landlords are ALSO a small percentage. We have families, friends, colleagues and deal with people just like you do. Just because Income property happens to be the choice we made as an investment doesn't make us automatically evil.

As for housing being a ""Right""...show me that in the Constitution. Like it or not, this is the system we live in. You are free to stage a rent strike...but the results will be absolutely predictable, especially now that the moratorium has ended.

Have I seen the cost of everything? Yes. Have you seen the cost of property Taxes? Insurance? Maintenance? Lawn Care? Paint, siding...ROOFING? You think we don't have expenses? My property taxes are 5 figures a year. Cost of property taxes has skyrocketed along with everything needed to maintain a property. IF you think we are making pure profit off every dollar you pay in rent, you are in for a rude awakening if you ever decided to actually do the numbers. 5-10% is considered good.

As for your friend...my rentals are pet friendly, but all taken. People can vote with their feet as well. There are places where COL is significantly cheaper...Bellingham is a seaside, college community. It is a highly desirable area. Its gonna be an expensive place to live. Its like complaining you can't find a $500 place in Seattle. Sorry,but thems the facts.

People can either complain, move or do the things necessary to raise their income so rent becomes not so burdensome. If all you do after work and on the weekends is hang out on reddit, smoke pot, play video games and drink with your friends all weekend...then go back to an entry level 9-5...well, sorry but that's just not how rent becomes affordable.

"I give 0 shits about landlords. sucks for small guys who rely on it, but they're so damn disconnected from reality they forget that Housing is for people, not profit. Why do we have people on the streets at all and vacant houses ""for rent""? Not everyone was able to make use of the eviction moratorium or the rent freeze (I know no one who was able to make use of either) and what does that even mean? it's usually people who literally can't afford rent and don't want to end up on the streets during a worldwode pandemic. Most people including myself had to resort to paying rent with their credit cards or by some other means, and don't have ""extra"" income coming from a place they bought that they are not living in. 
The fact that landlords have a ""community"" that isn't made of the tenants, says a whole lot. Tenants need community as well, and guess what they wil be talking about?
I'll promote a mass rent strike any day of the week. Your perception of them going on vacations, etc is false and that's what landlords have done with the rent money they get historically, How is someone making $20/hour which seems the average wage supposed to ever buy property? Do you see any good jobs around? My friend is a school teacher making about that much, does she not deserve a home? Have you seen the cost of literally everything? or are you not aware because you have extra income coming in from a rental property probably bought out of inheritance or living through a time where it wasnt late stage capitalism which has been squeezing down on the working class? Or maybe you're a tech bro making more than your job is worth. Covid was expensive AF for everyone suffering through it and if you think renters were out vacationing the whole time, you watch too much fox news, this isn't florida. The difference is Landlords have a house that other people NEED to live in, Housing is a NEED not a commodity, like healthcare, water, food, etc. Stop acting like landlords are suffering when their ""extra property"" isn't collecting money from the poor. They shouldn't be trying to buy up houses and charge people to live in them in the first place. ""it's how things have always been"" is a terrible argument. Who's making sure that people are housed and able to afford their housing? I know someone working for my company who's living in a hotel right now while he's trying to find a place that accepts him and his dog, it's impossible, yet he's a good person and a great worker, why is he struggling at all to live somewhere?

"Maybe, I just think that the one way streets with all green lights (or racing yellows) encourages a sense that one can go faster.  People might be merging, but nobody is crossing the lane in the opposite direction.  Related but not necessarily core to the argument, I think given that downtown is a business district and destination, you'll find people scanning for parking on both sides of the road and encouraged to change lanes to reach that parking, across 3 lanes.

I feel like any design choices the city can make that make drivers feel like they need to be alert increases safety.  Our downtown streets are designed the way they are because the freeway didn't exist and they were operating as a through-town highway, so they're built to accommodate faster throughput of traffic.  Roads like this encourage cars by design to move through a place rather than to a place, so it also has impacts for business, especially considering people here prefer to park within a block of their destination.

Right now there's no safe place for bicycles on Holly Street, though it's the only street moving through downtown in that direction.

"Student unions seem like a super interesting idea, especially in the US, and I‚Äôm excited to see how this shakes out.

However- they are demanding mask mandates be reinstated? Is this really the most pressing issue students are facing? The question I have at this point is- to what end? Do your just want everyone to wear masks in school forever, indefinitely? COVID is not going away (unfortunately), vaccines provide a reasonable amount of safety, and while I can sympathize with those who are immunocompromised or have family members who are, we need to be able to adapt and move forward at some point. 

I have to wonder if this has more to do with social anxieties and conditioning than anything having to do with safety or science. These are young people, who have all been through a pretty traumatic experience over the past 2 years (as we all have) but given their age, life experience, and what they have been through I wonder if psychologically they have some attachment to masks now- like a safety blanket. I know that sounds like I‚Äôm just an old person complaining about the youths, but I‚Äôm 24 and only a few years out of college.

"I also had a really bad experience with Dr. Berry. I brought in two rats who were suffering from upper respiratory infections (very common in rats). After the first round of prescribed antibiotics weren't particularly effective he prescribed my rats Clavamox. A very common side effect of Clavamox is the developmetn of dysbiosis, where the bacteria in the gut start to die. I was not warned of this nor was I told the symptoms. Soon after I started giving it to my rats, one of them started having runny stool, was lethargic, and had a reduced appetite. That next Monday morning I called the office to ask for help. At first they tired to tell me that it was probably fine, but after I pressed and told them an exhaustive list of what had happened and the symptoms, they said she had probably developed dysbiosis and I should stop giving her the clavamox immediately and she should start to recover. I stopped giving her the medication, I was force feeding her Critical Care and baby food, but she was getting worse. I tried to call his office back multiple times and get an emergency appointment, but either nobody would pick up or when they did they said they'd ask him as soon as he was available and call me back but they never did. She died that Sunday. It devastated me. 

I dont blame Dr. Berry. I understand that bad reactions are always a possibility and with something this severe there's little that can be done. But I think him and his office handled this inappropriately and I no longer trust his medical judgement with my rats.

"Bro you have no idea the frustration that I have myself and thanks for the post I've been looking for almost 3 weeks for a good rental opportunity and I haven't even got close to closing anything, and it's not even that they jacked the prices across the board, the landlords and owners are have become extremely picky and in all reality they are really are not supposed to be discriminatory, so since I am not a female, under 30, straight or not 420 friendly (I'm 420 friendly) I get denied on that and don't even get a look at the rental

*So I guess the restrictions of the things I just listed, that not discriminatory?*

I spoke to a local property managerband all the roadblocks all of what's going on in the area she was able to tell me. Since there is a low supply of rentals and a high demand of renters that brings in more scammers into the area to muddy the waters even further.

Lastly, I'm currently renting a condo in Bellingham and it has been the most ideal situation, I would have lived here forever. But, since the housing market has shot up in the last few months, the owner of the condo he's going to sell it and take his profit, which I understand

"I got this one from amazon

Andis AGC Super 2-Speed... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018KVI5M?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

I like that it has two speeds, although I almost always keep it on low. It has a long flexible cord but sometimes I wish I'd opted for the cordless version because its difficult enough to hold my cat still and in the position I need while also wrangling a cord. she doesnt mind being shaved too much but doesnt really sit still while I do it, and cats have a lot of stretchy elastic skin so you have to be careful so as not to catch it with the trimmer.

It's not super loud, which is nice, but it is a tad on the large side for such a small cat (she's always been the runt of the litter and is only 9 pounds, definitely on the lean side. )

I took a few months to get her used to it before she was ok with it. Turned it on while she was in the room and pet her and fed treats. Pet her with the trimmer while it was off and fed her treats. Turned it on and pet her with the side of it and fed her treats so she could feel it vibrating. Finally worked up to shaving her in small pieces and now that I'm more practiced I can get her done in just a couple sessions.

She's pretty good about letting me know when she's had enough though and I respect her comfort level, but early on she was more prone to hiss at me as I wasn't as aware of her signals. She's never been super aggressive but I did realize that the second it gets hot she's DONE. mine gets hot after about ten or fifteen minutes so when I was slower it was harder to do temp control. Maybe I'm not doing enough maintenance on it or whatever as I'be never had an electroc razor before this but I've learned she's far more likely to stick around if I regularly check the temperature of the blade to ensure it's comfortable

Our pattern now is to shave a little, let her squirm away and then come back for pets and shave her some more, and repeat. Gives the razor time to cool and for her to feel safe. When she stops coming back for pets I know we're done.",t2_2erjwimx,IvoryNage,0,1648184698.0,0,t1_i212uc4,i212uc4,False,definedevine,t3_tkegkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/tkegkb/cat_grooming_in_bellingham_your_experiences/,Cat grooming in Bellingham -- your experiences?

"Downtown is where those services should be. Thanks to all of the other permanent features there (WWU, the port, the shelter, the courts and police, the bars, etc.), downtown is always going to have the negative elements that attract the homeless and/or mentally ill. 

The mall is right on the freeway, down the street from most major retailers and the airport, a rather convenient drive to Canada/Ferndale/Lynden/Deming/Downtown, and is situated pretty close to a variety of restaurants, shops, and medical services. It is the ideal place for a walkable planned community filled with affordable housing, but also for higher-end high-rise apartments and services.
