"If you are looking to be close to night life, I would suggest finding somewhere west of DNT in Addison area. Look up apartments near Vitruvian park, tons of brand new apartment/retail area full 20-30 yr olds and you can easily commute to Carrollton while avoiding highways by going up Marsh ln.

Carrollton is a great place to live when you have a family, but there’s really not any night life north of George Bush other than your occasional hole in the wall neighborhood bar here and there. Everything else is pretty much closed by 10pm.

Korea Town is pretty cool but it’s pretty much all confined to one shopping center. 

Commuting via Dart rail into downtown is possible but dangerous by yourself at night and also takes a long time. I think to ride dart rail from downtown Carrollton to downtown dallas is like 45 mins-1hr vs driving or Uber and be there in 25 mins.

Also, just to second others, I do not suggest living in uptown and commuting to Carrollton unless you don’t mind long commutes everyday.",t2_899dx,jabes101,0,1646099116.0,0,t1_hyuvavw,hyuvavw,False,Fancy_Crows31,t3_t39502,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarrolltonTX/comments/t39502/asian_american_23f_young_professional_moving_here/,Asian American 23F young professional moving here!,/r/CarrolltonTX/comments/t39502/asian_american_23f_young_professional_moving_here/hyuvavw/,3,r/CarrolltonTX,0,3

"Somewhat, it's a mix of everyone now, 20s, 30s, some 40s, etc. Dallas neighborhoods have their ebbs and flows every 6 to 10 years. Deep Ellum was absolutely dead from 2006-2012 where it started making a come back. Uptown and DE sub-cultures were kind of separated. Now, Uptown is dying, has some security issues lately, and lots of uptown people are shifting to DE for late night fun as evidenced by the change of DE culture, which used to have more punk rock shows and tattoo parlors and now has more high-end cocktail bars. I still end up in Uptown and Greenville occasionally, but DE and South Greenville seem to be where it's at now. Knox-Henderson was kind of nice but requires a car and there's no parking there. 

and keep in mind K town bars can be fun till wheneverAM too. Dan Sung Sa (DSS what we call it) is fun, cheap, and can probably meet people there too.

"Uptown and Addison are going to be much more expensive. Addison isn't very walkable so I don't know what advantage you would get unless your work is right there. Carrollton is better for work in the Plano/Frisco area. Could argue it's better for work in Irving Las Colinas too since you can miss most of 635 traffic which is akin to Mad Max movies.

Advantage of uptown is its walkable grocery stores and bars, but they're likely overpriced anyway. Would have to drive 20 min to Royal/35 and Bush/35 if you go there a lot.

KTown nightlife is pretty good. Spent numerous nights at DanSung Sa, Ddonggo, and KTV. If you have a crowd here then you might as well live here.

"My favorite places:

Manna BBQ/Shabu - both all you can eat and buffet style for the non-meat options. Super delicious (actually ate at Shabu for dinner tonight lol.)

Ssam - real good for p much everything but if you get like 1-3 friends together and get the hot pot, deffo ask them for juk at the end - it’s a rice porridge they make for you with all the goodness you were making in the hot pot and the BEST. Especially on cold nights. They also have a really good steamed egg dish.

Korean Street Eats - so many good snack foods I could eat there forever

KTown - the BEST kimbap. It’s the family that owns Ajumma on the other side of the building but they stopped selling their kimbap and opened KTown for JUST kimbap and honestly no one else’s comes close to their classic one. 

Kimchi - I love their garlic pork belly 

Musiro - the BEST sundubu you’ll ever get. 

Rice Chicken - are they still called this? I feel like they changed… anyway, super good and crispy chicken. 

Gen - good BBQ but can be expensive. They have really good banchan.

I will say don’t go to Omi. I went with a group of friends and they more or less refused to serve us or let us order BBQ or anything besides like bulgogi. I’m sure they’ve gotten bitten by The Whites before but they reaaaaaally didn’t want us there.

"Really depends on what you want to eat.........

On the H-Mart side of the freeway:

If you plan to eat in,  I'd second DDong GGo. It's a Korean pub style restaurant with some fun dishes. Their Kimchi Fried Rice volcano is great.

BB.Q Chicken (Korean fried chicken chain) is also on this side of the street.

For dessert, Cocohodo has Bungeoppang (Korean version of Taiyaki) filled with ice cream. Granted there is also SomiSomi which is another good option with the same style of treat on the other side of the highway.

Don't forget Tiger Sugar either......it's a Taiwanese chain that has a cult like following for their Brown Sugar Bubble Tea.

&#x200B;

On the Ranch 99 side:

Frankseoul has Korean Style Hot Dogs (cheese filled, sugar dipped, etc etc.......cheap and worth a try if you haven't had them before).

Kura is a revolving sushi bar, which is definitely fun but the cost can add up fast.

Too Thai Street Eats is a tasty option in terms of Thai food in that area with a nice atmosphere inside.

"It is allowed but you must wait your turn. 
I do not think there is a left arrow turn signal at that intersection for the cars leaving the parking lots (both east and west)

With no left arrow, you are in the wrong. Cross traffic has the right-of-way and those needing to turn left must yield until it is clear. Any circle (non-arrow) green light is a left turn yield (you must yield to oncoming traffic).

Those lights were only recently put up in the past couple years and are awful when it is busy.

"Its not so weird haha. They only do it one day a week for a couple hours until the food runs out. It will definitely be the most authentic food and most of the time also cheaper. Most of these places are just for pickup so you wouldn't sit in someone diner table or anything.

As for food trucks I haven't really tried any that I like but also I've only tried like three of them so I don't have much experience with them. The food truck scene is growing but I haven't heard of one that has really good food. 

This friday I know of  a taco pop up if you want to try it out. I also know of a barbacoa pop up on sunday. Let me know if you want the info.

If you feel more comfortable with restaurants I definitely recommend the places I talked about in my previous comment. I wouldn't go to places like El Fenix or On the Border or anything like that. Go to small restaurants for the best experience.

"My two favorite spots are La Tapatía in Carrollton and Tacos Sabrositos in Lewisville. 

Tacos Paisa were a staple in Dallas for years but they have gone downhill. I only like them super late at night after the club or a party lol

Edit: I almost forgot about Fajita Pete's. I highly recommend the burritos from there. Also Chuy's is my favorite tex Mex place. I only get the Chika Chika Boom Boom quesadillas. 

These are the most authentic and good tasting places (that aren't pop ups) that I've tried in the area. Also a good tip is that if half of the dishes are covered in cheese they are not authentic. If you want some more street places that pop up at gas stations or pop ups in people's houses just let me know.

"I've lived in Carrollton eleven years, and here's what I've noticed or read about in the last few years.

&#x200B;

* North of Old Denton and Trinity Mills (near H-Mart), there was a new David Weekly subdivision built about six (?) years ago.  A couple hundred homes, primarily single family, but some townhomes as well.
* Just next to that development, they're adding a condo complex (""[The View](https://www.theviewcarrollton.com/)""), currently under construction.
* The previously noted project off Denton Drive, along with continued expansion of the downtown area (slow and steady).
* [Trinity Mills Station](https://www.cityofcarrollton.com/business/carrollton-development/tod) is starting soon-ish in theory.  I don't know if they've begun construction yet, but I'd expect at least three years out from anything meaningful there.

I think downtown Carrollton is good for date night, at least with reasonable expectations.  Good events, good restaurants, good coffee.  I love Carrollton's proximity to Addison for that as well (my wife and I go there often).  We also have easy access to all the entertainment at The Shops at Legacy area.

Speaking as a family with three kids, we've really grown to love Carrollton.  The DART connections to the city are great.  You're close enough to Plano and a lot of the jobs there.  Most of the properties have good sized yards, and the housing has (until recently) been very affordable.  Schools here are good, city amenities (park district, trails, community pool) are all good.  Diverse population, but still mostly middle class (not a lot of super high end neighborhoods, though a few are scattered around).

&#x200B;

EDIT: Forgot to mention the entertainment around the H-Mart area.  A ton of restaurants, karaoke bars, gaming centers, cafes.

"I grew up by rosemeade rec center and that area of the creek/waterway and never really noticed a smell. But its always a possibility by water that dose not really move much unless there is a flood. as for bugs you would have to worry more about mosquitos again in more stagnant waters. Any more north or west you then have to start worrying about the smell from the Lewisville dump during the summer months.

As for housing, i think it depends what you are comfortable with. Also bear in mind the dividing line between Denton and Dallas county runs through that area and there are two different tax rates for homes in the area. General rule of thumb is the toll way for that line but not exactly. Its kinda weird their two because the closer to old Denton the houses are new and the closer to Josey the houses are old. Generally that will set up the kind of people who live there as generally new housing attracts better off people and older generally less well off.

I would even look all the way up to Hebron though you start to get into the even more expensive and newer homes but theirs some older ones scattered about in that area and your only another block or so away, for most people its not that much further to the area you want to hang out in.",t2_1nonl85g,PandaSTi,0,1626189560.0,0,t1_h51mwy4,h51mwy4,True,[deleted],t3_ojfuy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarrolltonTX/comments/ojfuy6/do_the_waterwayscreeks_always_smell/,Do the waterways/creeks always smell?,/r/CarrolltonTX/comments/ojfuy6/do_the_waterwayscreeks_always_smell/h51mwy4/,2,r/CarrolltonTX,0,2

For basketball, I go to LA fitness and you can almost always find a game there, but like somebody mentioned they do get a little rough sometimes. I recommend the LA off of midway and hebron/Park for pickup games for sure. 

Im always down to get some shots up or go for a run or somethin, i just work an odd schedule.

"$14 is more than generous for a zero skill job. Quality of life is directly correlated to your earnings, which are based on your knowledge and skills. The less qualified you are, the less luxury you can demand. Instead of renting a 3-bedroom apartment in the neighborhood with best schools you may want to consider renting someone's basement/room in a house in an average neighborhood. Instead of shopping at Central Market you should probably go to Kroger. And around here living without suffering is plenty doable on $14 an hour.

"I'm in downtown as well, work in Coppell.

In my experience and from what I've been told by my mechanic, state inspection is pretty much the same wherever.  I typically get it done at the Valvoline on Denton Tap in Coppell on the way home from work.

You're probably looking to just have the oil change and inspection done all at once, but if you're looking for a mechanic, I highly recommend Coppell Tire and Auto for maintenance.  They're straight-shooters and I've never had any issues with them.  They've even had someone drive me the rest of the way to work after dropping my car off there in the morning.

I've also heard good things about Old Town Automotive Services right here in downtown, but I haven't used them myself so I can't speak from experience.",t2_5vnk9,ZapActions-dower,0,1618501149.0,0,t1_gum60yy,gum60yy,True,mrezee,t3_mkp3s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarrolltonTX/comments/mkp3s5/anybody_know_a_good_auto_shop_to_get_an_oil/,Anybody know a good auto shop to get an oil change and state inspection?,/r/CarrolltonTX/comments/mkp3s5/anybody_know_a_good_auto_shop_to_get_an_oil/gum60yy/,1,r/CarrolltonTX,0,1

"I would also recommend the food industry, if you have experience or at least an interest. Despite what many will think, many nice restaurants are hiring, often will full time hours. The whole Legacy area in Plano, and along Dallas Parkway all through Plano and parts of Frisco, is a close drive to large parts of Carrollton and hiring-hosts can easily negotiate at least twelve an hour or serving, instead, which should average about twenty dollars an hour, at the least.

&#x200B;

Really, most upscale casual restaurants or above should net you at least twenty an hour, serving, but, for hosting or just counter service, it can be harder to find similar in Carrollton itself. This week is an exception-the snow has made a lot of restaurants stay closed-but business is good at most establishments, otherwise.

"Deli News. Something my family would get every year for Christmas lunch was a large selection of sliced deli meats and bagels. Something I always looked forward to. I'd also like to shout out to The Great Outdoors though not technically a deli. Oh yeah there's one of them in ftw so you might know 'em already. If you already know and don't like The Great Outdoors don't let that sour the Deli News recommendation. Central Market's always poppin' too, but that's not hidden and also not Carrollton. But it's also bfast all day so big plus and the deli inside has a lot to chose from. CM is a hop and a skip if you can take Bush, otherwise, take your time and cruise down Frankford. Not many places that compare to Cyndi's. Cyndi's is like a cafe, diner, and deli all rolled into one. I won't even get into diners, cafes, or bagel places. Tried to limit this post to places that sell deli meat. Included Great Outdoors because they slice meat fresh for every sandwich. Market Street in Coppell is pretty nice too.

"Not a lawyer, but I didn't read any admittance of guilt here. Getting drunk at a friends house is not a crime unless he's underage. Obviously he was drunk in public, but I guess he wants to try to dispute that in court. Judge might show leniency since he avoided driving. My concern is the poor decision making that lead him to being more that a few miles from where he originally was, but there's also the question of how close did he get to his residence before he got caught also might be taken into consideration by a judge. I understand him wanting to try to fight this and a good lawyer could honestly improve his chances.

I get takeout from Pie 314–my go to is the short ribs pappardelle and carnevino pizza.  The Great Greek is also on rotation—it’s a fast casual dining kind of place that translates well for togos.  

I’ve never eaten at the actual location of Tineo Peruvian Cafe, but I’ve gotten takeout from them 4+ times.  The empanadas are AMAZING!!!

I just looked up Arepa TX on Yelp—Bomb arepas, but sadly they’re closed...so sad!!!!

"Okay, I'll type as someone who is planning of a possible move TO California. Carrollton has a few small things going for it. Korea-Towan and the other Asian areas are fantastic and provide some uniqueness to an otherwise plain-Jane suburb. There are also hills which is nice compared to the otherwise flat areas of DFW. It is also very convenient to Frisco, northeest Plano, The Colony and even Dallas depending on the part of Carrollton you are in. It is more moderately priced than some other suburbs and the schools are okay, better in far birth carrollton where you are in the Lewisville ISD, not CFBISD. 
Carrollton has some progressive politics, so isn't just straight hardcore conservative. Ironically, the area of California I am looking at is, unfortunately for me, MORE conservative than here. So, Carrollton will not be a conservative safe space. Cost: it is the same unless comparing west LA or the Bay Area. What you make up for in no income tax is destroyed and then some by property tax in TX. Gas is less expensive here, but I drive electric so that's irrelevant to me. There are tons of jobs here in far north Plano, but everything I had been offered, including the job I accepted are all remote and staying that way if I so choose.
Long story short, if you like mostly average suburbs with jobs available locally and nothing of particular environmental interest, Carrollton is a fine place to live. I need mountains, deserts, forests and oceans in quick reach. I need character and uniqueness. Basically, Carrollton is a nice, safe, average place to settle down. A little moreso if you are part of an Asian community or want quick access to Asian food and supplies. I don't have anything particularly bad to say about Carrollton. For DFW I think it is better than average for a suburb, but it's a suburb and I'm not sure I am compatible with that monotony.
That may not sound like a rousing endorsement, but unless you are looking for something very specific, I'm not sure what suburbs or part of DFW to truly recommend.
