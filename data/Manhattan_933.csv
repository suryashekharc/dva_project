"It's been a minute but when I was a teenager we would walk Broadway. You can hit up Gray's Papaya or Big Nick's (I think Big Nick's might be gone though).

We'd also walk through/around Central Park all the time. If you take the N 86th entrance into the park and cross the road (that loop inside the park) the reservoir will be on your left (aka North) and if you go slightly south and east there is this pine tree grove with a big set of swings. We used those all the time. If you go farther east you'll hit the great lawn (south of that is the belvedere castle and the Shakespeare garden) and just east of the great lawn are a bunch of basketball courts (North of this spot is the central park police station). Usually this is a great place to wander and people watch. You can also easily walk to The Met from there if that sparks interest. (Forgive me if I got some of the location names wrong it's been a minute)

Also I always loved the Natural History Museum and I think they might have a planetarium projector but I remember it being closed a lot. 

You could also hit up Cafe Lalo for desserts (I fucking hope it's still there haha)

If you are ever out that way on Sunday you should go to the flea market at the school near the Natural History museum. It's awesome. 

Thanks for the stroll down memory lane.

"You can do Houston to 59th in one day.   The west side is more interesting for that part of the island (W Village, Christoper St, et al). 

You don't need a whole day in Midtown.  You'll take a couple pics in Times Square and be ready to leave.  The best parts of Midtown are Grand Central and the Bryant Park Library and you can do that in a morning or afternoon.

Lower manhattan from the tip to Houston is probably a day, maybe 2 if you want explore Alphabet City, the LES, Chinatown, Nolita et al more closely.

i'd divide 59th and up into one day, and then Harlem and up into a second day.   You can spend one day at central park and the museums, antother day for Harlem and Washington heights.

Be advised that a lot of the main Manhattan destinations like Union Square are no longer really that interesting and you can probably just tick off the boxes.

"So we got into Harlem around 12:00 PM on Saturday and we first went to the Hungarian Pastry Shop. After that, we crossed the street and attended the vertical tour at Saint John Devine which was an amazing tour complemented with a very intelligent tour guide. We walked back to our Airbnb after the tour and checked in/ got ready for about an hour then made our way over to ""Nobody Told Me"". We made the assumption that it was aptly named that because it seemed like everyone but ourselves were there for their very first dates; nobody told me this was the first date bar.

You're not going to believe it but we then walked all the way to ROKC from Nobody Told Me and it was great! I think we'll be talking about that ramen for as long as we live. Of course, we then walked next door to Cocteleria Perla Negra for a drink and then walked all the way to Harlem Hops for our last stop. The bartender/mixologist who was serving us at Perla Negra was a true professional and it was entrancing to watch her craft our orders.

On Sunday morning we got brunch at Maison Harlem and then took the A subway from 125th and Manhattan all the way to 34th Street because my girlfriend wanted to see, ""The  Vessel"". After seeing the overly sized beehive, we walked to the Eugene O'Neil theater and watched, ""The Book of Mormon"" which we both thought was amazing. Lastly, we took the D subway all the way back up to 125th and Manhattan, grabbed a quick dinner at the Thai Market on Amsterdam Avenue, and proceeded to head back home.

Frankly the Times Square area is full of tourist restaurants that aren’t really much good nor inexpensive, yet I do recommend Junior’s. It’s a great value, service and many times I share a plate and we don’t even finish it all.

Tacos La No. 1 is something to experience. A few locations in many practical areas. While not inexpensive if you skip sodas and sparkling water, Eataly has good menu items.

As far as friends, many of our friends grew from gym acquaintances.  I am very introverted, too, so it took about a year before I had a real circle of friends.  However, this was from CrossFit style gyms, which made social contact easier.  Also, we made friends by going to the same places over the years.  For example, I’ll always go to the Irish Pub on Friday to pick up dinner.  We became friends with the bartender, who then merged into our group, yada yada.

While we’re on the topic, make friends with a gay guy.  My gay friends are *always* doing something.  House parties, brunches, running/walking in the park, wine on the rooftops, game nights, etc.  There is not a single night they aren’t going somewhere or planning something.  At least in Manhattan, just picture a huge social group of well paid, middle aged guys with no kids (but lots of dogs lol).  I love those friends, and they’re all open minded, kind, and welcoming to new people.

As far as “don’t bother me” people, you just have to ease into it.  People need a minute to know that you’re not a psycho.  That’s why routines will give people a chance to let their guard down after seeing you a few times.

Start with “let’s sun tan on the roof” or “want to watch movie X and open this new wine I heard about?”  The rest will come naturally.

I hope/think you’ll love Manhattan as much as we do.  Let us know how it goes, and good luck!",t2_3zdew,mike2lane,0,1647344565.0,0,t1_i0qknbz,i0qknbz,True,lifebykimchi,t3_tek6gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/manhattan/comments/tek6gm/moving_to_nyc_in_mayjune/,Moving to NYC in May/June,/r/manhattan/comments/tek6gm/moving_to_nyc_in_mayjune/i0qknbz/,5,r/manhattan,0,5

"St John the Divine is nice and worth the trip.  Grant's Tomb is kind of fun to talk about, not much there tho.  There's a really cool building on CPW and 105/106, it's an old hospital that's neat looking.  If you can get up to Fort Tryon and the Cloisters its pretty cool with a nice museum and great views.

I would skip Morningside Park, not much in there and recently known more for crime than anything nice.

Nobody Told Me is a great little bar with excellent fried chicken sandwich and cheeseburger.  Thai Market is fun.  Dive 106 is a great hang out.  Dinosaur BBQ is fun.  If you get there early enough Harlem Biscuit company is terrific, though walking around after is questionable.  Bar 314 has good pizza.  People  love Mama's Too pizza but we are unimpressed.  We used to love Vinateria but our last couple trips it had slid back a little.  Melba's is okay, but can hit or miss- same with Amy Ruths and Spoonbread.  Red Rooster is pretty consistent.  Levain cookies are pretty monstrous.

Outside of St John the Divine I don't think there are many must-do's in the area, and I've lived there for 15 years.  I would recommend other areas unless you've been everywhere else.

"Nice try Russian troll. Those are the symbols of the *tiny* neo-nazi movements in Ukraine. They exist in all European countries, even Russia. But they hold no sway in Ukrainian politics, as the “closest to mainstream” one failed to win a single election. 

But of course Russian propaganda will attempt to claim they’re running the country, in an effort to have an excuse to invade. 

The fact that Ukraine’s elected leader is Jewish completely deflates that argument though.

"It's so annoying how thrift shops have essentially done a complete 180 on electronics pricing. When I was a kid I remember they often had basically zero idea what stuff was worth, and would just price everything $10ish.

&#x200B;

  
**Four people** have been arrested in connection with the **overdose death** of actor Michael K. Williams, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a press release Wednesday. Williams died last year at the age of 54.  


  
**Irvin Cartagena, 39; Hector Robles, 57; Luiz Cruz, 56; and Carlos Macci, 70**, were ""each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl analogue, fentanyl, and heroin,"" which carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.  


  
**Cartagena was also charged with causing Williams' death** in connection with the alleged conspiracy, which carries a **maximum sentence of life in prison**, the U.S. attorney's office said.  


  
**Cartagena was arrested in Puerto Rico** on Tuesday, and will appear in federal court there on Thursday. **The three other defendants were arrested in Manhattan on the same day,** and are scheduled to appear in the city's federal court on Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office said.  


  
Authorities identified **a drug trafficking organization** that had been operating in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn since August 2020.  


  
The U.S. attorney's office alleges **that the organization sells ""heroin laced with fentanyl** and a fentanyl analogue"" on the street and in an apartment building.  


  
That organization allegedly **sold Williams drugs the day before he overdosed, with Cartagena allegedly executing the transaction.**  


  
The interaction was **caught on surveillance video,** according to the U.S. attorney's office.  


  
Williams, an Emmy-nominated actor **best known for his role in ""The Wire,""** was found dead at his Brooklyn home on September 6.  


  
**He was wearing the same clothes seen in the surveillance video from the day before, charging documents said.**  


  
The Medical Examiner found he accidentally died of **""acute intoxication** by the combined effects of fentanyl, p-fluorofentanyl, heroin and cocaine,"" and the U.S. Attorney's Office alleges he used the fentanyl-laced heroin purchased from the Brooklyn-based drug organization.  


  
According to the U.S. attorney's office, **the four defendants continued to sell the drugs in Brooklyn and Manhattan after Williams' death.**  


  
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called drug overdoses a ""public health crisis"" and vowed to bring those involved to justice.  


  
""Deadly opioids like fentanyl and heroin don't care about who you are or what you've accomplished,"" he said. ""They just feed addiction and lead to tragedy.""

"Grew up in campos the area is safe during the day and after dark its give or take all I can say is the building on 12th between b and c is a shit hole but the area is a lot better then it was years ago 
They closed off some spots because alot of muggings would happen in the back and made it easier to get away also the gangs in the area would also sit in the back  but if they would start anything it would be due to beef with people from avenue D and this was years ago 2 buildings are owned by c.c. and the rest nycha they did install cameras and there are security guards there at times . 
There have been shootings in the back and on avenue b  but  that can happen anywhere i would be more worried about 1st Avenue and avenue A and 14st that stretch has gone to shit since the pandemic with the homeless and junkies 
The target on avenue A is there trader Joe's .which gives the area more foot traffic 

Just use common sense and keep your head up and be aware of your surroundings 
And if you go jogging just be smart about it 
And in the summer it gets wild

I can't imagine Manhattanites having any opinion, unless they have a specific personal connection to one of those places.

No switching to another public transit system, catching a car service, etc., just drop me off within a short walking distance of where I'm going.  If I know that at the other end of my journey I can rely on the subway's 24/7 service, single fare, and no confusing cross-system transfer I'd be MUCH more likely to visit.

"Where in Manhattan are you? I’m on the uws and I’ve learned what grocery stores to go to for what I need. Westside Market always has great produce for a great price. Key Food has store brand and off-brand items which can save money on things like cereal. Fairway Market has sales so I frequent there for things. I’ll go to Target to save a buck or two on certain items like stock/broth, Nutella, cheese, and ice cream. Trader Joe’s is good for sour cream, butter, and milk. What I’ll do a lot if I’m uncertain about if I’m getting something for a good deal is to check Instacart and see what other stores are selling it for.

"Trader Joe's is definitely a good bet, but their business model is based around not selling low-volume items, so good luck finding that one random spice you need or something like that. Aldis are hard to find in Manhattan, but if you can get to one easily, they have amazing prices, and do a great job having everything you actually need despite also focusing on stocking a smaller number of high-volume items rather than having everything you could possibly need. (Trader Joe's and Aldi, while run independently now, share some common corporate ancestry.)

Whole foods is convenient because they have pretty much everything you could possibly need under one roof, and have a lot of niche items, but rarely have the best prices on anything.

For just basic groceries, see if there's any public housing near you. Often public housing projects have basic grocery stores in or near them them. While their selection will be fairly limited, they usually have decent prices on necessities. Examples of this are the Western Beef in Chelsea, and the C-Towns by the Brooklyn Bridge and in the East Village.

Supermarkets like Gristedes and Morton Williams will give you an experience that's somewhere in between all the options just mentioned. Probably not going to have the best prices, quality, or selection in any particular area, but there are a lot of them, so the odds are good of one being conveniently placed for you.

Ethnic grocery stores can be really hit or miss when it comes to pricing. Obviously there's some items you'll simply only find at an ethnic grocery store, but for more general stuff, sometimes you'll find great deals, and sometimes you'll find major ripoffs.

In general, though, the secret to grocery shopping in Manhattan is to make a lot of smaller trips to different places, picking up each item where it sells for the best price. If you are looking for that suburban grocery store experience of walking into one building and walking out with everything you'll need for a week or more without paying an arm and a leg you'll be severely disappointed.",t2_5geklxez,__-__-_-_,0,1640976177.0,0,t1_hqpn9pf,hqpn9pf,True,[deleted],t3_rszuht,https://www.reddit.com/r/manhattan/comments/rszuht/affordable_grocery_shopping_in_manhattan_trader/,affordable grocery shopping in manhattan? trader joe’s? whole foods? help ya friend out,/r/manhattan/comments/rszuht/affordable_grocery_shopping_in_manhattan_trader/hqpn9pf/,17,r/manhattan,0,17

"Yes,I do think it's doable, but you may have to look hard to get what you want in the pricier neighborhoods. If you are finding it tough to find something before you move, you might consider a short-term rental at first so you can be here on the ground to snap up a good apartment.

A/C is in nearly all high rises and newer buildings. However, make sure the listing mentions central air or ask. It's the old 5 story walk-ups that don't, as well as other small, very old buildings. It costs a lot to rewire.

The doorman is the frontline security for your building. They know who is coming and going. They accept packages for you, etc. They are incredibly handy, especially if you work long hours and don't have time to pick up your cleaning, packages from wherever, etc. Plus they are important for safety.

There are small, newer buildings that have video/ buzz in systems since they aren't large enough for doormen. The video/buzzer is very helpful since you can see who's trying to get in. Never let anyone in you don't know or aren't expecting.

Another idea of where to look is Stuyvesant Town (MetLife built this community for their employees back in the day). It's located from 14th to 20th Sts on the East Side above the East Village. Peter Cooper is adjacent to the north and goes up to 23rd St. It's a little pricier and very nice.

 Stuyvesant Town was rewired for A/C a few years ago. It is a great community with a diverse mix of people, young to old, singles, families, etc. They have workout areas, concerts outside, etc. It used to be dowdy, but they have really improved it in the past few years  Take a look online. They have their own leasing office. It's safe over there. Plus lots of green areas. Because the buildings are older (they are well maintained from what my friends tell me), the apartment rooms are larger than in newer places. You won't see sweeping cityscape views from too many apartments there, but it is more likely you will get a nice view of trees and green, which is a rarity in Manhattan. I have never seen a regular type fancy lobby like in most other buildings...you just get buzzed in and go up in the elevator, which is steps away from the door. The buildings don't have doormen ....just regular buzzer systems, but it is safe. There are security people patroling the community. Also, utilities are included in the rent...except there is a low A/C charge. I don't know if they have central air or you have to install your own, but this is one case I would tell you to consider installing your own if it's necessary because the apartments there are rent stabilized. Which means that at the end of the lease your rent can only be increased by a percentage set by the city board, not your landlord. In unstabilized rent buildings, landlords can and will charge you whatever they want with the new lease so what was affordable suddenly may not be. They might also be able to secure an apartment for you sooner than July because they have so much stock. Take a look.

If I was younger and didn't have my own stabilized apartment, I would move there. Before they modernized everything, I was on their list for years and never got in. Then I got my place.  People lived there until they died. But the new owners have turned it around IMO. There is no list to languish on.

"770 is in NoHo, near the Village(Greenwich)  and East Village.   The southern part of Gramercy Park area is also easily walkable from there as is SoHo. 

These are fabulous and pricey and for the most part very safe neighborhoods (don't know about EV's crime because I don't pay attention).  

Start taking a look now on the websites already recommended to get an idea of pricing. If you do find a brand new building that is opening around August, they will be signing up tenants months in advance if they can, but they will be pricey.

A few comments:

Many apartments come up for rent anywhere from a few days, a week or two or maybe 3 before they're available.

August is a busy month because college students are returning so it's more competitive than right now. If you see something you really like, pounce on it.

There aren't that many new buildings in those areas. The Village and Soho probably have the least. Would you call a white brick apartment building built in the 60s old? Many are kept in great shape, have doormen, elevators, maintenance crews on site, etc. so don't overlook them.

If you have your heart set on a newer building, look a little further up in the low 30s where the streets between 3rd/2nd/1st Avenues are full of high rises built in the last 0-25 years. Depending on where the apartment is located in the building, you can get a great view. If you really like to walk, this is doable but probably a 30 minute walk. The bus service on those avenues is very good, so you can easily get to work in the rush hours if the weather is bad or you don't feel good. For years I walked 30 minutes to and from work. It was a true joy to walk through the different streets and get to know the neighborhoods around me, as well as getting exercise and time to prepare for the day or unwind.

Make a list of must haves. I'm assuming a doorman and elevator. If a building doesn't have an elevator, it is likely small and very old. Your list will help you sort out the listings you like. An apartment/building may not have all of the amenities you want (if they aren't mentioned, don't assume they are offered/available).

I'm sure others will give better tips, but hope these help. Good luck!

Edit: Forgot to mention you should know if you want to have your own lease for a year. Or if you want to sublease from a lease holder who isn't living there (in a regular rental building) OR sublease from a co-op or condo owner. Subleasing can be a fast and easier way to get in without getting stuck for a year while you try to find something better, but your rights can very  limited, etc. Subleasing can be great, but sometimes a nightmare if you are suddenly given notice and you need to find somewhere else quickly, especially if it's an illegal sublet. I personally never took an illegal sublet because of all the people I knew who wanted a nice and cheaper place in a great building but ended up getting screwed because they didn't have a legal leg to stand on.

"So more than likely, any info you get here is going to fall into two camps.

1) That area is a hell hole and you are going to get murdered.

or

2) You’re a terrible person.

The only way to get actual, reliable anecdotal evidence is to talk to someone that lives in that area. This sub is a good place to start but people on the internet are weird, my advice is to go to that neighborhood and find a bar or a coffee shop (bar is probably better, as they see the neighborhood at night as well). Talk to whoever’s working about the neighborhood, maybe after that see if there’s a regular they could point you to to talk.

But overall, anywhere in Manhattan is pretty damn safe. It’s important to keep your guard up and be wary but no place is as bad as they say on the news. As long as you take common sense precautions like don’t engage anyone who freaks you out, make sure doors are locked behind you and seeking help if you feel you need it (dudes in any 24hr bodega will call the cops for you if you need it, and any bouncer or bartender lives for shit like that.)

Masks, moving everything we could outdoors, gradual reopening, a 40-50% prior infection rate and 90% vaccination coverage for 18+ kept our Rt below, or for limited amounts of time barely above 1, since mid-April 2020. Unlike other states and nations, we virtually never had to backpedal or reimpose restrictions since then. Life was pretty much back to normal since September. In a background of forever-Zoomers’ prophecies of doom, schools and colleges reopened, and nothing happened; the skies did not come falling down. Hospitalizations and deaths kept hovering around pandemic lowest levels. Vaccination campaigns, mandates and proof-of-vaccination policies proved fruitful. A few weeks ago optimism still permeated everything and everybody, myself included.

Then came omicron, slashing both natural and vaccine-immunized protection against becoming infected by a factor of 5 across the board. The infection odds reduction by a factor of 5-6 (VE 80% - 85%) dropped to an essentially negligible odds reduction by a factor of 1-1.2 (VE 0% - 20%). 

And Rt shot up by a commensurate factor. And that changes everything. 

Omicron doubled every two days. And so it goes, with exponential growth: it is steady, it is highly predictable, but we have zero intuition for it: suddenly there’s that week where it turns from tiny speck at the horizon to a wall slamming in our face that seemingly came out of nowhere. Nothing really changed though, the infection rate kept growing at a steady exponential rate. Nothing has changed for weeks, really. And so nothing will change for at least another week, for why would it? 

Our minds our evolutionary conditioned to assess threats growing linearly, well-adapted still to know what to expect from fast-approaching, loud and visible cars. But not at all well-adapted to intuitively asses threats growing exponentially, not at all tuned to a fast-spreading quiet and invisible virus.

So, very roughly, this is what will happen.

Say nothing has been or will be changing at all, ie the growth has been and will be, for some time, just steady exponential, with a steady doubling time of two days. 

Then when did steady highly predictable thing this start?  Not yesterday, but almost 4 weeks ago, on November 24. Then when did it seem to all of sudden be everywhere,  seemingly coming out of nowhere? Last week. When will it grow beyond what seems unimaginable? Next week. When will it be over — be it by lockdown of by simple viral burn-through? No later than mid January.  For under those quantitatively overly-simplistic but qualitatively basic-essence capturing assumptions, it then went, and will go, like this:

12/24: 5  o-infection in NYC 

11/26: 10  o-infections in NYC 

11/28 :20 

11/30: 40 

12/2: 80 

12/4: 160

12/6: 320

12/8: 640

12/10: 1K

12/12: 2K

12/14: 4K

12/16:  8K

12/18: 16K

12/20: 32K

12/22: 64K

12/24: 128K

12/26: 256K 

12/28: 512K

12/30: 1M

1/2: 2M

1/4: 4M

1/6: 8M

1/8: 16M??  Well, obviously not — not enough people around. 

In reality it will slow down and peak well before 1/8, evidently, one way or another. But it will certainly not yet peak next week, at most the doubling time will slow down a little bit, but it will still exponentially increase. Because there is no reason the tide would suddenly turn right now, after all these weeks of nothing changing, and still lots of new hosts available. 

This brackets things pretty tightly — it will probably peak around the beginning of January, one way or another. 

As for OP’s original question: since you are vaccinated, booster included: just come. Sure you’re quite likely to get infected, like all of us, but not necessarily on day 1, and the incubation time is 4-5 days, and with very high probability you’ll get nothing more than very mild symptoms. So you’ll still get a good chunk of your trip feeling fine, and then perhaps a couple of days bleh, and a two-week free extension of your trip courtesy of NYC, in a quarantine hotel, which may well include the Pierre and the Plaza by then. It might be your most interesting NYC trip ever.

"Congrats! In no particular order:

Right now I’d go to the comedy cellar website and get reservations for a show. Then in two weeks show up and see first rate stand ups and then go out in the Village. Grab some expensive cocktails from Employees Only, Katana Kitten or something like it. Or uptown at Dolly Varden or Valerie. Maybe grab reservations at a speakeasy like the Basement or PDT.

If you have any interest in the slightest—go to the Opera. I’ve see a lot of stuff in my time, traveled the world, see a lot of shows—the MET Opera floored me. It’s beautiful. The vibe is electric. The performance is amazing. The sets gigantic (like size of a City street). It truly is epic, to its truest form. You don’t have to dress super fancy or anything, but it is fun to!

Get pork buns from Mei Lai Wah. If there’s a line, wait in it. It moves fast. Cash only. 

Pick a famous bagel place. Everyone has their favorite—mine is Best Bagel and Coffee. SECWait in line, it goes fast. 

Get drunk. Go to bodega. Order a chopped cheese. Enjoy your forever changed life. 

Perhaps a little touristy—but my wife and I still do it—buy baileys and hot cocoa. Dress warmly and walk around the Pond in Central Park and around sunset. Drinking boozey hot chocolate. Then make your way down 6th Ave. See the Rockefeller Tree and ice rink. Then pop into Magnolia there and grab a dessert to split. It’s touristy, but like—it’s also delightful.",t2_lxyh7,joelekane,0,1639020901.0,0,t1_hnt4y1i,hnt4y1i,True,Tuna65000,t3_rc4415,https://www.reddit.com/r/manhattan/comments/rc4415/due_to_omnicron_my_wife_and_i_had_to_change_our/,"Due to Omnicron my wife and I had to change our honeymoon.

If you like museums some less obvious ones might be the Museum of the City of New York or the New York Historical Society. 

There are good restaurants and bars uptown by Columbia as well.

"Done. The next time you create a survey, you’ll probably want to break out the questions with more specific grouping. 

Ask a set of questions about toilets. Then ask the same questions about water fountains. Then do the same for indoor public spaces, etc. You’ll get better quantitative data to analyze what’s more important to people by type of public utility.

"Named for a cloud of dust in outer space that’s visible in the night sky, Nebula takes its cues from the interstellar, the club’s visionary design transports guests into different otherworldly immersive environments each week. 

Nebula will provide a transformative nightlife experience that blends cutting edge technology and world class hospitality, its ability to transform every night a nod to the famed Manhattan venues of yesteryear, which transformed for their patrons week to week. Nebula’s unbelievable, movable ceiling gives the club and event space the ability to transform each time the doors open. 

The ceiling is composed of six massive video panels, which are able to move and tilt individually or come together to form an incredible, venue-spanning screen, allowing patrons to **dance under anything from a cosmic night sky, to hypnotic, rhythmic pulsing lights**. 

This *technology is like nothing guests have ever seen before*, **enabling the venue to transition from a soaring cathedral like space, to a low ceilinged dance club**, ensuring *a captivating and unique visual experience and set-up every night*. 

Nebula is the brainchild of New York nightlife fixture Richie Romero, a former partner at Butter Group, the force behind 1OAK and Up&Down and Yang Gao, the co-founder of MIXX Lifestyle Group. Musical programming is being curated by TCE Presents founder and one of the most respected figures in New York’s electronic music scene, Rob Toma.

"I love the jam sessions at Smalls in west village. Usually features a lead musician/band and then other musicians can show up and join in. The ensemble changes based on who shows up with what instruments. Great loose improv, and usually a lot of real talent. The venue is small though and it can get crowded fast. Lots of people end up standing around the bar. ([This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9_2lwlyjk) pans the room in the middle. To give you a feel for the club.)

Vanguard is my favorite for seeing a feature performance. You buy a ticket and get a table. The music will be professional and tight. Vanguard looks/feels more like the photo you posted.

"Not with those places, no, both Vanguard and Blue Note have a fairly hefty cover charge depending on the artist. With the Vanguard, that DOES include I think at least one drink, so that helps. Not sure about Blue Note.

As for no cover charge, I'm not really sure you will find that, there are just too many costs associated with running that sort of venue, especially in NYC. Rockwood Music Hall used to have no cover charge for its original room, but I am not sure about that anymore, plus thy are not strictly a jazz club.

"Love the concept of the app, few critiques (im running the android version):

- you should make your filters scroll wheels or something click able, the slide bars are hard if you just want to chose a certain weekend if they're too close together its almost impossible to get it right.
- you don't appear to have a filter to stop duplicate events. I've found the NYC Halloween Parade 5 times now so I keep rejecting it since its already in my likes. Not sure if that messes with your algorithm since I like the event just not having that many duplicates in my likes.
- this is not the biggest deal but i signed up for an account bc of the $500 give away but it looks like you don't get a loon from signing up you have to find one in an event to be entered. I almost deleted the app just from that bc it feels like a trick fake giveaway. 
- you should have a report or request feature incase someone finds an error in an event or someone shares something inappropriate. Not saying I found that yet but if I opened the blah blah party and saw it was at a bar and the bars address is wrong there's no way to give input back for the client who posted it.

You may want to consider taking that job in DC first & then search for jobs on NYC on the side. Once you have it, THEN move to NYC. Very few places are doing in person interviews, so you could do video interviews to get started.

"Hey, first off Happy Belated Birthday! You're 19 and you've got an entire life ahead of you, it might not seem like it but if you take it one day at a time I know there will be many more Birthdays for you in the future.

I'm sorry that you're in the position you're in, living in an apartment with someone who is toxic and rips you down would hurt anyone. I don't have any money nor a place for you to stay but if you do run away there are a few subreddits that might be able to help. If you can hold onto your phone you can use public wifi to interact and such. I don't comment/visit much on Reddit but just wanted to reach out here and give you a little stepping stone for your next day.

Try out [https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/)
