One option is to take the gondola at Snow Basin up to the Needles Lodge then hike the rest of the way to the top of Mount Ogden.

"True. 

I wouldn’t know what to do with an unrepentant kid if I had one. But I’m thinking there are probably professionals in our community that have the knowledge and authority to do something for this bunch. 

I doubt splashing this all over Reddit will do anything to help the attitude problem, or the behavior problem. And it seems incredibly invasive to post this stuff instead of just showing it to the relevant adults in the situation (principals, parents, cops, whoever).

Honestly I was a shitty kid sometimes. I don’t know if I was ever this bad, but I know that when adults responded with righteous indignation I immediately thought they were self-important twats and didn’t listen to anything they said. If they had outright attacked me or my parents, I would have been thunderstruck, but it would also have just further entrenched my belief that they were assholes who didn’t know anything.

Do you honestly think kids like this should go to jail? Do you have any idea what prisons are like?

I’m genuinely curious where all of the anger on this post is coming from. Because to me, that kind of punishment mindset is incredibly extreme and tends to result in worse and worse damage. Unless someone’s truly a danger to others, there’s no point in having a torches and pitchforks reaction. If your real goal is to prevent property damage, public and private, online harassment isn’t going to help. 

It’s not that the destructive behavior isn’t shitty. It is. But IT HAPPENS. People make BAD DECISIONS. Especially when they’re young.

Now, my neighborhood is completely safe. Meth labs were demolished or bought/renovated by the city. Amazon packages remain safe in open view on our porch. A new school was built a couple years ago. Kids play safely in front yards. It's completely different from the reviews in 2015.

"I forget her name, but there's a gal in the garden center at IFA that's a great resource for everything plants. 

Their 4 step fertilizer is decent too and lists a general time frame for application. 
But to my general understanding, getting pre-emergent in the fall helps a lot the next spring because it gets watered in over the winter. 

One of the troubles with pre-emergent in the spring is ensuring it gets watered in properly. If you're on secondary water, it's too late by the time they prime the system for a pre-emergent to be effective. And rainstorms can be tricky to catch or don't dump enough.

I homeschooled my boys until high school. If your parents are uncomfortable with you participating with one of the public schools, perhaps they would feel you are safe joining clubs at one of the charter schools? If they are liberal/diversity-friendly, then Davinci has a ton of ten clubs: anime, robotics competition, art, theater, and service. If they are religious/conservative, then Ogden Prepatory could be a good choice?

The bike collective is a nice community too. In addition to getting a bike, you can learn skills and make friends there.

Ogden's community centers used to offer a lot of free or cheap classes and activities for elders and teens. We went to the Marshall White Center for swimming, jewelry making, and service. They also have basketball, table tennis, etc. 

At your age, you could also talk to your parents about taking a class or joining a club or service organization at Weber or the OWATC.

News articles report that homeowners are still fighting to evict deadbeat or unemployed tenants and if the tenants move they won't pay what's owed and typically leave the property trashed to make things worse.

They are free to access if you physically go to the Weber County Recorder's office(except for copies and printouts of course). Unfortunately if you don't know what you are doing it is not very user friendly and county employees can only help you so much. They are limited in what they can do because of liability.

Researching a property prior to 1981 can be done, but is much easier with help from somebody who does this for a living. It involves reading the handwritten abstracts that are kept in the recorder's vault. 

The Utah Business Entity Search is free for basic use, it's a few bucks if you want/need to dig in deeper. 

https://secure.utah.gov/bes/index.html

One of my favorite completely free resources is: 

https://parcels.utah.gov/

You can use this to drill down to specific addresses or tax serial numbers and get a decent overhead by turning on the hybrid view in the top right. You can also just scroll to zoom into whatever you are looking for. Keep in mind that this only shows basic ownership lines and is sometimes out of date. There are **no** easements shown. 

The county courts are also available for a small monthly fee on xchange:

Utah - Smith Lc did sell the land/building to Swift Port Inc back in March of 2000. But the Utah Business Entity search discloses that Swift Port was just another Smith owned company.

Swift Port Inc then sold the property off to National Federal Lands Conference, A Utah Non Profit, but [surprise, surprise, surprise,](https://c.tenor.com/1N-RSV0yQ0IAAAAd/gomer-surprise-gomer.gif) that too is owned by Smith.

A year later National Federal Lands Conference then deeds it back to Utah - Smith Lc.

"I've lived in the Ogden area my entire life. Yeah, the amenities are obviously not what SLC has to offer, but you still have great outdoor recreation in all directions. Vegas, Moab, Jackson Hole, Yellowstone, the Uintas, Zion, and Park City are all within reach still in Ogden. Closer options from Ogden for your visit would be hitting the east bench hiking or mountain biking trails, Antelope Island, Pine View, Willard Bay/ Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, Salt Flats and of course historic 25th street to name a few. In the summer, 25th Street has it's weekly farmers market as well! Pine View and the ski resorts (Snow Basin, Powder Mountain, and Nordic Valley) could all be options while you're in town, but we have had very little snow this year.

You'll find cheaper housing in Ogden, but not as much diversity as SLC. However, more diversity than in Davis or Utah county. Overall, it's a good mix in my opinion. More of a small town feel but still a good amount of bars, restaurants, and activities around town. I'm a real estate agent in the area, feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Even if you've already made connections with an agent, happy to just provide you general info about the area and can suggest some Mortgage Lenders/Brokers that you can connect with.

"Hi there!

Downtown Ogden is fun. It's known as 25th street. There are bars, restaurants(if you like pizza and beer, try Slackwater on 24th or Lucky Slice on 25th), coffee shops, and some small shops that are fun to peruse. There's a fun (but small) train museum to check out. 

The art district is under a ton of construction right now, but it's still fun to see local artists and their art. 

We have our own minor league baseball team that plays at Lindquist Field (a block away from 25th street.) We also have an amphitheater that hosts live bands, local musicians all throughout the summer. The music vibes  range from acoustic (think Iron & Wine) to pop. 

The farther east you go, you'll be in the mountains and almost every road ends in a hiking/biking trail head that boasts great views of the Ogden Valley. Most of the hiking is easy, but make sure you take water with you. It can get incredibly hot incredibly quickly. 

We're a short drive to a couple ski resorts, and Pineview Dam is about half an hour away by car and is fun for swimming or boating. 

Every July (July 24th), we celebrate our statehood anniversary. There are always rodeos going on along with fireworks. (The fireworks are dependent upon how dry the state is at the time.) There's usually a parade and carnivals galore.

The roads out in that area are not bicyclist or jogger safe. Most of 1200 W that is south of 400 N really has no shoulder and cars regularly do 50+ MPH. You can weave your way through BDO east to Stewart Drive which isn’t as heavily used as Depot Drive but then you reach 12th street with no traffic light.

What model is your dryer and when you say loud, what exactly do you mean? Squeaky? thumping? grinding?

However, one thing I've noticed is that home prices have been skyrocketing. In the last year, our home's value has appreciated by at least 30% (current market value is approx 130% of purchase price), hence why we are planning to move in a few years instead of right now (i.e. to avoid a huge capital gains tax).",t2_xxtjv,Reno83,0,1644880693.0,0,t1_hwyu1pk,hwyu1pk,True,sillydustbunny,t3_srywfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogden/comments/srywfh/what_are_the_positives_and_negatives_of_living_in/,What are the positives and negatives of living in Ogden?,/r/ogden/comments/srywfh/what_are_the_positives_and_negatives_of_living_in/hwyu1pk/,3,r/ogden,0,3

"I'm a transplant that lived in Layton for a year, then Ogden for the last 5. 

Weber County is the most racially diverse area in Utah (backed by census data). That being said, I wouldn't necessarily say it's not racist. It's still Utah, unfortunately. There's also great LGBTQ+ support. 

The public schools are also rated very poorly across most of the area, particularly beyond elementary. The best are charter/private schools, so have fun with that.

Housing. What can we say about housing. As someone that is in process of selling, I'm really happy to be getting out right now. My house doubled in value in five years. Ogden and SLC are both in the top ten of overvalued housing markets in the US; Ogden at 3, SLC at 9. You're likely to find more house for your money up here, but depending on what you're looking for, potentially more ""value"" in SLC. I work on the north side of SLC, with a 38 mi one way commute. Even with bad traffic, the trip is rarely over an hour. The train can also be very convenient if you need to use it. 

As far as jobs go, Utah wages are getting better depending on where you look, but they're largely not on track with the exploding inflation for the area. There's a lot of growth in the area depending on what you do.

"I deal with this too and we are beyond fed up. We have been in contact with the sheriff. It seems to be hard problem to solve. We have started gathering license plates for the extremely noisy cars that drive back and forth. We have also noticed a gathering spot at the Maverick on 7th and Washington. The sheriff explained to us that there are mods now that the drivers can switch on off for their mufflers so it's hard to catch because the drivers just switch it when an officer is in sight. We were told that because Washington is a state road, it's hard for the city to implement any new types of restrictions.

"I went to the NDI program there last year and it was great, it was right next to the Composites program so I was able to see a lot of work they did every class.

Have you researched the college a bit? It's different from Weber State because it's a hand on technical college where you learn at your own pace. It's probably the same for the Composites program but for the NDI program we had to watch videos through an approved accredited site that would help acknowledge the online learning when we graduated for an employer.

I would expect you would watch videos for each unit you're on and then you would do the lab portion of it. 

The school is honestly amazing and I would have gone there sooner had I not had every single person tell me to get a bachelors degree from a university, no one bothered to ever tell me about doing a trade instead.

Because of the education I received from the OWACT I was actually offered a job up here in North Carolina for $26 an hour starting and they even helped me move out here with a moving expense, Composites is one of the top up and coming careers so do it and be ready to get a lot of hands on experience!",t2_hlq11,dabrothergoose,0,1644334715.0,0,t1_hw3come,hw3come,True,jimmyroberts_cats94,t3_shdw58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogden/comments/shdw58/moving_back_to_ogden_area_this_spring_opinions_on/,Moving back to Ogden area this spring.

Currently the status of the hotsprings is , they are amazing and a treasure, I live within a couple miles and enjoy them as often as possible, I don't want to attract more ppl as they are fairly popular but can still find yourselves alone enjoying it a to yourself. Late fall of 2021 locals did a nice job improving the narrow path that meanders above and along the river as well as reorienting and recreating the lower pools that are at river level and along side the river damned and divided off by rocks that get washed and scrambled up every spring and summer as the rivers level rises and drowns them till the fall, the 3 tubs above the river level are awesome I wish I could thank and know more of or about the people who made some of the initial efforts building the pool rock tubs they did a terrific job and I feel lucky to have such a awesome retreat that's not developed into some regulated steril unnatural commodity.  To sit in the moonlight down a dirt path listening to the river flowing by out in nature has a feeling you cannot recreate in an development nor can you retain it through development, it will be gone , that feeling or experience I can't define exactly but it's not just the water the warmth the night sky open air or the river sounds its all of the mixed in with the raw sensations you get only from nature , the sometimes sketchy icy narrow turns you confront with risk if 20 plus foot drop down to rocks a d river, or the idea that ya maybe some creeper could be out there in the dark , or maybe a mountain lion or whatever it is , the point is the fact its not a paved trail with bright lights and a concessions stand  is the most valuable attributes of the place.   Many know exactly what I mean without my bad description and grammer, those who don't are missing out on what I consider the best things in life simple experiences in nature that keep me acquainted with my connection of my body to the earth to the universe , without that nourishment  I would be join the growing numbers of the walking dead.

"Because the demographic is different in Ogden and the rest of Utah than in LA. Expecting Ogden/Utah to hit LA standards in the 'boojie' area of material things is unrealistic. It's a different place with different people. I'm not saying that nobody here wants those things, I'm sure that like you, there are others with the same gripe. It's just a lot less of the population.

To answer your earlier question:
A few quick googled numbers -
Average income in LA in 2020 was 75,624, average househole size 2.8, and poverty rate of 13.2%. 
Average income in Ogden in 2020 was 66,876, average family size is 3.32, average household size 2.7, poverty rate of 17.2%. Not to mention the population difference. 2020 census says  LA had a population of 3,898,747 vs Ogden a mere population of 87,321. The whole state of Utah has less of a population than LA, coming in at 3.2 million. 

Looking at those numbers, I think money and population is definitely the main factor.

Secondly, Oden and Utah have a different feel than LA. Priorities are different for a lot of us. I think someone also mentioned the religious aspect of having around 48% of the population of Ogden being LDS members. With that, priorities and wants are different for almost half of our population are more humble. Meaning fancy material things and dining are very low on that list, and that 10% of their income would be going to the church instead of back in to our economy. Another key factor. 

As for why did it change you asked in another thread-
IMO, prices of housing and cost of living has gone up, but wages haven't kept up. Forbes also listed us as the top 10 places to raise a family a few years back. I think we've had an influx of family households in the area, meaning amount of mouths to feed, clothe, and house is larger with not a lot of growth in income. Ogden has also changed a lot in 25 years. This is the most I've seen in free or cost effective events, the amount of good local restaurants, and the city putting an effort into making Ogden more cultural, artsy, and outdoorsy.
More simply put, the consumer demographic has evolved changed.",t2_b62az81y,mindless_hope_877,0,1642701442.0,0,t1_hthjcg8,hthjcg8,False,[deleted],t3_s83kk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogden/comments/s83kk4/reasons_for_no_high_end_retailvehiclesdining/,Reasons for no high end retail/vehicles/dining,/r/ogden/comments/s83kk4/reasons_for_no_high_end_retailvehiclesdining/hthjcg8/,2,r/ogden,0,2

"Hey, I've got one of those fancy book learnin degrees. But I actually don't need my engineering degree to let you know that you come across as an ass. I honestly thought people were being a little overly harsh on you at first, but nothing says ""I think I'm better than you and smarter than I actually am"" than calling out people for not having a degree. You might take this as ""passing judgement""(which imo is almost always just an excuse trotted out for poor behavior), but you should legitimately ask yourself why you would look down on someone who didn't decide to go $80k+ in debt for college. It's odd to think like that in general, but incredibly tacky to actually type that out or say it in real life.

But in response to your original question: In general I think what keeps a lot of chains/dealerships out is Ogden's old reputation. My wife's coworkers in SLC talked about it like it was one giant meth house when we moved to Utah (I work in Ogden). It seemed so weird because we really enjoyed it when we visited the town. I've lived and worked around St Louis and San Antonio. These yuppies have no idea what a sketchy neighborhood really looks like, lol.

Personally we decided on moving to Ogden after being in Utah a couple years because we enjoy the blue collar feel. I enjoy it here so much more than the suburbs we rented at before buying in Ogden. It seems that you'd like some fancy chains to move in, but I'd rather they stay out and keep that business going to local places. There really are some great options here food wise. I noticed you mentioned that you miss the Eddie Bauer. Hit up Gear30, they have higher end brands than EB.

In general, most of the people on this sub like Ogden, and don't want it to look like the rest of the wasatch front. It seems you would like it to, and that's why most people are probably downvoting you.",t2_8ipd1,jdd32,0,1642693456.0,0,t1_htgxji5,htgxji5,False,[deleted],t3_s83kk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogden/comments/s83kk4/reasons_for_no_high_end_retailvehiclesdining/,Reasons for no high end retail/vehicles/dining,/r/ogden/comments/s83kk4/reasons_for_no_high_end_retailvehiclesdining/htgxji5/,9,r/ogden,0,9

"You must be new! Well, this community may seem thriving now, but even until 2017/18 it was hard to convince the local population (as a whole) that we weren't the ""armpit"" of Utah (Slackwater actually used to use that in ads).

Ogden/weber was stagnated for decades, I think I remember hearing that when I-80 was rerouted by park city to SLC that the area went downhill, until very recently.

Hell I don't even know where everyone works now, but for years it seemed like the only jobs here were call centers. Sure the air force base, but let's not kid ourselves: most those folks live in Davis county.

Additionally the local population has been historically tight with money. Half of them did with 10% less because of tithing and the other half were just stingy. (For example: I waited tables until 2011 and the average tip was less than 10%).

And if you ever want to waste time go ahead and read restaurant reviews in Weber, everything that isn't Little Caesars or McD's or Texas Roadhouse (for some reason) is slapped with ""overpriced"".
