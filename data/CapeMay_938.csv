"Haven‚Äôt stayed but looked many times, and have been around it since the building was a decaying hulk and got restored. 

It‚Äôs really nice and you get a lot of amenities (but many of them like beach service aren‚Äôt there in the off season).  It‚Äôs a bit expensive, and the deal breaker for me is the lack of porches or terrace. My favorite thing to do is sit on a big Victorian porch and read or watch the people, and horse drawn carriages go by, or if you are beachfront, watch the ocean. You can sit on the lawn at CH, but it‚Äôs not quite the same.

"Some favorite restaurants of mine are: 
Freda‚Äôs Cafe (small, relatively casual but fantastic food).  
Primal (new, steakhouse, absolutely amazing food but not stuffy). 
Tishas (Italian leaning food, fine dining but not snobby)
Louisa‚Äôs (was ‚Äúfarm to table‚Äù before that was a thing)
Merion Inn (old school piano bar vibe inside at the bar, oldest bar in Cape May, though they just got bought so I don‚Äôt know what changes will come)

There are very few liquor licenses in Cape May, so most restaurants are BYO. Colliers liquors has a really good wine selection. 

Can definitely recommend renting a bike and cruising around to check out all the Victorian houses.  Ride down to the lighthouse and Sunset Beach.   If you are into the Victorian thing, take a tour of the Emlen Physik estate and/or one of the trolley tours.   Lots of stuff within walking distance so I usually don‚Äôt see my car when I‚Äôm there. 

The Queen Victoria is another great B&B option if you are still looking for a place to stay.

"i agree w the other comments. There are world class restaurants in cape may, we are kinda known for them. I have been vegan/vegetarian as well as many friends of mine for many years. most restaurants have a vegetarian vegan option or two (even if all it takes is asking for substitution on an existing menu item.)  
 If you are only looking to the tourist trap restaurants then you might have less luck. (lobster house, Ugly Mug, Uncle Bills, Fins, etc)   


most are family owned and happy to accommodate you, you just have to ask your server or put a note in on your reservation and they will do what they can.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"Thank you for responding! I will address your interesting points:

1) Re: kindness. Oh, I believe you. I am sure the friendliness even further south is most different than what we are used to in the NY area. In NY, people have always tended to look a bit on the angry/indifferent side. We are jaded, so sometimes can give a vibe of really being mean. Like, for example, personally I think that's the vibe people get from me, even though I can have a long conversation with someone. It's just hard for me to initiate it in public with a stranger, but when a stranger does approach me, it is very endearing.

2) I definitely agree with what you say about formal but not judgmental. You really hit the nail on the head and that's exactly the feeling I get, which is why I like it. On a personal level, I can be quite formal in dress, but at the same time I don't like to carry myself in a judgmental way or ""stiff"". I just really enjoy classical stuff and a low key approach to life.

3) I am honestly shocked about what you've said re: Kentucky. I would have never imagined it that way, but there you go! You learn something new everyday! Yes, for me, coming from such a dirty city like NY, it is always beautiful to see no litter on the streets and no gum stuck all over the place or graffiti everywhere. Urban blight is a very real thing and it affects your outlook on things.

\-----------------

Re: Negatives

1) No, it wasn't just the beer glass thing. That was a quickly noticeable thing for me, but in general there was a lack of ""attention to detail"" (although now I see that others have mentioned that they are short-staffed, so that makes a lot of sense!)

2) Food: Personally, I tend to like a lot of variety (although nothing too spicy or ""exotic"" for lack of a better term), but I guess I need to just find the right place. I did plan to go to one place called Aleatheas, which someone told me would be more to my standard, but unfortunately did not have time to go.

Would I purchase? Probably not. I would basically just enjoy long-term rentals, which would take away the heavy responsibility of owning and in my case, I probably would not be able to live there all year long due to several logistics in my own life. I have never been there in the winter though, so if I experienced it in winter and liked it, I might change my mind. However, as a summer place, I can honestly say it has been my favorite resort thus far (in the US).",t2_5h6cm0ly,waspinastoria,0,1629393673.0,0,t1_h9k12jf,h9k12jf,False,waspinastoria,t3_p7dkai,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/p7dkai/really_liking_cape_may/,Really liking Cape May,/r/CapeMay/comments/p7dkai/really_liking_cape_may/h9k12jf/,2,r/CapeMay,0,2

"Hello! 

I remember your post, and I appreciate you writing down your thoughts! I am a semi-frequent vacationer to Cape May and it's always good to see other opinions. I thought I would share my opinions and thoughts as well, at a genuine attempt at discussion; please don't think I'm trying to be antagonistic here. 

My background: I'm in my 30s. I fell in love with Cape May in the late 1990s and continue to go back. My wife and I plan to retire there one day. I remember going to Cape May when I was in high school, staying at the cheaper places. Then as a young adult, going with my now-wife, we would stay at Bed and Breakfasts. Now we have young kids, and we either rent a house or stay at a kid-friendly motel like Beach Shack. I am coming from a different area than you... I live in Virginia, where things are a lot ""slower"" and the food is nowhere near as diverse as one can regularly find in NYC. Pizza in Virginia is rated at how close it is to ""genuine"" NY-style, which is to say, nothing really comes close. A run-of-the-mill Indian here place sees a lot of buzz and success because of how different and unique it is.

1. It's funny you should mention the kindness. I guess Cape May does feel a little bit ""Southern"" when compared to NYC. I've never noticed this phenomenon, probably because people in Virginia already tend to at least look you in the eye and nod when they pass. I recently took a trip to the North Carolina coast (which I wouldn't really recommend otherwise, it doesn't compare Cape May or the Jersey Coast at all IMHO) and I was shocked at how many people legitimately greeted me. It seemed like everyone in NC looked me in the eye and said, ""Hello!"" or ""Hey there, Boss! How are we this morning?"" I sat down inside a boutique while my wife shopped and the manager offered me coffee, tea, *or a beer*.
2. I love the houses/architecture as well, and while I have never gotten the chance to stay at Southern Mansion, I have stayed at many B&Bs in the area, and they are all wonderful. The owners are always down-to-Earth, the breakfasts are always great, and other patrons are generally quiet and well-dressed. That's one thing I miss now that I have kids because I wouldn't dream of staying at a B&B with young kids. 
3. I agree that *feeling* this is somewhat unique to Cape May. The quiet, relaxed, kindness. Formal but not judgemental.
4. The cleanliness might also be something I take for granted. I find most places outside of big cities are clean. Except Kentucky, where people litter all over and even the interstate highways just have trash all along the side of the road.

Negatives:

1. Did you find the service otherwise lacking, or was it just the ""beer glass"" thing? I don't typically order bottled beer, so I'm not sure if this is a regional thing or a genuine problem. I guess I would say that I've never noticed any endemic *issue* with Cape May's service, but I've also never noticed it to be especially great*.* 
2. You have to realize that you're coming from NYC, which is considered by many professionals to be the Food Capital of the ***world.*** Any international cuisine of the highest quality at almost any price point can be found within a few miles of your home. I would agree that Cape May food is a little pricey compared to most ""regular"" places, but on-par with other tourist areas. As for quality, well again, I doubt it compares to what you can get in NYC, but I would say it's ""consistently above average"" compared to what I get around here. Like maybe the best restaurant in my town is about as good as one of a dozen places in Cape May. 
3. I haven't noticed this either, but I always try and go in the off-season. I usually go in September or June. Again, I am coming from Virginia, where things are definitely slower in general compared to NYC. 
4. I absolutely agree. Cape May does NOT have much of a night life, especially compared to some of the other touristy places I've been. Even the dessert places in Cape May tend to close by 9pm. I guess it's something to do with the older and/or family friendly atmosphere.

>All in all, I would definitely live here or rather, at least spend summers here. I might consider doing that starting next year.

"They aren‚Äôt too bad BECAUSE of the tax revenue the tourists bring in.  When you say you would be willing to pay more, are you comfortable with a 100% increase? My family has lived and owned property in Cape May and the surrounding area for almost 80 years. Members of my extended family have been involved at every level of local government for majority of that time. The area had grown and developed into an economic powerhouse during the season. With that growth comes the need for upgraded water, wastewater, road maintenance-all of which is needed year round and would be needed either way. The average tax bill is about $3000-$5000 for both full time residents and vacation home owners. Without the addition tax revenue, your bill would easily go to $6000 on the lower end. Sure, the home owners on the east end would have no problem covering that-they have big, out of town $$ that can cover an increase like that. But with high paying jobs at a premium and many of our residents on a fixed income, do you think they could handle an increase of that size? Look at the cities in Idaho & Montana where they saw a major increase in property owners. Bozeman Montana tried to keep tourists out. The city council made it difficult to accommodate tourism and it has backfired in spectacular fashion. Instead of leaving,the ‚Äútourists‚Äù started buying up property. Lots of it. So much so that the average tax bill went from $2000 to over $15000 per home. Tourists became semi-permanent residents that could easily afford the property tax. Know what else happened? The people that tried so hard to keep tourists out found themselves priced out of housing. Cape May has lots of older residents that will eventually die off. When that happens another ‚Äútourist‚Äù will buy their property and become a summer resident. You are foolish to think that cutting tourism will benefit you or anyone else.

‚ÄúBlack Diamond is a steel roller coaster located at Knoebels' Amusement Resort in Elysburg, Pennsylvania. It originally operated as the Golden Nugget at Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey‚Äù

And if you‚Äôve never been to Knoebels, all I can say is go.
You seem like you live for the things that existed when times were simpler-as do I.
Knoebels feels like an old soul of a place. There‚Äôs no charge for parking or admittance. You can simply walk around and enjoy the atmosphere if you choose to do so. But it has that lost in time feel that makes you comfortable right from the start.

Hopefully you decide to make the trek. You can see another piece of of your childhood memory & bring that early 80s summer feeling back again-if only for a moment.",t2_10hgcaek,ThePrettyGoodGazoo,0,1628703261.0,0,t1_h8k3iw0,h8k3iw0,False,ctrlaltxwrists,t3_ol8swa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/ol8swa/cape_may_will_always_have_a_special_place_in_my/,Cape May will always have a special place in my heart.,/r/CapeMay/comments/ol8swa/cape_may_will_always_have_a_special_place_in_my/h8k3iw0/,2,r/CapeMay,0,2

"Shoobie here. I was about to ask a similar question about this practice, which I'd never seen in 24 years of summer visits to Cape May until last week. At Beach #18, someone had set up three Tommy Bahama chairs at the tide line, then 10 meters away almost a dozen more in a half circle around an American flag. It was annoying: I'd brought me & my 9 y/o son at 10 AM, thinking that I could set up my chair up front in order to watch him play in the waves. The best I could do was to sit behind the three-some of empty chairs. But after 10 mins. or so of not getting a good view of my son in the water, I simply folded the chairs. The occupants didn't arrive for another 4 hours. Question: Do other shoobies pay to get these chairs on prime beach spots?

"Ocean temp will start dropping in September, but it's still probably in the high 60s in October, so not unbearable. Lifeguard services will be non-existent, so you swim at your own risk.

Things start cutting back hours/days after Labor Day weekend, with Columbus Day weekend being the true end of the season for a lot places (i.e: they close til the following year), so some places may only be open on weekends if at all.

It will be beautiful. Excellent mild weather, most of the shops on Washington Street will still be open, [tours](https://capemaymac.org/plan/cape-may-itineraries/ghosts-mysteries/ghosts-mysteries-calendar) and trolleys and bikes will still be available.

&#x200B;

There's a lot to do in Cape May even in the off season. TBH, when we go for a week in the heat of summer we only spend one day on the beach anyway, the rest of the time its enjoying all that the town has to offer. 

&#x200B;

And even though Cape May is *never* too crowded, in the off-season you'll feel like the town is yours. 

> Mainly would like to know if people swim in the ocean and would swimming pools be open?

I doubt you will see anyone swimming in the ocean. You'll see plenty of people stepping in with their toes, or walking along, and you might see someone going for a quick circulation-boost health dip, but you're not going to see kids in trunks swimming in the water.

As for pools, if you really want to swim in a pool, I highly suggest booking a place with a heated pool.

"hi! I would say it depends when in Oct. The first two weeks might be fine for the ocean but the beaches don't have lifeguards and there definitely wont be many swimmers. I usually close my pool at the end of October though so I would say on that front you're good. 

Other than that, I love Cape May in the fall! I actually like it better than the summer lol.

"I have so many fond memories of Cape May, it's Friday, and I don't feel like working today, so strap yourself in-- it's story time...

My uncle retired to a newly-built house on Illinois Avenue in ‚Äò78 and then promptly died in ‚Äò80, when I was 7. He left the house to me. My family spent the summers of ‚Äò81-‚Äò85 down there. The week after I got out out of school, we'd pack up and head down, and not come back until the week before school started up again in the fall. I remember getting progressively more excited as we got closer on those drives down: When we crossed the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge into Jersey; when we got onto the AC Expressway from Route 73; when we got onto the Parkway; when we'd hit those three intersections with the traffic lights pretty far down on the Parkway (that were only recently replaced with overpasses a few years ago). When I heard the sound of the car's tires on the steel grid deck bridge near Lafayette and Washington, my heart would really start pounding with excitement, and still does to a lesser degree when I drive down for the day as an adult pushing 50.

Most days during the summer I‚Äôd be up and out of the house by 9 or 10am and just straight up gone until dinner time. I could go anywhere I cared to pedal on my bike. I had a ton of ""summer friends""-- There were the Gaudiosis, five kids the next street over who came up from Virginia to stay at their uncle's house. There was B.J. Wilson, a kid from Marlton who came down to visit his grandparents who lived across the street-- I knew when he was there because his mom drove a blue AMC Pacer that I think of every time I watch Wayne's World. I was even friends with one kid who was a year-rounder-- his parents owned a restaurant called Maureen that was on Beach Drive, across the street from the second, smaller arcade that's a ways down the boardwalk from everything else (now it's the Iron Pier Craft House). They lived in a huge house not too far from mine, and he had the biggest collection of Atari cartridges I had ever seen.

A few blocks over from my house, the streets and houses kind of petered out and there was just a dirt trail through woods, with some construction debris laying around. There was a dark green fuel tank that was labeled ""diesel"" in black spray paint, sitting in front of an old semi trailer that was probably used for storage and had been there for years judging by the plant growth around it. The dirt track was what is now part of Trenton Ave, from Delaware Ave to Massachusetts Ave, and then it took the turn onto Massachusetts and spit you out on Texas Ave. Back then that end of it was blocked with piles of dirt so nobody could drive a large vehicle back there, but our bikes made it just fine. On Google's satellite view you can actually see the different color asphalt just above the intersection of Trenton and Delaware, that's where the dirt road began when we were kids. The fuel tank and semi trailer was on the dark green lawn to the left. We spent a lot of time in that area fashioning ramps out of plywood and rocks or cinderblocks and then doing jumps with our bikes.

There was a really nice guy across the street, Mr. Hinck. He had two dogs, a male Golden Retriever named Brandy and a female Great Pyrenees named Pooh Bear. I was always over there playing with them. He'd walk them one at a time over to the same then-undeveloped area where we made our bike jumps to do their business. I used to walk with him. Over time he'd let me hold the leash for a while, and eventually we'd each take a dog and walk both at once. Pooh was the sweetest dog-- if you were petting her and stopped, she'd tap your arm with her paw and look at you like, ""Who told you you could stop?""

I blew a ton of money on kites and balsa wood planes from the Dellas Department Store in the Washington Street Mall, and I was amused to see the exact same ones still for sale in there when I went down for a day trip at the start of June. We also bought quite a few water rockets, including one big enough to have a payload bay. We used to catch little toads in some of the undeveloped areas and launch them off in there.

The money I wasn't spending in Dellas went to the arcade on the boardwalk. The early 80s were the golden age of arcades, and over those four summers, that place had all the best games. To this day I can walk around in there, and if you point at most spots I could tell you a game that was occupying it almost 40 years ago. I can still hear the sound of the change machine, and the ka-chunk sound those hexagonal Splash Down coin pusher machines made when they were dispensing their silver plastic prize tokens. Even a few years ago the machines were still taking quarters and dispensing paper prize tickets but as of I think 2018 or 2019 they're using mag stripe cards to pay for games and record points--- takes a bit of the fun out of the experience when you're in there on a nostalgia trip.

I ate miles of strawberry shoestring licorice purchased from Morrow's Nut House. It broke my heart a few years ago when I got down there and found out it had been sold and renamed, because for so long it remained exactly the same as it had been when I was a kid. Stepping into that place, hearing the screen door slam behind me, and taking a big whiff of the familiar smell of chocolate and roasting nuts was like stepping back in time. I was even more disheartened this year when I went down and found it boarded up because the successor didn't last. One of my other day-trip totems was the animatronic guy in the window of The Fudge Kitchen. He was stirring the contents of his bowl for decades, but I saw this year that he's finally gone, too.

My friends and I played mini golf down there all the time. The best course is gone now, it was at La Mer, at Pittsburgh & Beach. I can't remember the name of it, but there was another good one on Gurney Street, in the spot now occupied by the building housing Avalon Coffee. There was also a pretty good soft serve place next to it, also gone. Stockton was just okay. Ocean Putt was the second best, and I see that's still around.

I saw some of the greatest movies of the 80s in the Beach Theatre. I remember Ghostbusters spent almost the entire summer of '84 playing in that theater, same with Back to the Future the following year. Every week there used to be a small printed movie guide listing titles and showtimes for the Beach and most if not all of the now-gone boardwalk theaters in Wildwood, and I would go pick one up religiously.

I had a few pet hermit crabs over those years, all bought from a large gift shop called Pandora's, that used to be on the corner of Beach & Gurney.

I remember a bookstore that used to be on the other side of the Beach Theatre from Pandora's. We went down for the day in October 1985 to check on our house a couple days after Hurricane Gloria hit the area, and that day I bought the novelization of Back to the Future from that bookstore. I still have it.

In 1983 the local cable company started providing MTV for free every day until 7pm, and I still have near encyclopedic knowledge of the music videos from that year in particular as a result.

Once a month or so my parents would take me to the Wildwood boardwalk for the night, and I lived for those visits. I remember when Morey's Pier first added the Sea Serpent and the giant Ferris wheel, but Hunt's Pier was more my speed back then-- I loved every ride on it except the Wacky Shack. I was very sad when I found out it had closed down for good. Years later, when I read that the Golden Nugget mine ride would finally be dismantled after just sitting idle on the derelict pier, a bit of me died inside-- it had been my very favorite, and on day trips down there as an adult it always made me smile to see that it still stood.

My parents sold that house in I guess very late 1985 or early 1986, very, very much against my wishes, but I was 12 and basically powerless to stop them. I am still bitter about it to this day. I take a day trip down there almost every year and my first stop is to just park for a minute in front of my old house. I wistfully remember the good times I had there, smile when I look at the dent in the lamppost at the end of the driveway that I put there by crashing into it on a bike once, curse my parents for selling it, and then head for my other stops on Beach Ave.

The happiest, most carefree days of my life were the summers I spent in Cape May. When I die, I'm going to be cremated and will almost certainly have my ashes scattered in the water off the Howard Street beach.",t2_4ahsk,phillymjs,0,1626460494.0,0,t1_h5fedrb,h5fedrb,True,ctrlaltxwrists,t3_ol8swa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/ol8swa/cape_may_will_always_have_a_special_place_in_my/,Cape May will always have a special place in my heart.,/r/CapeMay/comments/ol8swa/cape_may_will_always_have_a_special_place_in_my/h5fedrb/,4,r/CapeMay,0,4
"Many of the businesses here make an effort to sell unique products. It's fun to poke through stores at the Washington Mall and elsewhere to see what they're selling. West End Garage offers stuff to decorate the home you wouldn't find anywhere else. Cold Spring Brewery and Cape May Winery for those with adventurous tastes. Winterwood Gifts for some great Christmas gear.

The Wildwood Aviation museum was a fun day trip to see military planes. The tickets are fair and it has never been crowded. I have been to two Memorial Day speeches at the Convention Center to listen to speeches from the Commander of the Coast Guard. 

The beaches are just amazing. They're cleaned late at night, every night during the summer. I take walks from my usual spot at the Cove all the way to the lighthouse. Just peaceful listening to the waves.

If you're in that sweet spot in life, where you don't have adult responsibilities, but you can manage on your own there's plenty of summer jobs.

"Both months are beautiful and the water is at its warmest this time of year. You may encounter a few places closed after Labor Day but not enough that it would dampen your experience. Although, it's possible that the labor shortage this year could close up more places once the college aged workers leave. Personally I really love September in Cape May because the beaches are way less crowded and there's no kids around! The beaches will be free and the parking will be easier.

Just so you know, Cape May does not have a boardwalk. It has a beachfront concrete promenade with very few shops directly on it, just the occasional craft fair. It's very serene for walking but it's nowhere near your classic Jersey boardwalk--you'd have to visit Wildwood for that.

"> The flag lowering at Sunset Beach came to mind, but is there anything else? 

The Flag lowering is certainly a great event, and helps showcase that Cape May is and always has been a family friendly, all-American town. Its history is deeply tied to national service, especially the Coast Guard. 

Speaking of its history, the one thing that REALLY sets Cape May apart from other towns is a strong historical identity. Cape May prides itself on having more Victorian homes than anywhere else in America. There's no better way to experience this than by staying in one; there are many dozens of independently owned and operated Bed and Breakfasts throughout Cape May. All of the Bed and Breakfast proprietors are extremely friendly and would love an interview, for sure. 

There are also daily Ghost Trolly tours and mansion tours.

> Ideally, it's something during the week and is specific to the town. Again it could be a person, place or event!

If Cape May has an unofficial cultural center, it is Congress Hall. I highly recommend taking the historical tour. It's only about 15 minutes, but you'll see that every brick, every floor tile, every chair, every flagpole has a historically significant meaning.",t2_mhq4hzk,Abe_Bettik,0,1626279411.0,0,t1_h563byn,h563byn,True,JoeMartucciWeather,t3_ok6kvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/ok6kvc/press_of_ac_meteorologist_looking_for_video_idea/,Press of AC Meteorologist looking for video idea,/r/CapeMay/comments/ok6kvc/press_of_ac_meteorologist_looking_for_video_idea/h563byn/,4,r/CapeMay,0,4

We were both on our phones. Laying down and cooling off after getting too hot outdoors. I thought my wife was scratching an itch. Just a subtle rhythmic wobble.

"I have to echo what an earlier poster said that there are going to be tourists everywhere you go. However, some more ""off the beaten path"" type restaurants you could try that I personally really enjoy are The Olive Branch in Villas, Viggiano's on Sunset in West Cape May, Provence in Cape May Court House, 5 West in North Cape May, and Curry Inne in Wildwood. Mayer's down by the Lobster House is also really good, but last time I was there was very crowded. I also generally really like Secondo which is on the way into Wildwood Crest, but last time I was there we didn't have a great experience. Sometimes Gusto Brewery in North Cape May and Hawk Haven Winery in Rio Grande have food trucks and I love the product at both of those places. If you decide to give in and just deal with the tourists in town, Tisha's, Union Park, Peter Shields, Fins, Sea Salt, Exit Zero, George's Place, and The YB are all good choices.

"> tourist traps?

You may want to re-phrase that. Lobster House may be touristy but every local I know loves it as well. The biggest difference is that locals are more inclined to order ""take out"" and eat on the back dock, as opposed to eating in the restaurant. 

The other thing you have to realize is that Cape May is and always has been a tourist town. Unlike, say, Bar Harbor, where there are practically wars fought between tourists and locals over things like parking, pretty much every local in Cape May understands that their town is founded on tourism and holds no resentment.

For that reason, you're not going to find much ""off the beaten path"" and the places frequented by locals are likely also frequented by tourists. The Ugly Mug, Rusty Nail, and Harry's Bar are all full of tourists but also considered ""local.""

The closest things you're going to get are probably [West Side Market](https://westsidemarketwestcapemay.com/) and [Harpoon's on the Bay](https://harpoonsonthebay.com/menu.php). And if you're willing to drive a few miles north, [Court House Diner is pretty good.](https://www.thecourthousediner.com/) New Jersey is known for their diners, after all.",t2_mhq4hzk,Abe_Bettik,0,1625746821.0,0,t1_h4grucz,h4grucz,True,40ozT0Freedom,t3_og5gle,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/og5gle/taking_safe_harbor_from_elsa_in_cape_may_looking/,Taking safe harbor from Elsa in Cape May.

"I'd take a day or two to explore town and checkout some of the shops. Depending on how active you want to be you have a bunch of different options. You can rent bikes or Surrey's, or take a carriage ride around town with a guide. You can grab some food at one of the nicer restaurants if that's something you enjoy. It's pricey but I highly recommend 410 Bank Street, definitely get the Beignets if you go. 

Take another day to either do a nature tour or rent some kayaks and kayak around the marshes. I went out this morning and saw two osprey couples feeding their babies in the nest, there's also herons, egrets, and even bald eagles around the area. They also just added a place called revolution rail where you can bike down an old railway, in dog that tomorrow and I'll report ban if it's worth it.

The beaches are great and the water has been pretty warm, but it's been a little rough for swimming this week. It's still great to just lay on the beach and chill out for a bit.

"I checked my photos and I have an unmarked dated one I think from somewhere between 02-04 where it‚Äôs totally eroded underneath. High tide was completely under the building.

I‚Äôm honestly not too sure. Through the 90s I would go pretty much every year on vacation and seem to remember the beach was pretty eroded that whole time.

"When he gets older booster boxes in that he‚Äôs selling the packs individually just notice what goes in the vending machine soon after he starts selling it. After that take a drive up to the other shop in Vineland and look and see what new single cards he has for sale in the display case. Hopefully he stopped doing it but it‚Äôs been a while so knowing him he probably started doing it again. You know when he first opened up he called the other card shop in town that‚Äôs no longer open and pretended to be a tcg player inquiring about their store hours, tournament times, and the cost of it. After that he starting opening an hour before they did, started tournaments on the dates they did an hour before , and reduced the price to play as well. I mean I get it from a business standpoint but that just tells you what extent he‚Äôll go to just to make a couple dollars. Someone that has a distributor and gets reduced prices on product but still charges reselling prices is just greed at its finest yet can‚Äôt even pay his employees minimum wage. During the pandemic one of this employees had COVID when they opened back up and missed two weeks of work but no one knew that since he didn‚Äôt tell anyone bc he didn‚Äôt want to shit down again. So when everyone wasn‚Äôt that sure about COVID he decided it was in his best interest to not tell anyone and keep the store open and potentially risk everyone that walked into that store since the other employees and him worked with the one employee that had it. He only cares about money and will do whatever he has to do to get more of it. There‚Äôs so much more regarding him ripping off his customers but now that you know some of it just starting paying closer attention to things and you‚Äôll see. The guy only cares for himself and paranoid of everyone else. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs always watching his phone. It‚Äôs linked to the cameras at both shops and his house. People that paranoid are usually the ones that do shady things to others in the first place. I truly hope people realize what‚Äôs going on there sooner than later. I‚Äôm not positive about this one but the one employee said they say the paperwork for a ppp loan but they were never paid during the pandemic when the store was closed. The list just goes on and on.

We ended up going there and had a pretty bad experience. My steak was dry and overcooked. Our server pretty much ignored us once we got our meals. We ended up sitting there for two hours because she couldn't be bothered to check up on us and ask how we were doing. We were definitely the youngest couple there so maybe that's why they didn't take us seriously. Perhaps our waitress figured she'd get a larger tip from her older patrons.

"The Washington Inn. 

The service is unparalleled in Cape May, and it is the service that truly creates a memorable experience. The food is incredible, and portions are larger than Peter Shields. Their head bartender is a true mixologist, and the cocktails are out-of-this-world there - from the classics, to the bartender's creations. In addition, the Washington Inn has the most extensive wine list in Cape May (I believe upwards of 1000 selections), and a sommelier on staff to assist you in discovering the perfect wine to complement your meal. To me, the drink is equally as important as the food. They work in symbiosis to create a culinary masterpiece.

I also went to the Merion Inn last week and ate in the garden. That was a lot of fun and the ""foodie"" style food was excellent as well. As good as anything I've had outside of a Michelin-starred restaurant, for sure.

Washington Inn Atmosphere: Homey/indoor/cozy

Peter Shields Atmosphere: Connecticut Beach/Sailing

"/u/Abe_Bettik definitely hit the nail on the head, be sure to try things from both lists. To add, the lighthouse closes early, I think 4pm, plan that into your schedule for sure! If the weather is nice and clear, take pride down to sunset beach for the sunset. Cliche, but it is really nice down there. 

Revolution rail was a great time, pricy but worth the ride if you can get a reservation. 

You can also go walking on any busy street and take a big half step into the road to make drivers think you're crossing, then step back and wave them on as they stop. Seems like people love doing that!

"There are a lot of great bars, if that's what you're asking about.

* Harry's has great drinks and a view of the ocean.

* The Rusty Nail has live music, sand, and fire pits going every night.

* Delaney's is an Irish Pub with a friendly atmosphere. 

* The Ugly Mug is a foodie joint with decent beer.

* Congress Hall has several upscale ""upper crust"" style lounges. 

* The Lobster House has a permanently moored boat in the harbor reserved exclusively for drinking. 

* Harpoon on the Bay is up the road a little bit but also offers a ""local"" atmosphere with beach views.

Other than drinking:

* Washington Street pedestrian mall is a must. Great shopping, candy, ice cream. 

* There are a few good antique shops in the area.

* There are many upscale fine dining Restaurants. The Washington Inn and the Merion Inn, and Tishas are some of my favorites. 

* All of the trolley tours are fun, especially the Haunted ones. 

* There is apparently a lot of bird watching activity at the nearby nature reserve. 

* You can climb the nearby lighthouse.

"Like others said, the Channels apartment may have openings, although friends who live there said they had a bit of a wait.

There‚Äôs also Town Bank Manor in North Cape May, but it‚Äôs a bit more run down.

Rio Grande has Meadowlark, which usually has months to a year wait, as well as Green Heron in Cape May Court House, since they‚Äôre the same chain of apartments.

Wildwood is very seasonal, so you may find some long-term rentals, although I‚Äôm not too sure what they have apartment wise.

"Apartments are not plentiful around these parts, in general. A lot of the rentals you're going to see are going to be seasonal rates, overly inflated. It's transfer season for the Coast Guard, a sizeable contingent of the population here, so a decent amount of homes for rent should be freeing up, if you have a family or whatever and can swing that. 

Zillow and the like are not particularly helpful in searching, and you may want to call a local realtor office (like Century 21) to tell you what's coming on the market.

Don't bother looking on Cape May proper, or any of the Wildwoods - Lower and Middle Township are your best bets.

No matter what you get, in the more than 20yrs we‚Äôve been going, we‚Äôve never had a bad experience there...other than finding a place to park and the wait üòÖ

Oh!...and if you get a chance, there‚Äôs a dock behind the restaurant that you can get to by walking straight back from the main doors and to the left.  There‚Äôs a raw bar, some outdoor seats, some other little things, and there‚Äôs also a boat that serves food and has a bar, called The Schooner.

"The bay side is much calmer. Basically no waves or dangerous currents and the water gets deep very gradually. That said, there are no life guards or restrictions on use so you'll have fishing, boating, and swimming all happening in the same waters.

I have heard people say the water is not ""safe"" or ""approved"" for swimming, implying it's dirty because it's fed from the Delaware. NCM is about as close as you can get to technically being oceanfront though. There's no shortage of people who fish and swim all up the bay either. 

The beaches can vary a fair amount block to block (rocky vs sandy) and even throughout the season the tide lines can shift quite a bit from storms. Take note as some beaches have almost zero space at high tide. There can be mucky pockets in tidal areas and in general there's more seaweed/reeds in the water and on the beach. You'll almost for sure have horseshoe crabs in the water and beaches - totally harmless though.",t2_9v869,exotube,0,1619125479.0,0,t1_gvhop0q,gvhop0q,True,micafin,t3_mw6avz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/mw6avz/north_cape_may_swimming/,North Cape May Swimming,/r/CapeMay/comments/mw6avz/north_cape_may_swimming/gvhop0q/,2,r/CapeMay,0,2

"I've never personally swam on the Bay side, but I've walked it, and would have no hesitations doing it should the desire arise.

* The water is much calmer
* The beaches are far less crowded. You may see no one there at all.
* The beaches are much smaller. Distance from grass/rocks to water is anywhere from 10 to 30 feet, instead of 100-300 feet on Cape May southern shore.
* The beaches are a bit rockier/dirtier/greener. You're more likely to see washed up seaweed, growing grass, or step on a sharp shell. You're also more likely to see wildlife. There's two reasons for this: (1) the beaches aren't combed by enormous tractors every night and (2) the lack of strong waves and currents doesn't frequently wash away debris.",t2_mhq4hzk,Abe_Bettik,0,1619110911.0,0,t1_gvgq8n7,gvgq8n7,True,micafin,t3_mw6avz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/mw6avz/north_cape_may_swimming/,North Cape May Swimming,/r/CapeMay/comments/mw6avz/north_cape_may_swimming/gvgq8n7/,2,r/CapeMay,0,2

"This is all new. The landlord came and took almost of their equipment this past Thursday (4/15) they spent the weekend getting what they could.

At the start of covid this new landlord bought the spot and didn‚Äôt want to renew anyone‚Äôs lease, he just increased rent and doubled it. They paid it in full and on time.

They believe the cop that showed up with him multiple times is indeed corrupt. They asked for court orders and paperwork and were never given any. They were never given any official notice or communication on this either, minus the harassment to try and make them leave The landlord finally just came in and stole their gear so they cannot operate at all. It seems to be similar attitude to other small business from the new land lord who is with icona resorts. They couldn‚Äôt outright kick everyone out since it was the start of covid, but clearly to me, they are trying to develop the area into another resort.

They started a lease in 1997 for 10 years with og landlord. The renewed it for another 10 until 2017. After that the landlord was comfortable with them and they let the lease continue year to year. It sold to one landlord and that stayed the same. That landlord then sold to icona resorts who refused to negotiate and discuss anything with them. They were actively trying to stay there and get something on paper with the landlord, beyond just paying all his rent hikes. He stopped communicating with them and started showing up with the cop and taking money from their registers and aggressively harassing them.  
They loved it there and was a major part of their life. Which is sadder is the father who started the pizzeria has now started to succumb to dementia as the business crumbles. 

They are actually now trying to actively move the business to their hometown outside of cape may.",t2_5yrtzkbz,soil_tastes-good,0,1618847251.0,0,t1_gv3daaq,gv3daaq,True,[deleted],t3_mtunut,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/mtunut/louies_pizza_needs_help/,Louie‚Äôs Pizza needs help,/r/CapeMay/comments/mtunut/louies_pizza_needs_help/gv3daaq/,1,r/CapeMay,0,1

"Love this idea for a thread and I bet you get a ton of replies.  There are so many great restaurants in town that I am sure we will all discover some new favorite dishes.  Anyway,  my ""go to"" dishes would be:

1) Favorite entree: Lobster Cobb Salad at Fins.  I have ordered this at least fifty times of the past few years and have never been disappointed.  I love the way the sweet lobster plays off the smoked bacon and grilled corn. Absolutely fantastic.

2) Favorite appetizer/bar food: Panko Fried tomatoes covered with fresh crab salad smothered in remoulade sauce at Oyster Bay.  Best upscale bar menu in town and no other restaurant is close.

3) Favorite breakfast: Tie between the Mad Batter and Saltwater Cafe.

Honorable mention for ""go to"" entree would the Fried Scallops with Red Cabbage Slaw at Mayer's Tavern.  You will find great scallops everywhere in town but the simple presentation and unique setting at Mayers makes it a winner, especially with a glass of white wine on their deck watching the sun set over Spicers Creek.",t2_13pm5p,Wise456,0,1618702033.0,0,t1_guwwiy3,guwwiy3,True,BestSelf2015,t3_mszlrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeMay/comments/mszlrm/the_best_fooddishes_in_cape_may/,The BEST Food/Dishes in Cape May?,/r/CapeMay/comments/mszlrm/the_best_fooddishes_in_cape_may/guwwiy3/,1,r/CapeMay,0,1

"If you are a first time visitor, make sure you spend some time walking down Hughes, Jackson  and Columbia Streets and take in the unique Victorian mansions which date back to the 19th century and are still impeccably maintained. Or better yet, rent a couple of bikes and you can easily cover the entire island.   Bring your camera as there is no other place in New Jersey like it.  Definitely get over to Sunset Beach and the Lighthouse and adjacent state park which has very nice walking trails which run next to the beach.  Make sure you take a quick walk (and maybe a nibble or a quick cocktail) through Congress Hall.   Cape May is a foodie town and there are so many excellent restaurants.  It truly is difficult to get a bad meal other than perhaps at the two tourist traps on the Mall.

"The Washington Inn is definitely highest quality restaurant in Cape May right now. They are also among the most formal.

"At this point in history Cape May was undergoing a renaissance. It was transitioning from a washed up old beach town where people thought its best days were behind it, into the high end destination it is today. The Christian Admiral came down in 1996 and Congress Hall was undergoing its restoration into the premier historic hotel it is today. All in all it wasn't THAT different than it was today. The general feel was very similar, but a bit more rundown. Things were far more seasonal... most businesses didn't operate in the off season at all. Nowadays most businesses operate a skeleton crew in the off season.

* Real estate was MUCH MUCH cheaper.

* Hotels could be found for comparatively low prices, even in the busiest parts of the season 

* Fewer high end specialty shops, more generic beach T-Shirt shops

* Less ""Cape May"" branded merchandise everywhere, more generic beach themed stuff

* Fewer high end restaurants. More pizza parlors. 

* Many more of the Victorian homes in a run down state

* A lot more cheap motels. Several of the big high end specialty motels used to be cheap big box motels before they were bought and rebranded (the Ocean Club was the Atlas) Most of the smaller boutique motels were run-of-the-mill cheap motels (e.g. Beach Shack)

* And of course a movie theater. I remember seeing Star Wars Episode I and Lord of the Rings there when they first released.

"To the Editor:

¬†¬†¬†This first-hand account has been published many times as it illustrates the strength and also the horrors that America faces every single day. The story relates to the response of every school, and all teachers and children, that were facing the New York Harbor that fateful morning. Some of the children in the school had parents and relatives that worked near the World Trade Center. Incredible emotions, among the children and the professional staff, were put aside in an effort to maintain the safety of the entire student body. Immediately, identification procedures for adults had to be employed, to allow children to be removed from the school by a parent or relative, that was on record as a legal guardian. ¬†¬†

**THERE WAS NO ESCAPE!**

**J. K. Aumack**

On the morning of 9/11, like so many other mornings, I entered school about 7:30 a.m., the weather was exceptionally bright and cool. I distinctly remember the beautifully clear, cloudless sky over New York harbor. It was a magnificent sight. I was a Basic Skills teacher assigned to P.S. 41 on Ocean and Wilkerson Avenue in Jersey City. P.S. 41 is at the top of Liberty State Park on Ocean Avenue. It has an outstanding view of the lower New York Bay and of course, at that time, the Twin Towers. From the northwest corner of the building, you could almost reach out and touch the towers and Battery Park. It seemed that close. As was my custom, after completing my last-minute prep for what I had planned that day, I went back to the first floor to a small room where the speech teacher had a pot of coffee and a small TV that was always on for the morning news reports.

**Then It Happened!**

As I walked into the room the speech teacher told me that a plane just hit the World Trade buildings. ‚ÄúWas it a small private plane?‚Äù Thinking perhaps, a pilot‚Äôs heart attack. ‚ÄúNo! It seems to be a commercial liner,‚Äù she answered. How could this happen? Then I realized that this, in all likelihood, was not an accident.

My wife is a registered nurse and was on her way to work when this happened. I called her at the adult day care center where she worked and she told me that they already had been instructed not to expect to leave work at the end of their shift, in the expectation of hundreds of injured. All medical personnel in every hospital as far away as New England were ordered to stand by for the expected injured. This expectation was never realized. There were no injured ‚Äî only the dead.

On the third floor of the school building, teachers were standing outside their classrooms with tears streaming¬†down their faces. These were the people who were really tough, who faced down every¬†problem¬†the inner city had to offer. We could see what was happening, we knew that there were people dying. We could see, what we knew in our hearts, were humans who had to make the most horrible choice of burning to death slowly or jumping to their death. There was no escape. They were very small black dots falling from the burning building. Then the second plane hit.

The first building was burning profusely and most of us realized it couldn‚Äôt last much longer. We watched it come down and individually and as a group, we prayed for those who we knew were dying or trapped in the rubble and likely would face a lingering death. There was nothing we could do but pray for them.

Our students in the classrooms were also suffering. They knew from our reaction, as much as we tried to hide it, that something horrible and beyond belief was happening. Some of those kids had parents that worked downtown. Some of them worked in the World Trade buildings.

Very soon, Air National Guard jets were flying over the school heading across the harbor. They were flying over the city in expectation of another plane flying into what was left of the trade center or other buildings. You could see the missiles on their wings and I had every expectation that they also were carrying a full load of ammunition for machine guns. Understanding that an accident had recently occurred in a practice gun run in South Jersey where an elementary school near a bombing range was¬†totally¬†shot-up and almost totally destroyed, during a overrun in gunning practice, I suggested that we move all the students from the third floor to the first floor. We were that close to the harbor. This¬†suggestion was denied because a assistant superintendent didn‚Äôt think it was necessary.¬†Considering what just had happened, I thought it was prudent to do this but was over-ruled.

**The Immediate Aftermath!**

All schools have procedures for these types of situations. In this case, very soon, people were coming into the school in droves to pick up their children because there was extreme fear and panic among the adults in the community. This in itself caused many problems.¬†The entire community was terrified!

Every child is supposed to bring home and return to school a form that establishes who can legally take the child from the school building in an emergency. It also should be changed if the people identified are changed. This form is kept on file and consulted in an emergency. We will only release a child to a person with proper identification who is named on the list. There is no other way to get a child out of the building in an emergency. The only two male teachers in this elementary school 

building were assigned to guard the school office and to only let into the office those who had proper identification. As you might imagine, this was not a popular and fun assignment, but we both made it through the day.

I will remember this day as one of the most horrendous days in my teaching career. I find it hard to believe that I watched 3,000 Americans killed before my eyes.

Over the next three days, my wife and I sat in the Hudson County Park on the Newark Bay in the evening and simply looked around us. We lived in Bayonne at the time and were very near the New Jersey Turnpike, the Newark Airport, numerous boat, train, bus and truck routes. We had become accustomed to the noises of daily life. When the common noise isn‚Äôt there, the sounds of silence are very, very loud and upsetting. Everything was closed, stopped or shut down. Nothing moved ... there was no traffic by car, boat, train or plane. The Turnpike bridge across the Newark Bay was empty. There was no movement at all.

In the months that followed, my wife and I, as a custom, would go for a walk in the evening. We liked to walk in the park by the Kill Van Kull near the Bayonne Bridge. Here we saw the barges that carried the rubble from the towers to a remote and protected site on Staten Island, where it was sorted to find body parts and personal identification.

The sadness continues to this day, and will never leave. Even thinking about it, I mist as I try to hold back the tears and control my anger. ... God has blessed America and I hope He or She will continue to do so.

I don't care what your political affiliation is, I wouldn't go there. 

You shouldn't support a bar that kicks someone out with a MAGA hat, you shouldn't support a bar that kicks someone out for voting Biden.

We really need to stand against -anyone- who would divide us among political lines. I honestly believe that's the biggest problem in America today: the extremism and the fact that EVERYTHING becomes political, even a goddamn virus.
