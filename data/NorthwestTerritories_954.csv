"That kool-aid must have tasted great, eh?  Drinking in all the stuff you want to hear while claiming everything that might counter your position is lies and propaganda?   
  
They weren't protesters. They were insurrectionists occupying our capital city. One of their demands was that the current government to be dissolved and then the insurrectionists would be welcomed in as an equal partner in running Canada. Fuck that.   
  
Do they stand with fascist symbols/flags? Yes they do. Here's the Wikipedia link. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\_convoy\_protest#Extremist\_group\_links   
To clarify, the fascists are the ones that think they are qualified to run the country with no one electing them into the position.  Is Antifa the enemy?   Think about that.  IF anti-fascists are your enemy... that must mean you are a fascist.   
  
Our PM turned Canada into a dictatorship?  During a global pandemic people that enjoyed the freedom to be willfully ignorant have dragged the need for masks much longer than it had to be.   Being vaccinated was the quick way out of restrictions.   There was an election mid -pandemic and he was re-elected. That's not very dictator like.  But claiming he is a dictator certainly gives you a righteous lil' hill to stand on. You're wrong.  But damn, it must feel good on that hill, hair blowing in the breeze, looking around at the others on their tiny little hills. You've found your people.   
  
I think I saw most of a semi-load of food donated to the event. Insurrectionists have to sustain themselves. No one seemed to question who paid for the food.  There was lots of food there while they occupied the streets and made assholes of themselves. There were lots of white bullies being belligerent to the local population en masse. There are lots of reports of unmasked bullies threatening waitstaff because of the requirement to wear a mask for 2 or 3 minutes while the got food from a restaurant. Like a normal participant in a civil society. If you dispute that you're being willfully ignorant.    
  
Fox News is your source of reason?  The same channel that is claiming Putin is good to go in the Ukraine?  The channel that idolized Trump? The soon to be jailed, orange shithead that told over 30,000 lies during his time in office?  30, 000 lies! Yeah, that seems to be a reliable source.  Do yourself a favour and check out this link https://adfontesmedia.com/the-chart-version-3-0-what-exactly-are-we-reading/   Its kind of science based, they show how they do measurements.   But science may not be a strong suit for you.   Tucker will tell you how to think.   
  
But of course none of this will change any point of view you have.    I'm not sure why I spent time to respond.  The small number of people that subscribe to the insurrection-is-good train of thought are not who I think of as Canadian.  They have been co-opted by their own media streams that make money off fear and division.   The hate based echo chamber is deep, damn near endless. Media companies make money off hate.  It's is a constant fight to keep their disinformation from becoming loud enough to hear.  Internet based chat rooms have allowed village idiots to find other village idiots and when enough of them gather together they think what they're spewing out of their pie-hole is worth listening to.  But they're still idiots.  Their rhetoric makes no sense.  I keep thinking... if this was the dictatorship they claim it was, they all be shot by now.

They went on at 10:30 at night so they likely thought kids would be gone but I know a few parents that promptly gathered kids and left. Midnight sun, middle of the summer, bedtimes go out the window. People that stayed fucking loved it though. Seriously good. We were listening to this in the truck all summer. Couple EPS out and working on an album.

"We spend about $400/person/month on groceries, but that can go up to $600/person depending on time of year and how fancy and varied we want our diet to be. It depends a lot on how you shop/cook. You can expect a lot of things to be at least 50% more than you'll pay in Calgary and the availability to be way lower.

Utilities depend very much on where you're living and how you heat it. A bunch of people switched to natural gas a while back but then a [major well got contaminated](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/fuel-solution-has-inuvik-residents-struggling-to-pay-bills-1.2500833) and people had to switch to imported synthetic gas instead.

I live in an apartment and don't pay for heat or water, just power. It's about $150/month most months. I know people who pay $1k/month to heat their stand-alone house in the winter and that's just to get it to 16 degrees or so.

"The NWT Crime severity index for 2020 was 414, the Violent Crime Severity Index was 517. Small communities aren't given a CSI rating. 

Inuvik's CSI was 367 in 2017 and increased to 642 in 2020, and has seen a significant increase in violent crime severity index from 389 in 2017 to 968 in 2020. 

Tuktoyaktuk has a CSI of 842 with a VCSI of 1346

Fort Smith has a CSI of 243 with a VCSI of 331

Hay River has a CSI of 317 with a VCSI of 375

Behchoko has a CSI of 1016 with a VCSI of 1060

Yellowknife has a CSI of 266 with a VCSI of 299

In short, highest crime rate is Behchoko, Highest violent crime rate is Tuktoyaktuk. Inuvik is middle of the road, but has seen significant increases in the last few years.

Note: Crime rates are misleading due to the small populations in the NWT. For example, in 2020 there were only 634 violent crimes in Inuvik, but that equates to a crime rate of 18,959 because the population is far below 100,000.",t2_3yfeuxnj,Lumie102,0,1637908604.0,0,t1_hm4mb8w,hm4mb8w,True,[deleted],t3_r2fks7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NWT/comments/r2fks7/crime_rates/,Crime rates,/r/NWT/comments/r2fks7/crime_rates/hm4mb8w/,4,r/NWT,0,4

They say the real issue is staff keep leaving because the unit is inadequately managed, placing staff in dangerous and stressful situations.“I’ve been in the most terrifying situations of my life there,” said one person, referred to as Worker 1 in this article.Cabin Radio spoke with three current and former employees who have significant, recent, and verified experience of working at Stanton’s obstetrics unit. Their names and any identifying information are not being used as they fear reprisals or the loss of their jobs if managers are able to work out who they are.

"So the process is that you applied, the asked for references, they will check your references and if you are the successful candidate they will let you know you are the successful candidate.  

Once that happens (usually late Friday afternoon think 1645) they then have to inform all applicants in the process who will then have 5 days to file an appeal.  If they can reach everyone they 5 business days (weekends don’t count) and usually starts on the day all have been informed.  

If an appeal does get registered they appeal goes to an adjudicator who will review all materials from the competition and will rule on the appeal.  I have appealed many competitions in 20 years and have had none upheld.  Most appeals can take between 1 and 3 weeks or more to be resolved.  In order to get the competition redone the committee has to have made a “procedural error”.  

Once that is done they will contact you if you are the successful applicant and make a verbal offer to you.  This will include suggested rate of pay (usually step 1 of whatever pay grade your position reflects) and they will also look at a start date for you and any relocation allowance you may have available to you.

Asking for references is a good thing, but you still have some time to eat through the process.  If you have questions I would suggest asking the HR Officer handling the competition.  They can share the process and timelines with you, they cannot advise if an appeal has been filed.

Check with your references to see if they have been contacted.  That usually a good indicator.

"My point is that political parties do what benefits them. Electoral reform does not benefit the liberals so why would you expect them to follow through on that promise.

The only reason to want electoral reform is to increase the chances of the party you support to get elected.

Electoral reform only benefits the NDP, Greens, PPC who, nationally, poll better than the seats they end up with due to FPTP

If you voted for the liberals for electoral reform, you either are voting for someone else than the party you support to help the party you support get elected (in this case why not just vote NDP and they will do reform) or you don’t support the three parties I mentioned and then you just don’t understand the point of electoral reform.

If you see people working on the ground, make sure they know you are there. They will probably send you cookies from the kitchen and have their safety person visit and mark your campsite on GPS so everyone avoids it. 

If you have a programmable radio, throw on the common channels (LAD1-4) and turn it on if you're driving back roads.

"Temperature wise, it does get unimaginably cold. I remember writing to a friend how on the coldest days everything becomes crispy, the tires crunch on the ice/snow; the air is so sharp it almost hurts to breath with your mouth uncovered.

To cope with the cold, and the short days, I find the best option is to find stuff to do, keep active. There’s nothing wrong with cooping inside watching a film, but if it’s all you do, that’s an awfully long winter. Lakes freeze, so there are skating rinks all over the place, you can snowmobile virtually anywhere, you can snowshoe ir hike to places that are limited during summer, get ice fishing, set up a tent and cook outside for the day…

COVID wise, the territorial government basically quarantined the whole territory. Everyone entering needs an isolation plan and must have a valid reason to cross the border (resident, family, essential worker). So tourism has been squashed for over a year. Now that vaccination rates have increased all over the country, some restrictions were lowered. All things considered, we’ve been well protected and saw fewer restrictions when compared to other provinces because of the isolation.",t2_12bta3nd,Angel_FS,0,1626359713.0,0,t1_h5a2m17,h5a2m17,False,[deleted],t3_okhow3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NWT/comments/okhow3/just_an_american_wanting_to_learn_more/,Just an American wanting to learn more!,/r/NWT/comments/okhow3/just_an_american_wanting_to_learn_more/h5a2m17/,2,r/NWT,0,2
"I love in a big city in Southern Alberta.  I have been to the ""mid west"" though I don't really understand that saying.  It seems to apply to anything that doesn't touch the ocean or the southern belt.

  The average person in my city knows very little about the territories north of them outside of the names of capitals and whatever else was mentioned in elementary. I wasn't much different.  I just knew there wasn't a high population, it was cold and it was far.

Recently I traveled to nwt and Yukon for work.  NWT was pre covid so I had some time to dive into the culture of Yellowknife.  I definitely enjoyed my time there.  Culturally it is not comparable to the provinces south of it.   I think Living there would bring on a little bit of unique challenges but there are some very neat perks too.  People are very friendly and welcoming.  It was somewhere between cold and very fucking cold and everyone was out, walking around and full of smiles.  Yellowknife relies on tourism.  No different than living in Banff,   the transient population would bother me. Some of the (other) tourists seemed anywhere from  absurd to obnoxious to me.  


I also got to spend some time in the northern communities. These are first nations and Inuit if you head north enough.  Their history and current situation is truely badass and  amazing - the rest of the country does not know enough of their truth.  I went as far up as Tuk via the ice road after flying into aklavik.  As someone who didn't know much about ice roads, I got stuck.   Twice.   And twice some kind passer-byers helped me out. A man I had just met gifted me a shitload of caribou and moose meat.  He wanted to give me more but I didn't have the means to bring it home. I flew into communities that had no land access.

The areas are beautiful. Old trees look nothing like I was used to seeing due to a sliver of a growing season. Most of the space is incredibly wild.  The northern lights are everything you dreamed they would be.

Yukon was a bit different because I had to isolate from people.  Everything was closed and I could get no sense of what Whitehorse was like.   I CAN say that Yukon is rediculously beautiful if your into a massive range of landscapes.  Like, oh- my -god everything is just better. I went to old Crow.  The moose up.there are a different breed.   They are so big that I can't understand it.

I imagine Alaska will have the same topography as Yukon.  From what I hear, most of Alaska is protected land. Most of what I know of Alaska is from shows like meat eater.
The caribou and moose are the same ones in the Yukon.  They don't respect our political borders whatsoever!

From random reality tv shows it seems the Aboriginals are the same tribes.  Gwichʼin or one of its variations that I don't fully understand.  The Americans there seem, well maybe I shouldn't say.  It is afterall from tv, normal people make boring tv.

If you have the opportunity to check it out, do it!  It's costly but not comparable to the lower states. Driving would be crazy cool. But would take the right vehicle a lot of planning and time.",t2_k16zm,J3rry27,0,1626331350.0,0,t1_h58xj21,h58xj21,True,[deleted],t3_okhow3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NWT/comments/okhow3/just_an_american_wanting_to_learn_more/,Just an American wanting to learn more!,/r/NWT/comments/okhow3/just_an_american_wanting_to_learn_more/h58xj21/,3,r/NWT,0,3
"Lot to unravel there, but short version: I live in Yellowknife, been to all three territories, but can’t say know much about them. The people that live and thrive in the North are some of the most amazing people I’ve had the pleasure to meet and work with.

Climate varies from location, but Yellowknife has short but hot summers (25°C to 30°C tops) and some cold winters (last year it dropped to -53°C without wind chill). However, on average, -25°C is perfect to go snowmobiling, and spend time outside.

I’d say the biggest change is the shorter days in winter (around 4 hours of daylight per day) and looong days in summer (virtually no night during summer)

"Weather is a little colder than down south in the winter.  Summers are warm, but somewhat short.  Fall can be a bit rainy.  Bugs can be bad in the spring and summer.

In town, there's a 3-hole golf course, the Legion, a couple of museums, a really nice park and walking trail system (at least for a town of its size).  This is all currently closed to rotational staff due to covid restrictions, but will open back up at some point.

Outside town, there's Jackfish Lake (which is also currently close to rotators) and hiking in the Franklin Mountains.  There's Grayling to be caught in Bosworth and Canyon Creeks.  Fossil Canyon is full of fossils.  

Imperial Oil started running a charter service during Covid and it sounds like they'll continue to do that.  Previously, we flew commercial on Canadian North.

"Expanding with links on what others have said - the two public school boards in Yellowknife (one is denominational, the other is not) have excellent French Immersion programming.

Yellowknife Catholic Schools (YCS) has their elementary immersion programming at [Ecole St. Joseph School](https://www.esjs.nt.ca/).

Yellowknife Education District No. 1 (YK1) has their elementary immersion programming at [Ecole J.H. Sissons School](https://jhs.yk1.nt.ca/). To complicate things a bit, J.H. Sissons (JHS) has been torn down and a [new schools is currently under construction](https://www.yk1.nt.ca/JHS%20Renewal%20Planning%20Study.php) I believe planned to be open for the 2022-2023 school year. For the time being the JHS students and staff are being housed at [Ecole William McDonald Middle School](https://wms.yk1.nt.ca/) (WMS) and in new portables next to WMS. They're functioning as an independent school with their own office, admin, etc. while sharing resources/facilities where appropriate. This sharing started this year - JHS students/staff moved out at the end of the 2020-2021 school year/during the pandemic when learning was all remote. All schools in Yellowknife are back in session, though with individual COVID plans/restrictions.

The one big difference in Yellowknife's schools compared to those in the south is that Yellowknife has no specific catchment areas for schools. A child can enroll in whichever school they want - they don't need to live close by. I've got a friend who lives in Toronto whose daughter wanted to go into Immersion and I was stunned to hear that the school does a lottery, so just because you want to do immersion doesn't mean you get to. That's not the case in Yellowknife.

Both YCS and YK1 are excellent. YK1 is about double the student population to YCS. YCS has three schools total, YK1 has six total.

There's also a French first language school option - [Ecole Allain St-Cyr](https://www.csftno.com/nos-ecoles?lang=en) operated by Commission Scolaire Francophone Territoires du Nord Ouest (CSFTNO). CSFTNO has one other school in the NWT, Ecole Boreale in Hay River.

In case it provides some peace of mind for your student's family, all 18+ NWT residents are now eligible for the COVID vaccine. The teachers that I know have all been vaccinated and are in line for their second dose anytime now. When the family arrives in Yellowknife, anticipating restrictions don't change anytime soon, they will need to isolate for 14 days. Some employers are paying for the 14-day hotel stay for new employees arriving in the NWT. Our Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) has let it be known that come late April/early May that COVID restrictions within the NWT will be eased, but the 14-day self isolation will remain in place for everyone entering the territory until infection rates in the south decrease/vaccination rates in south increase. The CPHO has made it clear that because the vaccine is still not available for those under 18 years of age, that the school COVID capacity/restrictions will remain in place.",t2_38bow,RambleMan,0,1617675536.0,0,t1_gtixs9s,gtixs9s,True,Musoyamma,t3_mkstlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NWT/comments/mkstlu/french_immersion_schools_in_yellowknife_any/,French Immersion Schools in Yellowknife - any information?,/r/NWT/comments/mkstlu/french_immersion_schools_in_yellowknife_any/gtixs9s/,3,r/NWT,0,3

"Hey there! I did K-12 in Yellowknife (all in french immersion), graduated in 2015, and now I live in Ottawa. I'd be happy to answer provide some info!

Yellowknife has two school boards: the public school board (YK1) and Catholic school board (YCS). I only attended Catholic schools, but I was not Catholic, and neither were the majority of my peers. Both school boards offer robust French Immersion streams.

At YK1, all French immersion students attend École J.H. Sissons (Yellowknife's only all-French-Immersion school ) for K-5, École William McDonald Middle School for grades 6-8, and École Sir John Franklin High School for grades 9-12.

At YCS, a french immersion student would attend École St. Joseph's School for grades K-7, and then move to St. Patrick High School for grades 8-12.

While I can't speak to the public school system, I only have good things to say about the Catholic schools I attended. Despite being far from French-speaking Canada, I had great French Immersion teachers (quite a few young teachers fresh out of university), and I was well prepared to take university courses in French at the University of Ottawa post-graduation.

"Interesting it says there is almost no support for North South corridors. I can't imagine why.

Take the Mackenzie Valley for example. The road (Highway) is clearly still in the works. Bear River bridge appears to be a go ahead. There is a ton of oil and gas up the Mackenzie Valley and mining opportunities and basically nothing else. Which suggests it's worth it to build the road on the basis of oil gas and mining alone. And it's been under construction for like 60 years.

"The roads are clear (when there is no snow) and it's a neat place to visit.  There are paved roads (novel for you simpsonites!) and people from Res, Smith, and Hay River camp there.  There are also core samples which are cool to look at and play with.  It's like the town was air lifted out.  In reality the buildings were packed up and sold (many went to fort smith).  Fort simpson was offered the artificial ice package for a buck, but declined and I think it went to the wells?  Anyway, that was something simpsonites complain about still :)

&#x200B;

As far as other places to visit:

Little buffalo river is nice, so is Smith if you haven't been there yet.  I'd suggest the waterfalls route camping (sambaa deh, kakisa, then the falls around hay bush) then down to smith.

And, you can technically leave the NWT at fort smith to alberta without having to quarantine (they give you day passess to cross the border to Alberta).

"This is a bit late, but hopefully it’s helpful; I live in one of the towns necessary to pass through to get to inuvik (Fort Simpson) and is say it would be very hard, but wouldn’t destroy your car, especially if it’s semi new. The roads are mostly gravel after Fort Providence so the flying rocks might cause some damage, but I’ve seen little cars from the early 2000s make similar drives without immediate damage (the repeated travel is usually what causes the damage). Though the roads are narrow and it’s not hard to get sucked into the ditch or lose control, try and stay under 100/90 (most trucks go about 120-140 in my experience, but we can also be reckless) and try and stay towards the middle unless you’re in the elbow or see a car coming/passing. I’d suggest taking the truck just to be safe, but if you’re a safe driver you should be fine. Avoid days that are too dry or too rainy, as previously mentioned, because days that are too dry will cause the rocks to fly, and potholes form after heavy rain which often takes 1 or 2 days to fill in. Also, if your car has 4x4, use that to drive on the gravel road. 

We should be entering phase 3 of lockdown by mid-may, so hopefully you can come by june or july. Tourism is one of our main sources of income, and we’d love to have you if you’re able to come. You should also check out Sambaa Deh falls, and the nahanni national park (entered through my town). Stay safe and good luck with your travels:) 

Edit: also, we have 24/hr sunlight in june, so i would suggest coming in late july or august instead; you’d be able to see the northern lights, it’s not as humid at that time, and hopefully by then the pandemic is settled down and it won’t be as risky for you to travel.",t2_6jkcntkt,SuchDevelopment2,0,1617002134.0,0,t1_gsnwryk,gsnwryk,True,Flaccidnuggets,t3_lwl3uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NWT/comments/lwl3uh/driving_to_inuvik_in_the_summer/,Driving to Inuvik in the summer.,/r/NWT/comments/lwl3uh/driving_to_inuvik_in_the_summer/gsnwryk/,1,r/NWT,0,1

">If they aren't even willing to acknowledge there's a problem, no solution will be found.

Just because you haven't received a response doesn't mean MLAs won't acknowledge that there is a problem. This is constantly being brought up in the house, by both regular MLAs and Cabinet. The standing Committee on Social Development has put affordable housing as their number 1 priority for this Assembly.

The problem is much bigger than an Email back saying ""We'll get right on it!"". Housing prices are based on market demand. MLAs have little control over this. If you're looking to stay in Government Subsidized housing then you might be in luck, but it doesn't sound like that's your situation.

The bottom line is we live in a place that is expensive to live, no amount of online petitions will fundamentally change this.

2.	It can also be quite a stressful job. There are many examples of PTSD and suicides among police and other first responders. If you’re in a small Northern detachment, you’re on call 24/7.

"No, you're not necessarily more likely to get a job with the mine being local (in the Nwt, anyway). Probably more than half of the employees live remotely and the mine flies them in for their shifts; right now there are flights from two or three centres in lower Canada (and of course one from Yellowknife). You have to get yourself to one of those locations for the flight in, when covid isn't a thing, as far as I understand. (Right now I think they fly you the extra leg to that Central flight location as well). 

That said, if you're struggling to find employment online with the mines, are you looking on the general online boards or in the specific mining company sites? Not all of them advertise with those amalgamation job boards. Also, for any other Northern job in a Northern city.... It's hard to find staff here in the North. Bring a warm body definitely gives you a leg up. If you're flexible on the type of job, you could definitely find something else for work while you work on getting the mining job.",t2_5x4oo,alltogethernow7,0,1611324512.0,0,t1_gk6dobb,gk6dobb,True,[deleted],t3_l2j6kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NWT/comments/l2j6kd/far_north_mining_work/,Far north mining work,/r/NWT/comments/l2j6kd/far_north_mining_work/gk6dobb/,2,r/NWT,0,2
"hey!! 
neither of the diamond mines are hiring right now due to covid. 
in the past few weeks, some people i know finally were able to go back to work after being laid off since march/april. 

oil and gas is pretty quiet around here also. 

you wouldn’t be able to come to the N’Dub unless you isolated for 2 weeks in one of the ‘hubs’ which is Fort Smith, Hay River, Yellowknife and Inuvik. 

you’d have to submit an isoplan to the office of the cpho of where you’d isolate. whether it be in a hotel or a personal residence. if you do personal, then anyone in the household has to isolate for 14 days also. 

travel in and out of the territory is pretty strict right now. no one can come in unless they are essential workers or someone returning from medical appts or students coming home from school. 

even for us for in territory travel, it can be difficult. some towns are closed for business and won’t let anyone who doesn’t live in the town won’t be able to go in. 

Nunavut has almost mirrored the N’Dub for covid safety. 

i’d say, make phone calls instead of trying to come up. you’ll just waste money to be told to go home.  

also, what do you mean ‘experience Canada as those of old did’. 
does matter where you go in Canada, it’s almost all the same across the board.

just a heads up....

"Hello! For context, I'm a woman in my 20's living in Hay River. I'm born and raised here, and I used to walk 20 minutes to and from school every day, through a rougher neighbourhood. I can honestly say I have always felt safe here, but it is very important to watch who you hang out with. Almost all the violent crime in town is related to the hardcore party and drug scene. Generally, if you stay away from such hard-living, you'll be just fine. The other issue is that there will sometimes be a string of car break-ins, but those are usually caught very quickly. I hate to say this because I love my home territory, but every community up here has a crime right above the national average, and unfortunately HR is no exception. However, overall folks here are incredibly nice and will always help out if you need a hand.

"Fort Smith is the banana belt of the NWT. High government wages and relatively low cost of living. The hardest thing is finding a place to live.

When I moved here from Southern Alberta 15 years ago, I actually started to save money as the wage increase far outweighed the increase in costs. Though part of that savings was raised from spending less time in the bar and more time enjoying nature.

"You keep bringing these thoughtful responses, and I keep appreciating it entirely.

I end up booked solid from mid April through mid October, so realistically Late March 2022 would be my best, next opportunity to go (I'd be shocked if things are open at all in 2021).  I want to get out to the arctic ocean and I don't really care much where exactly I go for that (I heard Tuk was the most reasonable place to do this, but I don't know shit.)  

Right now the trip is pretty amorphous, I just wanna experience some tundra, piss off the edge of the world, and maybe see Denali and/or Gates of the Arctic national park.  Maybe that's all too different/far apart to reasonably try to do, but I've got a year and a half to figure it out.

One way or another, your advice on the roads up there is super valuable, and whenever I can make that trip, I'll be grateful for your advice.  

It seems to me that the extreme cold would be likely to destroy some of the old rubber parts of my engine, and maybe fatigue the copper wires.

"So if that dude encountered Bison, then he's coming out of Yellowknife, maybe one of the Tlicho communities...but either way...This is a paved highway with communities every hour or two.  Totally different than road to Inuvik/Tuk. Most importantly our highway doesn't go through the Yukon, so you know it's plowed and mostly maintained unlike YTG's shit treatment of the Dempster.  

Once you're past Behchoko its a fantastic, easy drive - smooth roads without much in the way of bumps or rolling pavement, lots to look at, interesting places to get out every hour and a half, 6 hours goes pretty quick and it's next stop alberta time. The part before that isn't bad by any means, road just rolls a lot and you can bottom out pretty easy, even going old man speed. And I'm no fan of Alberta driving (ugh), but that part of the drive is pretty easy and enjoyable til you get round Grimshaw, then you're back in the south. 

Honestly, coming through the 'busy' part of the south NWT only way you should get in real trouble is super bad luck (eg you hit something) or you're travelling without looking at the weather.  There's lots of people on the road (gotta be 500 plus vehicles a day), most of whom will stop if you're in trouble. There's a tow truck either a hundred (or so) km in front of you or behind you to get you to a City. 

However, to say one fun thing about the Yukon (ugh), if you need a tow here, the truck driver is not going to be the model for the local beer, like the dude who picked us up one time on the Klondike Highway (the mechanic who serviced the aforementioned shit topaz had failed to re-attached the negative terminal on the battery, so every little bump and roll killed the power). I see Yukon Breweries have redone the labels to some new effort at hip labels so they sell in the south, but I told the driver he sure looked familiar...and before long we established that he guy on the label. Gave us signed coasters as $250 momentos. I guess I drank a lot of Yukon gold and Chilkoot back then. I will say, the brewery tour was really fun. I was the only one on it and on the way out I met some NWT turncoats who had moved there which was fun too. 

Anyhow. But as with the places along the dempster, you may have to pay to get yourself on the move again - supply and demand pricing may even be worse (I've never been jammed up down here) than the dempster because there they know that its bend you over pricing and there's some modesty about it.

Overall, southern NWT is great. You'll almost certainly see herds bison between Provi and Behchoko. Last time south I saw a couple moose and a bear for kicks. If you did the drive right now, the trees are turning, first waves of geese went south a couple weeks ago, eagles are still around, ducks mostly gone. No bugs. Early fall is a great season (we have at least 8 seasons) to come, but not as good as late spring (before the ice goes, but the sun is warm - for reference, early summer is warm sun, no ice). 

Your van would do fine round here. But, if the Arctic Circle is your thing, you gotta go Dempster. You'd do fine on that in the summer, probably in the winter too. Hope you do come.

I have a friend who drove up there in the summer on a big dirt bike. Two different bikes travelled together and it took them a few days. He won't do it again. As for your van I would say summer it might work but I would never trust it in the winter. You do know that -40 is common? I've been in the Arctic at -55 and in those temperatures you can easily die in a few hours if you go off the road and no one sees it happen.

"Dempster is great drive. You don't need to be mega prepared, but having spare(s) is a must, and a shovel and a sleeping bag in the winter is cheap insurance. 

Worst I ever had it was when we were going back north and there was an avalanche at about 200km up the road - waited in the cold (-40 for both US and Cdn) and dark for something like 10 hours for YTG to clear the road. Started the car every half hour. It was Jan 1st and the boys just decided it was too hard and left us to turn around and go back to dawson (they didn't clear it the next day either and Dawson is a *very* small place in winter with nothing open for food).

Really, as long as you're not dumb, you'll be fine. Be prepared to pay your way out of trouble - tow trucks exist, but supply and demand is a bitch. Eagle plains (the gas station/hotel halfway up the road) can be a mighty fine place, but at a price...a price you'll pay because either you need it or you don't.  

You ask about knowing when not to go - just look outside and check if the road is open. If it is, you're good. If it isn't or it was closed yesterday - then don't go anywhere. Try to get through the Yukon NWT border during the best part of the day as that's usually the hairiest part of the drive. If winter, know that the NWT crews clear it way better. 

Knowing when not to go depends a lot on what vehicle you got. Like I said - I did it in a piece of crap topaz, crossing the ice bridge on the last week (It's melting and muddy on the approaches) - with water up to the floor...probably shouldn't have done that. But in a f150 that would have been nothing. 

Bought an Outback after the topaz and it was pretty easy breezy after that. Got stuck once when I was leaving town on my way south. On that I probably should have waited a day as they'd just reopened the road - but was ready to GTFO out of Inuvik at that point. Yukon highways had only plowed one lane, then when I pulled to one side to let the grater go by the snow and the ditch just kind of sucked me in. Even then I got pulled out before too long (not by Yukon Govt obvs who saw me go in the ditch, had chains hanging on the back of his grater, but refused to help). I'd been stuck once before after a bit of a sitch, but we dug ourselves out, in the end it was pain in the ass more than serious business and lots of folks offered to lend a hand (there were 4 of us to dig) 

In short, be prepared but its not the dakar rally or anything - you're not on your own out there. They bring porches with no ground clearance up every year to get cold weather testing in. If they can do it, it's not that hard.

"You're absolutely right about the Covid stuff, I edited my post to reflect that.  I won't be anywhere near Canada this year now that I think about it for more than 3 seconds, and next year looks like a 50/50 shot as far as I'm concerned.  

That being said, I still want to experience the Arctic, so I'm grateful for the rest of your answer.  

I'm comfortable with all the challenges you listed, but I'm thinking my van isn't the best vehicle for this kind of trip, she belongs on highways, not on the kinds of roads you're describing.  I think I'd need to find myself in a newish 4x4 truck with some off-road preparation.

That's exactly why I ask, I don't want to end up as a burden to someone else because I'm some dumbass who doesn't understand the situation he's trying to trot into.

"These roads are not maintained, paved highways. They are rough, muddy, icy, rocky, gravel & dirt roads. People do the trip in normal vehicles, even motorcycles but typically in the summer only. As someone else pointed out, spare everything including tires, sat phone would be a good idea, possibly CB or other radios to communicate with others on the road. Gas stations are few and far between, if you do break down expect thousands of dollars to get someone to come and help you or to tow you back somewhere. I would also never do this trip solo. The risk is too high.

There is tons of wildlife around, in the winter it will be dark 24/7 or at least for the majority of the day depending on when you go.

Due to Covid, you won't be allowed travel in Canada for leisure and the way that the territories are handling the situation I don't see this going away within the next 12 months or more.

"Not to put a damper on your trip, but this winter probably isn't the right time. With Covid happening, the borders are closed to most people who aren't NWT residents.

Once you're through isolation, I would still be worried about travelling to the smaller communities unnecessarily.  Many don't have adequate health care facilities to deal with an outbreak.  Couple with a generally older population, and it's a pretty big risk.

I'm trying to figure out if it's an absurd idea to have at all, or if it's not *that* crazy, and no reason a careful person couldn't do it.

My van is currently in solid condition, but I don't know how at-home she is in literal tundra.   I did some very thorough maintenance on it this Spring (New Trans, refreshed suspension, new tires, alternator, water pump, fan, belt, various sensors, glow plugs battery), but there's only so much trust you can have in old hoses and wires with 280k miles worth of heat cycles and abuse.  Would you even consider the trip without a 4x4 pickup truck?  My Sprinter is virtually an RV.

My favorite regions I go to regularly are the Dehcho, Sahtu, Gwitch'in Regions.

Expect to be camping rather than hotels in a lot of these regions as the cost for a room in these areas is usually 200-300 per night per person.

If you want to go hunting or fishing, contact the proper authority to get the licenses. But also make sure to respect the locals and thier customs if you are going to be harvesting on their traditional lands or near by. Just because you're allowed to doesn't mean there won't be consequences to what the locals might consider trespassing. So, do your research for the region you're going to visit.

"If all you want to do is drive to Tuk and then turn around, this is theoretically possible to do while maintaining self-isolation (isolating in Inuvik for a day on your way there and back, then leaving the territory).

"So just to be upfront, I'm saying all of the following with kindness and the belief that you're coming from a good place. 

The NWT/Arctic has always, always had people coming up from the South looking to fix our problems or tell us how to do things better. They often forget that we've been doing things our way up here for a long time, and it's not likely to change without good reason and community buy-in.

Any project being initiated in the NWT by a Southerner must be delivered in true partnership with local services. Whatever it is that you want to do, there is likely already somebody up here doing it. That doesn't mean you can't help, it just means you need to know that you won't be the expert on it, and you'll have to listen to see how the community wants the project to work. I don't recommend that you do much planning until you've created some foundational relationships with Indigenous Northern governments or groups that are willing to work with you and make sure the project is well-approached. 

Research current projects in the NWT and reach out to those groups. Keep in mind that many Northern organizations choose to not partner with non-Indigenous or Southern groups (for many reasons), and the group you want to work with may not be willing. Be flexible and willing to learn and take all of your cues from NWTers, and position yourself as a support and potential resource instead of coming in as a guns-blazing leader.

"Remote is the key word here.  Getting out of the community isn't as simple as taking the next Westjst flight.  From Inuvik, you'd take a wee plane ([Aklak Air](http://aklakair.ca/)) which runs three days as week pending weather.  Costs for flights are around $1200 just for that flight from Inuvik - I think they are around that price from looking at my last ticket receipt.  Oh, and for that price you may even have to help load and unload the plane :) 

So yes, very expensive.  Work will likely cover your removal to the community, but leaving for personal travel takes time, planning, and money. 

The sun will set in December and you won't see a glimpse of it again until the end of January.  By April it'll be 24 hours of day light and by June the Sun stays high in the sky  like its 2pm.  Costs of groceries and access to amenities have already been talked about.  There are not coffee shops, Tim Hortons, or any fast food places.  No bars, one community center that is also the only hotel.  From my experience small communities are accepting of homosexuality, that being said there will not be an active social community. Yellowknife has a larger scene, with Pride activities running in June and Pride is usually in August.  Inuvik may have a smaller Pride activity, but I am not 100% certain. 

I should also note that the ""way of life"" or culture is vastly different in the NWT.  The southern region of the NWT has trees, different indigenous groups, and have different culture practices than the higher arctic.

"Paulatuk, scenery-wise, is beautiful. The Parks job would be amazing. However, u/UTM7N made the good point that these aren't quite the questions you should be asking, but you're on the right path. Paulatuk is remote, and I mean *remote.* Knowing that, you gotta consider some self-reflection as well, like how much do you want to visit your family down south (flights are very expensive and inconsistent given weather and demand)? It's also way north so you also need to consider how much you need sunlight, how well you cope with constant cold temperature, how sensitive your moods may be to the long-term harsh conditions of a dark winter. Seasonal Affective Disorder isn't fun.  As well, there will be very little selection at the grocery store and shipping anything will be expensive, so how attached are you to fancy cooking, having lots of vegetables, or access to any sort of variety?

I hope I didn't come off as condescending. Carving a good life in the north is about accepting the place as it is as just as much as having the people accept you as you are. It's definitely not for everyone. So it's just as important that you like Paulatuk as it is that the folks in town to like/accept you.

"I'm a long term Yellowknifer.  I am interested in seeing tourism bubbles ... meaning that jurisdictions such as New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba, the NWT, Yukon, Nunavut, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Czech Republic, Greece etc get together and make an agreement to accept people as tourists in each other's locations.  As other jurisdictions such as Alberta, BC, Saskatchewan and other countries get the virus under control, they could be added.  To do this, we would quickly have to extend the runways of the Yellowknife Airport and get permission to be an International Airport so flights could avoid landing in southern Canada in areas with large numbers of cases.   I am not interested in opening the border to people from Alberta until the province has fewer than a 100 active cases.  And, even then, I'm in favour of keeping the two week quarantine in place for all visitors from there.  

I don't hold out too much hope for Toronto and Montreal.  I know that it's possible that big cities can get the virus under control as witnessed by Vancouver, Edmonton and Winnipeg.  I wonder why too many of Toronto and Montreal citizens can't see what is going on elsewhere and change some of their ways.

Eradicated speaks to having been killed off; the virus never took root in the North.  There was no community spread.

"It's complicated. Almost everyone I've talked to want to follow the FortressNWT plan for as long as needed. This entails keeping the borders closed and have strict policies for isolation upon arrival. This would allow us to get back to business internally while protecting our people.

BUT my community, Fort Smith, is a border town people live on both sides.  When the border closed on March 20th, it was like the Berlin wall went up and it caused a lot of hardship for our community. People that live in Smith couldn't go to work on the Alberta side even though they'd only have to go a kilometre into Alberta to get to work. Most people play on the Alberta side. That's where the beaches, golf course, park and lakes are.

The order happened on a Friday and it took until the following Tuesday for the Yellowknife based government to allow locals to travel back and forth. We're expecting that the border will completely close again when the river breaks and there is a ""risk"" of people coming from Fort Chipewyan.

Per your inquiry below, I think the 700 km is a typo: In a 2015 proposal to upgrade Howard’s Pass Access road (by Selwyn Chihong Mining Ltd.) the Howard’s Pass Access Road is a “79 km gravel road” (see excerpts following). It is also referred to as the Caribou Crossing Trail on the national park website, so I don’t know if that includes more land area/road. We have the same length in the 2020 book. We send checking copies to all our sources, including Nahanni National Park, but that doesn’t mean they catch errors. I’ll flag it for correction in 2021.


Excerpt from “Howard’s Pass Access Road Upgrade Project” (June 2015): 

The Howard’s Pass Access Road (HPAR) is a 79 km gravel road located in southwestern Northwest Territories. It was originally built in the late 1970s for access to the extensive zinc- lead deposit that straddles the Yukon-NWT border at Howard’s Pass in the Selwyn Mountains. When mineral exploration activity declined in the 1980s, the road fell into disuse and gradually deteriorated. Renewed interest in the Howard’s Pass mineral deposit since 2005 has also renewed the need for access to this potential mine site, both for exploration and mine development, and as part of a route for transporting ore concentrates to market when the mine is operational.
The HPAR runs through a succession of valley bottoms for much of its route. The first 12 km of the road follow alongside Divide Lake, then past streams, wetlands and lakes at the headwaters of the Little Nahanni River. For the next 48 km, the road runs mainly along the southwest side of the Little Nahanni River. In this road section, the terrain alternates between hummocky and rolling terrain, consisting of unconsolidated sediments within glacial landforms, and bedrock and colluvium on valley wall slopes. The road then climbs onto an extensive glaciofluvial terrace near the confluence of Steel Creek and Little Nahanni River. Beyond this, the road follows the southwestern hillslope of the Steel Creek valley and then crosses Steel Creek. North of this crossing, the road runs a short distance along the inactive floodplain of Steel Creek, then starts to climb the Placer Creek valley, traversing the eastern hill slopes of the valley. It then leaves the valley and climbs along gentle slopes to reach Howard’s Pass.
Along this route, the HPAR first passes through Dehcho Traditional Territory, then the Sahtu Settlement Area. It also crosses through traditional territory of the Kaska Dena. In addition, the HPAR traverses portions of both Nahanni and Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserves. 


Excerpt #2 from Parks Canada management plan (2017):


Ɂepé Nı̨narehɂá Ɂetenéɂ (Caribou Crossing Trail / Howard’s Pass Access Road) is Zone IV. This zone was selected because the defining feature is direct access by motorized vehicle. A licence of occupationFootnote 3 that pre-dates the Park is held by Selwyn Chihong Mining Ltd. for the road. There is industrial traffic on this road.
The road parallels Łáhtanı̨lı̨ Deé (Little Nahanni River) for a portion of its length. The river is an important recreational corridor for visitors – the river is part of the Zone II Wilderness area. The river valley and surrounding area are important for species of special concern, such as the federally listed northern mountain caribou, as it includes a portion of the South Nahanni herd’s calving, summer and rut ranges. It is also an area of high grizzly bear density.
Limitations to private motorized access 
A restricted activity permit is required for anyone using Ɂepé Nı̨narehɂá Ɂetenéɂ (Caribou Crossing Trail / Howard’s Pass Access Road) within Nááts’įhch’oh or Nahanni National Park Reserves, with the exception of Aboriginal traditional users.

"OKAY. So from what I can find, the HPAR is a short section of a longer highway that ends south of Tungsten, NT, in the Mackenzie Mountains. It starts off the Yukon Highway 4, and is about 200km to Tungsten, then seems to extend another 40-50k south. You can't access the rest of the NWT from here, and since it's mainly through valleys, it's unlikely that much of it (other than the sections used to access mines) is terribly well maintained. BUT a mining company was looking at a major maintenance/improvement project back in 2015, so who knows how far that's gotten by now (if anywhere).

There aren't a ton of rental units, so prices fluctuate quite a bit throughout the year.  If you're willing to live with other people, you could get a room in a house for as low as 500-800$/month.

"You get used to it as long as you dress for it. We went to B.C. the holidays and I was constantly uncomfortable because my winter gear is not appropriate for the weather there.

My neighbour goes for a ski with his dog every morning to hunt for ptarmigan. My dog is old and takes some convincing to go out to relieve himself once he's out there he'll play for 20 minutes before coming back in. Longer if there's a squirrel in the yard. 

When it gets this cold school doesn't have outside recess. My kids are in kindergarten and jk. When they get home we try to spend some time tobogganing or just playing in the yard even if it is only for 30 minutes to help ward off cabin fever. Generally, they can dress warm enough for this weather but their hands are what get cold. We've not been able to find a good pair for kid gloves. Most of the commercially made ones are designed for southern winters. Beaver fur mitts work the best but they are expensive ($200 a pair) and they grow out of them so quickly. 

Last year when it was this cold I camped out near Fort Good Hope for 5 weeks. We'd light a fire every couple of days in the tent we were sleeping in to dry out our gear. I had to put a Coleman stove under my truck to warm it enough for it to start! 

People drive a lot but many people walk to work or school. My partner walked to work, which is about 3km from our home, all last week. 

Life is great for many of us. I don't think it makes us tough. I think we've decide to revel in what we've got. We've decided this is fun and find ways to play in it.

We don't have a Xbox or a tv and neither do most of my friends but I think we're in the minority.

We had a Nissan  versa until recently. It hated this weather. We now have a vw golf, which starts and runs just fine as long as I remember to plug it in.

Hope that helps. Please feel free to ask any follow up questions.

"I think we are driving a little bit more than usual at this temperature, but I still walk to work every morning (about 10 minute) and some of my co-workers still ride their fat bikes!  With the extreme cold, a lot of my friends with younger kids seem to be doing way more indoor activities (lots of indoor forts!)  We have lots of indoor activities, a nice walking track at the local multiplex, so people still get out to move around...  
For a lot of people, leaving town for a week or two is a yearly activity...My husband and I book a trip down to the Carribean every February.  Interestingly, it's not really the cold that is the issue, it's the darkness.  It can be pretty depressing when the sun rises at 9:00 and sets by 3:00.
