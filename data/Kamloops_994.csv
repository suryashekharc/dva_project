">~~Nothing at all says~~ “Im wrong” ~~than doing what youre doing lol.~~

FTFY. 


>All technicalities

Vague. What technicalies? You said it's okay to bear mace people you don't like because they might hurt you. I said that's fucked up. You cried. That's it. 

>the assumptions you accuse me of

Again, please, be specific. I can't read your mind. 

>analyzing why I say what I say

""He thought about the words I said, that's bad!"" What?!

>you then attack me and demean me.

Lmao, he said after attacking and demeaning people. Can dish it but can't take it. Typically bully shit. Cry. 

>But you are just SO OFFENDED when I do it to people who are actually out here hurting people

I love that this sentence is essentially you admitting to attacking and demeaning people, and you see no problem with it, and only wrote it to further attack and demean me. This is the most ironic sentence I've read in quite a while. 

>Its crazy

Said the guy saying we should bear mace people who are sick. 

>You are psychoanalyzing me negatively

""Mean man pointed out my words are callous and a call to violence."" 

>a regular guy pays bills/taxes votes D.

You think these things somehow should protect you from being called a ghoul when you're calling for violence towards a subsect of people as a whole? 

>Because I think people should be able to defend themselves from real threats with non lethal violence.

No bro. You've actively called for violence and speak in generalizations and cast all these people as one. No one in the video was violent. No one In the video was threatening violence or even remotely being aggressive. The main parent comment to which you replied literally advocated for lying about a previous attack to justify just spraying these people with bear mace and you came in and agreed with them and doubled down and actively called for the same violence yourself. Don't turn this into a self defence cry. That doesn't hold any water and no one ever said you don't have a right to defend yourself. But you have no right to attack an entire group of sick people and spout hateful rhetoric online. It's disgusting, myopic, and dangerous. 

>But these people ^ up there smoking drugs threatening someone, they get the benefit of a doubt. 

They get the benefit of the doubt because they weren't calling for violence. You were. They didn't talk about how worthless, lazy, and dangerous you are. You're having a laugh if you can't see why what you've done is shitty. You should be embarrassed. I'd delete all these comments if I were you. 

>Let me ask you, what are they thinking since you know me so well lol?

This sentence doesn't even make sense. Your pronouns are so confusing. What are you even asking? I'm assuming you're asking what the people in the video are thinking? Two things. 

1. Theyre humans. Just because they struggle with addiction, doesn't mean they arent people like you. Asking me to predict what they're thinking is stupid. There is no way I could know. 

2. They're likely not thinking clearly. They're likely only thinking about the next high. 
.

>“Well see they are smoking drugs in his parking spot because he is so sick and needs help.

I mean, yeah. You dont get this? Are you being serious? You think this person **wants** that? They want to have no other option than to be smoking drugs in a parking spot? 


>Dont mind him threatening anyone, hes not violent!!

The people in the video did not threaten anyone. They were not violent. You're just making things up. 

>You see its your fault for wanting to park in your spot, thats mean to the poor man smoking meth.”

I never said that. I understand the frustration. I understand wanting to park in the spot you paid for. I get being angry. But I don't get being an adult, who this did not even happen to, and posting about it online calling for violent retribution towards these people, who were again, non violent, and not threatening violence.  Your quote misattributed my words as implying that you'd be at fault for merely going about your day, which is of course not true. What is mean and unacceptable is calling for violence against a whole group of people, irregardless of their actions, spreading misinformation and hate about a whole group people.

>My mother was homeless in berkely/sf for years before she died. She didnt want any help. None of them did. We need to protect the people who are doing things right and trying. Not this scum.

Sorry you had such a trying relationship with your mother.  These people are not your mother. You're taking out your hate on these people despite their lack of violent actions. They're literally just smoking meth in a parking spot and you're calling for them to be maced.  I genuinely would encourage you to talk to someone and get out those feelings you have toward your mother; that resentment and frustration.

>Not these scum.

~~scum~~ people. People. They're people. Just like you. Addiction is a sickness. No need to dehumanize them.

I see no evidence of these people threatening harm. Op. Made no such claim. They threaten no physical harm in the video.. do you know these people?

I do find it rewarding to help the most vulnerable.

He said, encouraging violence and intimidation. Are you the scum of the Earth? 

>The cops don’t do shit

Yeah, that sounds like a cop issue....and something  vigilante violence won't change. Cops aren't really the answer either. Addiction is hard and it's going to take a multifaceted holistic approach which includes efforts of understanding and education on your part, as well as your support for such programs and interventions. Violence doesn't change the issue. It won't stop addiction and the sequaeale you complain about. It won't stop others from being addicted. It won't even stop you from being upset.

Because I think people should be able to defend themselves from real threats with non lethal violence. But these people ^^^^ up there smoking drugs threatening someone, they get the benefit of a doubt. 

Let me ask you, what are they thinking since you know me so well lol? Love to hear your logic. “Well see they are smoking drugs in his parking spot because he is so sick and needs help. Dont mind him threatening anyone, hes not violent!! You see its your fault for wanting to park in your spot, thats mean to the poor man smoking meth.”

">Imagine if this man had been attacked or his loved one

Purely a hypothetical situation. 

If I walk down the street and you're heading towards me, I don't know you. It is equally as likely that you could attack me or my loved ones. Does that justify me in bear macing you? Does it justify others encouraging me to do so by saying ""hey watch out that guy could potentially hurt you, you should bear mace him! Always have bear mace!""



>people want to live in a world where 9/10 homeless are “down on their luck” lol hate to break it to you but 99/100 love their lifestyle, their hustle, their scam.

""Here are some completely made up numbers that don't reflect reality."" 

>Its easy to beg for money, threaten people who wont give any, and get high.

Imagine thinking that being homeless is easy. You're clearly not in touch with reality and have never struggled with homelessness. 

>Being a functional member of society is literally too much to ask of these people.

Yeah, they're sick. When you're sick you don't perform well either. Are you being obtuse? 

>They deserve any retribution they get.

You're literally calling for and encouraging violence toward your fellow humans. That's really fucked up. 

I don't understand why you're so resistant to hear a voice or reason, or why you're so resolute on violence being the answer. Violence isn't the answer. It literally wouldn't fix anything. It's okay to be wrong about something. It's fine. It's an opportunity for growth. I hope you can take this opportunity to reflect on your words here and how you could view someone as deserving of violence.

"Hey man, nothing against you personally. We are all just people.

I understand that this is born of frustration. I get that. I understand that the impact of addiction reaches far beyond the individual, and even beyond the people directly in that individual's life. The impact of addiction is huge, and hurts everyone in the community and the community as a whole. 

Frustration and grasping for a solution is understandable. Looking for the cause of problem and stopping it is also logical. I just think you're going about it all the wrong way.

And I get that too, I understand being tired of seeing something and being frustrated and saying something in the moment. I understand not thinking about things holistically before we say them.

What I can't understand is actively encouraging people to harm other people. Needlessly. Suffering doesn't fix suffering. Hurting people doesn't fix addiction. I don't understand your initial comment, and much less your second comment, for your second comment doesn't seek to understand. It's intent is not to have a discussion, or even respond to anything that I said. Instead it's only purpose is to mock and denigrate me. That's it. Which I think we can both agree is childish. You're better than. You're better than a weak ad hominem. 

I get that it's hard to be called out, and that our contemporary Western society makes it challenging to admit when you were wrong. But you're wrong on this. And calling me names or portraying me is stupid or something you don't like or whatever doesn't make you not wrong on this. Being wrong isn't bad. It means you have an opportunity for growth. I challenge you to take it. 

I hope you can reflect on this later and ask yourself some hard questions, and find some room to grow.

"Canadian prisons have a lower rate of repeat offenders than America by a long shot, and that would lead me to believe that it’s a better rehabilitation than the rehab facilities. Because they don’t have the choice but to get better or stay away from where they are a danger to themselves and others; not even jail is necessarily it, like I said before, remember asylums? 

The parking space? You think I worry about the parking space? No I worry about the half-dead guy in the elementary school yard, with a pile of broken meth glass around him. Go outside one day and you’ll see, it’s not sunshine and rainbows that these people are leaving behind them. Decriminalize the disgusting steer level laundry detergent that we call crack? What good would that do? Who here is gonna just start making crack, or fentanyl, or Crystal meth? I’m on board for legalization tbh, but not of hard street grade drugs that we have no control over; almost all this shit is imported my friend, read a book maybe and you’d know we’re one of the biggest international drug launderers in North America. 

Stop the crime indeed, as I asked someone else, what all-knowing answers do you have to pull out of your ass; how do we entirely curb this issue? How do we:  

Stop the flow of illegal drugs, control it, turn it to our government 

Stop the current violent drug addicts from remaining a danger out on the street

Stop people from overdosing

You act like bear macing these guys will somehow solve the problem, or do anything other than vindictively inflict suffering on people clearly suffering already.

"Oddly enough, sometimes just asking them to move along can work. They seem pretty chill right now, these people tend to avoid trouble and if you ask nicely they will often move along. They probably don't know they're trespassing. They are making somewhat of a choice to obviously not be at a school or around the park or someplace with kids. Give them credit for that  In their twisted logic they're probably trying to do a good thing by relegating themselves to some corner of a parking lot. 

I'm just saying, they're drug addicted and yes they probably get pushy and violent with one another at times. But it's a small percentage of them that just lose their mind and attack members of the public. By and large when they're chilled out and you speak nicely to them they're often quite agreeable to move along especially if you give them a window of 10 to 15 minutes to collect their shit. 

The problem is people will just yell at them or go full Karen and if you think about it logically nobody, drug addicted or otherwise, wants to be spoken to like that so that never ends up working out well but it gets blamed on them being drug addicted versus the truth of the matter which is that someone was being rude to them.

I think it's a hard problem I would like to see them not anywhere near my residence or property and I get where everyone's coming from and the frustration towards the government and law enforcement powerlessness, but there are some positives to look at and with a little intestinal fortitude it's not impossible to interact with these people and just ask them to move along in many cases.

Throwing our hands up, not prosecuting ""small crimes"", allowing repeat offenders, focusing our empathy on those few at the bottom when they're hurting the majority...that's just bad bad empathy in my opinion. I'm not saying be heartless towards them. I am saying they and their comfort cannot be our main focus.

"Absolutely right. Part of the problem with housing is everyone in town says “we need to help these people,” govt says “ok let’s use this building as a shelter.” And those same people say “oh no, not here.

It’s not all of those using shelters who commit crimes but those that do really ruin it.  I guess you could look at a bylaw saying that shelters can’t go in neighbourhoods or near schools or places where the citizens will be negatively affected and go from there, just not sure where that leaves space?

Personally I would like to see them moved to a facility on the outskirts of town.

Ambulances, police, fire, support workers can all easily drive to an outlying area so there should be no fear of ""needing to be near services"".  

What good is it just having them wander around like zombies committing crimes and making life miserable for the honest hard-working tax paying useful members of society?  

A facility on the outskirts can better control the drug supply, can better wean them off, can get some of them the assistance they want to rejoin society in a useful manner.

"Bruh, my concern isn’t fREe stUFF it’s that we, taxpayers, are paying for their free stuff, so that they can continue to be addicted, so that we can continue to pay for their free stuff.

Then, they’ll have kids who grow up into group homes, that we pay for, that almost always fail the children, who get addicted to drugs using free stuff that we pay for, so that they can stay addicted, so we can pay for more free stuff to keep them that way, so that they can have children that go into group homes….

See the cyclical pattern here? The government makes more money off taxing us than these simple needles and pipes cost. But if there’s always a drug problem, we’ll always need to pay to “fix” it. If they regulated the illicit, hard drugs, had a proper rehab that actually works, we probably wouldn’t see so many violent addicts. Who will collect all the funding that way though, if people aren’t addicted?

"Can confirm with PG; I work at an apartment overnight kinda thing, bout 4 hours ago there was a tweaking couple cutting their drugs in broad (moonlight?), visibly fucked up, the guy was folded talking to the floor, the chick was folded cutting and snorting their drugs and mixing it with their lemon cake (I wish I was kidding, she crushed up her crystals, put it in some whipped cream, started huffing it up). Took two hours for RCMP to get there, moved them along all fine n dandy after some arguing, didn’t investigate the drugs or check em, even after I told them they’re literally snorting meth in the lobby.

It’s painful to watch, not because I have any sympathy for them, at this point I think Darwinism should be directly applicable to crackheads, if they wanna huff some laundry detergent mixed with wall and a bit of meth, shit, what happens happens my dude, it should no longer be our responsibility to save you.

"Problem with it was there were no sewer/water hookups and it was too far from the hospital in case of an emergency.  I think another issue was the people in Rayleigh felt downtown businesses just wanted them out of sight so just dump them far away and the Rayleigh residents get no input. Govt just announced a new complex care facility to be built in Kamloops just not sure when. Unfortunately people wind up homeless and addicted for a lot of reasons. Even the fires/floods from the last few years put people out on the streets. As much as we want to just say lock these people up it probably costs more tax dollars to arrest them, hospitalize, release them and re-arrest ad nauseam.  It really needs a co-ordinated approach from all govt levels but just isn’t getting it. If the solution was easy, it would have been done already.

I agree that addiction is not a police responsibility and there are lots of factors than can lead someone down the path of addiction and we all need to be aware of that but our downtown is overrun with people that are openly using drugs and a small number of those people are also causing disturbances to local businesses. Personally I think that we need a treatment/recovery center out in the Raleigh area around there those baseball fields are so that those who genuinely want help can get it and are not in close proximity to drugs/alcohol.

"There is usually an active scene friend. Welcome to the hobby! 

High Octane used to do Thursday night games you drop in for like 2$ and find other players, as well as leagues. I havent been since pre covid, just call down and ask about their tines these days.

Can't speak for all aboard, 

Most players I know stopped playing at the stores and the stores couldn't open for the required space during certain covid times.

In September attack x is a big table (2000 pt) tournament event in town, but there are often tournaments at High Octane. Wet coast is another event to check out in Van too! 

There is a large scene here but you will need to put yourself out there and try a couple smaller events or just show up to the stores on game days. Once you play with a few folks you usually can nab more regular games. There's four or five bigger groups in town a few with discord or the like but usually those are the league events (usually 2k pts)

I dont have tons of spare time this month but dm any other questions! I could probably swing a small point learning game at some time in April though!

"Real Redneck only consists of the West Virginia coal miner scene and the late 1920's union scene. What is known by ""country boys"" as redneck is nothing but self righteous xenophobia with questionable real redneck influence. When people try to argue that bands like Florida Georgia Line are not real redneck, while saying that Trace Adkins is, I can't help not to cringe because he is just as fake redneck as Florida Georgia Line (plus the pretentiousness). Real redneck is ENERGETIC, POWERFUL and somewhat COMMUNIST. Fake redneck is weak, self pity and a failed attempt to direct energy and patriotism into flying a traitorous flag. Some examples of REAL REDNECK are syndicalists, union organizers, Dolly Parton (the only real redneck musician from the Nashville country scene) and the Socialist Rifle Association.

covid is going to be around for a long time. it would be nice if it hit endemic phase this year, but it might not also and we will continue to see waves.  Data indicates another wave is starting in europe, though who knows how much it will spike? Time will tell, they are ahead of us on reopening so they will be an indicator. 

Open everything back up, though smart people will still be wearing masks in retail and public transit settings.

"Every comment on this thread shows how out of touch with reality 99.999% of people are.  
    The homeless problem in most major cities like Kamloops has gotten progressively worse over the past ten years due to relaxing of laws that protect people who want to shoot drugs in the street.  Its obvious to anyone with a working brain that all drugs should be decriminalized.  Does this mean people should be able to shoot heroin in front of families downtown? Obviously not.  
   If you took all the money that went into funding the in town shelters, their directors, staff, you would have a huge amount of money that I'm sure a local rancher would gladly take to maintain & house these people who choose to shoot heroin in the streets.  Every time one of these people escapes and gets downtown shooting drugs they should be picked up and taken to the farm.   If you want to use drugs, do so in your own space away from people, away from town and away from parks for kids.
       To the ""homeless"" people who smash on average 12 windows per night in kamloops they should rot in jail for theft/vandalism.  We need harsher laws, and more enforcement on these people who choose to do this. 
    No one has an excuse to shoot heroin in the streets in front of kids.  Only in a modern society with braindead liberals does this even happen.

I've only experienced kindness from homeless. But you need to know they get socially attacked a lot so they're on edge. Still given that, I then find them to be the most greatful. I also try not to bother them if their in an altered headspace for any reason.

From conversations I've had most have trauma in their past. While their family might want to support them, many times they don't trust and would prefer life alone rather than trusting family.

Once the individual is homeless health and work can become impossible. This is why supportive tiny home communities to stop the homeless spiral is so essential.

"The reason for this is because nobody will round them up and dispose of them, and ""helping the homeless"" is big business. A few years ago when we had a few really big wildfires, they rounded up all the homeless getting neighboring cities, brought them here, and just left them to become part of the Kamloops community.

They do nothing but cause problems for everyone in town. They steal, they break things, they use people's yards as bathrooms. Don't bother talking to them.

There is a company called Ask Wellness that leases out entire motels and fills them up with junkies who do nothing for society except sponge off of it. I've had friends that lived in the lower Sahali area that have had to sell their house because their vehicles got broken into every night and their yards were full of old needles after they all moved into the neighborhood.
