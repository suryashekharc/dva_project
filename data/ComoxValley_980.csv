"Just some perspective from someone who works in building design:

A church building is not suitable for use as a long term homeless shelter for several reasons; most of them relating to sanitation, fire safety, and the organized use of space.  I'll go over a few points:

A homeless shelter requires discrete spaces for sleeping, congregating, eating, and washroom facilities.  The spaces for each are determined in Part 3 of the BC Building Code, [https://free.bcpublications.ca/civix/content/public/bcbc2018/465649652/2121247527/?xsl=/templates/browse.xsl](https://free.bcpublications.ca/civix/content/public/bcbc2018/465649652/2121247527/?xsl=/templates/browse.xsl), to determine the building's maximum occupancy and the facilities required to serve that occupancy.

A church's occupancy rating is a [Group A assembly occupancy](https://free.bcpublications.ca/civix/document/id/public/bcbc2018/bcbc_2018dap1s13), where as a homeless shelter is a [Groub C, residential occupancy](https://free.bcpublications.ca/civix/document/id/public/bcbc2018/bcbc_2018dap1s13) (or maybe a group B)  I don't have time to pull up all the specific differences such as area per person permitted and required washroom facilities, but you can comb through the codes if you like.

A church, being an assembly building, has washroom facilities to service a crowd for a 2-3 hour service or event, but not for a population of homeless people.  There are little to no showers, and the number of water closets (toilets) could be insufficient for that use.  These types of buildings also have to have plumbing systems designed to meet the type of demand the occupancy places on the building's and the city's systems, but that stuff is way over my head.

A church building's fire safety plan is designed for evacuating a crowd that is attending an event, not a population of residents who are sleeping at night.  There are large open spaces for fire to spread quickly and usually a lack of fire spread barriers like fire doors that you would see in an apartment building.  The church also lacks designated sleeping rooms that have mandatory egress openings (a window you can climb through) directly to the exterior.  Unless the building is sprinklered, this would not serve as any sort of residential occupancy and the bylaw officers would be obligated to shut down any homeless housing due to risk of physical harm or death.  The risk of fire is only going to increase when you populate a building with a lot of desparate, down and out people who have no hope and might be prone to risky behaviour.

Eating: Do the kitchen facilities have enough capacity to feed these people?  Perhaps, but what about staff and supplies?  Or staff in general to manage the population and keep order?  How about an individual having security of person and belongings?  Having no dorm rooms at minimum with a locker, people will feel less secure.  People who feel less secure are prone to more defensive, aggressive behaviour.  These buildings are also designed to be inward focused, towards a center of worship, teaching, etc.  They often lack the kind of outdoor access for light and recreation, at least in a way that makes sense for a long term residential facility.

These and many factors add up to a situation where the population's morale and mental health could be more severely impacted over the long term.  Not to mention you are displacing any of the uses the building was designed for.  I am not saying anything here out of lack of care or empathy for the homeless, I'm saying it for the exact opposite.  Putting a group of people inside a buiding to use it in a way that it was not designed for would be more harmful than good.  Churches make good post disaster relief buildings for the short term, but are not a good long term housing solution for a homeless population.  We need dedicated long term homeless housing, and way more affordable housing.

Right now the City of Courtenay is dragging its feet on a lot of changes that are necessary to make affordable housing more available.  A lot of subdivisions are being dragged through council at a pace that makes a snail look like its going light speed.  I have worked on low income housing that took 2 years to get through the Development Permit process while the city tried everything to avoid upgrading the septic system.  And right now, the City of Courtenay does not allow secondary suites or carriage houses in many of its residential zones.  Cumberland's R1a zone allows for a suite in the home and a detached carriage house.  The best use of your energy might be to harass city council to get it's ass moving on this problem.  The less affordable housing we have, the more that lower income families fall out of the rental market as prices go up and their landlords sell from under them.

TL:DR

Buildings are designed around their intended use.  Human nature, psychology, health and well being is a MAJOR factor into how they are designed and why the codes, bylaws and regulations govern their design and use.  Using a building for a purpose it was not designed for could be disastrous for people's safety and mental health, and these issues could spill over into the community, making the problem worse.  We need to petition the city counsel to get working on making affordable housing easier to access/build, and support the increase in dedicated homeless shelters.",t2_dh9z6h50,WonderfulSpecific601,0,1648138491.0,0,t1_i1y3jad,i1y3jad,True,Stunning-Caregiver54,t3_tljo7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/comoxvalley/comments/tljo7n/homeless_in_comox_valley/,Homeless in Comox Valley,/r/comoxvalley/comments/tljo7n/homeless_in_comox_valley/i1y3jad/,5,r/comoxvalley,0,5

"I would recommend getting a Ring, or similar camera. They aren't too expensive, and will capture any motion. Once you have that, and it alerts you that someone's crawling under your porch, call the RCMP immediately to have them removed. 

It might seem a little harsh treatment of someone who just wants a place to sleep, but this person could be dangerous or high, and it's not safe to have homeless people sleeping under your porch. What if they were to make a fire to keep warm? Your house would burn down. 

I had to make a call like this once when I came home to find a homeless person having a little bonfire on the back porch of the empty house next to mine. The RCMP officer told them they couldn't be there, and then helped them actually find some services and a warm place to go at the time. Hopefully, yours gets the same treatment.

"I‚Äôve been in the trades for the better part of 20 years at this point. I‚Äôve run my own business before and still do. I never once said it was easy, nor did I ever overlook the costs of all the extras you need for running a successful business. However, I will concede that I definitely didn‚Äôt spend the time in my original post explaining that when I said the 80-120k profit on a house was on top of the owner being paid a really good wage and covering all those extra expenses. I apologize for not being more in depth in my original comment. It was first thing in the morning and it was something I had just been talking about with friends a couple of days earlier while negotiating a contract and I vented. No excuse though as I understand those details really matter in retrospect. 

As for your last sentence - I do. Whenever I get a job that requires me bringing on extra people aside from myself or my partner they are ALWAYS compensated well. I pay out minimum $50 an hour for experienced carpenters and $30 for labourers. 

For example I have a job starting at the beginning of April and anybody I hired is being paid a minimum of $550 a day. Granted, I‚Äôm not running a construction company that employs multiple people full time but I put my money where my mouth is and do my part to pay people fairly when it comes to the trades where and when I can. 

As I said in my original comment - there‚Äôs no easy solution to any of this. I don‚Äôt really have an answer to what to do about it either but the model that we currently are working under where big city money pours into our small town and a select few see any of it is not it.

Considering someone can be clicking a button counting members making $28.  Our trades people are highly undervalued.  Profits before people is something we cannot escape unless we stop supporting it.  I would imagine there would be development slow downs over night if we would start demanding fairer wages.  On the other hand there are always new trades persons being born every day that see 28/hr as a big increase in wage from their previous jobs while finishing their training.  I guess the better question is what kind of social responsibility do builders and large companies have in the trades? Perhaps a socially acceptable practice of fair wages vs Profits.  Profits or people?

"This isn‚Äôt the NDP‚Äôs fault. Nor is it any western country‚Äôs government‚Äôs fault. The entire western world is feeling rising gas prices. This is almost purely on Russia invading Ukraine.

That isn‚Äôt much of a rise when you consider the fact that gas would be over $2/l regardless of the tax going up or not. 

Also, you realize lower income families get some of the BC Climate Action Tax back as a credit right? It ups your GST payment if you make under $40k a year. And they increased that rate to compensate the rise of the tax going up, but I don‚Äôt see you talking about that.

"Getting a bike. Been wanting to get in shape so this is the push I needed. Bonus of less snacking while trying to stay healthy = less groceries.

Making our own bread, crackers, granola bars, muffins. Only buying processed goods if it is cheaper (99c spaghetti at superstore is cheaper than making homemade noodles, but wraps are cheaper to make at home for example).

Cutting out meat a few times a week, eating less meat per meal. This also helps health.

Sticking to local/seasonal fruits, fewer berries, etc. But we freeze stuff in summers so we still have a couple pounds of blackberries to last us till July.

Costco shops more often. Although 3lbs of asparagus is hard to use regardless of the ""deal"". But trying to keep the fridge/cupboards relatively empty at the same time so we use stuff right away and can keep better track of the budget. Costcowest secret weekly deals gives pictures of the weekly sales every Tuesday for BC.

Using leftovers every time.

Cutting streaming services, going back to ""free"" online streaming services with a good adblocker & VPN. Going to try to figure out how to get my firestick access to ""free"" content.

Considering some type of white collar crime but only want to steal from rich people, kidding but not kidding.

"Buy as much as possible from Costco and getting comfortable eating similar things regularily to reduce costs. At the same time getting good and making flexible food choices when planning meals. 

For example the pork loin from Costco runs about $20-25 per loin and can make about 15-20 pork chops so around $1.25-$2 a portion. There are a million different ways to make pork chops tasty. Grilled, roasted, schnitzel etc.  

Get good at cooking potatoes and onions as well. Both are cheap and filling and flavorful when done up. 

Potatoes can be roasted, boiled, baked, mashed, French fried, wedges etc. 

Onions can be raw, sliced, diced, grilled, saut√©ed, roasted. They make up the backbone of most soups, gravies, and roasts. 

I‚Äôm planning on restarting my garden soon.
My dogs ripped my one from last year. Kale grows year round and is a nutritious hearty vegetable. Slice it into soups or salads, roast with olive oil and salt, pan fry with some garlic. 

Cabbage is also very versatile. Coleslaw is cheap and delicious. Mix it up with some different dressings. Saut√© it with some of the above mentioned onions and garlic. Drop some into some chicken noodle soup. 

Buy a big bag of rice and always keep some cooked in the fridge. Makes for a great filler to any meal. Cook it with some chicken stock instead of water for extra flavor. Add some chili powder to it for some kick. Fry some day old rice with some frozen peas and carrots and a beaten egg for a easy fried rice. 

For gas it‚Äôs become a dedicated effort to preplan trips. If we are going to X what else can we do in that area so we don‚Äôt need to go out again.

"I was been in Comox for 2 years. Unfortunately this place is a difficult place to get connected with others especially around your age. You can either go to college or get a job here and can get to know local people or newcomers. But other than that, yea you might feel invisible till you finally get tired of here and leave the place. All the people I hang out here last year left the city by the way. Also, a lot of young folks here are here for temporary reasons such as travelling, summer job or visiting grandparents. If you go to Nanaimo or Victoria, there might be more young people between ages 20s and 30s but still mostly are students. To be honest, if I am you, I would try to move to other cities unless I go to college here, especially if you are 20 years old. Man, you need have social life to enjoy golden 20 years old of lifespan. I guess thar your mom lives here so you are here with her but she gotta live her life and you gotta enjoy your life too. I definitely have other reasons why I choose to leave this city and this city wasn't for me. But living here could be challenging to build a social life for people around your age if you don't go to schools here. I meant you can make friends that you cannot really call as a friend. You are from Singapore and I know people there really love making a deep connection with others. A friend like your family, your brother and sister. It's probably extremely difficult to make a friend like that here.

"Things aren‚Äôt lining up with data from other countries. India has a minuscule vaccination rate in comparison and next to no covid. There is clearly something wrong with the base line data.

I don‚Äôt think the statement referenced is intelligent or specific enough to actually attach any real meaning to, but I am not about to twist it to spin a narrative. 

My main point remains the same, if we just call each other crazy and divide ourselves along partisan lines instead of uniting against the actual evil in this world, we are the arbiters of our own doom. 

And as far as the convoy goes, and my rhetoric regarding people attaching beliefs to me that I do not actually maintain, I have been absolutely bombarded with these accusations for the past two years so forgive me if I am defensive. I do not support the ‚Äúleadership‚Äù of the convoy, or some of their tactics, but I support their message and I think people need to realize that they are the only people actually standing up to our corrupt government. 

I also must point out that the conservatives are trying to make useful idiots of the truckers, and are not going to be a better alternative to the current administration.

">They were waving confederate flags in front of parliament.

So? There was a guy at my own high school here on the island who had a confederate flag on the back of his truck. Is that supposed to make me think this is America's fault? When the Proud Boys (who were started by a Canadian) waved a British colonial era flag at a protest in Halifax a few years ago, was that England's fault? When Central Park Karen called the police on the African American bird watcher last year, was it Canada's fault because she is a Canadian born/raised in Ontario who was just living out her racist tendencies in NYC? 

I hate to have to point this out to you but the confederate flag being used by Canadians is nothing new. It's like the red Trump MAGA hat, which I've seen twice in the last year here in the valley. It's been appropriated by many groups to signify many things.

"I used to be part of the comox valley peace society.  We protested on issues like Israel's bombing of Gaza and made and organized the White Poppies for Peace every rememberence day. We haven't been very active since covid started. There are other particular issue groups like CV save our forests team, and climate emergency stuff. There is also some significant activism in our indigenous community. We usually hold marches and gatherings around simms park on orange shirt day and more recently the memorial for the missing and murdered women on Feb 14. 
Only general leftist sort of movement I can think of that is kind of generalized is CV Council of Canadians. They campaign on various issues. Not sure what their take on the convoy is, if they have one. What the valley needs is an antifacist group. I'm not sure I it would be safe to be explicitly antifa though. A lot of people (including some relatives of mine I had a heated discussion with today) are getting sucked into borderline or explicit white supremist crap as the alt right takes advantage of the government overeach narrative with covid.

"Unprofessional conduct.  Blaring a 90db truck horn and it stops being a peaceful protest, it inflicts pain. Go in your car and see how long you can handle it, and remember it's not nearly as loud as a truck horn. Go ahead and have a peaceful protest but the second you harm others it has to stop. Encouraging it does nothing but embolden the fringe fanatics (an arson attack has happened now). I do disagree with the politics but believe in the right to peaceful protest.

"I don't feel in the least bit surprised by this surge in right wing activism.
In February 2020 I was on the little highway blockade here in the valley in solidarity with the Wet'su'wet'en. 
We shut down in around 48 hours (I don't clearly remember, I should have taken notes at the time) after having some individuals who identified as ""Sons of Odin"" (I think it was 2 men and 1 woman) come by in their truck and storm the place tearing down our camp and telling us to leave. 1 dude got arrested as he was being violent. I don't know what became of him. 
A few hours later (that night) we were surrounded in the bushes along the highway by an unknown number of angry young men, some of whom were wearing forms of body armour. Cops said some of them had come from Naniamo, and were involved in right wing groups there. We packed up and left as the threat of violence was too great, and the cops first said they wouldn't intervene if we got attacked, and when we moved our camp closer to them (the cops) they said they were ""out numbered"" by the people in the bush threatening us.

There have been protests across Europe against restrictions, including recently in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, etc... These people are ignorant, no doubt, but so is our knee-jerk reaction to reference anything we can about America so as to say or imply this isn't actually something we Canadians would do without their influence.

"Oh there's a new bubble tea place?    
Darned covid.  I just don't get out enough any more.  :/  


Was thinking more like a dedicated area in the parks.  Have you ever been to Clover Point in Victoria along the waterfront?  Something like that would be perfect.  Room for parking, room for the trucks, safe place to play, walking areas for people/pets.  Also, when it's all together its accessible for seniors and those with very young children or those with disabilities, too.

"Food trucks are finally taking off, which is great to see here.  They bring lots of variety and great food while keeping prices down.  The problem currently is that they're so scattered - except for the ones just by the 5th street bridge.

What I'd like to see is a couple park-type areas where they could have places to park \~5 of them at a time.  There'd be picnic tables, recycling and garbage cans, a play area for the kids, maybe grassy spots for picnicking or bocce, bathrooms.

Have a bubble tea / specialty drink store to anchor it - one that changes with the seasons:  spiced apple cider and hot cocoas in the cold months, fruit and veggie smoothies in the summer.
