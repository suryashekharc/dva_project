After council members said they could not prevent the restaurant from developing the site, some neighbors turned to the courts, suing Raising Cane’s in June. Save Rancho Providencia Neighborhood, which purports to represent the community, has argued that Raising Cane’s needed to receive special permission from the city to construct a drive-thru, though the city has disputed this. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge also decided last year against issuing a ruling that would prevent the restaurant from opening during the legal proceedings.  
  
In a hearing on March 9, Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said he would take both parties’ arguments “under submission.” The court also canceled a March 11 hearing on Save Rancho Providencia Neighborhood’s arguments, though filed documents indicated it would be rescheduled.

"It's not illegal, for sure at least for the outgoing flight although NV may have different rules. Weed is legal in California, and if you are flying with less than an ounce (different limits on vapes I believe but plenty for personal use reasons), even if TSA were to ""catch"" you they have to give you your weed back & send you on your way. I do not hide my weed when I fly, I stick it the main compartment of my backpack still in the packaging. I've flown with weed many, many times to states where weed is both legal and not. I've had my bag searched, they've taken it out and looked at it and determined it wasn't a weapon and put it back. They don't send the dogs out when you land & they really aren't going to mess with you over a vape cartridge.

"To be clear, whether or not “they care” it is a federally regulated flight even if you are flying between two states where it’s legal it is federally illegal, and the medical card only works in your state of residency, crossing states with a federally illegal drug is a big crime. Also regardless of if it’s legal in both states, the product is only legal in its state it was sold/purchased that’s why on the container it has a state label so hypothetically if you were pulled over in Vegas and had CA weed with the CA label on it that’s a crime and again now you’ve crossed state lines with a drug which isn’t good, even tho they probably won’t/don’t care. Drug dogs can smell marijuana even if it’s a vape/pen. Also remember your not supposed to fly with batteries so if you carry it on and don’t take it out of your bag for X-ray the battery might trigger them to search your bag so maybe check the battery part? Then if you get caught with just the cartridge you won’t have to trash the pen too, ans you can just say you forgot to take it out I guess…If your going to do it  edibles seem low risk, they aren’t going to test your gummies or chocolate in an unlabeled ziplock bag just looks like candy. But honesty, just go buy it when you land?

Maybe the landing gear wasn’t coming down. I was on an inbound flight from Las Vegas to Burbank on Southwest one time when the landing gear would not come down so they rerouted us to LAX but only after running the fuel out for several minutes. We couldn’t land at Burbank because we would’ve gone out on the Hollywood way. At LAX they had emergency landing protocol waiting With nets and foam. We landed safely and were offered the option to either be bused back to Burbank or to take a special flight from LAX back to Burbank because they didn’t do LAX to Burbank flights at the time -  this was in the 90s. We decided to hop right back up on that horse and flew back home to Burbank. Maybe this is what happened.,t2_232pbtf0,Nikkivegas1,0,1647631376.0,0,t1_i16wa8g,i16wa8g,True,Desperate-Ad-6463,t3_tgnct6,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/tgnct6/southwest_flight_missed_bur_by_thismuch/,Southwest Flight missed BUR by >thismuch<,/r/burbank/comments/tgnct6/southwest_flight_missed_bur_by_thismuch/i16wa8g/,2,r/burbank,0,2

"I'm 100% with you, but have to admit some anxious feelings about the situation. 

Folks on the Citizen app were saying initial tests by LAFD came back as hydrogen cyanide. No idea what that chemical is about but cyanide is a scary word. Next I hear from an ABC news crew on scene is that it's the epoxy resin. Not a good thing by any means, but nothing thats going to cause a citywide evacuation either. 

When I was reading about how it happened they said a metal vessel getting ready to transport the stuff had a broken valve so it leaked. Then a spokesman for the company said it wasn't a broken valve, but something was overheating so the computer did an auto venting. 

I can fully appreciate that things are still in flux and the story will get ironed out, but I'm a bit uncomfortable.

"Because he's dramatizing the situation. ""Really bad shit"" is just fear mongering, not to mention pure exaggeration if your read the safety data sheet he posted. 

It's an epoxy. A resin, or glue. It's stable, it dries within 4 hours, it can be diluted with water. People work with similar product at home. All of that is a good sign. Yes, you never want to be leaking this into the river on a normal basis, but of all the chemical spills that have happened in the world, this is incredibly benign. 

Read through all the animal tests, the worst things that could happen are skin or eye irritation, and that's at high concentrations. It's not a carcinogen, it's not a nerve gas, everyone's going to be fine. 

The concentrations it needs to be at for it to be toxic in water are ridiculously high, and even as a precaution I imagine Sepulveda dam has been opened up to flush water more rapidly through the river.",t2_3a026,thanatossassin,0,1647613331.0,0,t1_i15mpmm,i15mpmm,False,Chanz,t3_tgf1d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/tgf1d1/electricchemical_smell_outside/,Electric/chemical smell outside?,/r/burbank/comments/tgf1d1/electricchemical_smell_outside/i15mpmm/,2,r/burbank,0,2

I don't want to discourage you but I produce a monthly stand-up show myself & it's very hard to find a venue in the area that isn't going to try to get ya on something. It took us 6 years of sell-outs  in different venues that incrementally gave us better deals until we finally proved ourselves enough to get a 100% door cut & no rental fee -- and only because we were able to get into a very prominent comedy club that sells overpriced drinks as their profit motive. I lost a not-insignificant amount of money (for me anyway) keeping the show afloat then. others mentioned the clubhouse & maybe that's the exception but very few places around here do anything for free anymore.,t2_121wo6,bwoodzilla,0,1647197084.0,0,t1_i0it3w7,i0it3w7,True,Testacc88,t3_td8pe6,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/td8pe6/community_spaces_in_la_that_allow_you_to_hold/,Community spaces in LA that allow you to hold music/comedy shows? no large booking fee,/r/burbank/comments/td8pe6/community_spaces_in_la_that_allow_you_to_hold/i0it3w7/,3,r/burbank,0,3

"My go to “fancy” restaurant is Kali in Hollywood. They are Michelin starred and pricey but not crazy. The food is delicious and not overly pretentious. Anajak Thai as someone mentioned is fantastic and not your average thai restaurant. It’s really a unique experience in what looks to be a regular thai restaurant. In Burbank, we do like the prime rib and martinis at smoke house. They have been around for ages and it has an old vibe to it. Kind of cool. Castaway is pretty, food is fine but nothing to write home about. Yuzu and Kabosu both have fantastic sushi if you’re from somewhere sushi isn’t readily available.

"Well, for one condos and apartments have different building codes. 

Second (and working in banking I’ve seen this), how many of these new condo owners could afford, or be able to borrow, $20k-$50k on a dime for an emergency repair required by the HOA? For example, at the Surfside condo in Florida that collapsed, a big issue that delayed repairs was the owners assessments ranging from $80,190 for one-bedroom units to $336,135 for the owner of the building's four-bedroom penthouse required to funds repairs that may have prevented the collapse. A corporation might be able to take out a single loan for repairs and spread that cost out over 30 years. 

There is a huge difference between renting and owning, and we saw the effects of making home loans to people who shouldn’t have qualified in 2008 already.

In addition to that, there’s townhomes which I’ve seen purchased and then put up for rent.

"First, I’m not sure you have the right to tell a homeowner who they can sell to. 

Let’s say this does pass and homeowners don’t contest it (I would), the problem you create is that it may be difficult or even impossible for new homeowners to get bank loans to purchase homes within Burbank because this condition essentially denies the bank the ability to foreclose on the property if the loan goes bad. 

Even if a carve out is made, by denying corporations the right to purchasing property, you throw the value into the wind because it’s not accurate now that you have taken out a portion of the demand. If Banks don’t know the accurate value, they can’t make a loan to a person to buy it. Because the selling restrictions is significantly different from the norm, the new purchase may not qualify for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans, which the vast majority of new home owners rely on.

Less than 50% of the homes in Burbank are owner occupied.

Don’t get me wrong, I also want to see us break away from single family homes and build denser houses…I’m just worried that anything we build will get snatched up by landlords and we’ll continue our trend towards all rentals.

Sure, there will always be renters, but I sincere doubt that over 50% of the people in Burbank WANT to rent.

"I agree with you, we need more housing.

But I also gotta say, adjusting supply/demand isn't the only way to reduce the price of ""any good.""

Sometimes prices are inflated because of an information gap. Prices for things that typically require a loan are greatly affected by interest rates. In medicine, your demand for any treatment that would save your life is infinite, and increasing the supply of doctors has historically increased overall health spending without a reduction in prices. Deregulation of the airline industry lead to falling prices, while deregulation of power companies has lead to price increases.

Supply/Demand is an important part of economics, and when it works it's cool because you don't have to do anything.

"Inflation was 7% on Average for 2021.  So yes wages are stagnant if they're not keeping up with inflation.

There are many reasons why home prices are what they are right now, IMO the biggest reason for the current high prices is low inventory.  Price is set by demand and if you have high demand and low supply the price goes up.

It is becoming increasingly more difficult for people who work in Burbank to be able to afford to live in the community.  I don't know if it's a good thing for the long term health of the city if the housing cost continues at the rate it's going.  If you're already a homeowner things are great, if you're a renter looking to buy it's pretty brutal.

Case in point, according to zillow, the average home value in January 2022 for Burbank was $1.12 million.  This is a year over year change of 18.3%. In 2012, the average home value was $481k.  So in 10 years the cost of a home in Burbank has more than doubled. 

Again this is great if you're an owner already, but trying to break into the market now is probably the most difficult it's ever been in Burbank.",t2_aq8qyq4q,Swimming-Ad4750,0,1646511990.0,0,t1_hzhq7sl,hzhq7sl,False,BzhizhkMard,t3_t7eovj,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/t7eovj/corporate_home_purchases/,Corporate Home Purchases,/r/burbank/comments/t7eovj/corporate_home_purchases/hzhq7sl/,8,r/burbank,0,8

"I almost rented a place that was brand new remodeled 1br/1ba in an old building in Burbank. Everything in it was new - they even took out walls and made it an open floor plan. It looked awesome - even better in person than in the photos. I happened to show up early before the landlord arrived and I spoke to another tenant who lived across from the vacant unit. In conversation, she offhand mentioned that her apt was fumigated again and again for roaches. Boy was I horrified. JUST before I left the showing for the new apt, as I was walking out the door, I recalled what the neighbor said and I decided to check inside the kitchen cabinets, just for the hell of it. 

In the brand new, pristine, not a speck of sawdust cabinets, were several dead roaches. Needless to say I did not apply.

"If you want to be proactive, get a jug of Neem oil at the hardware store or garden center and wash the floors with it before you move in to your new place.  Spray it in cupboards, under sinks, under the fridge.  It is not toxic.   If the place is carpeted, rent a carpet cleaner and neem the fuck out of that sucker.  

While you're living there, lavender oil diffuser, or peppermint oil  or citronella oil will work as bug repellents.  You can also get a couple of citronella plants.  

It's easier to keep bugs or spiders away than to get rid of them once they're around.  So be proactive.  If you have a couple of days before you move in, when you don't have to yet be out of your previous place, you could set off a couple of those bug-bomb foggers and let the place sit for 48 hours....but that's toxic stuff & you need to ventilate well a day after fogging.  Better to use them when the place is empty though, than later when you have cupboards full of food etc.

"So wouldn't the law actually protect transgender kids' rights to wear the clothes they wish?

The law doesn't prohibit clothing and I think it's just meant to ensure the parents are the ones having those sensitive talks with young kids.  

Anyone who has kids in Burbank Unified can tell you that it's cool to be LGBTQ.  Which is great that they are accepted!

"Because saying ""you can't talk about sexuality or gender"" is language that pretends to be balanced but specifically cuts out lgbtq culture. You don't have to talk about straight or cis culture, it's everywhere. Girls can wear dresses and boys can wear pants and we don't have to talk about it but that's an expression of gender. As soon as a boy shows up wearing a dress now we're having a conversation about gender (which won't be allowed).

"I too would like an answer to this question but I don't expect it to be logical.

Also, while I'm pro LGBTQ+ rights and gay marriage and anti team terf or whatever, I'm also curious why they call this the ""Don't say gay"" law.  [From NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/24/1082969036/florida-house-passes-controversial-measure-dubbed-the-dont-say-gay-bill-by-criti) it says the bill prohibits teachers from discussing sexuality or genders before the third grade.  That means they can't tell kids they're cis hetero any more then they can tell them they are not gay.  It seems more like a ""Don't talk about sexuality or gender with 3rd graders"" law and to me that doesn't seem something worth protesting for.  Maybe I'm missing something, I've only read the NPR article but I imagine that's more then most.

> Opponents — many of whom have taken to calling the measure the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill — say it will make life harder for LGBTQ youth, who already face a higher rate of bullying and a higher risk of suicide than their straight, cisgender peers.

> But the Republican sponsor behind HB 1557 says it aims to have schools teach gender and sexuality at an appropriate age and to keep parents informed about what's happening in the classroom.

> The legislation prohibits any instruction about sexuality or gender between kindergarten and third grade ""or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.""",t2_6tz8g,griffindj,1,1646363381.0,0,t1_hz9qcpl,hz9qcpl,False,Desperate-Ad-6463,t3_t64tp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/t64tp6/picketers_were_out_in_front_of_burbanks_disney/,"Picketers were out in front of Burbank's Disney Studios bringing attention to Florida's ridiculous ""Don't Say Gay"" law",/r/burbank/comments/t64tp6/picketers_were_out_in_front_of_burbanks_disney/hz9qcpl/,6,r/burbank,0,6

The Burbank north station is a couple blocks walk to the airport or a quick Uber, and I thibk that line comes from the Palmdale direction. You can also connect to those lines through Union Station if you are coming from a different direction, and usually metro passes do have some connecting bus lines included in the fare for the train if i recall.
