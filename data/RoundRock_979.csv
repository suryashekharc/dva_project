If the electrician calls in the inspection the same day he pulled the permit and started the work, you might save a day but a lot of guys won't call it in until the work is 100% and all of this is IF he is not busy and can start right away.

1-day acquire material and pull permit. (unless the electrician has all he needs on his truck).  Typically once you find an electrician and set a day to do the work, this will include getting the material the day before.

1-day do work

1-2 days inspection

1-day encore

"Electrician here, this is correct:

>Oncor says that they disconnected service and removed the meter and that it is my responsibility to contact a contract electrician to come out and effect some sort of unspecified repair. Then, after that, I'll have to go to the city to request an inspector come out to inspect the electrical service. If the city approves then TXU will get notified and I guess Oncor will then come out and reconnect me.

You own the panel, the meter base, and the drop from weatherhead, Oncor provides the wire from their pole to your drop.  If your part of the service is damaged, you will need to hire an electrician to come and rebuild it.  Call around and see if someone can come out soon.

"All through tornado alley when the alerts go off people dart to the windows. If they don't see anything nearby, life continues as normal.

The news alerts, the watches and warnings are amazing. They save a lot of lives. People can become more aware of their surroundings than ever before.  Weather radios, cell phones, computers, and assorted other devices all come to life the moment radar detects the circular wind.

With that extra awareness you get advance notice at recognizing when you need to take immediate action, like hearing the sirens while also hearing the low rumbling from the wind. They're great for that. 

You also can recognize when you merely need to be alert, hearing the phones go off but a glance at the window shows your trees and flags aren't blowing at all, so you need to keep an eye out, and take steps to make yourself mobile just in case the situation changes.

"Eh, I was single while living in NW Austin, and the folks I dated were fairly evenly distributed between Austin and the northern suburbs. Especially if you're open to online dating, finding folks to date if you want to date shouldn't be a problem. I ended up with a RR guy, so hey... worked for me.

Honestly, the traffic is the sticking point, and it's only going to get worse with everything they're building up here. I live right near the 35/45 flyover, and I almost never see traffic flowing smoothly any more. There's always some congestion there and then again a few exits down near Parmer. 

Ten years ago, I lived in NW Austin near the Arboretum and commuted down south every day to work near Ben White & 35 (south Austin). The commute sucked, but it sucked for about 45 minutes each way. I can't even imagine doing that now. I've spent 45 minutes pre-pandemic getting to work 10 miles away without ever hopping on a freeway. (Took me 15 minutes during the height of the pandemic.) If you can live close-ish to work, use all that free time you save with a shorter commute to go out and enjoy whatever you want to enjoy. Over time, you'll learn what areas to avoid when if possible, and you can get in and out of Austin easy enough when you want. Not as easily as before, but there are ways.

There are Austin-only purists out there who'll have you believe everything outside the city limits is a consumerist conglomerate-infested dumpster fire, but really you just need to get off 35 and look. (I have a cousin who always says she has to ""go north"" whenever she has to go beyond 183 with a uniquely disgusted look. It amuses me.) Austin does have some unique, fun stuff that you can go down and enjoy, but day-to-day life is good here, too.",t2_dknvv3qq,ListenRei,0,1647654106.0,0,t1_i18bt9r,i18bt9r,False,jlit35,t3_thcic8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/thcic8/moving_to_round_rock/,Moving to Round Rock!,/r/RoundRock/comments/thcic8/moving_to_round_rock/i18bt9r/,5,r/RoundRock,0,5

"You do not want to meet people in Round Rock’s downtown. Tried twice and no fucking thank you. The Domain is an even worse decision. Georgetown isn’t a thing. Yes dating is bad everywhere but Round Rock is still podunk burbs underneath all the new stuff they’ve built up over the past few years. 

If you’re making enough to deal with tolls I’d say something off the east side with easy access to downtown Austin and highway 130 is your best bet. 

I get you said you’re not a bar or club person but that’s exactly why you live close to Austin’s downtown. There’s so much food, live music, and other options on any night of the week in Austin. The only thing to do in Round Rock is drink. Food is subpar, the drinks aren’t as good as downtown Austin. I’d pay $13 for one amazing drink in Austin than $10 for some watered down version of a craft cocktail in RR. 

University is also the north most part of Round Rock before heading into Georgetown. There is nothing good up there. 

31 and single, go to the east side of Austin with easy access to 130 if you can afford it for sure. South to north is also the opposite way of traffic in the morning.

Round rock is far superior to Austin, it’s so close geographically, but so far away you don’t have to think about dealing with it. Avoid 35 at all costs, regardless of the time of day there are multiple spots that are consistently stopped due to the infrastructure that forces traffic onto it and bottlenecks the flow. Round rock has a couple of these places and it gets worse the further south you go.

It feels super safe, still plenty to do with Austin just a quick drive away for the weekends!

"when you say ""a note"" do you mean like a handwritten note? a citation?

if the latter, i imagine there is a phone number on it somewhere. call that number and ask what is going on, citing specifics like the identification number on the citation, name of the officer, location of the vehicle.

if the former, chuck it in the trash and go on about your life.

&#x200B;

edit: i just saw the image (was that there the whole time and i missed it, lol?). so,  the ""Reason Tagged"" says ""inoperable/flat tires/abandoned."" that is a generic message, covering a plurality of issues seen with vehicles on the side of the road and not an itemized list of what is wrong with your car.

peel off the sticker and move the car into your driveway for a couple months. that resets the clock on someone reporting it, heh. after a couple months, put it back in front of your house.

also, this is a legitimate sticker issued under the authority of RRPD by Code Enforcement. if you like, you can call RRPD and confirm its legitimacy. it is not, as some have suggested a clever ruse to ""phish"" you or some wily ne'er do well ""casing"" your property, lololol.",t2_3cw5w,buntaro_pup,0,1647363881.0,0,t1_i0rrrwl,i0rrrwl,True,valzi,t3_tescis,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/tescis/police_threatening_to_impound_based_on_obviously/,Police threatening to impound based on obviously false premise,/r/RoundRock/comments/tescis/police_threatening_to_impound_based_on_obviously/i0rrrwl/,4,r/RoundRock,0,4

"No, it is not ""close.""

The only Round Rock bus connecting to Howard Lane Station is from La Frontera. The earliest it leaves La Frontera is 6:53 am, and the latest it leaves Howard Lane Station is 7:30 pm; only on weekdays.

The Metro Rail takes 34 minutes from Howard Lane Station to Downtown Station. The bus from La Frontera takes 12 minutes. So 46 minutes from La Frontera of just travel time, not counting waiting in between, assuming no delays. Plus whatever time it takes to get to La Frontera, since there are no homes around there.

Not the case now.  Now it's Ikea, an outlet mall, some car dealerships, shopping centers, etc.  If you were from out of town you'd have no idea anyone cared it wasn't part of Austin.

"I'm not a councilor, not yet anyways. I do hope to become one, and I'm flattered by your words and glad to serve in any way I can. 

I started working on this when someone sent me a Instagram link from a resident who was really worried. I grew up around the guys who deal with this for a living, and while that doesn't make me an expert at all (really, I don't have much knowledge) it did give me an understanding of what they were saying and where they were coming from. 

I also understand the fear and frustration of the residents. When you hear phrases like ""total suspended solids"" it can seem like a deflection or like they are trying to complicate it. 

I don't understand the science well enough to explain all the terminology or why it matters how the poop floats/flows, but I do know that it does matter. And seeing it isn't reflective of the health of the water. You can have a turd floating down the stream and the water is safe, or you can have water that looks clean, but contains dangerously high levels of bacteria. 

I'm not an expert in waste management nor am I an environmental scientist. I just know people and how to see through the words they are saying to hear the words they are meaning. Wastewater management is extremely upset and stressed about this. They are taking the contamination and any harm caused by it extremely personally, it's weighing them a lot more then they can professionally say. They are also taking a lot of heat over this and that comes with its own set of anxiety, as if everything else wasn't enough.

And while the residents are coming across as angry they are afraid. They talked about tourism, property value, and wildlife conservation in the meetings, and while that does matter, they are scared for their health and the wellbeing of their kids, grandkids, pets, and neighbors. And they feel like, unless it's about the financial impact to the city, then no one cares. 

I think that this has really highlighted the elephant in the room. The residents don't feel like the city hears them or takes what they say seriously. They feel like no effort is being put into outreach, and when they do show up to speak, they feel like no one is listing. I know that isn't always the case, sometimes there isn't an answer available and other times it isn't possible to accommodate what has been asked for. But I do think there are ways we can help to bridge the communication gap.",t2_iuv3sw9x,RRs-Caitlin,0,1647038652.0,0,t1_i0au0kk,i0au0kk,False,buntaro_pup,t3_t82bqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/t82bqe/round_rock_wastewater_plant_seeing_increase_in/,Round Rock wastewater plant seeing increase in wastewater levels | kvue.com,/r/RoundRock/comments/t82bqe/round_rock_wastewater_plant_seeing_increase_in/i0au0kk/,3,r/RoundRock,0,3

"When a road is built the civil engineer (I have 20 years experience as a civil designer) will create plans for the proposed road. Every road is defined by a right of way. That is the boundary of the road. It can never become wider than the right of way. Then every road has a centerline within the right of way. The centerline is the basis for everything which is to be constructed. The centerline has what are called stations. The stations are spaced every 100' or 50' of road. Using these stations and ""offsets"" how far left or right of the centerline provides a sort of coordinate system to define lanes, curbs,  sidewalks, etc. Also water mains, sewer mains and storm drainage lines all have stationing. That is how the road features are conveyed to the contractor so he knows what to build. Here in Texas. TXDOT the Texas department of transportation has a set of standards for the construction of roads and all of the utilities that are associated with building a road. Everything that is called for on the plans must have a detail drawing showing all required elements of that particular feature. In other cases the municipality where the work is being done also has their own set of standards. Some are more comprehensive than others. Sometimes a plan must also be created to show what lanes must be closed and temporary construction traffic patterns. Other times the contractor will build to meet the plans while doing his best to maintain normal traffic. The plans tell the contractor what must be built. It is not permitted to dictate the ""means and methods"" of how he will actually conatruct the road. Normally they will take wooden stakes and the coordinates from stationing from the road centerline and put a stake where every part of the road such as start and end of turn lanes, sidewalks, light poles, etc. With his proposed road staked out he will lay his curb. Think of it as a mold for him to drop the road in. The road is constructed in 3 layers typically. A subgrade which is the sand, dirt, clay, etc that is naturally present that has been compacted  and stabilized 12"" thick for city roads and up to 3' thick for highways Then is the base, the base is crushed gravel graded to a specific size and also compacted and stabilized. Usually from 6""-12"" thick. Last is the asphalt.  The asphalt is usually 2 layers. The coats are called lifts. The first lift will be installed and compacted to a certain density. Then a tack coat will be applied which allows the second lift to adhere to the first. After the second lift has been compacted to 98% total density per AASHTO-T180 standard the road opens and you can drive on it",t2_gk0e2t8v,Key-Sun6443,0,1646987620.0,0,t1_i07w1c7,i07w1c7,True,ParkingWave5526,t3_tb7n35,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/tb7n35/progress_on_university/,Progress on University,/r/RoundRock/comments/tb7n35/progress_on_university/i07w1c7/,4,r/RoundRock,0,4

"I've spoken with the waste water department as well as some of the residents along the creek. 

The good news is:

• that the rate at which the water is flowing in from the leak means that it's unlikely to contaminate the ground due to the pressure of the incoming water.

• they have cameras already in the lines searching for any sign, both visual and sonar.

• it isn't because of the rapid development. Our metrics show that we are well below the threshold even with the projected development.

• Round Rock has a policy where contractors are to be held financially liable for any damage or stress caused to our infrastructure. (I don't know if it's being enforced yet)

The bad news is;

• The leak is likely directly under a large body of water, so a creek or pond 

• our wastewater plant is regional. We share it with 3 other cities, and all of them have to agree to any changes made above a set amount. 

• one of the cities isn't feeling cooperative.

• we don't have an accurate projected development from all of the cities.

• The TEQC standards are low enough that we should be asking that we pass a city ordinance to decrease the acceptable levels of all negative chemicals/bacteria.

And the biggest and most concerning is that the city hasn't been fully transparent. I have had some wonderful and honest conversations with our wastewater department and they are drowning. They are following, and where they have the budget to do so, exceeding all requirements. But those are the absolute minimum. We can, and should, ask for more. The wastewater team are working overtime, round the clock, and taking the brunt if the blame. While our plant is regional, it is owned and operated by Round Rock. 

I don't know how the cost is allocated. I will be asking more questions.

We can show the staff in the wastewater department our support. They are doing all they can within the parameters and budget set out for them. 

We need to demand more transparency from our city. 


I will be reaching out to the Austin Wastewater department and asking questions. I also have a contact in a wastewater department that I will be asking for clarification from.



What I think we should do is to have Austin send a consultant up to talk us through what's different and how we can achieve a higher quality of discharged water. Have an environmental study done by Texas state, through a grant, to make recommendations on what we can do to best preserve out waterways.",t2_iuv3sw9x,RRs-Caitlin,0,1646964636.0,0,t1_i06t93v,i06t93v,True,buntaro_pup,t3_t82bqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/t82bqe/round_rock_wastewater_plant_seeing_increase_in/,Round Rock wastewater plant seeing increase in wastewater levels | kvue.com,/r/RoundRock/comments/t82bqe/round_rock_wastewater_plant_seeing_increase_in/i06t93v/,4,r/RoundRock,0,4

"Oh, please no. We don't need even more pavement at the park.

The park doesn't need extra sidewalks. 

As someone who is there at least 3x/week for many years, we've seen plenty of encroachment, paving over of open spaces, and blocking off of space. It seems every new development comes with more fences, the new ""Apex Soccer Fields"" on the north meant another quarter mile of new fencing around the place, and more pavement. The northern tennis courts before that again turned the open grassy spaces into pavement with fences. 

The reworking of the southern soccer fields got some sidewalks, but also some more barriers preventing any use other than soccer.  The new pavilion and terraces added even more barriers, they claimed it was so cross-country runners would have better facilities, but the cross-country runners are now looking at different parks, including moving to the South Wilco Park over by Cedar Park as they destroyed it for existing park users.

"I was not given the opportunity to attend a university. I married my senior year and while I had planned to start classes that following semester, that's not how things worked out. The economy at the time was in a crisis and plans were set to the side. The marriage ended in speration, further delaying and complicating things.

I did, however, work in some of the most socioeconomically depressed child care centers in the area. I took every class and training available, with a focus on special needs and trauma. 

We need to recognize that a university education is not the only way to become a professional. Apprenticeships, on the job experience, and internships are valuable and underrated forms of education. Trade skills are a dying art, and leading to a shortage of skilled craftsman. 

I have no shame in the education or skills that I have gained or how I have gotten here. 


As for volunteering;
Through highschool I volunteered at every available opportunity. I exceeded 100 hours per school year in my community, I raised money for the Ronald McDonald house, I researched native plants, worked with a team that organized a reforestation effort that resulted in the planting of 140 trees, developed programming for child engagement in nature and history for Pioneer Farms, and volunteered as a docent at Pioneer farms (2005 - 2018). As I mentioned above, what followed graduation was turbulent at best, so my volunteer service was limited to what was already part of my established routine.

In 2018 I had to step back from all volunteer and career work for medical reasons. I began searching for new opportunities in late 2019, as I had recovered and felt that myself and my family were in a good place. Unfortunately 2020 brought the Covid 19 pandemic.

I made masks and hair wraps for law enforcement and medical professionals, as well as making and donating enough masks to fully supply all our local postal workers.

I dedicated my time to helping parents work through the sudden and unexpected homeschooling situation the found themselves in, finding them resources, virtual social opportunities.

During the winter storm (2021) I prepared hot meals for neighbors without power and carried water to neighbors without.

I have been working with a group to help bridge the communication gap between LGBTQIA children and their parents. Acting as a safe go between to help parents understand the social and emotional struggles their children face, and helping children understand the confusion and fear their parents are experiencing. This is still developing, so I will not provide any further details. 

I'm also deeply involved in Round Rock Pride and dedicated much of my time to them. 

I didn't put these in my bio because I didn't do them for the credit. I didn't do them for attention. I did them because I believe in my community. I care about the people here. I did them as an investment in tomorrow. I never expected thanks. 

My dad always said ""Kindness with a motive is never kindness. Charity with expectations is no charity at all. The ones who make the world better are the ones who do so quietly, consistently, and selflessly."" I took these words to heart and strive to be humble and practice gratitude and humility.

"This got a lot more of a response then I expected. 

I'm going to just answer it here in one comment instead of trying to answer everyone individually.


I miss when my oldest was little and couldn't sleep and we would walk up and down main street and sit in the plaza. We tried that with the youngest and a fight broke out in the middle of the street. This was around 8:30-9 on a weeknight. 

I feel like, for as much as my taxes have gone up in the last year, we are somehow getting less. I'm sure some of that is this is because of the pandemic, but while we used to enjoy Pokemon hunting after the library and stopping for ice cream, I feel like I'm taking my kids to classic 6th Street in Austin. When I was in middle school there was a coffee shop down town that we would go to, my boyfriend in highschool used to hang out at the library until it closed and then walk home, we'd stop at the Snack Shack for Dr Pepper and Cheetos. 

I remember falling in creek near the sam bass because I was trying to prove I wasn't scared of anything (in this case a snake) and they had to hose me off before we could go for coffee. 

When we bought I had hoped my kids would have similar freedom to explore safely, and at first it was true, now we have to leave when we can hear the bars. I'm also heartbroken over Wag•a•Bag. I remember bailing my sister out of trouble by picking her up at the one on Mays and Logan to get she and her friend home before her friends parents got back. 

I feel like Round Rock is becoming an extension of Austin and not the ""Mildly Weird"" town I fell in love with and made so many memories in.


I lived in Austin, too, and I watched as it eroded into what it is now.

"It is meaningless. All the sympathies and sanctions will not save Ukraine now, The Russian military is rolling over each village, town and city like an unstoppable tsunami. After Ukraine falls, Putin will enact his combination of eliminating the opposition and propaganda making it look like the Ukrainians welcome the Russians as saviors. This is what he did when he invaded Georgia, the Crimea and the Dombass region of Ukraine. And all this sympathy will be forgotten because we have short term memory and are impotent and led by an impotent president. Evil prevails when good men stand aside.

Edit: And this isn't over. Putin's ambition is to bring back all the breakaway Soviet republics back into Russia. Because some of those have ties to the US, Putin will have to pre-emptively nuke the US military. This won't be the end of the world because he just has to nuke enough of the US military to keep it from being able to challenge Russia. He bets Biden will not pull the trigger in response because Biden will be afraid to nuke the innocent people in Russia. Putin doesn't fear Biden at all. It looks like we will have to wait until then to finally stand up against Putin.

This isn't all. China just made a statement that the US support of Taiwan is futile after the Ukraine invasion. They see Putin's success as a framework for invading Taiwan. Several countries around there have pledged military support for Taiwan that we have ties with, so we will definitely be pulled into WWIII there. The only question is if we get nuked by Putin first or not, and if we will have a president who won't run away.",t2_4a296,sangjmoon,0,1646344453.0,0,t1_hz8kuae,hz8kuae,True,War_Daddy_992,t3_t5fvgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/t5fvgs/should_the_water_towers_light_be_changed_to_blue/,Should the Water tower’s light be changed to blue and yellow for Ukraine?,/r/RoundRock/comments/t5fvgs/should_the_water_towers_light_be_changed_to_blue/hz8kuae/,6,r/RoundRock,0,6

Moved here a few years ago from North Austin and was honestly concerned RR lacked diversity.

"I grew up here. I used to be able to see from my grandparents' house at the corner of Sunrise and Greenfield all the way to Robertson Elementary. When we got a Wal-Mart (now Gold's Gym) it was a huge deal.  We had a lot of local businsses that are gone now- Joe's Comics on Main, a couple doors down from El Matador.  We had Alvin Ord's, Young at Heart Toys, and when Movies 8 opened we no longer had to drive into Austin to see a new film.  

Some things are better now- the play for all abilities park is a wonderful place to take kids.  The dog park is also great to have.  I shed a tear, though, that there are no more diving boards at the old public pool, but hey, Waterpark at Old Settler's.  No more Sam Bass Shootout, either.  Main Street seems like it's 2/3 bars.  Round Rock High School is almost unrecognizable with its coffee shop, ATMs, and massive new buildings.  Not that we don't have more schools now so my kids will likely go to schools that didn't exist when I graduated rather than be Dragons.

Times have changed, as they are wont to do.  I lament those vestiges of my childhood that are fewer with each passing year, and make every attempt to embrace those things that are demonstrably better.

I went to a football game to see a young woman on the 8th grade team, kicking all manner of ass.  A young student who was by all appearances male at birth was sporting makeup that was spot-on and cheering their heart out to the adoration of their classmates. Students had what in my day would have gotten them sent to the office for ""unnatural"" hair colors or ""distracting"" hair styles.

Oh, for that freedom in 1987.  That support, that ability to be who one was inside, instead of conforming to avoid the bully's fist or the administration's ire.  The library staff at RRHS now runs a small comic con and the staff cosplays right alongside the students.  Back in the day Dr. H. Lynn Russell would have identified such behavior as subversive, Satanic, and possibly Communist.

So maybe I can't grab a couple comics at Joe's then walk over to El Mat for hugs from Ms. Helen, a bag of pralines from Mr. Jimmy, and a Senor Special.  But I can rest assured the kids are going to be all right.",t2_3uefiqj4,TheOldDragoon,0,1646160162.0,0,t1_hyxzuyp,hyxzuyp,True,RRs-Caitlin,t3_t3xet5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/t3xet5/what_changed/,What changed?,/r/RoundRock/comments/t3xet5/what_changed/hyxzuyp/,9,r/RoundRock,1,9

The unrestrained growth really puts a strain on the roads and public spaces   What used to feel like having the park practically to yourself is now shared with thousands of other people any given day.

The terrible driving manners, lack of right of way, people making their own mistake everyone else's, and unapologetic attitude while doing any and all of the above really cramp the styles of other drivers.

"Ah, that's pretty easy to replicate - you'll probably strike out if you're looking for a *cabinet* person - you basically need a carpenter/handyman/woodworker. 

They'll do something like this:

1. Measure the thickness of the wood of your other doors. (Do this yourself)
2. Try to find those hinges and door knobs (if you can, it'll probably save you money)/ if you want a drawer instead, they'll find side mounted drawer rails (also DIY source able if you want)
3. Cut a wood door to fit that opening. (Measure that yourself)
4. Cut 'millwork' or 'trim' or 'moulding' that has that pattern to length with 45 degree angles- [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Woodgrain-Millwork-WM-366-11-16-in-x-2-1-4-in-x-84-in-Primed-Finger-Jointed-Casing-Molding-Door-Pack-10001390/202086608](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Woodgrain-Millwork-WM-366-11-16-in-x-2-1-4-in-x-84-in-Primed-Finger-Jointed-Casing-Molding-Door-Pack-10001390/202086608) is pretty close except the top part has an extra groove.

"Hi,I love open forums and town hall meetings. I feel they are a vital part of city governance. As an elected official you are an employee of the citizens, these meetings should happen regularly in the same way performance reviews are done. They also give officials a way to hear many different views and experiences that may not have happened otherwise, as people are not always comfortable speaking on non-agenda items.

Town halls can be done with a full quorum present and still comply with OMA. That would mean that the council could not respond immediately to any questions or comments made, but that may actually be for the benefit of the speakers that no one is trying to calculate a response as opposed to listening to what is actually being said.

Now, to answer the specific point you were asking about I have several things I want to see done.

Ideally the Youth commission would be a volunteer group that consists of city representatives, community members, educators, and youth, and it would oversee several programs, namely;

1.) A Youth Council made up of children from within our community between the ages of 14 and 18. I do not want this done through RRISD as that would be a limited representation of the true diversity of our community. Round Rock has a large homeschool population and multiple charter schools. All of our youth deserve an equal voice no matter the educational career they are following. The youth council will function much as the city council, with monthly meetings and peer elections. They wouldn't be able to approve any project or legally vote, but would advise the city council, draft proposals, and participate in the organization and execution of city events.

2.) A volunteer database linked to the city website that ranges in tasks from graffiti removal to junior camp counselors. This page should have a recommended (or required in some instances) minimum age and recommended group size for larger projects. It should allow for dates to be scheduled as opposed to set times as often as possible.  One other aspect that I feel should be strongly considered is to allow 'applications for assistance' to be submitted by members of the community. This would allow our elders to request assistance on menial tasks, and for the youth to get credit for completing it.

3.) Community service awards. There should be two categories of awards one being application based and without a cap, the other being by nomination only. The application awards would be determined based off of community service hours completed. The nomination awards would be based on nomination, divided by category, and would be up to the review of the Youth Council.

4.) I want a complete financial study done to see what the cost would be to the city if youth between the ages of 16 and 18 could have their membership fees waved for the Rec Center, or if we could have an alternate, limited membership that they could access. I would also like to have a study and review done in collaboration with Capital Metro to see how we can make our community spaces more accessible geographically to younger people who have limited or no transportation.  I would also request a study be done on the cost vs reward of creating community clubhouses for some of our outlying neighborhoods and add and ordinance that any new residential development have recreation spaces included in their community development plan.

&#x200B;

Admittedly this third proposal would require a great deal of review before it could be put into practice, if it's feasible at all. Taxes and home affordability is already an enormous issue for Round Rock, and while our youth deserve the very best that we, as a community, can offer there is no point in pushing through ideas that would further the challenges that we are already facing.

&#x200B;

I feel that we could get community partnerships for the awards each year, and the Youth Commission should have a minimal impact, if any at all, if put into practice properly.

&#x200B;

I hope that helps to answer your question, and if there was anything else, please feel free to reach out.",t2_iuv3sw9x,RRs-Caitlin,0,1645835573.0,0,t1_hygca8t,hygca8t,False,Ionopsis,t3_t1afn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/t1afn3/a_new_contender_is_now_challenging_rene_flores/,A new contender is now challenging Rene Flores for seat 2 of the Round Rock Council: Caitlin Leggett,/r/RoundRock/comments/t1afn3/a_new_contender_is_now_challenging_rene_flores/hygca8t/,12,r/RoundRock,0,12

Sunrise and University? I think what is happening is that the traffic control plan and sequence of construction wasn't quite compatible with the diverging diamond intersection at IH-35. They almost have the westbound lanes done and will flip back over to finish paving on the eastbound. You can tell when another lift of paving is going to happen if the pavement is down an inch or two from where it meets the curb. People need to quit running the lights and stacking up. That's not the contractor's fault.

"[Bell's Gaming Center](https://www.bellsgc.com/) basically across the highway from Rogue's Gallery has regular Magic events.  


If you're willing to drive, [Emerald Tavern](https://www.emeraldtaverngames.com/) is pretty awesome for all things gaming, including Magic with great food and drinks.  [Dragon's Lair](https://www.dlair.net/austin/) is great, too, but without the food and drink.  


[Mothership](https://mothershipatx.com/) is a little closer than Emerald Tabern and Dragon's Lair, but also smaller.  Very friendly owners that are always there (also, woman-owned).  I can't find their events page, but I know they have MTG events weekly.  


My wife used to play Magic a lot -- I never got into it, myself, but I do enjoy lots of other card games and board games (Netrunner, Legend of the Five Rings, and games like Star Wars: Rebellion, and Unfathomable etc.) so I'm a bit familiar with the local community but YMMV.

"Progressive Christianity looks beyond the text to try add interpretation that isn't spelled out in the Bible or its historical context often to fit post-modern liberalism. If this is what you are looking for, I think you are going to have a hard time. All the churches I've attended concentrate on the Bible being the truth and using historical context to make sure that the literal wording isn't mistaken for the truth. This means things like abortion and homosexuality are considered going against God's word. It doesn't mean that people who believe in things like legal abortions or are homosexuals aren't welcome to attend, but their beliefs will be explicitly considered against God.
