"There's something to be said about policing, specifically, dirty bike riders. Long Island police do not tolerate this. But NYPD are normally no where to be found (sometimes).

This happened last summer (will find article to support).

But a few bikers from Queens, crossed into the Elmont, Long Island border to buy gas for their bikes and ATV at a gas station. Out of no where, Nassau County police squad vans pulled up while they were fueling up. 

Long story short, before they were able to cross back into Queens, Nassau County confiscated their dirt bikes, issued tickets, and messed up their evening. 

They didn't plan to ride in Long Island (I don't think). They were just getting gas. But they crossed into Long Island which have zero tolerance for such act and were ALL busted.

"> What kind of psycho‚Ä¶

Me.

So it might surprise you, but I don‚Äôt consider it immoral and I don‚Äôt consider it pointless to dispose of a killer.

We disagree on these things, because we hold different values. And our values take us in different directions. 

I think preserving the life of an aggressive killer, and asking society to support that aggressive killer with housing, food, and therapy is inappropriate.

We have all experienced a bad day, and most of us never felt like shoving an elderly person onto concrete during our bad days. We can stay in society, because we don‚Äôt harm others, especially the vulnerable and frail elders.

"STFU.
That shit is horrible and it is the City's job to ensure everyone's safety. I am not Asian, and I recognize the fear in Asian people's faces. I am scared for old Asian ladies. 

I was on 40th St. LIC above ground station and this young black?latino? guy, clearly mentally ill, started chasing this older Asian man, who jumped in the tracks and ran to the other platform to get away. An express train came through just as he got to the other platform. How is this/that much different then lynching? To live in fear. I don't like it. What the fuck type race dynamics are going on? Like a whistle mentally ill people really just heard in the night. This idiot Trump.said China Flu and we were transported to San Fransciso and Chinese immigrants were building the railroad. I have never seen racial hate just reveal itself like that. I was also  on a train where this mentally ill white women was going off about the China Flu ... Yo! I LOVE THE NYPD ON THE TRAINS NOW,  their was that NYC train silence, this grown Asian woman was cowering as this raggedy bitch walked up and down the car speaking crazy for a stop. I also had to check this bitch at work last year 'cuz she started taking about Asian people being ""nasty"" because their ""wet markets"". I told a. ""I'm not with that kind of talk"" and 2. WHERE DO YOU THINK MOST OF THE WORLD IS BUYING THEIR FOOD, AT PATHMARK? Where do you think people brought food before Associated?

Anyway. I like to think of myself as ""progressive"",   and it does bother me a whole population in my city is living in fear. Like that 11%  American ""population"" is like 1/2 the entire planet's population. Critical Race Theory discussions aside for later, this is not the NYC I want to live in if on ethnic group is being targeted. 

Hearing the experiences of Asians makes me feel more like I have a responsibility to do something, say something, because it is wrong. It sounds dumb but hearing their experiences gives others the courage to step up, because it's not right. It's not.

"Oh i think she is guilty. But unless there is a video of the attack they have not yet released.. I don‚Äôt think she is going to be ruled guilty. 

The description she matches is the one made by the victim as she lay dying of a head wound. There is plenty of evidence that puts pazienze in the area, but that doesn‚Äôt link her to the crime, it‚Äôs manhattan there‚Äôs people everywhere.

As for her behavior after.. she was in a ‚Äòphysical altercation‚Äô with her fiance, went home with him then went to her mom‚Äôs house, tossed her phone, deleted the wedding website and her social media.. all things someone would do if their fiance dumped them. She also quit a job and deleted linked in, which are more weird but all she has to say is the fiance confessed to being attracted to her coworker in the argument and that kinda makes sense too, at least enough to establish reasonable doubt. Also she has no priors and the video of her walking away looking unaffected plays more like someone who didn‚Äôt just kill someone. 

Im inclined to think she knocked her over for her cab and looked unaffected cause she is a sociopath.. but i have been knocked over by someone stealing a cab while i was on the way to the hospital.. so i think its not unlikely behavior.

Anyway its hard to get a conviction and without a video itll be hard to even establish she was even knocked over on purpose.

"> that helps minimize use of system resources

Minimizing system resources shouldn't be the goal; using resources adequately and effectively should be.

And yes, there *are* alternatives *which adequately and effectively use system resources* and can incentivize (not ensure-- not even cash bail does that) showing up to court.

Some of these alternatives include things like targeting common reasons people skip their court date in the first place-- such as not having transportation or not having a good advocate (it's not always because they want to skip out on prison). Other alternatives include things like supervised release, where someone can ensure this person is not fleeing or intending to skip their court date.

[Here's a paper with many examples](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/99166/supporting_individual_agency_in_the_pretrial_release_process.pdf)

[Here's another example from NYC that has had success](https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/Supervised-Release-Brief-2017.pdf)

And of course, sometimes people just shouldn't be released if they pose a real danger to the public or have a high chance of fleeing. This isn't affected by money anyway-- if someone wants to flee, they would flee even if they have money at stake.

I know there are some who will take the knee-jerk reaction that this is just letting people go and asking them nicely to come back and that will never work-- but that's not really the case. I hope anyone looks over the data for themselves and sees that while no system is perfect, we *can* improve the inherently classist one we currently have.",t2_70s5p,sonofaresiii,0,1648262714.0,0,t1_i25d8xe,i25d8xe,False,terryjohnson16,t3_tnybja,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/tnybja/suspect_in_87yearold_grandmothers_nyc_shove_death/,"Suspect in 87-year-old grandmother's NYC shove death released from Rikers on $500,000 cash bail",/r/nyc/comments/tnybja/suspect_in_87yearold_grandmothers_nyc_shove_death/i25d8xe/,5,r/nyc,0,5

I think people are really seeing it now. The people who issue the money are the ones that own the media that:

1. tell young people to take on debt to go to school

2. so they can learn the dictated curriculum

3. and get jobs in companies owned by the institutions

4. to get money to spend on rent to the institutions, or put it down to take another loan from the institution to ""buy"" property, which is often not property, but a share of corporation granting rights to reside on premises but without a rights to the underlying land

"The short? Not immediately. The longer, is that it's going to push a lot of people who live in the city to the outer boroughs into those neighborhoods with robust transit options, which will then in turn push rental prices upward, may cause rental prices to fall temporarily in the city, and then those who realized that they are spending more on cabs due to congestion pricing and those who realize that they can get a relative bargain in the new era, will return. That will set off rent increases and the cycle will start again with a new issue to be centered around.

"First, don't shoot the messenger here. I am only providing information. Second you should understand innocent until proven guilty. If she is out on bail, she is just not in jail pending further legal proceedings. Whether it goes to trial, gets pleaded down, or they drop the charges altogether depends on the evidence, And from what I have seen, there is no firm eyewitness evidence or video evidence that shows her committing an assault on the woman. All the evidence is circumstantial. It places her near the scene at the time and her later behavior can be interpreted as a guilty mind. She has already been tried and convicted in the press, but her history is not admissible in a trial. Unless there is some forensic evidence, like fibers from her outfit that are found on the victim, or an eyewitness who can unimpeachably recount that he saw her push the victim, this is not an easy case for the prosecution. Lots of people were in the vicinity of the victim around the time of the attack. It took place in Manhattan. My own feeling is she probably did it, but if all  the prosecution has is video tape of her on the street watching the ambulance arrive and then holing up in her parents house, erasing her social media accounts, that probably won't be enough for soberminded jurors to convict.",t2_ek75fwsf,DirtyFacet,0,1648260341.0,0,t1_i258m7t,i258m7t,False,terryjohnson16,t3_tnybja,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/tnybja/suspect_in_87yearold_grandmothers_nyc_shove_death/,"Suspect in 87-year-old grandmother's NYC shove death released from Rikers on $500,000 cash bail",/r/nyc/comments/tnybja/suspect_in_87yearold_grandmothers_nyc_shove_death/i258m7t/,2,r/nyc,0,2

"Good point. Let's dig in:

When people think or say ""crime"", I find they tend to think robbery, drugs, murder; not embezzlement, conspiracy to steal an election, dark money, human trafficking, crimes that require off shore bank accounts, etc.

People who make that knee jerk assumption that crime/criminals = poor, usually, underneath it all, also think criminals are predominantly black/brown. However, race is a lazy way to generalize class/money (which separates us from them and unless you have $$$, you are not one of them, your part of the larger ""us"" so yoir anxiety gor you thinking you can clearly denote the profile of a crimal (poor, probably black or brown). It's the money that keeps the ""real criminals"", like the Sackler's out profiting and killing more people than any random inmate at Riker's where this bitch should be.

"We live in a country where we presume innocent until proven guilty, which means if you don't have the funds we are imprisoning Innocent people. And it's not just a theoretical moral argument there are hundreds of thousands of totally  innocent people in jail.

https://www.gq.com/story/abolish-cash-bail

Let's say as we have seen some bail reform means some people who are actually guilty go free. Well for most cases that's okay because most crimes are non violent even so. 

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/20/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/ft_20-11-12_crimeintheus_1/


So the question you have to ask yourself on the question of bail reform is are you okay with harming lots of innocent people to make sure some percentage of bad guys don't get out or is the risk worth it?

I don't know the correct answer for anyone but most people on the bail reform see the harm of the government having the ability to imprison innocent lives and the harm that does as worse than the risk of one innocent live caused by a criminal who was accidentally let out",t2_5oq4j,unknownz_1,0,1648256219.0,0,t1_i2504xa,i2504xa,False,terryjohnson16,t3_tnybja,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/tnybja/suspect_in_87yearold_grandmothers_nyc_shove_death/,"Suspect in 87-year-old grandmother's NYC shove death released from Rikers on $500,000 cash bail",/r/nyc/comments/tnybja/suspect_in_87yearold_grandmothers_nyc_shove_death/i2504xa/,16,r/nyc,0,16

"**[Depraved-heart murder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depraved-heart_murder)** 
 
 >In United States law, depraved-heart murder, also known as depraved-indifference murder, is a type of murder where an individual acts with a ""depraved indifference"" to human life and where such act results in a death, despite that individual not explicitly intending to kill. In a depraved-heart murder, defendants commit an act even though they know their act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to a person. If the risk of death or bodily harm is great enough, ignoring it demonstrates a ""depraved indifference"" to human life and the resulting death is considered to have been committed with malice aforethought.
