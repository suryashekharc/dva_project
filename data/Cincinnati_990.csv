"It's more of a hyperbole, but i don't really see any other event bringing down housing prices in my lifetime. I think I've just been so pessimistic about the future I just can't imagine the housing market improving.

 The rich will block any attempt to legislate the housing market to benefit single-home owners because that'll bite into their wallets, they'll hamstring any attempt to lower the cost of homes because it's devaluing their assets, they'll leverage their current holdings to get crazy low interest rates to secure more properties further strangling the home supply. 

Meanwhile nobody is building cheap housing because there is no margin for profit, currently cheap properties are locked into a spiral of ever worsening conditions. Or cheap properties are getting bought cheap, having rents raised to cover the costs of renovations, the property is sold after it is fixed for a higher price, and then rents are raised by the new owner to cover the now high price tag of buying the newly renovated property, and then as the surrounding area is further gentrified they raise rents again because lo and behold the area is now an upscale yuppie playground. 

I'm approaching 30, have a college degree, a decent paying job with good benefits and the only way i can afford to save for a home while paying loans is to live with 2 other guys. The prospect of renting alone feels like fiscally stupid because any passable living space will basically ensure my savings will turn into a miniscule trickle. 

Now as i watch homeowners react to the low interest rates banks that were prescribed by tacking on 30, 40, 50k to the price of their home I'm furious. Even when we do manage to get an artificially low interest rate to help people out, it's not just corporations, but people who turn around and abuse the system to screw home buyers again. 

My options are pay out the ying yang to secure a house, or move to bumfuck egypt where property values haven't gone insane. So yes, i fantasize about a housing market crash dropping prices where i could secure a nice modest home for a deal, or honestly even just the realistic value of the home. Is it the most educated, thought out, defensible position? No. But year after year i see how greed has ensured my life will be a battle in nearly every way imaginable.",t2_1ztrjhs5,tryingtocopeviahumor,0,1648267206.0,0,t1_i25le18,i25le18,False,leap_year-2016,t3_tnpizz,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/tnpizz/llcs_who_bought_at_least_10_properties_in/,LLCs who bought at least 10 properties in Hamilton County since Jan 2020,/r/cincinnati/comments/tnpizz/llcs_who_bought_at_least_10_properties_in/i25le18/,1,r/cincinnati,0,1

I don't doubt that the scene was far better in the 2000s than it is now, sadly I was in elementary school when The Void closed. It's probably nothing like it was back then but there's still a scene mostly in Northside bars and the aforementioned places.

"**[Carew Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carew_Tower)** 
 
 >Carew Tower is a 49-story, 574-foot (175 m) Art Deco building completed in 1930 in the heart of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, overlooking the Ohio River waterfront. The structure is the second-tallest building in the city, and it was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks on April 19, 1994. The tower is named after Joseph T. Carew, proprietor of the Mabley & Carew department store chain, which had previously operated in a building on the site. The complex contains the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza (formerly Omni Netherland Plaza), which is described as a fine example of Art Deco architecture.

"The house I'm renting in North college hill got bought last month. On Friday the 11th I got notified via a letter taped to my door (in the 10 minutes I was at Walgreens on lunch, I wfh) that I was also getting a new property management company. It took dialing the extension on the letter, leaving a vm, then having messages sent by the people at the leasing extension + emails every business day since then to get a lease signed today. When I turned away the Vinebrook Homes maintenance man who had showed up at 11am unannounced to change my locks, my neighbor asked if that's who my new management company was and I confirmed, she strung together more curses in one sentence than I've heard from a sailor.

Sorry not sorry for the run on sentence wall of text but I'm MAD, DAMNIT.

Just went to a hardcore/power violence show at The Nest a few weekends ago. To say nothing of the UC kids regularly throwing shows up there. 

In fact, literally this weekend there's a benefit show at The Nest with a bunch of hardcore bands like Slutbomb and Butcher's Dog as well as a funky punk band called Sweet Action playing one of the UC houses. You can find all this stuff by looking up the bands on Instagram. 

Besides those bands the cinci punk and indie bands I know of include Voice Of God, Body Farm, Run Rabbit Run, Arlen Gun Club, Gnarkan, The Mimes, and Piss Flowers, there's more too. Idk where all these dooming comments are coming from, those bands are all active and have played shows within the past month.

"To me, this is an issue of regulation and corporate irresponsibility much more than its about making the cops hold teenagers accountable through legal actions.

On the other hand, kids are going to be kids. I've also seen almost as many drunken adults be just as reckless with them. Making kids who just see a fun thing to play with responsible for corporate malfeasance, laziness, and greed is just more class and race warfare IMO. If an accident involves someone mishandling an unregulated public access scooter, the company who made it should be held fiscally responsible.

"Yeah, 90% of the riders in OTR are between 10-16yo.  I'm sure they are using parents' accounts in order to rent them, or simply falsifying information.  I've had the same issues as OP with nearly being run over by them on sidewalks (I also see plenty of adults riding in sidewalks, which pisses me off too) and watching them careen recklessly the wrong way on streets, through flowerbeds in parks, etc.

Ultimately the companies aren't interested in enforcing the rules, because they already did their legal CYA in their terms of service.  If someone gets hurt, they will just point to their TOS and say, ""Look, we told them not to do that!""  So I agree with OP that this needs to be an intervention from law enforcement to start ticketing for reckless behavior, underage riders, etc. Or Cincinnati does what some other cities have done and bans them altogether.  I was initially very against banning them, but now after having been nearly clipped by kids on scooters dozens of times in the past year, I probably would support it - although my fear is that these kids would just convince their parents to go buy them their own scooters (some already have) and continue their reckless behavior.

Over salted, unhealthy, low quality food just isn't in anymore so I echo your comment about not being too sad about it. All the restaurants were the same - chain american food or fried chicken. When you have CFA, Slim chickens, Cane's, Joella's, Popeyes, KFC, 3x Wendys, etc. within a mile and they all sell the same thing....it shouldn't be a surprise when they don't all survive.

You have a business, hint at vague future work, want someone who is ""building a portfolio"" - all of these scream that you will argue over any charges. You sound like someone who will try to convince the photographer that you can give them ""exposure"" that will be more valuable than cash.

I recommend any photographer that works with you has a signed contract for a decent fee before taking the first picture. 

I also suggest you pay for a tripod (though the required $30 does seem to be more than you're ready to pay for this) and take the pictures yourself with your Canon T6.

"Yes most condos will have a monthly HOA fee and they vary greatly. Some places around town will charge over $1000 a month if they have amenities.

Where we live the HOA is $250 a month and that includes maintenance of the building, trash, water, sewage, a storage unit in the basement, and one gated parking spot in OTR.

"This is an incomplete picture, though. The area is absolutely (over?)saturated with restaurants, some are bound to fail. Some were just coincidence, i.e. Flipdaddy's went under in all locations,  and some you've listed are long-gone. The only one listed that's a true COVID casualty is the Jason's which opened at exactly the wrong moment, but honestly idk how hard they tried, given I've seen others around them succeed.

Post-COVID staffing shortages have been a problem. Red Robin closed for awhile because of them and I was a little surprised to see them reopen. I thought that might be what happened to the White Castle.

In the end, I'm not worried about a few, often mediocre chains closing in the area. There's a great deal of food diversity up here and I'd much rather support that. I'm much sadder about the (absolutely COVID-related) loss of Bao Bun Bowl and Empanadas Aqui. 

So maybe something else is changing, as the area grows, now that I put it that way. Ever so sightly less tolerance for the typical suburban chains and a little more hunger for local, diverse cuisine?

"The point is that if you put a cap on how much rent can increase in a given time frame, landlords who otherwise only raise rent once a decade are now going to raise it by the maximum every single year.  

And then you have landlords that will play ""catch up"" every time a tenant moves out, so it encourages landlords to cycle through tenants because it means that they can raise rent each time.  If being an asshole landlord means that you go a month without a tenant but the next one is paying a few hundred dollars more it makes it more profitable to do so.

"More or less all ""symptoms"" were over within two to three months. After the first two weeks everything was pretty much fine or easily manageable.  The ""halos"" while driving at night were basically nonexistent after about two to three months but really after the first week they weren't so bad that I felt uncomfortable or unsafe driving. I probably only used eyedrops for dryness a few times per week during months two and three post op, definitely not every day. 

The only things I've noticed as side-effects were that my eyes tended to ""tear up"" more in cold weather than in years past and I get a bit more ""eye strain"" if staring at my computer monitor for long periods of time. But neither one of those things isn't manageable.

You just have to have a library card and check for reservations several days out. I would start checking now for what is available next week.

If you want to do a day trip, the Indianapolis Children's museum is amazing and they just reopened their dinosphere exhibit. They have indoor at outdoor spaces that are so engaging! You could spend a day there and still not see everything. (if you are going to Indy, check out the Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park, too). 
For Hamilton County Parks, there is so much to do at Sharon Woods, Winton Woods, and the Highfield discovery garden at Glenwood Gardens is lovely.
