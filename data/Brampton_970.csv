"Slightly off topic but download the A1 Taxi app and take taxis over Ubers or at least compare the prices. I used to strictly take Lyft/Ubers but when comparing the prices lately, taxis end up actually being so much cheaper. you can order taxis on the A1 app and track it, as well as see price estimates - it's not as smooth as Lyft/Uber apps but the money saved is crazy.

for example: Saturday I went to the TFC match at BMO field. There was 4 of us - standard Uber/Lyft still are only taking 3 passengers (no one allowed in the front seat). looked at an XL and it was $99. Got a van taxi for $75.00. Probably could have gotten a flat rate for $65 but I forgot to ask. Similar situation when I was in Toronto.

"To elaborate on this, Bike Brampton has a few opportunities that might be of interest to you (I'm not affiliated with them at all, btw).  These are all free (as in paid for by sponsors and probably your delicious, delicious tax dollars)

- Bike the Creek - June 18th - http://bikebrampton.ca/events/bike-the-creek/ - Annual event with routes around Brampton that focus on the N/S bicylce pathways in the city.  Skill levels and lengths of the routes vary (5 km Fmaily Ride to 65+ km rides)
- Community Rides - They used to run these every 2 weeks or so, all around the different communities in Brampton.  They would have a 5km fun ride and a 15km longer ride.   Slower pace for both, usually start/ended at a dairy queen/mcdonalds/etc... with a free treat at the end. edit: looks like they're back for 2022 - https://www.brampton.ca/EN/residents/Roads-and-Traffic/Cycling/Pages/Community-Rides.aspx
- CycleFest - https://bikebrampton.ca/events/bike-month/bramalea-cyclefest/ - not sure if this was affiliated with Bike Brampton, but was run out of the All Peoples Church parking lot, with a bbq afterwards.  For anyone concerned with it being affiliated with the church, I've never felt like anything religious was ever pushed during the event (or at least noticed).  Last time it was run was June 2019, no idea if they are doing it this year.

Once you attend a few of these, you'll get an idea of who the regulars are (e.g. kemosite was at most Community Rides on the west end) and you can find people that will fit your idea of what casual riding is.

"Insurance wise, you are not correct. If there is dash cam footage to show that your ability to keep a safe following distance was taken from you, and that safe following distance was eliminated but not by your own maneuver or anything within your control, you will not be found at fault. Especially if you have dash cam footage showing there was no prior road rage and therefore no reason to suspect the other driver would pull such a move. Even the most defensive driver in the world can get caught with this and I can guarantee that they would not be at fault if they have proof of it.

"So you have a few options. 
1.implants youre looking generally around 4k a tooth (you may be able to negotiate a slight discount if you're doing multiple) the process generally takes 4-6 months. You will have the metal portion implanted into the bone, it then has to heal before they uncover it and place the crown on top of the implant. 

2. You could also look into a partial denture, with the materials they use now they're fairly lightweight. 

Most implant procedures aren't covered by insurance just as a heads up. Whereas dentures are typically covered as a major service. 

3. Last option is a bridge, I personally wouldn't go this route as you have to structurally compromise 2 other teeth for the bridge and they typically fail in 10-15 years

1. It would be 3.5k to 5.5 k, if bone grafting is done. Bone is most important aspect. 
2.  Not too long, its like extraction surgery for most of the time.
3.  Its similar to an extraction. Easier than tough or complicated extraction. 
4. Pros: you got a tooth, no other teeth will be touched unlike a dental bridge. Your bone doesn’t go away as implant will be holding it. Cons: insurances don’t cover it, can have complication especially if your immune system is compromised i e diabetes, smoker. Also cost is a con lol. 
5. Any good oral surgeon or a geneal practitioner who does a lot of implant surgeries should be great. 

Also implants can have complications. You will need cleanings regularly, recommended every 3 mos. You won’t feel it is failing, until it is gone or too loose as it doesn’t have any blood vessels like normal tooth.

"Oh, more name-calling! 😂

If there has to be “a loser”, that is yourself since the “strength” of “your argument” is to attempt insulting the other person. 

“What is it called when people start name calling rather than having a discussion?

1 “Defaming someone instead of making a logical argument against their position is known as an ad hominem attack.”

2 “It usually means the person has run out of anything rational or logical to say.

Or because you have presented them with a point they have no means of addressing, or asked a question of them that they SHOULD be able to answer, but catches them flat footed with nothing to say.

It usually indicates you’re in a discussion with someone that isn’t speaking with opinions that they developed through their own research, but are only repeating things they have heard and chose to adopt someone elses opinion as their own, and are repeating what they are told.

It was why political discussions before the election became nearly impossible to have that remained on a mature level for long.

It’s much like domestic violence in that often the violence comes to the surface when one person pushes the other to a point that their intellect and vocabulary are incapable of expressing themselves any more, but the emotions continue to rise.

It’s the only response they can have at that point.

It doesn’t make it right, but it makes it understandable.”

You are correct. Nobody will know how bad a person is as a pet owner until “something” goes wrong. For exotic pets, that possibility is even less that the “something wrong” will be discovered.

And likely it will not be known when something “goes wrong,” especially when the pets are exotic. So the exotic animals just quietly suffer and die. The exotic pet owner just gets another one to replace it with and it also dies.

"Oh, I know the history of animal domestication all right.

The ancestors of bovine beasts are extinct. They were called aurochs.

The wolf ancestors of domestic canines are also extinct. 

The wild ancestors of cats still exist. 

The jury is still out on whether the wild ancestors of horses still exist. It was thought they did exist, then further DNA analysis revealed that what they thought were truly wild horses might be very old band of feral horses. So truly wild horses might not exist. 

The wild ancestors of chickens, turkeys and pigs still exist. Likely so for sheep and goats. 

I could go on and on. 

Once upon a time, every single domestic animal came from wild animals, that is true. Most domestic animals have been bred for thousands and thousands of years for certain characteristics that are beneficial or appealing in some way to humans. Yet, every domestic animal still needs to be tamed and handled from birth to be accustomed to people. To learn human ways. 

Pets are NOT furry human babies. There are numerous species of fellow creatures forced over the centuries by humans into being 100% dependent on humans (cats not so much, except the genetically mutated breeds). If released into the wild, many would not know how to survive. 

We humans do NOT need to take wild animals from their homes when there are so many domestic animals we can utilise for our needs and wants instead. It is primarily due to human arrogance, selfishness and sometimes greed, that will not leave wild animals alone and let then live as they are meant to live.",t2_28w1dzgc,BramptonRaised,0,1647791306.0,0,t1_i1ey9r9,i1ey9r9,False,Blynx777,t3_thiq1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brampton/comments/thiq1g/can_you_have_a_fox_as_a_pet_in_brampton/,Can you have a fox as a pet in Brampton?,/r/Brampton/comments/thiq1g/can_you_have_a_fox_as_a_pet_in_brampton/i1ey9r9/,1,r/Brampton,0,1

Yes, human animals are very good at messing up the lives of other humans and non-human animals. Looking at the daily news shows us that tendency abundantly. 

One can NEVER make a wild animal like a fox domestic. It will be a wild animal living in captivity. 

Sadly, yes, many humans will likely always be arrogant and selfish and interfering with other life, pushing the other life into extinction by various methods as long as humans breath. As for individual wild animals, many will live a hellish existence with ignorant keepers until they die.

"depends on what you mean by harsh.

[NOAA’s winter 2021-22 summary](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/202202), released on March 8, found that the winter as a whole (December through February) ranked as the 18th warmest in 127 years of recordkeeping.

However, what’s much more telling is the monthly breakdown:

* December 2021: warmest December on record
* January 2022: 62nd-warmest January on record
* February 2022: 63rd-warmest February on record

so temperature wise it was not the warmest, but it was warmer than normal.

If you mean harsh as in more severe weather, then yes as this winter was a [La Niña](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni%C3%B1a) year which meant colder in the Pacific and warmer in the Atlantic which causes erratic temperature shifts (warm to cold, back to warm) which in turn causes more tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin due to low wind shear and warmer sea surface temperatures, while reducing tropical cyclogenesis in the Pacific Ocean.

The winter we had [followed the predictions set last fall](https://globalnews.ca/news/8324459/ontario-winter-forecast-2021-2022/).  It is always a good idea to check [Weather Canada's season predictions](https://weather.gc.ca/saisons/index_e.html).  they tend to be spot on.

According to Weather Canada you can expect this spring (March, April, May, June), to be [average temperature](https://weather.gc.ca/saisons/image_e.html?img=s234pfe1t_cal&bc=prob) and average precipitation with the boffins reporting

"A species in danger of becoming extinct can be protected, in the wild where it belongs. 

Except there are those who want to exploit the animals for their own profit, and they don’t care about the survival of the species. 

To collect the juvenile wild animals the mother is usually killed, because she will protect her young. Of the young “harvested,” many young animals desired by potential exotic pet owners die before they become an exotic pet. 

When an exotic pet owner no longer wants the pet, if not dumped and abandoned, the animal might be surrendered to an animal sanctuary. 

It’s not basically the same thing. Thousands upon thousands of years of domestication have changed the animal. It is no longer what the wild ancestor was, though some instincts are innate and can’t be bred out. Many domestic dogs wouldn’t be able to survive in the wild. Some would, but many wouldn’t survive. Same as if a lot of people were dumped in the wilderness with nothing but what they are wearing.

"Some domestic cats are living in feral colonies within Brampton and have been for as long as I can remember. There are programs where the feral cats are caught, neutered and have an ear “tipped” before being released. You’d think there would be no more feral cats after a decade. But there are still feral cats. 

Some cats don’t want to be anyone’s pet. They escape and don’t want to return to being a pet. They avoid being captured, reproduce and live a relatively short (compared to non-feral indoor-outdoor pet cats) life. But they lived their life the way they apparently wanted.

"You intend you recreate a desert in your home? 

Fennec foxes need about 1,200 sq feet to build their burrows in three feet deep in sand. That is their home territory, not their feeding territory. You’ll supply them with live insects, rodents, snails, lizards, plants, fruits, roots, and eggs to dine on?  

If the space occupied by the predator (the fox) and the prey is too small, it has happened that the meal (the prey) attacks the predator, to the detriment of the predator. 

Because if the foxes don’t have enough space to be as active as they should and too much food, or the wrong food, they’ll get health problems like, for example, obesity (and associated organ disfunction). Finding a veterinarian will be difficult because they wouldn’t have experience treating sick fennec foxes, so you’d have to take them to a zoo or a place that specializes in caring for wild animals that have been taken away from arrogant people who want a wild animal “pet”.

"All life forms share some of the same characteristics. 

But plants and animals are not the same even though they all live. 

All animals share some characteristics with each other, but that doesn’t mean they are all the same. 

An insect is more like another insect than a bird (which might want to eat the insect). 

Animals that belong in the same family (1. invertebrates [no spine e.g insects, spiders, sponges], 2. fish, 3. amphibians [e.g. frogs, salamanders], 4. reptiles [e.g. snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles], 5. birds [e.g pigeons, hawks, ostriches] and 6. mammals [e.g. humans, bats, whales]) share more characteristics within their own family than with those outside their family. 

Each of the six different animal families is further divided by shared characteristics within the family. Example: Snakes and turtles are both reptiles, but I hope you can tell a snake from a turtle, or a lizard from a snake. 

Mammals are more like other mammals than they are to birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish or invertebrates. But I don’t think you’d mistake a kangaroo for an elephant or a blue whale. 

There are some characteristics humans don’t share with other animals. Namely our brains combined with our hands which gave the ability to make more advanced tools than any other animals, which increased our human ancestors survival.

"Non-human animals (humans are animals too), sense the world around them differently. They live different lives to each other.

Do you think a hawk and an ant perceive their surroundings in exactly the same way? They are both animals, but are very different. A bison and a wolf perceive the world differently and live their lives differently and have different needs. 

Ostriches, emus and other large non-flying birds move around on two sturdy legs like humans, but are they the same as humans? I hope you realise ostriches and humans are not just the same. 

Animals (and I include humans) occupy different niches in the web of life. Their bodies and minds are best for living in the niche they occupy. Some animals are at the bottom of the food chain — they get eaten by other animals. The animals at the bottom tend to be mostly herbivores, like insects, mice, rabbits, rats, squirrels, smaller birds, some amphibians and reptiles, deer, bison etc. Animals higher up the food chain tend to omnivorous or carnivorous. Squirrels will eat the flesh of other animals if the are hungry enough. Bears grow big from consuming berries and fish for example (and other vegetation and meat, like fawns for example). 

Can you seriously believe a bear is “just like” a human? Bears aren’t pack animals (they don’t live in social groups). 
Animals near the bottom of the food chain tend to live in groups, whereas animals at the top tend to be more solitary and have larger territories to gain their sustenance (some of the exceptions being wild dogs, some wild cats and many marine mammals and humans, for examples).

If you seriously believe other animals and humans are “just the same” then you need to learn just about everything there is to learn in biology (study of life), in particular zoology (study of animals). I respect other animals, wild and domestic. 

Other animals (including domestic animals) have a right to live their life as they are meant to live their lives. It is human arrogance that upends their lives and fails to respect the lives of other animals, by wanting to catch them and keep them in ways entirely unsuitable to the other animal’s needs. 

Even bonobos and chimpanzees (the closest living relative to Homo sapiens) are not “just like” us, though closer than other animals.

Do you really think the type of people who have no regard for others' belongings/safety (throwing cigarette butts off balconies - which is already illegal) would have any care for more rules?

"Restaurant wise, the three I mentioned are all great. They are all more upscale than your typical place for those types of food (Chinese, Italian, Mexican), but the price is worth it for the quality and authenticity IMO. 

Vesuvios in particular is a great ""special occasion"" family dinner / date night place. Really like the ambience there. 

Pub wise, there isn't much that stands out. I went to Tracks a couple times and it had a solid crowd, live music etc. I enjoyed grabbing some pints on the Wendel Clark's patio in  Garden Square but they have since closed. I usually just drink in my backyard so not best guide for pubs/bars lol. 

For ""tourist"" spots. Gage Park is a great place for skating in the winter, or just chilling out / picnic spot in the summer. PAMA is cool to check out at least once.

"The fix (and consequently choice of repair company) depends on what the issue is.

I see some suggestions here for building a grade to slope the water away from your house. This might not be feasible sometimes. In my case, the leak was in a place where just outside I have a hot tub and deck. Building the grade would require removal/reinstallation of the hot tub and deck which would be a pain plus $$$.
