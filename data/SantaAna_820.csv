&#x200B;

  
A 32-year-old man was sentenced to 15 years behind bars Thursday after being convicted of killing three teenage girls in a hit-and-run last Halloween in Santa Ana.  


  
Jaquinn Ramone Bell, of Orange, received the maximum sentence of 13 years and 8 months in prison for manslaughter and an additional two years in county jail in part for a probation violation.  


  
Bell was speeding on Oct. 31, 2014, when he fatally struck twin sisters Lexi Perez and Lexandra Perez and their friend Andrea Gonzalez.  


  
The three girls, all 13 years old, were trick-or-treating and in a crosswalk when a Honda CRV plowed into them, throwing them more than 100 feet, authorities said at the time.  


  
All three girls died at the scene.  


  
The abandoned SUV was located later that night about a quarter mile from the scene with a shattered windshield and severe damage to its hood and passenger side.  


  
Bell, who was with his two sons ‚Äì ages 14 and 17 ‚Äì when the incident occurred, was arrested within days of the crash.  


  
Court records indicated that three months prior, Bell had been convicted on charges related to a DUI hit-and-run, and that his license was suspended.  


  
In the August incident, Bell also had underage occupants in a vehicle at the time of a crash. He pleaded guilty to child abuse and endangerment, driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol and hit-and-run with property damage.  


  
At the time of his October arrest, Bell also had two warrants out for his arrest in connection with domestic violence allegations.  


  
Under California law, if a person previously convicted of DUI kills someone while driving under the influence, that driver may be charged with murder.  


  
However, Bell fled the Santa Ana scene and was not apprehended until two days after the incident, and thus was not given breathalyzer or field-sobriety tests.  


  
Prosecutors initially sought a 17-year sentence, but the court ruled that enhanced allegations for personally inflicting great bodily injury could not be attached to manslaughter charges, according to the Orange County District Attorney‚Äôs Office.

Well not sure what steps to take. But one of the things is to talk to the vet about payment. For you are paying for that dog and none of the other dogs. Your name is under the chip registration   Now the dog might be under your ex name on the vet files. But that can be changed. As if proof can be shown that you have chip registered and any payment to the vet directly. Technically the dog is yours if you can prove it. Talk to the vet and see what they say as well.

For some reason that restaurant has transmuted into like 5 different specialty restaurants over time but its always been the 2 same Ajummas running it lol.

"Dry. Hot and Dry. Imagine global warming is true, ya know, lets pretend... /s  
...and imagine the population is 5x the current (300k => 1.5M) . Despite the great CA exodus, the heat is going to create a migration  from AZ and NV to SoCal. Combined with the trend in high-density housing, you can expect OC and SA to grow, a lot in the next  50 years.  
  
This does not necessarily mean ripping out landscape and pouring more concrete. Self-driving cars will make the need for more lanes unnecessary.  I'd advice some kind of hard dirt paths or wider sidewalks. Build and design for walking, biking and ebikes! And speaking of concrete, some the streets in SA, the white-pavement ones, you know the ones in the older neighborhoods, roads that were build in the 40s and 50s, those are only now beginning to show wear, albeit those road are still working; while the black and tar pavement roads keep having to be repaved every 10-15 years. How about building roads to last. Build for high pedestrian traffic and battery-power vehicles like ebikes and golf carts.   
  
On another note, if you haven't noticed, the blooming patterns on the  jacarandas have changed in the past several years. They used to be twice a year like clock work. Similar to the Santa Ana winds, another weather pattern that was all to regular, now thing of the past. I regret to inform you, IMHO, these delicate trees and most beautiful tapestry to the neighborhoods, may be lost. They may go dormant or stasis for many decades  in response to the rising heat.   
  
I would encourage the ""City Officials"", the planning commission and project managers, to gear towards hot and dry, and many more people. The City of Yorba Linda just did a overhaul of their medians and landscapes. I'd recommend incorporating their finding into the SA plans with the added note that I think they still didn't design it for dry and hot  enough. I mean, you don't have to go sand and nothing like Mad Max, but something closer to a front yard in Phoenix or Tempe. Water will an even greater point of contention, so less is more here.   
  
Here are some examples of how to craft Santa Ana for the future:  
  
1) Kaiser Health Path - The walk path at Lakeview and 91 where the old Kaiser Hospital building used to be. I'm sure the Kaiser Foundation has done their due diligence on the best landscaping repurposing of that (totallty not irradiated) land.   
	https://www.google.com/maps/@33.8539947,-117.8178681,156m/data=!3m1!1e3  
  
2) Mini Park Place - The Santa Ana river trail is a superb example of how to increase mobility in the city. Use alleyways, use old rail lines, tear up extra road lanes.   
  
	a) channels for hard-dirt and for hard-paved;   
	b) bathrooms and trash cans, lest not we be civil;   
	c) family friendly with payboxes for traveling parents;   
	d) coordinate with OCTA, Anaheim's FRAN, the new trolley nonsense, and other services to maximize-strategic-transit-exaction, through the city and across the County, all in one app. But I digress...;    
	e) major and minor bus/tram stations with benches and induvial (spaced) seats; f) solid inground piped bike racks;   
	g) and if there's and money left over in the budget, security cameras.   
	https://goo.gl/maps/Wfux9535aX9soGvq7  
  
3) Tustin Arch Walkway - Microcosm of shortcuts. Good example of design for multiple path types, walking and biking and with several rest areas. Zig-zig flow design IN particular. I would look to open specific paths ways between majors hubs. Another examples of this is along the SA river there are often two parallels paths and a row or bushes and tress between the two paths. Sometimes I'll want to cut over to one or the other paths but cannot because those foliage and ground cover often cause flat tire with splinters. Sometimes there are mounds of solid rocks. A few breaks between the row of trees with defined paths might make the river path more enjoyable. IMHO the Tustin Arch is too compressed, but the concept is adaptable to inner-city connections.   
	https://goo.gl/maps/xXKQBDi8KwjWPyML9  
  
4) Maple Street Path - Macrocosm of shortcuts. Great example of maintaining pedestrian and bike pathways is the Maple Street Corridor. What an opportunity to let people get around without making then stand at a stop light.    
	https://www.google.com/maps/dir//33.7247658,-117.8633919/@33.7248536,-117.8640979,18.25z  
  
An example of what not to do, is to build the buildings out to edges of the streets and put all the landscaping safely in the meridian. Look at the road along 17th St. between Bristol and Broadway. Buildings on the edge, high pedestrian traffic only inches from high speed traffic. Giant decorative trees growing out the middle, ripping up the curbs. But hey, at least we have three lanes for the cars, each way!   
  
Imagine walking up a sidewalk, I should see houses, buildings, and private properties to my right. How much ""open space"" they grant their front areas is their purgative. (Side note, I wish there was a more public campaign to inform property owners that they are responsible for the foliage and bushes that push out over blockwalk and onto the sidewalks. I'm all for more greenage, but blocking my path is not the way.) To my left is city-and-citizen land margin, usually the dirt is often maintained by the latter, and the concrete maintained by the former. And all the up and down bevels between curbs and streets and driveways. This should not change much save for not a campaign to encourage property owners to switch less water consuming vegetation in the land between their homes and the roads.   
  
The curb and the road is the best default location to reclaim space for a growing city. Traffic congestion can be de-incentivized by just letting the traffic be. Yes, the traffic complaints increase. Too bad, it's more important to more people locally through the city than it is for a car culture to sit in traffic burning fossil fuels so they can listen to their favorite podcast tripe, in peace. We have freeways for that. Traffic will be a non-issue in less than a decade as AI in cars will self-stagger. People will just adapt to other options.   
  
Consider the efficiency that ebikes and golf carts maximize for the city's desire for density and the citizen's demands for mobility. I would try to optimize paths for less cars. There would also need to be an educational campaign to update the hierarchy of transit responsibility. The current system is taught as Cars => Bikes => Pedestrians. I'd forward this structure:  
  
	IV. Trucks, Buses, Cars, Motorcycles =>   
	III. Electrical Bikes, Electric Scooters, Golf Carts (no gas powered) =>   
	II. Mechanical Bikes, Skateboards, Scooters =>  
	I. Pedestrians, Joggers, Strollers  
  
The pedestrians has the most right-of-way and on up, so the driver of the car has most responsibility on the roadways and across paths. Building out more ""green lanes"" would be safe for pedestrians and offer more mobility around the city.   
  
That's my two bits. Imagine and design for hot and thick. (giggity)

"In my experience the cops in this county don't do shit regarding sexual assault. If you want to put in a police report, go ahead and do it but it won't accomplish much if anything at all.

I know this by experience, I took my girlfriend at the time to the cops years ago and they not only didn't do anything, they lied to me on multiple things, treated her like a criminal, then dropped the case when they triggered her PTSD (that she got when she was abused as a child). (I hate cops but because of these experiences, I never had a good one with a cop)

If you believe sexual assault has happened to a child, you need to contact child services and possibly a lawyer, since the victim is a minor. That's your best chance at making a difference here.

"Santa ana has plenty of safe neighborhoods. Floral park is exclusively for the wealthy - no regular person can afford to live there. Obviously, there is some crime, homeless, etc - Santa Ana is not irvine, but its also way more affordable. Look in the areas around downtown - french park, logan, lacy, arts district. Washington square, Santiago park, and wilshire square are all very nice neighborhoods but may be hard to find something there depending on what your price range is.

I lived kinda near the train station in an apartment for awhile on $25 an hour. It‚Äôs doable, but you do kinda gotta get lucky when youre looking for the right spot. But there are tons of apartments, just may not find them on normal rental sites. I‚Äôve lived in Santa Ana for about 5 years now and really love it - great food, culture and has alot more character than most OC cities. There are definitely some downsides sure, but really feel like the areas around the downtown have been steadily improving for years and will only get better once they finish the streetcar.

The only thing that might be an issue for some people (at least not me) are the homeless that wander around sometimes, but they are pretty infrequent and even then they aren't a problem and doing their own thing.

Much of the people were either in close proximity, or flat out bumping next to each other.

The funny part was that, although there were a considerable amount of people in the park today,  I was looked at weirdly because my girlfriend and I were wearing a mask. This was a huge red flag.

The point is being outdoors isnt the problem, its being in close proximity to people is an issue. Your interactions with each other will increase the risk of being infected, regardless if it is indoors or outdoors. If its windy, even worse, when someone coughs, and it blows your way, guess what if your eyes or mouth isnt covered, you better hope you have your affairs in order.

"Santa Ana is not LA . . .   it's in Orange County. To be honest, you're not close enough to LA to enjoy the ""perks"" - it's a 40 minute drive with NO traffic. You're close enough to drive in for work, or an event, but not close enough to just stop by your favorite coffee shop.  
  
You'd be avoiding the ""hustle and bustle"" of the city, sure, but sanity goes out the window pretty quickly when you're spending 2-3 hours a day on freeways.  
  
As for Santa Ana though - I love it. I moved to the OC from NYC two years ago, and people told me places like Costa Mesa were the ""cool, hip"" places to be. Honestly, the beach cities are kind of whack. Too WASPY, consumer-centric, etc.  
   
Santa Ana has culture, has a great vibe, and has an amazing LOCAL art and music scene. Don't come here and just go to the Observatory for shows. There's good food, cool bars, venues, and events. downtown is really on the up-and-up.   
  
I would NOT recommend Anaheim. Fullerton is pretty cool, but I haven't been in a while. I've been to a few cool bars, but be aware it is more of a college town.   
  
If you're going to live in OC, just pull the trigger on Santa Ana. You won't regret it.   
  
But if you can afford it, and are really trying to do more stuff in LA, go to Pasadena.",t2_81t69,fanboyhunter,0,1523905234.0,0,t1_dxguitv,dxguitv,True,DanceMachine102,t3_8cjs97,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaana/comments/8cjs97/moving_to_the_outskirts_of_la_help_what_is_living/,Moving to the outskirts of LA...

"I feel like the biggest question you need to be asking yourself is how much you're willing to commute.  Santa Ana to La Verne is 2 hours both ways,  often longer.  Same to/from LA (give or take where in LA and commute times). There's not good public transit here to where you'd be commuting,  so you can pretty much count that out.  I would reccomend looking closer to Diamond Bar/El Monte.  If you still think Santa Ana is for you, there's lots of fun/hip things to do here (4th Street is a hipsters wet dream), but rent is going to be higher than you've described depending on how nice/safe you want to be.  Sorry, I know I'm a downer, but I just want you to know the facts.  In SoCal distance does not always translate to commute time.   On the 55 starting around 3PM, you can count on spending an hour in the car to go 10 miles.

"Downtown Santa Ana definitely has the young and hip element.  Lots of restaurants and bars and nightlife.  There are new coffee shops and restaurants opening seemingly every week around here.  But visit to get the vibe before you make a decision.  It is a very small area, and the options can get redundant at times.  There are some very cheap rents, but likely in not the greatest buildings.  The young hipster/artsy buildings are probably renting at higher than your budget.  

Also check downtown Fullerton for a similar vibe, or Old Town Orange too but it's less of a nightlife/bar scene.  

One benefit of all these places is easy access to Downtown LA on Amtrak/Metrolink.  But note Orange is Metrolink only, which has a much less convenient schedule than Amtrak in the evenings.  

Your budget could be an issue in all these places.  A 1500-1700 one bedroom with den, or two bedroom, is probably not going to be in a great downtown location or a nice building.  You may need to look outside these downtown areas and settle for living in the sea of strip malls and parking lots that is most of LA suburbia, and drive into the downtowns and deal with parking each time you want to go out.  

Personally, if I had to be at La Verne three times per week, I'd be living in Pasadena.  It's everything you're looking for, and closer to LA, but pricier.  If you can swing the extra rent, Pasadena would be best.

"I agree with dalek_999 here. Our group's goal was always to have cities stop doing invocations, because they're unnecessary and divisive (how does it look to a religious minority coming to argue against the council if they council leads a Christian prayer?). If they don't stop them, then it's vital to get a rotating group of others leading the prayers, both to bring attention that it's happening and to give better representation. 

These invocations exist for no reason other than proclaim Christianity above others.

"It's not being petty. It's pointing out the hypocrisy of having a religious ceremony before a governmental meeting, and is often the only way to get those who insist on the importance of said ceremonies to stop having them. Why does there need to be any sort of statement before a council meeting? 

Those of us who have been fighting for a separation of church and state for decades have used this sort of action many times before to make change happen. Please don't make assumptions about the ""pettiness"" of this kind of action, or think that these types of actions are those of edgelords trying to make some sort of statement about Satan and/or atheism. I mean - no offense, but your wide-eyed shock at the fact that a city council meeting has a prayer before it shows that this is all pretty new to you.

"I used to run a group called Orange County Atheists - mainly a social group with monthly meetings, but we also did some political action. One of those things was attempting to stop city council prayers and the the then-rampant addition of ""In God We Trust"" to city council chambers. I also live in Santa Ana. 

About 10 years ago, I met with the City Manager about the meeting prayers. They considered them acceptable because any religion that wanted to give a prayer was allowed to. But almost no one ever asked to do it, so they'd have their police chaplain do it. They said that Jewish groups had also done it in the past, and maybe others.  

I asked if atheists and other non-traditional groups (wiccans and satanists) were allowed to give the invocation, and he couldn't give me a good answer other than saying, ""Well, if they requested it, we'd probably just stop having the prayers all together"". We never organized anything, however, and focused more on ""In God We Trust"" wording in other cities. 

Legally, they're allowed to have prayers/invocations, but according to a 1999 court case (Rubin v. City of Burbank), they're not supposed to be specific to any one religion - having ""Jesus"" or ""Christ"" mentioned is against the rules. That said, nothing seems to stop them. I haven't been keeping up lately, so it sucks that they're still doing it. It would take a bit of an effort to get anything to change, but it's possible.

I've seen the growth in the last 10 years, and have been impacted directly too.

A previous generation of Santa Ana residents/homeowners criticized the city's allowing of new rental housing, and I imagine that the former city councils were all too willing to play ball with developers. But we're talking about councils that facilitated these types of developments going back to the 70s/80s.",t2_jeme2,Santaniego,0,1490998589.0,0,t1_dfo4giv,dfo4giv,False,goldfish18,t3_62fm0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaana/comments/62fm0m/parking/,Parking,/r/santaana/comments/62fm0m/parking/dfo4giv/,1,r/santaana,0,1
I will definitely take a look at that area. There is a little section on Minter and 10th that has about enough room for four vehicles that I was luck enough to find a spot in one night. Right now I'm having the most luck near the Lincoln and Washington cross streets.,t2_9axu4,goldfish18,0,1490973698.0,0,t1_dfnim2c,dfnim2c,False,goldfish18,t3_62fm0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaana/comments/62fm0m/parking/,Parking,/r/santaana/comments/62fm0m/parking/dfnim2c/,1,r/santaana,0,1
"> But there are new housing/rental developments popping up around town. The city is steering the whole downtown into a transit-oriented experience.

I completely agree. I'm in the new construction business and one of the projects we have in Santa Ana is a 62 unit multi-family project. The company (Olson Company) loves to build in transit-oriented areas. 

However, had I known about this parking issue, I may have never even moved to this city. That issue coupled with the fact that I am in not so nice of an area and I'm well in the minority in terms of ethnicity leads me to believe less and less younger people who commute to work will want to live in this area. I should have done a bit more research prior to moving here, but I still think my point has validity. 

Maybe instead of spending so much money on parking regulations and people to enforce this, the city should have cracked down on landlords and made them better regulate the number of occupants in these overcrowded units. I'm sure a lot of them say they only have 2-4 occupants, but the likelihood is that there are double that. Kinda sounds like the city is so focused on creating this huge majority of Latino population and culture, that it turns a blind eye to these kinds of things.",t2_9axu4,goldfish18,0,1490973583.0,0,t1_dfnii9b,dfnii9b,False,goldfish18,t3_62fm0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaana/comments/62fm0m/parking/,Parking,/r/santaana/comments/62fm0m/parking/dfnii9b/,1,r/santaana,0,1

"More and more properties and neighborhoods are impacted by more cars in Santa Ana.

I've seen absurd amounts of cars at residential homes.

> The Orange County District Attorney&#039;s office has filed charges against three of the police officers seen in a notorious surveillance video eating pot-laced candy bars during a May 26, 2015 raid of a Santa Ana medical marijuana dispensary, Sky High Holistic.

> The video, first posted by OC Weekly last June, clearly showed officers passing around candy bars, joking about feeling &quot;Light-headed,&quot; and tossing darts after finishing their Scooby snack.

> The officers named in the OCDA announcement as facing petty theft charges for eating the supposedly non-pot-laced candy bars are Brandon Matthew Sontag, Nicole Lynn Quijas and Jorge Arroyo.

Santa Ana gamer here! I just heard about this place and I really can't believe it actually exists. I used to go to all the net caf√©s and arcades back in the day but most of those places are no longer around. Glad to see that esports hasn't died out and that future gamers have a place that they can go to in my city.,t2_dc4lb,pocketcoat,0,1444515148.0,0,t1_cvv6wdj,cvv6wdj,True,-Azax-,t3_3o9e1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaana/comments/3o9e1m/attention_santa_ana_gamers/,Attention Santa Ana gamers!,/r/santaana/comments/3o9e1m/attention_santa_ana_gamers/cvv6wdj/,3,r/santaana,0,3
Depending on where you're staying in Santa Ana will really indicate how cautious you have to be.

">residents and downtown merchants say the concept will serve loyal Santa Ana residents ‚Äì many of whom are Latino ‚Äì and attract a broader base of visitors who want a taste of Latino culture. Most residents within two miles of downtown are Latinos with median household incomes of $48,502. The median age is 27.

So...they want to cater to young people who are barely scraping by, versus hipsters, art-lovers, and the like? Which group has the money to spend, and free time to be spending it? That's who they should be focusing on. 

I dunno, I'm biased, I guess. I live about 2 miles away from downtown, and I love the changes they've been making to improve the area. I'm all for gentrification, if it means that property values go up, crime goes down, and we get more money going into the city itself. Deciding to focus the city's marketability towards the local (very poor) Latinos rather than trying to hit up the hipsters, etc who have money just seems very shortsighted.",t2_5dn4p,dalek_999,0,1434572449.0,0,t1_cs9xzol,cs9xzol,True,LucasPelucas,t3_3a6wi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaana/comments/3a6wi5/downtown_sa_slowly_moving_towards_calle_cuatro/,"""Downtown SA slowly moving towards 'calle cuatro' branding"" thoughts?",/r/santaana/comments/3a6wi5/downtown_sa_slowly_moving_towards_calle_cuatro/cs9xzol/,4,r/santaana,0,4
