But the thing is, what harm can it do? Maybe the use of the term Hawiian Shirts is somehow somewhere increasing the marginilzation of someone and it's not going to be  someone in a priviledged position (like a white shop owner in Olympia) to do anything about it. Maybe it causes harm to use that term maybe it's bunk but if there's a chance it does why wouldn't you think twice and make some change that doesnt make any real difference to you?

Probably because some people are more ""hurt"" than others by what would be considered something fairly innocuous.  Additionally, maybe defer to the cultural opinion of the group that could take offense instead of listening to what a bunch of trendy white people have to say about it.

"Curious as to why they acted like the term Hawaiian shirt was in some way derogatory I looked into the history‚Ä¶ 

Here‚Äôs just the wiki‚Ä¶

Still see no problem. I do like ‚Äúaloha shirt‚Äù that‚Äôs lovely.

According to some sources, the origin of aloha shirts can be traced to the 1920s[11] or the early 1930s,[12] when the Honolulu-based dry goods store ""Musa-Shiya the Shirtmaker"" under the proprietorship of K≈çichir≈ç Miyamoto,[12] started making shirts out of colorful Japanese prints.[b][11][12] It has also been contended that the aloha shirt was devised in the early 1930s by Chinese merchant Ellery Chun of ""King-Smith Clothiers and Dry Goods"", a store in Waikiki.[14][15] Although this claim has been described as a myth reinforced by repeated telling,[16] Chun may have been the first to mass-produce[7] or to maintain the ready-to-wear in stock to be sold off the shelf.[4][5]

The name ""aloha shirt"" appeared later. By 1935 and 1936, the word aloha was being attached to various sorts of Hawaiian products, so calling the garments ""aloha shirts"" was hardly original.[11] The term aloha shirt first appeared in print in an advertisement for Musa-Shiya in the June 28, 1935 issue of The Honolulu Advertiser newspaper.[11][17] However, Ellery Chun is sometimes credited for coining the term,[18] perhaps in 1933;[19] Chun's store reportedly carried window signs that said ""aloha shirts"".[7][20] The term ""aloha sportswear"" was registered as a trademark by Chun's company in 1936,[11][4] followed by Chun trademarking ""Aloha Shirt"" in 1937 and owning the rights to this appellation for the next 20 years.[21]


Tori Richard aloha shirts in a store
Within years, major designer labels sprang up all over Hawaii and began manufacturing and selling aloha shirts en masse. By the end of the 1930s, 450 people were employed in an industry worth $600,000 annually.[22] Two notable manufacturers of this period are Kamehameha and Branfleet (later Kahala), both founded in 1936.[23][6] Retail chains in Hawaii, including some based on the mainland, may mass-produce a single aloha shirt design for employee uniforms.

After World War II, many servicemen and servicewomen returned to the United States from Asia and the Pacific islands with aloha shirts made in Hawaii since the 1930s.[24] One significant manufacturer was Shaheen, which began business in 1948.[6] Following Hawaii's statehood in 1959, when extant tropical prints came to be regarded as rather tacky, designer Alfred Shaheen became noted for producing aloha shirts of higher chic and quality, and Elvis Presley wore a Shaheen-designed red aloha on the album cover for Blue Hawaii (1961).[24][25] In 1956, Tori Richard, a well-known brand of alohas was established.[26][27] Reyn Spooner (or, rather, its precursor, Spooner's of Waikiki) also established business in 1956.[28]

Exports	Edit
Garments manufactured in Hawaii could bear ""Made in Hawaii"" labels before statehood (1959), and even afterwards, their sales to mainland United States continued to be referred to as ""exports"".[29]

Aloha shirts tend to be referred to as ""Hawaiian shirts"" by the populace from the mainland United States,[6] and are often brilliantly colored with floral patterns or generic Polynesian motifs.

The aloha shirt is currently[when?] the premier textile export of the Hawaii manufacturing industry.[citation needed]",t2_6i3y5451,liageical,1,1648238444.0,0,t1_i23w0te,i23w0te,True,liageical,t3_tnx9n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/tnx9n3/certain_dt_thrift_store_will_not_let_you_say/,Certain DT thrift store.

"I'll second that welcome! 

As esclusivo said, check with your vet first, but we've tried several different antihistamines and found that cetrizine (brand name Zyrtec) works fairly well without making our kitty drowsy. Benadryl would probably work better, but it'd also knock him out.

The recommended dose on the bottle says just one, 10mg tablet - a child's dose - should last 24 hours, but the vet said we can give him that amount twice a day if needed. Before I gave him his first dose I double checked with the vet because it just didn't make sense to me to give a the same amount one would give a human child, much less twice a day! She confirmed, so there ya have it.

We crush the tablet between two spoons, add half a syringe of hot water to it, then stir until it's dissolved. Suck that up into the syringe and squirt it between the back teeth. 

For our little guy, this is much better than shoving the pill down his throat. Hiding it in his food doesn't work either. He doesn't like taking medicine (of course), but he's a good-natured kitty and forgives us really quickly.

">Economics 101 is killing city planning.  Housing is more complex than widgets and is NOT a commodity.  Simple supply and demand ideas do not create affordable housing especially during periods of increasing populations.  If thousands of people are moving to Olympia and Lacey because we are somewhat more affordable than Seattle and San Francisco and buying up properties with cash, they will continue to buy up all new properties that are built.  If affordable apartments like the Elks are all being converted into Airbnb's, we aren't going to have affordable apartments.  The markets will never ""trickle down"" to folks who work in the service industry, retirees, and other folks who need real affordable housing.  Believing in market solutions is magical thinking akin to the Easter Bunny.  
>  
>Regulation and purposeful planning is the only solution.  Just building housing without specifically building low income housing will not mitigate the harm of capitalism.  If you study economics beyond simple things like supply and demand of widgets, you will understand that unregulated capitalism does exactly what you see in our current markets.  It creates housing monopolies, great income disparity, and treats essential things needed for survival as if they are only widgets.

as someone who took the survey, and compared the different questions posed for renters and landlords, i can assure you there is a large bias in favor of landlords. questions posed to landlords include things like: ""how has covid made it hard for you to keep up with your mortgage"", ""have renters refused rent? how has that negatively impacted your life"". there were no questions like that for renters. all the policy suggestions are useless at best and at worse suggest giving MORE money to landlords. i am not exaggerating here. they literally have a question posed to renters that asks if giving more money to landlords would be helpful. if one takes the survey, they should point out these horrendous disparities and laughable suggestions of policy changes.",t2_66vx3e4z,suidtere,0,1648148709.0,0,t1_i1ytwwg,i1ytwwg,False,-artisticfrosting-,t3_swbgee,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/swbgee/city_of_olympia_launches_public_surveys_on/,City of Olympia launches public surveys on proposed rental housing code changes | Olympian,/r/olympia/comments/swbgee/city_of_olympia_launches_public_surveys_on/i1ytwwg/,1,r/olympia,0,1

"Awesome! This is the location closest to me, good for them. Signed the petition and shared. 

I worked for a local company that had a contract with Starbucks for many years providing an interior design element for their stores. I was a fly on the wall in a few meetings of their higher ups discussing budgets for renovations and over time I developed an understanding of how they squeeze every penny from suppliers asking them to reduce costs by pennies while demanding higher quality (which of course is not possible because they also always want it as fast as possible). At the end of the day they do not care about people at all, long term relationships with their suppliers destroyed in seconds if the supplier didn't do exactly what they wanted, always 100% about money, it was disgusting. I hope they are scared shitless which seems to be true with the departure of Kevin Johnson (who got a ridiculous $60 million as a 'retirement gift' too) announced last week so Schultz can come try to damage control the unstoppable movement of unions.

">From my house, within a 1 or 2 mile radius there are 3 apartment and/or town home construction projects that are going on and they look pretty massive.

It's about a 500 yard radius for me. My bet is that rental prices are only going to rise unless a certain percentage of social housing is required. And when construction is complete and occupancy nearly 100%, there *still be no red-yellow-green light* traffic control and Sleater Kinney & 15th Av NE.

"So I'll give you a genuine thank you for reminding me this. I much prefer being in Olympia to Vancouver. There's a lot of things about Vancouver that I don't like. I still think Olympia can densify while avoiding many of those things. We don't have much choice but to densify so we have to put our efforts into doing it in the best way possible, including making sure local small businesses predominate.

As for the sewage and whatnot - that's an easy one. Big cities economize on infrastructure much better than small cities do. Vancouver might have wrongly went cheap on protecting the environment but if they spent the same per person as they do in Olympia I'm sure there wouldn't be any special problem there. We have to build many extra yards/meters of pipe per person compared to them. Same thing with roads, power, etc... 

By the way, Olympia has something obscene like 100,000+ parking spots. That is not something I'd like to preserve as the city densifies.

"Careful what you wish for.  Vancouver is one of the most expensive cities in the world.  Homelessness is significant.   At least they preserved parts of its historic waterfronts.   


Vancouver is 45 square miles with the urban area, not counting the Metropolitan area that is is 345 square miles.  Olympia is a mere 18 square miles and surrounded by other ""cities"".  Olympia is not a city nor is it a metropolitan region and it doesn't have the space or resources to handle servicing high density.  Lacey has even more growth than Olympia.  Why not drop a Yaletown in the middle of Lacey instead of on Olympia's waterfront downtown?  Would they embrace corporate businesses more than small businesses there in the future?  Might they tolerate a Starbucks on three corners of a single intersection like you find on Robson Street?  

How are you going to get the developers to build or pay for the new sewage treatment capacity that LOTT would need?  You won't.  They cash out and run.  It would take more than simple capacity charges and hookup fees to solve capacity issues.   In Canada, they do not aspire to he level of wastewater treatment that we demand here.

Renters like me get fucked even harder.

Edit: also I checked Redmond and they are going to have a lot more restaurants and bars and overall retail space than they did in the old downtown. So not sure what there is to cry over there.

"It used to be a more walkable, affordable and accessible historic community where people went out to dinner, met with friends at pubs, visited parks, shopped at small businesses, got essentials and worked.  There was everything from independent clothing stores, coffee shops, book stores and doctors' offices to a feed store.   It was a hub for the region.  

Starting in the mid 2000's the razing and displacement of downtown was beginning lot by lot and replaced by rows upon rows of very expensive dormitory like housing with extremely high prices and it hasn't stopped yet and it is sprawling further out.  It seemed to coincide with the removal of height limits making the value per square foot much higher.  People thought the foreign investors would fail because rents were so outrageous and the housing wasn't appealing, but they were just getting started by creating a new ""market rate"" for housing.  

The displace and dispose culture for the sake of lining pockets is sickening.  Somehow the when height limits that even Microsoft wouldn't violate were removed everything circled the drain.  The community was left holding the bag for fixing the infrastructure needs that were created.  People lost their affordable homes. Rents got jacked up to run out the residents.  Turning all affordable housing and commercial areas into high income dense properties is the worst of all worlds.  The whole community was taken advantage of and no one saw it coming.

The last time I had to go there a few weeks ago I was shocked at the changes over just the last few months.  Cranes are everywhere.  Nothing was solved and housing costs are through the roof and rising.  It became inaccessible due to traffic and a lack of parking and small businesses suffered.  The people who live there now have to travel outside of the downtown area for essentials.  Open spaces and affordable housing was replaced by big box stores on the periphery.  There is some required token small green space added for dog walking to make up for many lost wild spaces and parks.  It doesn't make up for all the old treed wild spaces that are now gone forever.   It's no wonder one nephew had to move to Sultan after his rent went up 30% per year for his basement apartment and the other had to move in with 5 other roommates to share a small old house outside of the building zone.  They have good paying jobs, but they are not millionaires.  


They could have done these developments somewhere that didn't uproot an destroy an entire community with a loved downtown.  I am seeing the same trend in Olympia.  There is no reason to destroy an established a community for a a cheap land grab for expensive housing.  If you support this kind of growth, then you may as well say goodbye to Olympia, because it will gone in no time.  You may as well rip off the Band-aid move to Redmond.",t2_11h34e,kiki_wanderlust,0,1647961304.0,0,t1_i1o2szc,i1o2szc,False,[deleted],t3_tjkru9,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/tjkru9/are_all_these_new_apartment_complexes_going_to/,Are all these new apartment complexes going to lower the housing prices at all?,/r/olympia/comments/tjkru9/are_all_these_new_apartment_complexes_going_to/i1o2szc/,4,r/olympia,0,4

"I used to know her too, and agree, as she appeared to share the same values as myself and was interested in similar causes. She stated she was a feminist, but she wasnt the misandrist she is now. She seemed pretty okay until a temporary homeless encampment was proposed near her rented home, and she completely lost her shit and went full NIMBY, and joined forces with some really malignant people. Pretty soon she was queen of Olympia Looks Like Shit and was suddenly spewing right wing protestant-ethic type rhetoric, palling around with a convicted sex offender who was also active in that group (he promoted himself as a photographer who would go uninvited into homeless encampments and film them, exploiting their existence, publishing his work on facebook and Youtube)  and throwing around words like ""accountability"" which is hilarious when you consider her track record-she really began to enjoy her new found popularity among the local conservative hate groups. That is, until even they ousted her as a narcissistic grifter, I'm guessing over campaign donation issues and her ME-Centric speeches.
She has a grossly inflated ego, and a over blown sense of self importance, and a real gift for deluded self victimization. She thinks people want to censor her, because she's so ""dangerous"", and it's laughable. No, Candace. We just resent hypocrites, bigots and cons. She's a hatemonger, looking for her 15 minutes, and when she had them she blew them. Suddenly she became an authority on sex and identity,  homelessness, and addiction, because of some Peterson youtube videos that she then regurgitated and rebranded as her own independent thought. 
Her story is a tragedy, because she was once decent, and is intelligent, but her ugly nature blows it. I personally refuse to blame this on a mental health issue, bigotry and apathy, opportunism, are a choice. But I do know because it's obvious, she was traumatized by something in her life that caused her to go so terribly sour. And for that, I am sad for her. 
Bruce also wasn't as big of a piece of shit years ago from what I undertsand, he's another sad case. On one hand I can see where the way he was treated would make him bitter, but Jesus christ, he has everyone around him questioning his sanity at this point. 
I dont know if being pushed out of leftist circles due to their behaviour led to their goofy backward ideals, or if they were born this way, but it's really sad. Someone said today that Olympia was like a beautifully landscaped yard, and those two represented two piles dog shit no one bothered to pick up; Something ugly and unwanted in a usually beautiful and pleasant place, something no one necessarily wanted to deal or associate with, or even look at.

"Your answer is found in the most basic economic theory: Supply and demand. 

If supply is increased (it is), it COULD be beneficial to everyone's price IF supply outpaces demand. 

Beneficial to price may mean a lower price (unlikely unless supply is flooded, buyer's market) or it may just be that cost for housing rises more slowly or stays flat a while while new inventory is filled.

My guess is prices for housing continue to rise unless something seriously dramatic happens to supply (massive building) or demand (massive decrease in population).",t2_400vg,Jasonrj,0,1647921675.0,0,t1_i1meb1h,i1meb1h,True,[deleted],t3_tjkru9,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/tjkru9/are_all_these_new_apartment_complexes_going_to/,Are all these new apartment complexes going to lower the housing prices at all?,/r/olympia/comments/tjkru9/are_all_these_new_apartment_complexes_going_to/i1meb1h/,-2,r/olympia,0,-2

I  heard she became super into Jordan Peterson,  which now is not surprising, but back then should have been a warning sign. I didn't know that until her unraveling was in full force.

"In short we need the following:

1.) To upzone most of the city - for example most of the city has an 35 ft height limit for new developments.

2.) Expand transit - rental ebikes, rapid rail transit between the three cities, and more bus routes.

3.) Street diets & parking reductions - reduce the amount of lanes made exclusively for personal cars/trucks and replace parking lots with housing.

4.) Transition from property taxes to LVT (Land Value Tax.)

5.) When the city sells land to developers sell to non profit developers and support more cooperative housing.

6.) Expand the homefund to include housing directly to the public - hire builders and designers directly.

7.) Establish an home repairs and improvements fund/tax to fund non-interest improvements to current and future housing.",t2_769vs,vandypool,0,1647901804.0,0,t1_i1l7lyw,i1l7lyw,True,[deleted],t3_tjkru9,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/tjkru9/are_all_these_new_apartment_complexes_going_to/,Are all these new apartment complexes going to lower the housing prices at all?,/r/olympia/comments/tjkru9/are_all_these_new_apartment_complexes_going_to/i1l7lyw/,29,r/olympia,0,29

"Generally speaking, new housing is more desirable. Especially in a place like Olympia where a lot of the old housing stock is moldy postwar garbage.

But what we were seeing was that the new money people moving in were buying whatever they could get, even moving into cheap neighborhoods with shoddy housing on the west side and east side (basically where I've been living forever). With the shortage, that was the best thing they could get. There are houses that squatters back in the day would have looked twice at, that went up by $100k in value in the last year.

She forfeits her own agenda, which is to imply that men who identify as women belong in women's sports while simultaneously making the argument against sex segregated sports at all.

"How long ago did you put in your maintenance request? Per the Fair Housing Act and the Washington Landlord Association you have rights and the landlord has rules they have to abide by. 

My wife and I dealt with something VERY similar with our last landlord - they were absolutely awful and did not provide us with appropriate trash and recycling bins nor did they wish to repair anything much less spend money on the land they purchased and wanted to rent out. These landlords often would push the tenants to get involved with ‚Äúexpansions‚Äù and making the place better and wanted all these ideas but then would flip the conversation and refuse to pay for anything on a conversation they started. She willingly kept a tenant who threatened to shoot first and ask questions later leaving everyone else thoroughly uncomfortable and not wanting to live with said tenant - and yet they refused to do anything. Ultimately due to multiple ignored repair requests we moved without notice.

I could go on but I‚Äôll get to the point - a landlord legally has 24 hours to give a tenant an update on how repairs will be handled for things like hot water and a broken stove ie; necessities to survive.  All other repairs need to be completed in 10 days from tenant notifying the landlord - meaning your sink screw issue should‚Äôve been handled by now. According to the Fair Housing Act AND the Washington Landlords Association a tenant is more than welcome to leave without notice and find a new place because the landlord has already broken the lease by not upholding their end in terms of repairs. (This is how we were able to move without notice per Fair Housing Act you‚Äôre not responsible for notifying your landlord much less cleaning the apartment once they have broken the lease.)

The Washington Landlords Association has all their guidelines etc openly available on their website that can help you know your rights as a tenant and know what your landlord should be doing‚Ä¶ ultimately you‚Äôre more than welcome to message me as well if you have any questions etc. I just know up till having this awful landlord I was blind to what my rights are as a tenant and I urge people now to know their rights.",t2_i6uzdrlr,eeeeeking1031,0,1647829173.0,0,t1_i1hdk45,i1hdk45,True,[deleted],t3_til0jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/til0jj/my_landlord_is_a_slumlord/,My landlord is a slumlord.,/r/olympia/comments/til0jj/my_landlord_is_a_slumlord/i1hdk45/,5,r/olympia,0,5

"And just to make sure my position is clear:

Me defending him because people in the community were calling him a rapist, not based on first hand knowledge, but on rumor, when there is zero available evidence to support that, does not mean he is not a transphobe, nor does it preclude me from calling him out, at any time, ever, for either. 
I prefer to dislike people based on truth, not foundless allegations. 
I would defend you, Bruce, or anyone, if an allegation is unfounded, no matter how vilified or disliked you may be. 
I had plenty of problems with Bruce, but in the scope of his political run, my only issue was the allegations, and the attacks he faced for what was NOT provable (at least at that time) was pretty disgusting.

"If you haven't checked into it yet, the Tenants Union website (https://tenantsunion.org/rights) has a lot of great info about tenant rights and how to proceed if your rights are being violated. The Washington Law Help website (https://www.washingtonlawhelp.org/issues/housing) and NW Justice Project are also good resources. There are specific guidelines per Washington State law for how a tenant needs to request a repair (in writing) and how long the landlord has to respond, depending on the type of repair. It would be wise in your situation to be careful about how you communicate (do it in writing), and to document everything in case you need it later. 

The guy does sound like a jerk, and certainly some landlords are. Then again, as a landlord, I can confirm that no matter how hard you try to be a good one, someone is always going to hate you, someone is always going to pick the one thing you did that they didn't like (even if it does not violate their rights/the law) and they are going to focus on that rather than all the things you did to support them.
