"Well, Spanish Fort isn’t exactly a bastion of diversity. It’s largely white, conservative and many people who live there work high-paying industrial, management or medical jobs, with a few small business owner types mixed in. It is very sports-centered and the stereotypical culture that comes with that. But either there, Daphne, or Fairhope and your kid should adjust fairly well. 

The large majority of people and administrators are kind, caring and supportive. In my experience, bullying is not tolerated and counselors and administrators are good about stopping it when it happens, but of course as with any school, that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Kids here are largely just like other kids across the country - being gay or lesbian isn’t an issue they even bat an eye at. I will say, however, that trans kids are going to have a more difficult time than others, but that’s probably similar in many places around the country. 

I think a lot of it ultimately depends on your kid and their personality and willingness to accept where they live. You live in the south, so you get it more than most. The kids and parents that have had the hardest time are those that have moved here and then acted like everyone who lives here are racist homophobe rednecks when their politics don’t align with the locals. As long as your kid tries to and is able find common interests with a group of other kids, they should be fine at SF.",t2_1263r7,Exops1022,0,1638885177.0,0,t1_hnlculx,hnlculx,False,onelasttrick,t3_raxa8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldwincountyAL/comments/raxa8b/spanish_fort_high_school_inclusivity/,Spanish Fort High School Inclusivity,/r/BaldwincountyAL/comments/raxa8b/spanish_fort_high_school_inclusivity/hnlculx/,3,r/BaldwincountyAL,0,3

"Hey if you're looking for nature you could try Blakeley State Park outside Spanish Fort. Miles of trails so you could go out and find a secluded area for yourselves.

There is Jackson Oak in Bay Fromt park in Daphne which is a large majestic oak with some benches around it. Fairly popular spot so it may not be super private.

Graham Creek Nature Preserve in Foley is very nice with lots of trails to go and find.

 They did a class in the parking lot, and they wouldn't let me use the lifting platform inside

"A better alternative is to buy a 17.5Kw portable Generac Gas generator (Norwall Systems dot com) and fuel it with a buried propane tank after you put simply to install propane conversion kit on it, my dog could install it, remember natural gas lines are subject to shut off when lines are damaged with a tree ripping one up, also the local generator installers are thieves.  The generator I could buy online was $4000 with an automatic transfer box, so I knew ahead of time what the cost of the parts before I started getting bids, these jokers (3) were giving me quotes of $10 to $12K.  One quoted me, $4K for the generator, $2K for a 6 foot hook up to my main panel, and the good part, an additional $4K for the sheer pleasure of doing business with them, seriously they are that bold about it.  His company name rhimes with an unmarried male working with his sons if that's any clue.  I told the fool to exit my property quickly since it was time for my dog to come out and exercise.  I purchased the manual transfer case from a local big box HOME improvement store, ordered the 50' cord and a receptacle, and had a local gas company come out and install the gas tank.  The thieves can go fly a kite on a stormy day.    Remember, propane does not age.

I'd rather not describe the details, but even just trying to barely move the leg to check the dog's gender seemed to cause it a lot of pain and broke my heart. We got a wide piece of plywood and slowly inched her onto it just to get her into the cruiser.

My wife got hooted and hollered at by some dipshit in a WalMart parking lot in the middle of the day and when she drove away to leave, he started following her home. (Through multiple neighborhoods, my wife wasn't about to park at our apartment)

My wife called the cops just in case this was a pattern of behavior so she could say something if he ever got caught. The cop that drove to the apartment got there in like 5 minutes and was super professional and courteous.

Another time I got pulled over in Orange Beach because even though I renewed my tag, I didn't put the sticker on like an idiot. I was pulled over, gave him my license and told him as much. He disappeared to his car for like a minute to check and sent me on my way. Between my wife and I we have probably 3-4 stories like this between us.

"When I moved to the gulf coast 10 years ago, a college friend and I went to visit her grandparents in Daphne. On the way over she told me how she had been pulled over around 5 times in the past 6 months while visiting them and never really been given a reason for being pulled over nor had she been given a ticket. She said that having an older model Jeep and an out of county tag was likely the reason. On our way back to the interstate to head back to campus in Mobile, a cop got right on her tail and, it almost seemed, ""escorted"" us very aggressively to make sure we were ""leaving town"". She wasn't speeding, had insurance, good tag, was in the right lane with a clear left lane to pass in... there was just no reason for an officer, who would have absolutely pulled her over for following another car so closely, to act like that. 

My husband and I were a part of the large group of people who would walk the pier each night after Pokemon Go was released in 2016(?) and never experienced anything similar to my original experience, and I am thankful for that because it was unsettling. In fact we had plenty of positive experiences with Fairhope PD and never experienced any type of ""profiling"" from Daphne again.

I also grew up near Auburn and spent my weekends there in high school so I understand your comparison. Many ""speed trap"" towns come to mind as being similar.

There are cities and towns, especially deep in the south, that want to protect their image and some officers get rather aggressive with their technique on how to do that. Citizens begin not trusting the PD as a whole because complaints about those officers go unchecked and things go downhill from there.",t2_d751kjj,MomshellBelle,0,1615373494.0,0,t1_gqfm021,gqfm021,False,[deleted],t3_m1mj4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldwincountyAL/comments/m1mj4j/what_would_you_rate_the_baldwin_county_police/,What Would You Rate The Baldwin County Police Overall?,/r/BaldwincountyAL/comments/m1mj4j/what_would_you_rate_the_baldwin_county_police/gqfm021/,1,r/BaldwincountyAL,0,1

"I can't help on the fishing part, but I can recommend some places to eat that are nearby. Is there a cuisine that you're interested in?

Fish River Grill has a few locations in the area, great burgers and fried seafood. Big Daddy's also fits into this category. I also really like GooRoos in Robertsdale.

Desmond's in Foley is a good for Jamaican food, Portabella's also in Foley has good pizza.

If you want BBQ, LA BBQ in Summerdale is great, but seriously I haven't had bad BBQ from anywhere in the area. Cafe Acadiana in Silverhill has some good Louisiana cooking. 

Downtown Fairhope has a nice selection of food choices all within walking distance.

There's also a place based out of Fairhope that runs it's own sawyer called Grassroots Wood Co. They harvest from downed trees. They make furniture but I believe they also sell boards, cookies and live edge materials.

Side note, a friend of the family was one of the people with a fleet of power trucks coming in from out of state.

"Some parts of Fairhope have had power for a few days, but areas outside of main grids (like near hospitals, heavier traffic areas on main roads or shopping centers) are still without power. Certain traffic intersections might be out for a while, still.

Also, and I know as much as anyone, city-based trash/rubbish pickup is still on hold a lot of places. The Fairhope, Daphne and Foley focus is on reconnecting utilities, clearing roads and assisting people in need (but still picking up garbage cans in most areas so far that I've heard), and as long as roads aren't being completely blocked, all the debris and limbs and whatnot is basically on a back burner while city employees and outside contractors focus on the more urgent stuff.

"Not too bad. HWY 98 in downtown Foley was flooded about an hour ago, but it floods all the the time. 

CR24 had water over the road and was blocked off so a detour was necessary. It may very well be open in the morning. 

The biggest thing was trees and power lines. They are EVERYWHERE. I went to check on my parents around 3:00 and I couldn’t believe how many down lines I saw.  There were crews clearing things away but I didn’t see too many electrical workers except for one lonely truck. I’m praying they can get some work done overnight. 

A lot of people (myself included) stupidly underestimated this storm. It was downgraded to a CAT1 with 85moh winds. Then within a few hours after going to bed it shit back up to CAT2 with 100mph winds. 
As a result, we didn’t stock up on nonperishables.

"I just heard a report about our house on Perdido Bay, which was built 90 years ago.  The metal roof and the wood decking over the porch that faces the bay was ripped off and thrown in the back yard.  The roof over the house is mostly intact, with leaking in two of the bedrooms.  Other rooms are intact and dry.  This is the first time since the house was built that a portion of the structure was torn off.  Still it could be worse.  Hurricane Ivan, on this date in 2004, tore off all the roof shingles.  The metal roof did a great job this time.

It will take time for the water to go down so we can see about beach damage and look at the boats.  I know a lot of people will be in bad shape after this storm.

"It used to be a really small town that has just a few shops and was really only known for access to the routes across the bay to Mobile.

While there is a large shopping center, the city doesn’t have a real “downtown” area and is more abundant with subdivisions developed by major home-builders.

"From a nearby town to Spanish Fort, but would definitely say three of the biggest things it's known for imo are shopping, high school sports, and access to the bay. 

Shopping-wise there is the Eastern Shore Center that was built a while back. Normally sees a lot of traffic and has some great chain and local stores, along with a few restaurants/bars that are always a good time to visit. Has definitely helped to bolster the economy in the northern half of the county. 

High school sports have always been a significant rival to other schools in the area. Spanish Fort moved to 6A about 5 years ago and has continued to have an impact on the district similar to that it had when it was 5A. Have made many play off runs and won a few championships in most of their sports. Always seem to have a good crowd of supporters following them as well. Arguably a strong focus point of the community.

As far as location, very close to Daphne. Also provides access to the causeway from Baldwin County that allows transportation to Mobile and holds some of the best seafood restaurants in the state. Just north of Spanish Fort is Bay Minette that gives the county interstate access to the beach from I-65. I-10 also runs right by the Eastern Shore Center I mentioned earlier. Plus it is very close to the bay, has a few different landings for boat launches to access the river and the bay itself.
