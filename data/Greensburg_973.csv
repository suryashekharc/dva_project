"Well we specialize in running shoes, but we do more than your average store. If you go to Dick's and ask for a shoe they don't normally measure you. They ask your size and what color go and get it and walk away. We take a little extra time to take a look at your gait and discuss biomechanics to fit you for the correct shoe. We carry the best brands for running shoes like Brooks, Mizuno, Asics, Saucony, New Balance, ON, and Hoka. We just give you top service for no extra cost. So for a little extra time you can get your best fit for a shoe. We also offer a wide range of running clothing and inserts from local doctor recommended  brands to Aetrex which can be custom ordered for you using their super machine (which is much better than Dr. Schols). Overall we look to offer an experience that will have you coming back with honesty and sports science backed results. We work closely with local doctors, schools, and the community to be more than a store we want to be a staple for everyone. If you have a child in a sport like track or cross country we have spikes for them we care about your experience with us and how we can best serve you.

"A lot of the dystopian futures predicted by those old movies, especially the 70s/80s, were based on the urban decay that was happening at the time.  

Back in the 70s/80s what is now downtown Pittsburgh's Cultural District, was [full of porno theatres and massage parlors](https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2005/05/11/End-of-an-era-for-Downtown-strip-clubs/stories/200505110240).  The urban cores of many American cities [looked like bombed out warzones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhChJ4sEw84) as the suburbs prospered.  Inner city violent crime and murder peaked in that era.

Movies like RoboCop were basically just imagining that trajectory of urban decay continuing into a dystopian future.

In reality the pendulum started swinging in the other direction.  Urban cores hit rock-bottom and then started gentrifying, and small towns are collapsing.  Liberty Avenue downtown is where people go to spend $400 on tickets to a touring production of Hamilton, not for a rub and tug.  I still see older people who think that the East Liberty neighborhood in Pittsburgh is a violent slum, because that was its reputation in the 90s, when today it's home to Google engineers and Whole Foods and million dollar homes.",t2_97y6q,Excelius,0,1642386302.0,0,t1_hsziebf,hsziebf,True,green_st156,t3_s0v7yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/greensburg/comments/s0v7yw/has_greensburg_entered_the_dystopian_future_we/,Has greensburg entered the dystopian future we were warned of?,/r/greensburg/comments/s0v7yw/has_greensburg_entered_the_dystopian_future_we/hsziebf/,5,r/greensburg,0,5

"It’s a bit far, but I really really like Lampert’s in McKeesport. If you ever commute that way, it’s definitely worth to stop. They have butchered meats, deli meats, homemade desserts and chips, and they always have hot homemade food for sale. It was definitely a favorite lunch spot whenever I worked out that way. 

Other than that, I like Delallo’s too. 

I’d be weary of Naser’s out towards Pleasant Unity though. After I moved to the area, I used it as our main grocery store (until I learned where the Walmart and Aldi were lol) and the prices of their products are very expensive compared to buying the same thing at another store. I also was sold moldy bread there, moldy potato chips, and rotting potatoes and onions. According to my extended family who lives out here, their quality has gone down hill. I also know of a few other customers dealing with the same problem (actually I heard a lady yelling at and getting really irate with a cashier because she was sold a moldy bread product).

Depends on your reason for a attorney. Who or where ever you go make sure he or she is a specialist. Law is so complex that no attorney can do it all. Criminal law is different than writing a will. You don't want a ambulance chaser for family law. Hiring a lawyer is not the same as a mechanic. Find out how networked your lawyer is. You don't want a lawyer fresh to law. You want one with a history of accomplishment.

"I grew up in Greensburg, moved away for college and grad school, and have been in my current house in Hempfield for 7 years. I have 3 elementary age kids, and there are so many activities for kids! They are both playing softball this summer and do a daycamp program thru a local daycare. The Greensburg Art Center has lots of fun art classes for kids (and adults). The Westmoreland Museum also has kids classes, but they are still virtual but I’m hoping they will be in person by the fall. There are lots of dance schools, and we’ve had good luck with the youth program at Seton Hill. Hempfield Rec has a nice soccer and basketball program for kids. 

My kids absolutely love their elementary school, and the teachers worked so hard to make school as fun as it could be even with all the Covid restrictions. 

There are a lot of more conservative people in the area, but there are definitely liberal people too.

"This is fantastic and super helpful advice, thank you. I’ve had enough hip for a lifetime, and im looking to sort of remove myself from that culture. I worked as an artist and in the arts for years, I need something new. I’ll take chain restaurants as long as I can get a decent cocktail once a year!

I think the sweet spot for us is in Hempfield SD, but I do like the community stuff that is going on in Greensburg city proper. My brother lives in an upscale neighborhood in Irwin, it’s not really our scene but I do also like that Irwin has a lot of food/shopping options. It’s a lot nicer out there than I remember it being.

And there are definitely tons of camping spots, Idlewild, and the airport for the air show that they do so often. 

Even since I've moved up here things are changing, but it's less ""hip"" and more commercialized, if that makes sense, more chain restaurants.. 

But. Lynch field updated their pool. The rec center has tons of activities. 

Sustainable food? So big out here!  And you know what? I drive down my road and almost everyone has their own garden. It seems everyone is extremely knowledgeable these subjects too and everything is accessible. I'm not deep into this culture yet but I know its big out here. 

I can't speak for schooling quality yet as my kids aren't in real school! ... I do know Hempfield SD is a top school though. 

If you're looking a little higher class neighborhoods, I'd say take a look in Irwin (plus its close to the turnpike)... More farm like, look out in the direction of Herminie (be careful of school district, stay in Hempfield). New Stanton is cute but kinda boring. Greensburg is more city ish and close to everything.

"This is so helpful, Thank you! I love your response, this is the kind of thing I’m looking for.

Do you mind pmming the name of your daycare?

We would likely move when my kids are 2-5 ish years of age (in about 2 years) so we’d be more interested in young kid stuff. Dance, sports, Girl Scouts. Everything you mentioned sounds great. I used to do a lot of classes at Wccc and like that they have continuing education. Camps at st. Vincent and seton hill, guest speakers at colleges, live music, etc.

I’m terms of adult stuff, my husband and I used to love going out to eat or getting fancy cocktails when we lived in Bloomfield/Lawrenceville, but that just isn’t super interesting anymore. We haven’t found a place in greensburg that we like intensely for this, but I did like j. Corks (please tell me it’s still there?) and to be honest, we’re old and who has time for that. Our primary goals are academic opportunities for the kids outside of school, access to arts and culture, and more access to sustainable food, better air quality, community activities, and just a better overall quality of life.

We’re in Millvale/Shaler now, which is having its own community renaissance which is so fun, and I’m so conflicted. I can be in Lawrenceville in 10 minutes and McKnight in 5. But I’m terms of that proximity to the city, do you know how often we do anything in the city? Like never. But it sounds like Greensburg has a lot of the core stuff that we are looking for. My friends are all old, have kids, and we just don’t need to be around all of this stuff anymore.

The only other issue I pause on is diversity. It was always a shame to me that there wasn’t much by way of diversity when I was growing up, and that’s one thing that we’ve always appreciated about my stepdaughter’s school and our daycares. I think this might be less of an issue now, but Is still a thing. My husband had an opposite experience where he was always the minority as a white-passing person, and I’m worried that he really doesn’t know what he’s getting into moving to a really white area, and the sort of subtlety that I probably can’t verbalize that comes with that.

Anyway I love that you mention garage saleing! I forgot how much better thrifting is too around there!!

"Hi there. Mother of two here (4 and 2.5 yo). Grew up in Pittsburgh and have been living in Greensburg for the last 12 or so years. 

What interests do you have and what is the dynamic of your family's life? 

There is lots to do here, you just have to find it, according to your interests. For example, they have Friday night movies in the park, and Sounds of Summer (not sure if they're doing that this year). The library is having a lot of virtual stuff for the kids, not sure about in person stuff, but I think so. Casino, and some nice restaurants are popping up. Plus Monroeville is close for if you are bored with the places here. (Unfortunately only 1 bookstore here but half price isn't too far). 

Lots of sports and dance classes to enroll the kids in. 

Lots of parks and less intense people make it feel safer. 

If your kids are in daycare... I am fully confident in the one I've been sending my kids to (4+ years). I also am friends with another daycare owner and many of our friends send their kids there (lots of trust).

It's generally conservative, I'd say, but tons of liberals too. Most on both sides are generally very nice. 

When you're looking for quality, you'll find it since there are reputable businesses here. For example, lots of family owned butcher shops, quality farmers markets (albeit small). Walmart pickup is always available for the next few days. 

Little to no traffic at all times (unless you're always on 30 then definitely traffic, comparable to a busy route 19).

If I think of any more I'll edit this post.


Edit to add: there are a number of small neighborhoods and areas you may like to peruse to get the feel you're looking for. We moved to the end of New Stanton so it feels like the country. But we're 10 min for Irwin Walmart and 11 min from downtown Greensburg. My husband's family has lived in this area for years so even our 80 year old neighbor knows his grandma.

"Welcome!  I work at the hospital and lived in Greensburg city for 10 years!  Jioio’s has a clash classic, thin crust, sweet pizza that you must try at least once (gotta pick it up, no delivery). Classic pizza/delivery food for me is GianellI’s (Carbon, not the one on RT 30); never had a bad meal from there. Bubba’s is great for pierogis, “chicken lips”, and the pizza there is different but good. Anatolia (Turkish food) is awesome!  For ghetto Chinese, Fortune Cookie is the cheapest and tastiest; but if you want noodles/pad Thai order from the place beside Walmart (don’t remember the name).  Best sushi is at Robokyo; Peking Garden delivers decent sushj as well.  You MUST hit up Dellallo’s (pricey, but the best meat/cheese/bakery items; the subs and pre-made food is AMAZING! Oakmant Bakery/the Prantl’s on Grove street are also great.

An hour is perfect, you have Pittsburgh and ohiopyle (if that's what you're into).

Furniture: goodwill, UFO (if it's still open) christian layman store is also good for furniture.  

As was mentioned, twin lakes has a skate park.  Talk to people there about where else to skate.

Try the pizza from jioios.  It's a love or hate thing, but those that love it LOVE it.  If jioios is too sweet but you like the crust try falbos in south greensburg.  Parkwood is also great thin crust pizza.  The boulevard has good food too, and I love their coffee. 

Johnny's wife's place in Jeannette is a cool bar with good pizza and great wings.  Falbos in latrobe has my personal favorite wings followed closely by persichettis in Jeannette, but I like breaded wings.  Johnny's wife's place has my favorite non breaded wings.

If you haven't ever tried it, get a primantis sandwich.  You're close enough to Pittsburgh to be considered a pittsburgher by anyone that doesn't live in sw pa, so you have to at least try primantis, and you're not allowed to eat hunts ketchup anymore.  

Check out local craft breweries if that's your thing; all saints and helltown are great.  Invisible man and sobels have also opened up since I moved to away but I can't speak to the quality as ive never been there.

"Everything is relative. There’s free concerts two days a week in the summer. We’re about 5-10 minutes from a lake, 20 minutes from another lake. Plenty of opportunity to kayak, fish, and swim. About an hour from Ohiopyle so there’s all that there plus more. We have a library (I hear those are disappearing.) among other things. Bowling alley, pretty sure we have axe throwing now too, painting with a twist. Plenty of stores so you don’t need to drive far. The cost of living is pretty low compared to a lot of the populated areas of the country; we have a cheap airport (Latrobe) and a nice nearby city and good deep rooted sports teams. What’s not to like? One of the better suburbs imo.

Edit: three different ski resorts within a half hour to 45 minutes away. Multiple other bigger lakes within about an hour to an hour and a half and other activities. There’s a shit ton to do around here, if you’ve been here for 25 years and you think it’s boring, you really should get out more. There are a bunch of really good hobby stores around two for people that like magic the gathering and stuff like that as well. Not to mention some of the local fish stores, not Petsmart or Petco, and other exotic pet dealers that have really good stuff. You could go out tomorrow when they open and come home with an alligator if you wanted. If that doesn’t entertain you then who knows what will. Heck we have our own dispensary for medical marijuana next to rite aid. 

Personally I skied for two years and have snowboarded for around 8-10 with breaks in between, I’m just getting into kayaking; not so much into biking though. I like the summer concerts on Friday at the ampetheater in town and the ones outside the palace theater on Thursdays, they are decent options if you have nothing to do and don’t want to spend money. There’s a other stuff too.. you just need to look, and maybe drive 15 minutes to an hour (which is nothing.)

"Actually, many fire departments are volunteer. The last I checked through the NFPA registry over 70% of America's firefighters are volunteer. 

Paid departments are not a bad thing mind you, but remember that the costs would be a lot higher than one would think. All new stations would need to be built or bought from existing companies, the equipment, all of the different levels of fire apparatus, plus paying anywhere from 45-60k a year in salary, versus taxes, benefits, retirements and increased costs in workers comp and liability insurances. a recent news article showed that the costs of having a paid fire service in a large area would cost roughly the same as 2/3 of the current property taxes already in place. 

To date I'm not sure how Jeannette remains paid, but I am glad they do. They're one of the few paid in this county, and provide a serious amount of help to the hempfeild area as well. 

As a side note, people  who do have paid positions in this state often require a great deal (Close to 500+ hours) of training and a number of years of active service in firefighting just to apply. To think the standard firefighting certification course is now close to 200 hours of training time, and that is just an essentials program.

The requirements for the jobs would be higher in time served and training, but as of recent, the talks were to open it, and see who would apply, not giving the current firefighters as chance to take the work first. 

Having paid fire staff, and possibly in the near future a paid police staff is going to take a lot of revenue, the casino is one aspect of it, but after so many years, this is how they solve this crisis, not by coming to help, but to take over, and start spending money the fire departments could've used for some time to pay people, and take over what is already here.",t2_6ryzj,Dasbaus,0,1572023637.0,0,t1_f56idui,f56idui,False,Dasbaus,t3_dmz9iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/greensburg/comments/dmz9iu/looking_for_opinions_on_hempfeild_fire_service/,Looking for opinions on Hempfeild Fire Service,/r/greensburg/comments/dmz9iu/looking_for_opinions_on_hempfeild_fire_service/f56idui/,1,r/greensburg,0,1
"As a general idea, most fire companies show around 10 active fire fighters per station, so roughly 120 people total in the township being active. Some are lower, and the rates are declining.

The entire trade has changed over the years, and with the way of the world now, not many have the time to do it like we did in the past.

"You can definitely do those things in Greensburg, but if you like frequently seeking out new experiences and variety you might find your options limited after a couple of years.  For example, there are a number of good bars and restaurants, and a couple great ones, but even among these they mostly tend to be typical American or Italian fare.  

I've lived in all three places.  Pittsburgh (though I didn't commute to Greensburg at the time), Greensburg, and now I live in the eastern PGH suburbs and commute.  All three have their advantages.  I think my recommendation would be to start in Greensburg and after a year or two see if you still want to stay there.  Rent is cheaper, and the commute is obviously not an issue.  I don't see much advantage at your stage living in the suburbs - they are in many ways much the same as Greensburg.

"For the people telling you Livermore, it's not haunted.  When the water on Conemaugh River is at the right level, it allows for some fantastic echoing.  I was kayaking out there one day right by the cemetery and spent nearly 30 minutes clapping my hands and making other dumb noises.  It would echo off the right hill, then the left, then the right over and over going downstream until it hit what I assume was either the next bridge or the dam, then come back upstream pass me, and continue going.

"Her name is Anne. She frequents where I work, and she's really incredibly sweet. Her daughter passed away a few years ago, and she does have some mental health issues, but she means well. She did ""attack a car"" once, but the driver was an asshole.

He turned right from Pittsburgh street onto main through a red, missing a pedestrian by a few inches. So, she shouted ""Hey, you can't turn there,"" and gestured in his direction with her cane. He stopped in the middle of the street and assaulted her, and sent her to the ER. Every time I go to the courthouse and see her there, if she shouts at cars, it's only the people turning right on red or speeding through lights.

My source for the info on her being assaulted was my coworker who saw it happen. I've talked to her a number of times, and she never has any malice.

"> In looking at the population stats, it appears you guys have a few thousand less people than Jtown does, but it feels like there's a lot more going on there! Is this just perception?

I don't know if it's fair to just compare town-to-town statistics.

Sure Johnstown is the bigger town, but there's not a whole lot around it.  Westmoreland County has almost three times the population as Cambria County, and is part of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area.

So long as you have a car, that puts you within convenient range of a lot more stuff.
