"In Order: 

* **Sticks & Stone** is great if you can track them down.
* **Pizza Market** is great pan pizza, expensive though. Sauce is spicier than average if you're sensitive to that (or if you're feeding kids).
* **Super King Pizza** is great and well-priced pan pizza.
* **Pizza Farm** is good enough for the price. Nothing special, but nothing offensive. It's my go-to when ordering for kids since it's not too spicy.
* **Sauced** is good thin-crust wood fired pizza, their crust was pretty tough last time I had it.
* **Truro Pizza House** puts waaay to much cheese on their pizza. If you're into that you may like it, I'm not though.
* **Greco** is only good for is getting a huge order for a crowd. I would never get it for myself. It's way too sweet.
* **Mario's Pizza and Donair** - I had it once, I wouldn't go back. Flavorless and doughy.
* **Damascus** also wasn't impressive.
* **The Patio Lantern** was also pretty bad
* **Acropole** is a thing of it's own.

"Hi there,

Are you using electric baseboards? keep in mind we have some of the highest electricity rates in the country at .16cents per kilowatt hour. Off peak rates are available through Nova Scotia Power but you need to fulfill the requirements to be given those rates (special heating units and insulation). Do you know how to read your power meter? It's sometimes handy to get a baseline number, and then read it again in a few days to get an idea of what your power consumption is per day.  I'm known in the family as a bit of a power nazi, so I can definitely help you track down the issue but I suspect it's electric baseboard heat.

Edit: Here are the rates you would have been paying in ONT: [https://www.oeb.ca/rates-and-your-bill/electricity-rates](https://www.oeb.ca/rates-and-your-bill/electricity-rates)

Also; another thing to consider, did you use Natural Gas back in Ontario? It can run things like your heat and stove which would lessen your power bill back in Ontario as well.

Look for pasture (grass fields which are grazed) sheep grazed fields are the best as the mushrooms are easier to find (because the grass is short). Also needs to be permanent pasture i.e. not dug up or ploughed. I think moorlands are generally one of the best habitats then old agricultural grassland.

If you are suggesting that the government cut unemployment benefits to match the low wages offer by some employers, then that wouldn't be a win for the employees. 

You would have to think that the government set unemployment benefits at the current rate for a reason. They believe that the current unemployment benefits are what is needed to maintain a quality standard of life.  

Employers should have to raise their pay to incentivize people to work for them. Not the government lowering unemployment.

"There is one my one electric company here, Nova Scotia Power. If you watch Cable tc, there is only one cable company, but most folks probably watch their tc via the Internet. There are a few different providers of internet, depends on where you land in Truro - as to which one might be better.  Natural gas is only available in some areas, and I believe there is only one company for that as well, but can’t confirm.


For activities, Truro is actually pretty decent.  Good parks, lots of community activities. People are generally friendly.  I guess it depends on what your interests are, but you are also not far from Halifax, which has most amenities and decent shopping, etc.

"I think Truro has been fairly stagnant in the home value department. We've been in our current place for 12 years and up until this past year we would have been fairly lucky to sell it for much more than we bought it for. It worked out for us because we needed a bigger place and were able to find a place that wasn't outlandishly priced.

It sounds as if you were maybe a renter that was priced out of Ontario? I think a lot of the animosity towards interprovincial migration is the thought that someone from a market where they already own a house, sells it for several hundred thousand dollars, then comes to an Atlantic province, drops 450 thousand dollars on a place because they have the means to and then it just compounds out because the market dictates that is what you now need to spend.

I just bought a house in Truro coming from Ontario.  I wanted to apologize. Seeing as my purchase among others has pushed the market to where it is today. It was not our intention. The housing market across the country has been climbing to unsustainable levels for the past year. I don't think this is a problem that is just facing Nova Scotia. A single family home in my hometown of Kitchener Ontario averages $650k! That's absolutely ridiculous.

" Description: It’s not news that housing prices across the province have skyrocketed in the last year, and rents aren’t faring any better. Too many Nova Scotians are being left behind by unregulated housing prices and lack of  government action.

"I don’t think that’s practical. It may last longer, but concrete is far more expensive to lay and to repair. It’s an inferior driving surface, especially in the winter. It’s slippery so the surface must be roughed, and the slabs are rigid and settle over time—leading to a noisy and bumpy road. Potholes can only be repaired by replacing the entire affected slab, taking significantly more time and manpower compared to a simple patch job. Making the slabs smaller mitigates this a bit at the cost of making the road even more bumpy and noisy. 

Asphalt is recyclable, it can be turned into new asphalt. Concrete can only be downcycled into gravel.",t2_44bph,imbluedabedeedabedaa,0,1622467333.0,0,t1_h02vhxo,h02vhxo,False,Prestigious-Number-7,t3_noegju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Truro/comments/noegju/the_pothole_bylaw_needs_to_be_addressed/,The Pothole By-Law needs to be addressed.,/r/Truro/comments/noegju/the_pothole_bylaw_needs_to_be_addressed/h02vhxo/,1,r/Truro,0,1

"Hi! 

  
First, my thoughts are that house inspections are rarely worth it.  They will do a visual inspection of the house, probably test the outlets and maybe the septic, but in general, they are not worth the value and don't really delve into where any real issues could be found.   I don't see how the quality of neighbours plays into the inspection. (And of course the inspector things you should pay him, lol)

Second, Truro locals will complain about a few areas as being more sketchy than others, but its all pretty safe over all.  Especially if you compare to bigger cities.  Truro is quite a small town all things considered.  There is of course crime, but there is no where in Truro that I would feel unsafe walking alone after midnight.  The Walker Street / Prince street area is particularly safe, I would say.  Its a little busier than most areas, as Prince Street is mostly businesses, and Walker Street in that area is the location of the Sobeys grocery.  Its well lit and safe.

Third, 862 Prince street is right around the corner and is the Homeless Shelter.  I have never had an issue with this, but with homelessness you often also encounter mental health issues, so there is potential for concern there.  Homelessness is a problem in all towns, and the center is definitely a good thing, just wanted to note it in case you were unaware.",t2_bje66,Downvotes__Cats,0,1619103296.0,0,t1_gvg83dq,gvg83dq,True,SK2Nlife,t3_mw5k29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Truro/comments/mw5k29/walker_street_prince_street_sketchy_area/,Walker street / prince street: sketchy area?,/r/Truro/comments/mw5k29/walker_street_prince_street_sketchy_area/gvg83dq/,5,r/Truro,0,5

"Well... That depends on your level of tolerance. Your agent did not do you right by not discussing the area. If it is a steal of a price.. there is a reason... Especially in this sellers property market.

 The area does have a reputation and is the buildings are less expensive due to their condition, environment (both commercial and busy street and transient population) and reputation.

If you are looking to gentrify the property, there could be potential. Your building inspector is a less biased view as the agent is in the business of selling property. 

Again.. it comes down to your tolerance both for value and risk. Depending on where your are coming from and what you looking for moving back.. out can work out great if you go in with open eyes and information.

"Welcome to Truro! We moved here two years ago from Halifax. I work at the hospital. It’s a gorgeous hospital and I love it. Could never go back to the city now. We have two kids and are thrilled with the schools and the daycare here. 

Truro is a cute town and the parks and farmers market make it for me. I got really into mountain biking here which I never would have tried if I were still living in the city. Now it’s a major hobby for the whole family. We also love to ski/snowboard and there is a fun ski hill 30minutes away. Halifax is only an hour away and we go once a month for date night there. Truro is the hub town for a reason, easy to do lots of day trips from here to different parts of our beautiful province. 

The town is a bit sleepy and slow but that’s the appeal to me, days don’t feel like a rat race here. Everything just feels easier, everything is close. People are really friendly. The town is quite walkable too. It’s not for everyone but I think if you chose to move here you probably like the idea of a small town and the life it offers and so I don’t think Truro will disappoint. 

Unpopular opinion apparently but I am super into craft beer and don’t have much love for the Salty dog at all. The other one in town I haven’t indulged in that much.

">Housing is a basic human right and shouldn't be treated as a commodity.

I'm not arguing with that at all. It is something I believe in very strongly, but that does not translate to ""everyone should be able to buy the house they want"". There does need to be affordable housing, but that is a separate issue. Everyone has a right to have a sufficient amount of healthy nutritious food, but not everyone has a right to steak and lobster just because some people can afford it. Same with any other commodity. The op and his wife have two professional incomes, and they have earned one of the benefits that come with that. This is my last word on it here, because I don't want to hijack the original post. A thread like this really does go to show how negative people see negative things, and positive people see positive things. I don't regret my move to Truro (despite the potholes) and will continue to enjoy the park, the farmer's market, NovelTea (and a lot of other unique businesses), the Cobequid trail, Masstown Market, the skating rink, our AMAZING library - and a lot more. :)",t2_7v7oe,seaforcinnamon,0,1616851336.0,0,t1_gsg0mym,gsg0mym,False,GuyDanger,t3_mdm04d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Truro/comments/mdm04d/moving_to_truro_ns_from_ontario/,Moving to Truro NS from Ontario,/r/Truro/comments/mdm04d/moving_to_truro_ns_from_ontario/gsg0mym/,1,r/Truro,0,1

"Well our experiences differ.  I know for example with the recent Minimum wage increases in Ontario many lost there paid breaks.  As for cost of living?  At the end of the day about equal.  If you live in a denser populated town or city very expensive for a single person versus a smaller town where rent can be as much as half the cost.  Here I have found similar save not so many high populated areas.

However it comes down to something simple if your not happy with Minimum wage look for a better paying job and/or improve yourself to qualify for a higher paying job.

"I'll answer a few more of these. I was born close to the Kennetcook River. Yes, it floods whenever we get a lot of rain and the tide comes in, or in the late spring when the snow is melting, it can also get bad and come up to be road level.

"Also:

Quarantine laws are fairly strict right now. Mandatory 14 day isolation but an air bnb would be fine. You just have to give the address you are staying at and they call and check up on you a couple times. Pets depend on the air bnb.


For home inspectors, the real estate agent you are using could probably recommend someone.

Bus service for kids depends on where you are, usually the further out kids get it or you might have to drive them to a designated pick up point where several families drop kids off, but you could always call the school district and they can give you the bus routes for the area you are looking at.

Building material was hard to get a hold of but its getting better now, still can be expensive but if you do the work yourself vs hiring people it brings the costs down significantly.

The toll roads that I can think of are for the 2 bridges going from Halifax to Dartmouth and vice versa, $1 per crossing ( cheaper with the Macpass/epass) .

"Unfortunatly the way the system works minimum wage will always be hardly enough to survive regardless the of the wage, $12.55/hr  or $30/hr. Once the minimum wage gets set the rest of the economy will adjust prices to reflect this change to included increased profit margins which will continue to decrease the purchasing power of minimum wage earners. The employment system works on the supply and demand model, employers want to pay as little as possible for employees so as long as people keep devaluing theirself by working for these wages, they will never increase. Why pay someone 20$ when there is someone willing to do it for $12.55 with a little bitching.

"Yes, Bell Aliant got the all of the contracts for Round 2 from DevelopNS, but Colchester/Cumberland are being served entirely by Xplornet, which was awarded the contract in Round 1.  I also have a contact at Bell Aliant, and they confirmed that Bell has zero plans on running new fiber lines in rural Colchester at this time.

Also, based on the link above, as well as the [press release from Colchester Counter](https://colchester.ca/media-releases), and the [press release from Xplornet themselves](https://www.xplornet.com/about/news/going-faster-xplornet-high-speed-broadband-now-available-to-16000-nova-scotia-homes/), they **are** going to be providing fiber to the home for roughly 3500 customers.

I have been told (unofficially) that there will be a fiber line run right in front of my house, but I'm getting more and more frustrated with the lack of information from Xplornet about what their plans are, and when they will have work done.

The only timeline that I can seem to go on is the one from the Colchester County release which states ""Network completion is expected within three years.""

"I've lived in Truro all my life and currently have no plans to leave. I am going to list it out as it comes to me. Some points are good, some are not so good.

* Victoria Park is great, lots of trails, good playground.
* Downtown businesses have really started to thrive the last few years.
* Close to Highway 102 which can take you to any major highway intersection to get you anywhere in Nova Scotia
* Housing is (more)affordable, but has been getting a bit foolish lately, as any other area has. New listings are selling as soon as they are listed, but to my knowledge not too far above asking.
* Bible Hill Recc Park is near by, great for kids, they have a splash pad
* Newly constructed Tidal Bore park / playground.
* The population is old, which sometimes can get in the way of progressive ideas.
* Roads get obliterated yearly and the paving season seems to drag on forever.
* If you want to drive anywhere, assume you are going to have to stop for a train.
* Comparatively, I think we have a great police force (note: I'm not a criminal)
* Job market isn't amazing, but if your husband works remotely and you stay at home this isn't an issue.
* Navigating downtown during weekday afternoons can be a bit crazy when school lets out followed by Stanfields (factory)
* No Costco, but there is one in Dartmouth less than an hour away.
* There are a few factories that have intermittent odors, but I think I'm nose blind to it at this point.
* Close to North shore beaches (super warm compared to any others in the province)
* Someone already mentioned, but the deer. At first it's amazing having nature in your back yard. Eventually you start to wonder if the idea to have a culling of deer ain't half bad.
* There is some fun stuff to do as a family certain times of the year. Pride Parade, Canada Day stuff, Riverbreeze corn maze, skating by the library, Christmas Tree lighting / parade ect.
* Safe enough. There are some sketchy areas, but most are blown out of proportion. We obviously were very close to the Mass Shooting earlier this year, but I'd like to think that was one off. I've heard stories about overly assertive pan handling down on Inglis st, but that isn't exclusive to Truro.

"I moved back to Truro after a prolonged absence in my early 30s with a young child.  I think it's a great place to be, especially if you're in a work from home situation (I am as well).  Real estate is cheap, there are some great neighbourhoods and the schools are good.  The location is good as well.  It's only 35 minutes to the airport (faster than some people that live in parts of Halifax) and less than an hour to downtown Halifax.

As far as crime goes, I've never seen, heard or experienced any sort of crime in town.  I know it's there because the stats say so, but it's not a pervasive part of life for most people, like most other places in the country I imagine.  I don't lock my door all the time and I let my kids ride their bikes around the neighbourhood on their own without worrying.

As far as places to live in town, most places are good with maybe the exception of a handful of streets, but you'd be able to tell by looking at streetview that it's not really a great place to be.  The West side of town tends to be a bit nicer in my opinion (Smith, Broad, Longworth, Patillo, Park, Normandy, Duke\\Dominion\\King area).  Further up the hill towards the elementary school has some nice areas as well (Fundy, Cobequid, Pleasant, Mount Pleasant, Purdy).
