One of the effects of a Wal-Mart on a town is that it will entirely seize all the goods and services of the business community without any particular dependence on the economy of the area.

Should they ever make the decision to close the store (as they have in Nowata, Oklahoma; Hearne, Texas; or Grand Saline, Texas), then Dublin takes it in the shorts.

"I rent from Garcia and I haven't had any problems with them other than feeling like their rental prices are higher than what I think the spaces are worth. I've had to file a maintenance request once and it was handled and fixed quickly, but the job was kinda shotty.

In my experience, they don't handle tenet to tenet grievances well though. I've lived at my place for 7-8 years and have had great neighbors the entire time and everyone speaks pretty kind of each other, but I had someone move in below me a while back who began playing guitar for like two hours at a time without headphones and It could be heard all throughout the building and especially in my apartment. I put up with it as long as I could for about month and hit my breaking point. I recorded it and emailed Garcia about it and their solution was to make excuses for the neighbor after he claimed that he works on guitars and takes them home to fix them, which required him to play them. The neighbor decided that he was going to start provoking me by moving around my planters and lawn furniture, which was bothering no one nor impeding anyone's ability to use the yard. I brought it up and they just said that everyone needs to share the yard. Also, one morning I was getting ready for work and while putting my belt on, the metal part hit the wood floor and he called to revenge complain, which resulted in them calling me to relay that I had been ""stomping around"". After explaining what the ""stomping around"" probably was, they pretty much just kept asking me to be conscious of my walking through the apartment, which I couldn't have eye rolled harder at.

It just feels like their brand of conflict resolution is be passive and not recognize a problem, but rather convince people to find a way to cope with it.

Other than that, I am totally okay with them.",t2_8radm,jayeedoubleeff,0,1648247807.0,0,t1_i24i4j5,i24i4j5,True,BananaBoatMotorHome,t3_to25kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/to25kv/thoughts_on_garcia_properties/,Thoughts on Garcia Properties?,/r/StLouis/comments/to25kv/thoughts_on_garcia_properties/i24i4j5/,1,r/StLouis,0,1

"I'm on board with his argument regarding restarting the trolley and not repaying the federal grant. I'd rather spend the money running the trolley than giving it back to the feds and getting nothing.

That said, the argument that we should spend more money running it through Forest Park to the CWE MetroLink station doesn't make any sense, especially given his reasoning. The MetroLink already goes from Debaliviere to the CWE which would mean spending more money to continue having the trolley duplicate the MetroLink route. Forest Park gets crazy busy and has many cycists on the streets in the park. So either the trolley will get stuck in traffic and its tracks will trip up cyclists or it will need dedicated ROW through the park for a little used amenity, while Metro already runs a bus through the park.

Following through with the plan he mentions would be a terrible example of corridor planning. The entire new route mentioned would be through Forest Park where there are 0 opportunities for development, the BJC area doesn't need anything else to spur development, and he even said on the podcast that there is development. So you are spending a lot of money with no return in the form of development.

Also, if you are going to expand the route then it makes no sense to continue using the stupid trolley cars and not modern trams.

"First, you absolutely have the right to get a firearm if you want, but you absolutely do not need a firearm to defend yourself in the city. St. Louis is a safe city and the vast majority of people in the city will never be a victim of violent crime (i.e. mugging). There are tons of threads about this very topic you can search, but the short explanation is that our political boundaries are drawn in a way that makes St. Louis look worse than it is in crime statistics. If you look at the area as a whole (and ignore the funny political boundaries) then St. Louis looks just like any other Midwest rust belt city. 

Second, muggers and thieves have guns too. Using a gun poorly you are more likely to end up injuring yourself or getting yourself shot than you are likely to successfully defend yourself. Responsible gun ownership means going to the range regularly, spending hundreds of dollars on practice ammo, and training yourself so that you can instinctively and safely perform in a crisis situation. If that sounds like a fun hobby to you, then by all means go for it. 

You will never quickdraw on a mugger who already has their gun out and is demanding your wallet and jewelry. That's Hollywood stuff. You will bleed out and die. 

If you're only worried about the cash value of your ring or other property, renter's insurance and homeowner's insurance policies can cover property lost due to theft for a fraction of the cost of buying a handgun and practicing regularly.

Lastly, Missouri state law preempts local municipalities in passing gun control legislation. Some localities do have gun control laws on the books, but they cannot be enforced if they are more restrictive than State law. However, federal law still applies and establishes a variety of places where carrying is regulated or illegal. Post offices and post office parking lots, other federal buildings and their parking lots, federal parks, school zones, etc.",t2_snpmb7k,EZ-PEAS,0,1648225302.0,0,t1_i22ytj9,i22ytj9,True,weiss-2021,t3_tno32t,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/tno32t/concealed_carry/,Concealed carry?,/r/StLouis/comments/tno32t/concealed_carry/i22ytj9/,1,r/StLouis,0,1

"If the question is just whether or not to allow infill to occur or have it completed as part of a single developers large project, then I'm really agnostic to which approach you take. I like the outcome better when it's not a single developer but that's not a big deal to me.

I'd say a better approach is just a form-based zoning code, removing parking minimums, and the city setting aside land for present and future public amenities.

I just think that even if you want to go the planned community approach, then there are better places already in St. Louis city to look at for inspiration and definitely better if we broaden it to look outside the region.

I think the North Sarah development is fine (though I hate their parking set up but I understand why it's like that and I wish they had more height on some of the buildings) but not really comparable to New Town.

However we get there, I'm sure we agree on what makes a successful area (and we can see it in the areas of the city that have seen reinvestment).

1. One or more commercial districts with small to medium sized storefronts for restaurants, shops, bars, fitness studios, etc.

Thats right because there is a lot of very suspicious behavior [if you watch the video of the neighbor and the three men from the truck](https://youtu.be/dcU5DGCS3gI?t=94).

Most notably that none of them called 911 and instead immediately the men fled after the shooting (if it was true self-defense they would have called 911 immediately  and waited for the authorities) and then the woman herself kept her mouth shut until much later, claiming she was 'threatened' by the lawn mowing men to keep silent.

It is far more likely that the men and woman used the time to get their stories straight on a plausible self-defense claim.

"The initial portion of New Town is what I‚Äôm talking about. Is the stuff that abuts Boschertown still a part of it? I assume it‚Äôs all just going to fade out into normal suburbs at some point. 

I guess the difference, in my opinion, is whether you‚Äôre just building housing vs. the planned community model that New Urbanist developments use. I think the North Sarah development in Vandeventer is also a good example. It‚Äôs built into the existing grid, it has a good amount of commercial space, a mix of housing, it has a nice park, playgrounds, fitness center, community space. That kind of cohesive development gives it a level of desirability from the start, especially somewhere like north city that has lost a lot of these amenities over the years (or, in New Town‚Äôs case, just never had them because it was all farmland).

If it‚Äôs just density you‚Äôre worried about, the housing mix could be altered. New Town has the ingredients, just adjust the proportions, e.g. more rowhouses, less detached SFH.",t2_zsrbq,cooledtube,0,1648220656.0,0,t1_i22mxjg,i22mxjg,False,lugnut92,t3_tms1y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/tms1y0/city_of_st_louis_population_fell_below_300000/,"City of St. Louis population fell below 300,000 last year, new census estimates show",/r/StLouis/comments/tms1y0/city_of_st_louis_population_fell_below_300000/i22mxjg/,1,r/StLouis,0,1

"Systemic racism in housing practices has existed in St. Louis for over a century- causing lots of disinvestments in places like North City. For example: JeffVanderLou (majority black) has an 18 year difference in life expectancy in comparison to Clayton (majority white).

Giving African Americans basic rights has been conflicting since it officially became a state in 1821. Look up Dred Scott.

Crazy enough, in the 1880's, St. Louis had the third largest Black population. A few decades later, ordinances were put in place banning African Americans from living in white neighborhoods due to ""ill feelings"".  St. Louis became more segregated when an ordinance stated that no person of any race could live in a block where at least 75% of residents were of another race. This ordinance only lasted a year, but it caused significant separation to neighborhoods. After the ordinance was dropped, other tactics were use to marginalize black folks and keep them in particular neighborhoods. These tactics included racial covenants, redlining, and blockbusting. 

Thennnn, urban renewal and slum clearance destroyed many of these neighborhoods. Neighborhoods like Mill Creek Valley, which is now just a highway. At the same time, white flight started to occur. Many families that could afford to move out of the city did, taking their wealth with them.

You're new to the city, so look up the Delmar Divide. Actually, walk/bike/drive each side of of Delmar. Can you guess the demographics on the Northside? How about the South? Did you know that St. Louis's disparities in how Black-owned house value compared to the typical local home value is one of the greatest nationwide?

When you disinvest in a large demographic in your city, you'll see disinvestment in your city (which some people seem to not understand to this day).

Appreciate the architecture of these dilapidated homes. Many are owned by individuals (or companies) like Paul McKee who are letting them dilapidate. Some will be saved, more of them will be torn down. They hold many stories and are true marvels of St. Louis.",t2_daetf,AboveTheNorm,0,1648220512.0,0,t1_i22mkqd,i22mkqd,False,lugnut92,t3_tms1y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/tms1y0/city_of_st_louis_population_fell_below_300000/,"City of St. Louis population fell below 300,000 last year, new census estimates show",/r/StLouis/comments/tms1y0/city_of_st_louis_population_fell_below_300000/i22mkqd/,1,r/StLouis,0,1

> American families have changed dramatically over the past half century. The average household size in St. Louis in 1950 was 3.1 and in 2010, 2.2. With every other factor held constant, the decrease in city population would have been 248K or 29%. This means that with the same number of homes, the same number of apartments, and the same number of families as resided in the city in 1950, the decrease in average household size could account for 46% of the city‚Äôs population loss.

"I mean we have a lot of community amenities in the city; I'd say it's one of the best things the city does and would naturally be improved with more people, especially more people with means. 

So I'm still not seeing what we need to look to New Town for. If it is pretty similar to the city, then really the only difference is that there aren't many poor people (which then makes its school look better) and its new.

Given that the newer portions of New Town follow a much more ""suburban"" layout than the initial build-out, I think saying it's ""obviously pretty desirable"" when talking about it as a dense, urban-ish development.

I do agree with you that looking at the early parts of New Town would provide a good starting point for building around Metro East stations.

"That calculation also included the pretty large water features and some likely still undeveloped parcels. New Town is built pretty similarly to much of the city, ignoring some of the weird architecture and the ponds/canals. It‚Äôs just a mix of detached SFH, rowhouses, some multifamily, with commercial mixed in. The only major difference between that model and just building piecemeal infill of homes/apartments/rowhouses/duplexes/whatever would be the extra focus on building community amenities, which is a good thing.

As far as bones, I‚Äôm assuming any sort of New Urbanist development in north city would mostly align with the existing street grids.

It‚Äôs also more desirable for families, which the city desperately needs, compared to the 5-over-1s full of studio and 1-bedroom apartments popping up everywhere.

When people see scaffolding in their neighborhood they almost universally get the impression that there is lots of activity, but they are discounting the thousands and thousands and thousands of buildings that aren‚Äôt being rehabbed and so they get an inaccurate picture of how much growth they‚Äôre really seeing.

People do the same thing in bigger cities where they see two or three cranes on the skyline and conclude that they are witnessing a construction boom, when their region might be short tens of thousands of units.

This has to be accounted for always when you talk about neighborhood change. Humans are change averse and small amounts of change look to us like lots of change.

"The parts that are gaining are not gaining more than the parts that are losing, resulting in a net loss for south city.

To see why I‚Äôm right, compare Shaw to Carondelet. Between 2010 and 2020 Shaw added about 100 people and Carondelet lost about 1000. If any neighborhood in South St. Louis is ‚Äúbooming‚Äù it‚Äôs Shaw. But the reality of demographic change is that the people moving in have smaller families and the people moving out of Shaw had larger families. And a lot of the rehab activity is actually resulting in the net loss of units due to two- and four-family conversions into single-family homes.

So the declining neighborhood lost about 10 times as many people as the ‚Äúbooming‚Äù neighborhood gained. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúgrowing like crazy;‚Äù that‚Äôs shrinking like crazy.

"Even then when looking at the densest parts of New Town, you are still about half as dense as neighborhoods like Shaw, Debaliviere Place, or Tower Grove East. If all of New Town was as dense as its densest areas, then it would still only be the 28th or 29th densest neighborhood in the city (possibly lower if you were to exclude things like rail yards from some of the land area for a few of the neighborhoods. We have examples of good, urban built environment here in the city.

If you ran a commuter rail line to New Town, it would be a fine example of a commuter suburb, but not what we should be modeling our city development on.

Personally, I'd like to see income taxes cut and we make up the revenue in real estate property taxes.  Now if you're sitting on these decrepit properties, you need to be developing them to justify that tax bill or sell them to someone that will just to get the taxes off your books.

"As someone who is usually very critical of stl and has moved away‚Ä¶ this reads as more than just the usual jobs and crime narrative, given that the county lost pop too. I think more than anything this is just a sign of how few young families are in STL. There are a lot of HUGE houses in the county, and I‚Äôm not talking mansions, just the average sqare footage of the average house. They were made for huge Catholic families. Most of those big Catholic families have seen most of their college educated children move to other cities because they have more opportunity, walkability, and young professionals. 

Any new transplants to stl I consistently notice are the opposite of the type to have a huge family with 8 kids, so any young couple who owns a house has a good chance of wanting one or two kids max, usually later in life.

One of the biggest contrast coming and going from stl is always just the sheer lack of young adults, children, and especially young adult parents that you see many more of in other metro areas. So jobs and crime aside, the writing is on the wall for a declining population. Despite stl actually attracting quite a few 30 to 40 year old transplants for work. They‚Äôre just taking the spot of the 20 year old professionals who move away.",t2_eovnj60,BIGJake111,1,1648203253.0,0,t1_i21pvs9,i21pvs9,True,lugnut92,t3_tms1y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/tms1y0/city_of_st_louis_population_fell_below_300000/,"City of St. Louis population fell below 300,000 last year, new census estimates show",/r/StLouis/comments/tms1y0/city_of_st_louis_population_fell_below_300000/i21pvs9/,0,r/StLouis,0,0

"You were probably taken to central patrol on Jefferson and then to the Justice Center. They have to prove you had an actual controlled substance so it has to be tested. In the meantime you are released PWA (pending warrant for arrest) and you are essentially free until the substance is tested. At that point they may or may not issue a warrant for your arrest without you knowing. If they do, and you‚Äôre arrested, you‚Äôd probably be released RoR if you have no other outstanding issues and no other history. 

I say ‚Äúmay or may not‚Äù because I believe they have a time limit to test the substance and issue the warrant. I don‚Äôt know what that time limit is, but I have seen people released on PWA never have the warrant issued. 

Best bet is probably to just call the city police and ask. Or, hire a lawyer to find out. 

If it was your first and only arrest and you‚Äôre now sober and you can prove it you‚Äôll probably end up with like 2-5 years SIS probation. Maybe less given the age of the issue. If they didn‚Äôt issue the warrant in time it‚Äôs too late now.

Had a friend who went through a similar situation and Im a also a long sober recovering heroin/fentanyl addict. 1. Most lawyers will do a simple warrant search without payment because they have to look at the charges before they even decide if they're going to take the case therefore before a retainer is required.
