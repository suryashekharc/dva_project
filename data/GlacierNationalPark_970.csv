"I would sure like to see the data from that study that shows 99.9% positive feedback.  
1. What did that survey look like, and who answered it?

3.Did it include questions like ""This program may result in higher summer visitation to the Flathead and Glacier Park.  Locals will be less able to get onto GTTSR without a reservation""

The Chief Mountain US/Canada border crossing is the trailhead we were gonna use. We won't actually be coming from Chief Mountain.

"My opinion is you have to work backwards. When I went to Glacier I was able to get a few days at the Granite Park Chalet, a few nights near St. Mary and Apgar. So I put together day hikes for those areas. 

If you get a Backcountry site, you will plan on how you can hike in and reach it and try to use a loop with available buses etc. 

I know it seems counterintuitive, or not ideal, but because of the many uncertainties and popularity of the park you have to work plan based on what you can reserve or rely on same day reservations. 

Lastly, prepare to dress warm. End the June can be very unpredictable if you are up near Logan Pass or similar altitude. We had extreme winds and freezing rain in early July.

It's understandable that you want to give him some good experiences and share time with him. Somebody else has already commented on the GTTSR winter closure, but I'd also like to gently point out that taking your father far from home might be very disorienting and distressing for him. The idea of showing him the mountains is wonderful, but the reality might be far from it. He probably functions best in his most familiar surroundings, so taking him out of his comfort zone seems likely to increase the severity of his symptoms. Has he recently expressed a desire to go, or is that something he used to talk about before his dementia? What does his care provider say about the [safety](https://dailycaring.com/6-ways-to-figure-out-if-traveling-with-dementia-will-work/) of travel for him at this stage?

"Caveat: Policies may have changed since the last time I rode the MG boat in 2019.

As of 2019, you could get on the standby list up to 3 days in advance. Call their main office to see if that's still the case. If so, show up at the boat dock at 8 am on the 11th and sign up for both lists. If you're in the first 3-5 names on the waitlist, chances are very good you'll be able to get on the boat--there are always no-shows. 8:30 typically has more demand than 9 because of the ranger-led hike to the glacier, but I don't know if they're even doing that this year. Staffing issues have hit the park hard.

FWIW, if you want to take the boat to access the glacier trail, you can skip it. You only save about 3 miles off the roundtrip hike, and those are far and away the easiest part of the trail--all flat except the hill you have to walk over on the boat trip, too. And you can time it so you catch up to the ranger-led hike and tag along if that's your goal.

"Chris has great advice but I wanted to add my two cents--there are two parts of the Grinnell Glacier hike, the waterfall crossing and the steep moraine at the very end, where I'm always VERY happy to have trekking poles for extra stability. I took the descent on the moraine a little too fast last time I did it without poles, and I ate it pretty hard on the gravel and got dinged up. The waterfall crossing is fine without poles for most people but I've managed to fall in rivers twice, so water wigs me out and I like having four points of contact with the ground around water now. I'd want the poles on the steep overlook trail too, but I've never done it because I'm always dog tired by the time I get there.

" Both are awesome hikes. If you can do the highline and the overlook you are able bodied to skip the boat from the Many Glacier Lodge. 

All depends if you want to look at the Glacier closet or from above. The overlook will give you amazing views down the valley and you get to hike the highline. The trail from the highline to the overlook is an aggressive climb, and I don’t mean that lightly. 

The hike from the trailhead between the Many Glacier Lodge and the Swiftcurrent motor inn to the glacier is an amazing hike and the boat takes off pretty flat terrain along the lakes. Great views of Grinnell like on the way up. 

Both trails can be closed for bears frequenting the area, so it’s always good to have a backup and check trail postings when you get to the park.",t2_acatl,chris_wallace,0,1628705229.0,0,t1_h8k875j,h8k875j,True,citynation,t3_p2hdui,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/p2hdui/grinnell_glacier_overlook/,grinnell glacier overlook,/r/glacier/comments/p2hdui/grinnell_glacier_overlook/h8k875j/,7,r/glacier,0,7

"You're pretty much out of luck. You could ride the amtrak from whitefish to west glacier, then it's a 2.5 mile walk to the apgar visitor center. If you dont already have a shuttle ticket there's no gaurantee that you can get on. Depends if people don't show up and the attitude of whoever is working that day, some of them are sticklers and if your name isn't on the sheet you're not getting on. You could try to hitchhike but it's not a sure thing. If it all worked out, you would need to be back at the West Glacier train station at 8pm to head back to Whitefish. 

If I were you, I'm pretty sure the SNOW bus is running in Whitefish. Catch it at Safeway or downtown at the library and it will take you up to the ski hill. For $20 you can ride the chairlift to the top and go hiking up there.

"You usually need to book a year+ in advance. The lodging for peak times for glacier in 2022 is pretty much already booked or $400+ a night. Campsites are booked well in advance as well, although I haven’t stayed in any in Glacier. 

September might cut down on crowding but I’m not sure how much. I was there last week speaking to rangers and workers who said WFH has made the busy season extend into October and November and people have vacation time to burn this year. 

There’s also a national rental car shortage which is making them super expensive and hard to find this year. RVs can work but make sure they fit the GTTSR size requirements. We saw people with massive RVs being turned away because they didn’t research the vehicle length requirement.  

I don’t want to say it’s not possible but you’ll likely run into frustrations trying to plan this trip only 3 months out. Check out lodging (lake McDonald, apgar, rising sun are all along GTTSR if that’s where you want to be, but check out Many Glacier as well) and just keep looking for last minute cancellations you can snag. 

I’d concentrate on transportation first, though. The rental car issue is so widespread that if you can’t get or afford a rental car then I’d replan for another time.

"I'm a planner by nature but it's really a necessity these days, especially at the most popular NPs. I plan to visit Glacier for the first time next month (with an RV and a dog, so more to consider than most) so no first hand knowledge to offer but generally:

Camping is a skill built up over years. Poor equipment, preparation, etc can potentially ruin what would otherwise be a wonderful trip. I don't imagine the Montana wilderness is the ideal place for your first campout. Test out your gear in the back yard for a few nights first, then advance to a nearby state park to master setting up, cooking, sleeping, etc. under a variety of weather conditions. Camping in GNP also means being prepared for bears - do not skip this step.

Re travel - everything is very expensive right now. Flights, car rental (I think I just read rental cost from Bozeman up nearly 300% over last year!), RV rentals and campgrounds if you can even find them. If you're looking to save cash, you can go later into Sept/Oct and risk cold, snow, and GTTSR closure; or start looking at next summer. In the meantime there are plenty of less popular and more accessible NPs with plenty of beauty, if not the caché of Glacier.

"I personally did not. You can check the trail status online. I also saw some reviews on Alltrails from the past week. The anticipated clearing date is July 1, so I suppose they're working on it right now.

With the Highline trail in particular, the highest part of the trail is also the most difficult, with a large dropoff. So until it's clear and open you won't be able to pass. The Grinnell Glacier overlook is also anticipated to open in early July but is easier to hike while still under some snow. You can definitely try, and even if you can't make it all the way you'll still have great views from the Granite Park Trail.

If you want another option, it looks like Iceberg Lake is not totally clear, but flat enough you can walk through the snow. Hidden Lake will also be covered in snow but easily passable, and the snow makes better pictures.

"Overall, you’re covering a ton of ground and it will be go go go.  If that’s how you and your partner enjoy things then 100% go for it.  If you miss a thing or two here or there and are okay with it, go for it.  If not to either, trim it down just a little — I’ve visited all places recently and my only wish was to really spend more time going through it all.  Potential areas of risk:  Day 4 (lots of driving and traffic - time issue — you’ll spend most time on the road and little time at the places ), day 9 (can be tough to get a spot at granite but if you have it then you’re good) and day 10 (lots of hiking/driving - time issue ) will be tough.  Last thing:  driving at night is tough in Yellowstone and glacier in particular.  My only other recommendation is do Yellowstone/Tetons over the 11 days.  Save glacier for another time and give glacier 11 days, seriously.  Also, many glacier hotel is awesome especially sunset.  Case add canyon is another awesome hike.

"Pretty much impossible to say whether one year will be any better than the other.  The pent-up demand this year post-covid may not be any better next…could even be worse.

For the backcountry permits, I'm ready to line up for them early in the morning. If my plan remains this way that will be our only option of lodging for the night so I can't risk it.

I can make it so that day 8 is only the trail + getting to the hotel in west glacier and push the overlook to day 10 which is all about going to the sun road. 

I have a rental car booked already and a few hotels but they're all cancelable. I think I probably don't have much time to decide since there are non cancelable places that I'd like to confirm soon. Also, if we are pushing it to next year, I'd need to plan another trip for the week soon.

"Your itinerary looks very crowded tbh, especially day 8. Good luck getting a backcountry permit out of many glacier, cracker lake is one of the most popular in the park and many glacier campground is only available to multi day itineraries. How long do you have to decide? If you can wait until mid August to make the decision I’d say wait to see what the wildfire situation is. I suspect it will be bad this year with the early heat waves we’ve seen. Glacier is an amazing place but less so when you can’t see more than a 1000’ in front of you. We’ve been lucky the last two years in a row but 2017 and 18 were bad. Do you have all of this lodging booked already? How about the rental car? It sounds like you have at least checked availability which is good, things book up fast out here.

"I've done that route, though it's been a few years, and honestly I'd rate it fairly low compared to other Glacier trails.  The Two Medicine Pass area and the stretch on to Cobalt Lake and the Two Med trailhead are great, but the long stretch between Walton and Two Medicine Pass is kind of a slog.  When you pick up the permit, you could see about swapping out some of your campsites to improve the trip, trying to get Cobalt Lake and/or Lake Isabel instead.  Cobalt Lake is an excellent spot.

"Hi! I know that this post is a little late but I just hiked Grinnell Glacier on 6/9. As of right now the trail goes in about 3.5 miles, we were originally told that there were chains put up to deter day hikers from going further but we never hit that, just a bunch of snow. Personally I did not have any crampons but did have poles and we made some of the way on the snow before turning back.

You do get BEAUTIFUL views of the lake so if that's what you are looking for you should do it. This probably is beating a dead horse but be SURE TO HAVE BEAR SPRAY. We talked to some hikers and at the beginning of the trail they came within 30 ft of a grizzly. As a heads up this portion of the park was not opened to the public at all in 2020 so there are grizzly views on every trail. We stayed at many glacier hotel and a grizzy cub ran across the front of the hotel while we were at dinner. Be safe, be aware, make noise.

"I was there last week, as I understand, is still early in their season. There wasn't a lot of people there when I arrived early. I'm going to guess that that will likely not be the case during their peak season.

If this is your first time visiting Glacier - if you want to know my biggest ""lesson learned"", depending on how long you'll be there for - don't stay in one spot. Stay on the west side of the park for half your trip, and then the east side (or vice versa). Otherwise, you'll burn a lot of time driving from one side to the other.

"First thing I would do is book a car rental. There are shortages this summer, so check with dealerships if you can't find one through a traditional rental place.

You need passes: a national park pass to enter the park anywhere, and to enter West Glacier, St. Mary, or the Camas Road between 6am and 5pm you'll need the [Entry Reservation Ticket.](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/gtsrticketedentry.htm) edit to add: these go on sale 60 days and 2 days before your date of travel, and are good for 7 days. 

Backpacking permits are tough - they opened for reservations in March, so you're behind the curve. You can try for a walk-in, but much easier to try for a [FCFS front-country site.](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/camping.htm)

Honestly, the website is full of good information, take some time to go through all the pages and come up with an itinerary (and plans b & c).

"Grinnell Glacier is a definite no, unless you are very experienced and have the right equipment.

As an alternate I always recommend going as far as you can on the Bullhead Lake/Swiftcurrent Pass trail. I haven't been up there yet (maybe tomorrow?) but years past you could probably get close to or just beyond the head of the lake right about now - with the end being pretty soggy.

Easy little day hike with plenty of spots to stop and gander/have a snack. Nothing intense but beautiful country either way. I think it is more enjoyable as a standalone hike than going around Josephine/Swiftcurrent. I don't mind going through there but your views are more obscured by how thick the vegetation is most of the time. Bullhead you get better views of the surroundings.

That is 8 AM Mountain time every morning they open up two different groups of tickets: one group for the day 60 days in the future and one group for the day 2 days in the future. So to secure a road ticket for June 4th you would've needed to get them either on the first day tickets were available (mostly because people panic bought them) OR on June 2nd at 8AM.

You still have a good shot at getting a road ticket today for June 5th. Just make sure you are online around 8 AM to do so. It is best to have your account created and log in before the clock strikes. Once you get one in your cart they are reserved for 15 minutes or so for you to complete the order process.

Also worth noting you can still get into the park without an entry ticket - just not between the hours of 6 AM and 5 PM.

I’ll definitely consider Avalanche. We’re only there for a few days, so making the 2-hour drive to the east side won’t be bad especially since it’s our first time seeing the park. But good to know! I’m really hoping we will still be able to do some hiking in Many Glacier, but I’m nervous it’ll be covered in snow.

While I haven’t been able to get lucky with a GTTS ticket, I have a boat reservation for the day that we have to be on GTTS, so I think we should be good to go. The Many Glaciers day, we won’t be on GTTS as far as I understand.

"FYI for Upper McDonald Creek Trail, from what you're describing it's a good hike for your family. It's a nice hike mostly through a pretty forest, but it's nothing exciting. Word of warning though, about a mile before the end, there's a pretty good sized creek you have to pass. When I was there last week, the flowing water covered most of the log bridges. It's not deep at all, just a lot of water, maybe 6-12 inches deep. Not an issue if you don't mind getting wet, just a surprise if you're not prepared for it.

Between the 2, I would pick Avalanche Trail. It's a shorter but slightly more difficult hike but the ""pay off"" at the end is much much better (just imo, you can see the same views or the creek from the road).

Also keep in mind, it takes longer to get from the west side of the park to the east side than you'd think. Plan on it taking about 2 hours, plus don't forget you'll need entry tickets IN ADDITION to the national park pass to access the Going to the Sun Road between 6am and 5pm. Also, check to see if the entire road is open, last time I checked its still closed between Avalanche and Jackson Glacier. Otherwise you'll need to take highway 2 to the other side of the park. I wasn't able to get to the Many Glaciers area last week so that was a bummer, the road should be open on 6/3 though.

And for Bowman Lake area, the roads to the Polebridge entrance are unpaved but in pretty good shape. The roads past Polebridge are a bit rough. I was able to make it in a sedan with no problems, just take it slow (10-15 mph) and make sure you have a spare or donut tire just in case. Just mentioning it because when I was looking into it online a lot of people were saying you needed a truck or suv to get out there.",t2_7xdkb,sm753,0,1622644419.0,0,t1_h0bfwyy,h0bfwyy,True,Snoopy428,t3_nqe9qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/nqe9qa/first_time_to_glacier_june_69th/,First time to Glacier (June 6-9th),/r/glacier/comments/nqe9qa/first_time_to_glacier_june_69th/h0bfwyy/,2,r/glacier,0,2
"How old are your LO? Avalanche lake is totally doable even with only moderately active adults but there are some steep drop off that can make it hairy if you are walking with young kids prone to running away. 

Lake Josephine loop trail or taking the boats up and hiking down is also awesome for Many Glacier.

The Victoria Falls trail is also nice! 

Hidden lake at Logan pass was awesome but my daughter got altitude sickness afterwards so we stuck to lower elevations. But we were there early and saw ferrets, big horn sheep, Mtn goats, and chipmunks right on the trail and she was enthralled. 

I did Glacier in 2019 with a 9 year old for 10 days so if you have questions, feel free to PM me! 

The only thing is that that early Going to the a Sun road will not be completely open, so check your road conditions. I believe avalanche lake is already open though.

"Not sure how many below will see this, but I got back yesterday. It was a fantastic trip thanks to all the helpful people in this sub.

About the only things I wasn't able to see was the section of GTTR between Avalanche and Jackson Glacier. I also wasn't able to see the Many Glaciers area since they delayed the opening of the road until 6/3.

Lessons learned for next time:

* Don't stay in one place the entire time- but I booked this trip as a package (really cheap for direct flight, rental, hotel for 7 days) so I didn't really get a choice in that. The 2 hour drive to the east side of Glacier was beautiful, but 2 hours each way isn't something I wanted to do more than once on this trip
* Bring a monocular or binocular for wild life! On one of the trails, I ran into a group of super friendly people who waved me over to look at a mountain goat way WAAAY off on a side of a mountain, barely able to tell it's a goat with the naked eye but they let me look through their monocular, very cool!
* Look into upgrading/renting something with higher clearance just for the heck of it - I got out to Bowman Lake just fine in a smallish sedan, I made sure to stop and ask a park ranger if he though I'd be ok. He said yes as long as I go really slow and have a spare tire. It was a little rough but it was mostly fine.

"From what I understand they will have some kind of checkpoint on the Camas Road outside Apgar to prevent people from driving up to Polebridge and taking the long way to the Going to the Sun Road.  Depending on where you're staying and how many days you plan on going into the park, one viable option to get around this is to make reservations for an [end-of-day boat tour](http://glacierparkboats.com/) at lake McDonald Lodge or St. Mary at Rising Sun.  

You would have to get a boat tour for the day you plan on being in the park.  Having a printed proof of reservation for an in-park service along the Going to the Sun Road corridor means you do not need an entry ticket.  You can use the Going to the Sun Road the day of your service as if you had the entry ticket.  

Technically speaking, you would just need one ticket reserved for an end-of-day boat tour so long as you have just one vehicle and someone in the car has an ID matching the name on the reservation.  The tickets are non-refundable if you aren't there 30 minutes prior to departure.  So keep in mind that you may have to pay $30 or so for one ticket and if you don't show up you won't get your money back.  In other words, if you accidentally forget about your boat ride or find yourself running late on the trails and unable to make your boat ride, the boat company will sell your seat to walk-ups and keep your money.

Edit: You can also get reservations for motorboats, paddleboards, kayaks, etc. at places like Apgar and Lake McDonald Lodge.  Just rent one for an hour at the beginning or end of the day, or at lunch for a break between hikes.  Works just like an entry ticket, doesn't take up much of your time, and it's not terribly expensive.",t2_nag6y,amusso18,0,1621982190.0,0,t1_gzg2sem,gzg2sem,True,kawall13,t3_nl1rhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/nl1rhs/not_able_to_get_goingtothesun_road_entry_ticket/,Not able to get Going-to-the-Sun Road entry ticket,/r/glacier/comments/nl1rhs/not_able_to_get_goingtothesun_road_entry_ticket/gzg2sem/,12,r/glacier,0,12

However, if you're ok with spending money on rentals you could get a mountain bike for some places outside of the park (google ""mountain biking flathead valley"" for best options) and/or paddleboards/kayaks for use on Whitefish Lake, Flathead Lake... any lake really.

"If you've got a reliable vehicle and don't mind driving around I definitely recommend getting down to Flathead Lake (so many points of access it is hard to even say where to go but somewhere like Lakeside is a good bet also Wayfarer's in Bigfork). You'll obviously notice Whitefish Lake (the city beach there is a nice place to relax on a sunny evening).

There are trails in the area around Whitefish as well. The Whitefish Trails are well [mapped](https://www.whitefishlegacy.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018_WhitefishTrail_Map.pdf) out by Whitefish Legacy Partners and should all be accessible. Lion Mountain is a popular trail just outside of town (lots of dogs).

There is a local chain called Sportsman Ski Haus with locations in Whitefish and Kalispell. You can go into either of these places and ask for places to go. Rocky Mountain Outfitters in Kalispell is even better for this. 

Flathead National Forest has a ton of trails but I don't know about the access of a lot of them at this time. Holland Lake and Falls is accessible (and maybe busy). Strawberry Lake still has snow on the trail but it could go fast (or get more piled on top who knows). 

Bigfork Nature Trails are some easy little walkabouts near a nice little town with some of the best food in the valley.

Obligatory reminder that you _need_ bear spray. It is bear season and you're talking about walking around in bear territory. You need bear spray. It is available for purchase pretty commonly in the area. If you get lucky you might even get a demo in how to use it.

And finally, my ultimate advice (that I probably won't need to give because you'll plan this on your own), is to come back when the park is fully open. I usually recommend September rather than July or August. It _feels_ like it slows down a little bit as the weather starts to cool (or at least it used to). If you can sneak in before Labor Day you'll still get full park experience and maybe with fewer people around. After Labor Day you aren't as sure to have full services available but the trails will still mostly be accessible and that is what matters to somebody like me.",t2_4f2kr,Trapline,0,1621347069.0,0,t1_gykjztd,gykjztd,False,sm753,t3_nesfim,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/nesfim/glacier_np_last_week_of_may_need_some_guidance/,Glacier NP last week of May = need some guidance,/r/glacier/comments/nesfim/glacier_np_last_week_of_may_need_some_guidance/gykjztd/,2,r/glacier,0,2

"Driving to the east side around the southern boundary is totally feasible (and the route I usually take to Many Glacier or Two Medicine in peak season). It is a day but if you get up early you can get there, hike and drive back in time for dinner. I'd make sure to get over to Many Glacier if the road does open while you're around. It is the sort of crown jewel of the jewel that is the park. Like a jewel on another jewel. But not Jewel, I don't think she's playing in the area next week.

To ease your anxiety about maybe not planning ideally - there is a lot of other stuff to do in the Flathead. Tons of lakes and trails scattered about. Some rock climbing (if you're into that). Good breweries, wine tasting rooms, cider spots, and distilleries. 

There is a good chance you could work through the best available parts of the park in your first couple of days if you're really energetic. But you can still find some stuff to do outside of the park in that week.

My must-do spring recommendations:

1. Avalanche Lake - easy
2. Polebridge (Quartz Lake Loop - moderate to strenuous)
3. Many Glacier (Bullhead Lake - easy)

I know you found the road status page. The park also maintains Trail Status pages but they are separated into different areas in the park.

If you don't already have it I always recommend Jake Bramante's map: https://hike734.com/shop/day-hikes-of-glacier-national-park-map-guide/

There is a lot of hiking available in western Montana (and especially the areas around Glacier Park) but all requires driving to trailheads.

"I'll give you some do's and don't:

**DON'T...:**

* ...count on Uber/Lyft.  They have minimal presence in the area.

* ...count on cabs.  They aren't cheap, there aren't that many, and usually they are for airport runs.

* ...count on private shuttles.  Most don't even know if they'll operate, or at what capacity yet.  There are some that run from Whitefish or Columbia Falls to West Glacier, but unless they, too, get a Going to the Sun Road entry ticket, they can only take you to the gate.  The in-park shuttle may or may not run at all, or they may run at reduced capacity and will require a reservation.  

* ...assume the Going to the Sun Road will even be open in mid June.  It probably will not be.  It usually opens the final week of June or the first week of July, and this year looks like it will be the same.  It may open sooner, and for your sake I hope it does, but I'd personally suggest you plan for it to NOT be open.


**DO...:**

* ...check out rental car options on Turo.  It's expensive, and I mean *expensive*, to rent that way, but if you need a car, that's your best bet.

* ...look into flying into a more distant airport (like Boise or Spokane or Billings) and then renting a car there and driving the rest of the way.  Not convenient, but also an option.

* ...look into renting a U-haul pickup truck.  You'd be surprised how many you see driving around during tourist season here.

* ...call the local rental car offices directly.  Don't call the national numbers, call them directly.  People have been having luck getting cars that way.

* ...check with some of the local car dealerships.  Some, like the local Nissan dealer, have rental car programs.

"I only have experience in Yellowstone, which is also just as popular as GNP so I think the experience applies.

For FCFS (first come first served) campgrounds in the peak season you show up super early to get your spot, like you should be in the campsite no later than 5 am as they usually start giving out spots at 6:30 or 7. If they sell out of spots while you're in line, you're SOL, so get there *early*. An example for Yellowstone is that I usually camp outside of Yellowstone NP on Forest Service land and then head into the park well before dawn, you could do the same thing for GNP.

For GNP the FCFS sites along GTSR are Avalanche Creek and Sprague Creek. I would recommend you call *before you go* (so like today) to find out: if you're staying at these 2 campsites, do you need a separate ticket or will a ticket be included after you reserve a campsite. An example of what to say would be: ""If I get a first come first served site at Sprague Creek, do I still need to have my own entry ticket for GTSR or will reserving a site give me a ticket automatically?"" 

Also a reminder from their FAQ about the GTSR ticket system:

>Do I always need to have a GTSR Entry Reservation Ticket to get into GTSR corridor? No. You may enter the GTSR corridor without a ticket between 5 pm and 6 am daily.

This means if you make it past the checkpoint *before* 6 am, you're good. For example if you're camping at say Bowman Lake, you would get up early for a couple of days and get past the GTSR checkpoint before 6 am. From here for day 1 you could explore the eastern side of the park in the morning and head over to Many Glacier in the afternoon, then drive back over GTSR after 5 pm. Day 2 you could explore the western side of GTSR. Day 3+ you can explore the other sections of the park. Again this is just an example, the main point is that you can access GTSR w/o a pass before 6 am (or anytime between 5 pm and 6 am).

Additionally here is something to keep in mind:

>12. Will I still need to get a GTSR Entry Reservation Ticket before the entire GTSR opens over Logan Pass
Yes, however there will be fewer tickets available before the road opens all the way. When the tickets go on sale on April 29th, tickets will be available for 60 days out on a rolling window. When the road is fully open, the remaining tickets will be available.

To me this sounds like they will offer more tickets after the road fully opens. The closed sections of GTSR means they have less capacity on the 2 open sections of the road, so they've been giving out fewer tickets. Once the road fully opens to thru traffic, I would expect they'll release a lot more tickets for the currently ""sold out"" dates. This is something I would be watching for, I hope this section makes sense.

Also what /u/normal3catsago mentioned is good advice.

>I'd also hit up some of the Montana State Parks (I'm wearing my shirt now) because they are similarly awesome. If you head south towards Bozeman after Glacier, Salmon Lake State Park (and the whole Seeley Lake area) is also spectacular.

Here is the SP website: https://fwp.mt.gov/stateparks

The tourism site: https://www.visitmt.com/ (state tourism agencies have tons of great advice) and links to guidebooks https://www.visitmt.com/guidebook.html

I would recommend visiting state tourism sites for all the states you're passing though and check out their guidebooks.

For instance if you're only checking out Badlands NP in SD, you're missing out on the Black Hills which I would highly recommend. Another tip, this one for Wyoming, make sure to stop at Shell Falls. It's on one of the routes to Yellowstone from SD along US 14 just east of Shell WY.",t2_kpwfx,AwesomeWhiteDude,0,1620419758.0,0,t1_gxbd4jf,gxbd4jf,False,Chrisgpresents,t3_n6qk60,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/n6qk60/is_it_even_worth_trying_to_go_this_year_has/,Is it even worth trying to go this year...?

"Layers are the key. Count your rain shell as a layer. Wicking base top/ bottom, fleece or performance top, and a rain jacket will keep you alive and comfy.

- Know the trails before you go (bail outs, intersections, way points).

"This is such fantastic advice I've saved it.

And I do think that Glacier is worth it, even getting up to make it in before 6AM. But I'm a National Park whore and routinely end up getting up at 6:30 even when camping in the park!

"They are doing so much road work in and around GNP that for me personally, I don't think it's worth the potential hassle. This is just my opinion because I live within a (long) days drive to the park (near Badlands NP in fact!)

However, since it's a life's dream for you. I would say go for it. Tickets (seem) to be only required if you enter the GTSR area *between* 6am - 5pm.

From their FAQ:

>15. Do I always need to have a GTSR Entry Reservation Ticket to get into GTSR corridor?
No. You may enter the GTSR corridor without a ticket between 5 pm and 6 am daily.
 

I would still refresh like hell during the 48 hour window before the date you want to go.

#As far as camping...

GNP has a lot of first come first served sites, so get there early. I would call to see if you still need an entry pass if you're staying at any FCFS site in the park too. As in, if you have an active FCFS reservation at Logging Creek campground, do you still need a separate entry ticket. 

Here is the camping page for [Flathead National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/flathead/recreation/camping-cabins/?recid=66162&actid=29), the [camping brochure PDF](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd508303.pdf), and also the web page for [contacting their offices](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/flathead/about-forest/?cid=stelprdb5214219) which is *super useful* because the local ranger district will know the conditions of the forest roads leading to a campsite. Most seem first come first served, but there are links to recreation.gov and to their concessionaire if you want to reserve a site before you go. The forest service recommends Avenza Maps app but I've had way better luck downloading and using Gaia GPS on iOS/Android. The main maps you'll want at a bare minimum are the Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) from the FS, a visitor map, and an offline Google Maps download of the area. I cannot street how much better Gaia GPS is though.

There is also [freecampsites.net](https://freecampsites.net/#!(48.75347,+-114.28528\)) which I have used to find dispersed sites along the side of the road before, although not in this part of the country. 

I've done dispersed camping in other areas, generally the rules are

1. Make sure you're on public lands (so have a map of the area)

2. You must be at least 1/4 of a mile from a fee campsite

3. Try to stay in an already established pullout or open area on the side of the road, it's best practice. freecampsites.net has some of these spots shown.

4. Pack in-pack out.

Finally when you get to an area you're going to be camping at, visit the local ranger office of the area before you go to the site. They can advise you on specific rules they may have for dispersed camping, and information on trails you should check out.",t2_kpwfx,AwesomeWhiteDude,0,1620379700.0,0,t1_gx96m09,gx96m09,True,Chrisgpresents,t3_n6qk60,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/n6qk60/is_it_even_worth_trying_to_go_this_year_has/,Is it even worth trying to go this year...?

"If you have bikes I’d definitely bring those. Maybe even rent some.

The trailhead at lake Macdonald lodge, at least some of those hikes seem to be do-able right now. Snyder lake trail had snow throughout the last mile, we were all stepping through. The trail is a stream at some points, it could be even worse by the time you’re here. Check AllTrails for recent comments on any trail you wanna do.

You could park at lake Macdonald lodge and walk down to lake Macdonald creek trail. Not sure if there’s snow on it but I wouldn’t think so. Someone on AllTrails said having to walk to it adds 4 miles total.

Not sure if you’ve driven highway 2 before, but if you haven’t it could be worth it to check out two medicine area. You can walk down the road and check out the mountains. Can also walk on the snow to running eagle falls. You just park by the gate basically and walk down the road.

"First of all, while Glacier is likely to have limited vehicle access, there's still plenty to do.  You can drive in as far as Lake McDonald Lodge.  From there, you can bike the Going to the Sun road for miles.  You can also hike to Avalanche Lake from the lodge, though it's a longer hike than if you just drove to the trailhead (but you can't since the road is closed).  There's also plenty of hiking in the Lake McDonald area.  Here's a [trail map of the area](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/hikinglakemcdonald.htm).

Outside the park, there is plenty to do.  Since you're in Whitefish, definitely check out the [Whitefish Trail System](https://www.whitefishlegacy.org/trailheads/) for nice, easier hikes with great views of the mountains.  In Kalispell, there is [Lone Pine State Park](https://fwp.mt.gov/lone-pine) and [Herron Park](https://www.foystoblacktailtrails.org/trails-maps/).  

There are also TONS of [hiking trails in Flathead National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/flathead/recreation/hiking/?recid=66162&actid=50), which is next door neighbors to Glacier and Great Bear Wilderness.  Speaking of, there are significant trails on the the southern edge of Glacier.  Along US 2, there is Garry Lookout and Scalplock Lookout (both offer stunning views of the peaks in Glacier), Stanton Lake, and many other gorgeous hikes.  Some are in the park, some just south of it.  Just look those trails up for more info.  

In town, there are lots of breweries, cideries, and distilleries if you're into that.  Those include Bonsai Brewing in Whitefish, which will be less than 10 minuets from you.  You can also use the Rails to Trails system to do some easy biking from Kalispell down to the beach in Somers or to Smith lake in Kila west of town.  

In short, just because Glacier is limited doesn't mean you have to be.  There are so many thing to do that aren't Glacier, or more precisely, aren't Going to the Sun Road.  While the Sun Road is certainly one of the crown jewels in America's National Park system, it's not the only thing to do here.  

If you want more info, just let me know.  I'm going out for the afternoon, but I can get back to you tonight with any answers I can give.

"They can be cancelled, thus becoming available again.  The passes are ""free"", but they charge a non-refundable $2 processing fee.  My guess is that no one will actually bother to cancel the pass they bought and will instead just not use it.  From GNP's FAQ: 

> If someone who has purchased a GTSR ticket know that they aren’t going to be able to use it, can they can turn it back in?  

> Yes if a ticket holder cancels their reservation prior to the first day of their reservation, the ticket will be returned to inventory. However, the $2.00 entry reservation ticket fee is non-refundable.

So again, it's *possible*, but I'm skeptical very many will be cancelled.  Just my guess ,though.

I should also note, for those who can't get a pass, if you want to spend the day in the park *without a Going to the Sun Road entry ticket*, you can.  You just have to get passed the gate by 6:00 am, or go after 5:00 pm if you feel like doing something quick or just want to drive the road.",t2_nag6y,amusso18,0,1619732362.0,0,t1_gwclcc2,gwclcc2,True,[deleted],t3_n1axgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/n1axgi/timed_entry_pass_question/,Timed entry pass question,/r/glacier/comments/n1axgi/timed_entry_pass_question/gwclcc2/,3,r/glacier,0,3

"You'll have a great trip/amazing summer! Glacier is home to some of the best backpacking in the world, imo. You're right that June 1st will be pretty early for any serious 4 day backpacking trips just because you will be limited to [select campsites and routes](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/upload/Backcountry-Map-Web-2018.pdf) due to snowpack (possibly all are closed until June 15th so you'd technically still be in winter season, you'll have to ask the rangers about winter season backpacking). Not to assume but it kind of sounds like you don't have a group of 3-4ppl and you're younger and you also mentioned you're newer to backpacking, so just standard disclaimer, backpacking in glacier (for multi day trips) is no joke especially solo and in early season. It can snow any day of the year and wildlife (bears, mtn lions) and weather conditions can be unnerving when you're alone. Not to discourage you but just as an FYI. There's a good facebook group on glacier backpacking that you may have some luck on for camping buddies etc.

I'd recommend calling the apgar ranger station/backcountry office and bouncing some ideas off of them. You'll be limited to lower elevation routes (unless you have snow gear), so you may try checking out some lakeside routes. This could include two medicine to upper two med over to Lake Isabel and back. Or you could go around lake mcdonald. You could spend a few nights at cracker lake. Or you could do coal creek to beaver woman perhaps. You'll just have to look at the routing and mileage. Most important thing is to keep an open mind and have a back up plan bc campsites can always change and close due to weather, bears etc.

For getting permits, I'd recommend going the morning before you want to leave to the Apgar office (be there at 4am if you want first pick of campsites). The really scenic higher elevation sites (50 mtn, boulder, Hole in the wall) and associated multi day routes are open by August 15th latest usually. And, GTTS road will probably be open by July 4th, just so you know (must do scenic road).

"Keep in mind that even after that page shows that the plows have crossed the pass, it's still a couple weeks or more before the road opens to cars -- they still need to clear parking areas and reinstall guardrails and do other maintenance to get the road ready.

And rain at lower elevations often means snow in the higher elevations -- even in the summer.  I've been snowed on every month of the year in Montana.

The issue with the Highline is the southern end of the trail, where it's cut into the cliff -- the cliffs hold snow late, and it can be too dangerous to dig out.

"Yep, the high country is still going to be snowed in ... places like Hidden Lake won't be accessible until sometime in June.  The Sun road will be open as far as Lake McDonald Lodge on the west side, and a lot of people ride bikes further up the road from there.  Though you probably couldn't do that with a 4-year-old, you could definitely walk the road as far as McDonald Falls and Sacred Dancing Cascades; there's a bridge at the falls, and you can cross it and walk back down on the pretty trail on the other side.  (The water can be pretty treacherous, so watch the 4-year-old!)

I'd also drive over to the Two Medicine area and walk the closed road there.  Running Eagle Falls is really cool, and that would be a good destination.

Definitely take the kid up to Polebridge, and get something sweet at the bakery there!

"I did Olympic 2 years ago and it is simply amazing! I was in awe. Happy to answer any questions you might have. Mt Rainier also spectacular. 

The one warning I give about Olympic is it does require a plan or it will eat you up. It’s deceptively large and has no road going through it, only spur roads leading into it. Base out of several different locations and experience all three ecosystems. 

I highly recommend checking out the Trip Advisor Olympic Forum: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g143047-i769-Olympic_National_Park_Washington.html

Kaleberg, the moderator, will answer questions and she’ll bluntly tell you if an itinerary is a bad idea.

Thanks for the optimistic words and good suggestions - your username is well chosen.

"Congrats! I’m still waiting. Which means I won’t be getting what I want.  

Two Medicine is a great area of the park!  However, this itinerary won’t really have the backcountry feel you would have had with the Northern Circle.  Cobalt is a great spot, Upper Two Medicine is nice but visited heavily by day hikers, and Two Medicine campground is a car campground. However, with a little luck, you can improve on this permit!  Go to the ranger station the day before your trip starts, and see if you can add on NON and OLD (or OLD then NON). By doing this, you can include the Dawson Pitamakin loop, and see virtually the whole Two Medicine area.  You should have a good chance of adding them on since they would be toward the end of your trip.

"The car rental problem is real. Rental companies drastically curtailed fleet purchases on account of Covid and they are hesitant to bring those levels up quickly.

On a normal year in-park lodging for Glacier books a year in advance. Demand is higher this year.

In the Flathead Valley there are a number of commercial camping places but I don't know much about them.  KOA is the most common, and there is one by the park.

There are also State Park Campgrounds, and my favorite in the area is Whitefish State Park.  These have reservations, and there are a number of similar campgrounds on Flathead Lake.

There is also the Forest Service campgrounds around Hungry Horse reservoir (and elsewhere), and along the route there are the campgrounds around the Seeley-Swan area.  Those are often a ""show-up-first"" type places, except for the State Parks.  Placid Lake and Salmon Lake and Holland Lake campgrounds all are nice.

"The big issue with early-season hikes on Glacier's higher-elevation trails is the extreme steepness of the cirques that are traversed by most of the trails leading to the passes.  The north aspects of some of these cirques will retain snowfields into July, and some of the trails traverse the locations of these snowfields.  So you're needing to cross a super-steep snowfield with uncertain snow conditions, where if you lost your footing you'd have the potential to slide several hundred feet down to a jumble of big rocks at the bottom of the cirque.

So you need traction devices for your boots, of course ... but more importantly, you need to be really confident in your ability to self-arrest if you lose your footing or some of the snow gives way.  An ice axe can be good to have, but being practiced in self-arrest techniques is crucial.",t2_vaupu,pitamakan,0,1616940014.0,0,t1_gskujmx,gskujmx,False,biggelswerth,t3_mcxho2,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/mcxho2/early_june_trip/,Early June Trip,/r/glacier/comments/mcxho2/early_june_trip/gskujmx/,2,r/glacier,0,2

"That time of year, the upper part of the Grinnell Glacier trail will still be snowed in, and pretty hazardous to someone who isn't experienced in over-snow mountain hiking ... so I definitely wouldn't recommend it.

Just how much snow will be left on lower hikes will depend on what the weather is the next couple months, but expect snow on any trails that leave the valley floor.  Iceberg Lake might have snow at the end, but the hike is less technical.  On St. Mary Lake, the walk to Virginia and St. Mary Falls should be good, or go down to Two Medicine (which is beautiful) and head for Upper Two Medicine Lake.

It's not your typical National Park experience because it's outside the park boundary, in a little town that has a couple hundred year-round residents and many more in the summer.  It's also on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, which makes for a different community feel, though there's not much interaction between the Rez and the tourist communities.

Most of the best hikes are an hour or two away from there, but the Two Medicine area is only 12 miles away, and it's one of my favorite spots in the park.  If I were looking for a summer gig and got an offer at Glacier Park Lodge, I'd definitely go for it.  :)",t2_vaupu,pitamakan,0,1614954873.0,0,t1_gpryen7,gpryen7,False,rosiemm33,t3_lskkbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/glacier/comments/lskkbf/glacier_job_recommendations/,Glacier Job Recommendations?,/r/glacier/comments/lskkbf/glacier_job_recommendations/gpryen7/,1,r/glacier,0,1
"Pursuit can vary a lot depending on where you are.  Some locations (like Glacier Park Lodge) will be fairly similar to being inside the park, with employee dorms and cafeterias and a community feel, and others (like West Glacier) will be less like that.  You'll be just outside the park, living and working in a small town, so in that sense it's a little less cool that being at one of the Xanterra locations.

The Pursuit operations don't have the Park Service oversight that the Xanterra locations do, so in some ways things are a little less rigid, and I think they're less evilly bureaucratic than Xanterra is, for sure.

The dorm housing offered by the major concessionaires is pretty basic at most locations, but fairly cheap ... though I haven't checked for sure in a few years, my guess is that nowadays it's somewhere in the vicinity of $15/day for room and board.

Housing is nearly all dorm style with an employee dining room ... inside the park, the only exceptions to that are with the boat and horse concessions, which hire a very small number of folks who are mostly locals.

"The major in-park concessions are operated by Xanterra, which also the concessionaire for several other NPS units.  As an employer, they're definitely nothing to write home about, to put it mildly.  The other major lodging properties are operated by a company called Pursuit.  Their largest facilities are just outside the park boundary, and I've heard mixed opinions about them as an employer.  As with most such jobs, expect minimal pay, substandard housing, and not a huge amount of respect, but expect to have an amazing time during your off hours.  (I worked at Lake McDonald Lodge for six seasons a number of years ago, and it was life-changing.)

Vehicles are always nice to have in places like that, but definitely aren't essential, just because so many other employees will have them.  Depending on your work location (and on Covid), there will likely be shuttles to major hiking destinations.

"For reference:  This week, I cancelled a trip to Alaska in July (not feeling great about flying yet) and set my sights on Glacier, instead.  I could not find any lodging on the east side of the park closer than East Glacier for, basically, the entire month of July.  A day here and there, sure, but places are either A) totally booked, like the Xanterra lodges and the few places that offer nicer cabins (including the St. Mary KOA); or B) Not open yet because they are awaiting official word regarding opening. And, to be frank, the places in the latter category were very basic, motel-style, places that I'd be fine with but didn't really fill me with excitement, either.

The other thing to consider is that there will still be construction on the Many Glacier access road and that will cause 30-40 minute delays, meaning a drive from East Glacier to Many Glacier could take up to 2 hours.  For me, that's a deal breaker.

And of course, that's all without knowing what the Blackfeet will decide upon.

"I don’t mean to discourage you or be the negative voice in the room, but if you want the truly honest answer, this is one of the worst times to go. 

Everything will be covered in feet of snow and the most you’ll be able to do is drive a few miles into the park. It will likely be below 30 degrees F the whole time you’re there.

To see Glacier in its full beauty, with blue alpine lakes, flower strewn meadows, and access to hiking trails and the Going to the Sun Road, you’d need to go in late July/August.

If going to Glacier is something your boyfriend has always dreamed of, I’d save the trip for summer. I know that sucks to hear, but you all will get so much more enjoyment out of your trip if you wait a few more months until the park is at its most accessible and most beautiful. You could still maybe give it to him for Christmas and it would give you guys something to be excited about and look forward to for the next few months.

Very true. Glacier has a tiny number of parking spaces considering what a prominent park it is. You drive past many little lots that are 100% full, and since there is only one main road with no room to pull over, you can't even stop to enjoy the views of a certain area if the parking is all full there.

"You are correct that Many Glacier is an entire area. I went there with a 9-year old who was getting altitude sickness so we adjusted hikes accordingly (she got sick in Logan's pass), but Grinnell glacier hike is the one I definitely know of. We also took the boats across the lakes and hiked back down again. 

But the big thing is since access is solely through the Blackfoot reservation (if entering by car) or hiking over the passes, you need to ascertain if the Blackfoot reservation is open. And you don't want to count on tent camping because there is much more bear activity and the NPS is most likely to limit camping to hard-sided campers or close spots entirely.

"The shuttle within the park is free. It does the Going to the sun road and up to Many glacier. Camping spots open for reservations 6 months in advance, if I recall correctly, though this year the East side access was closed due to the Blackfish reservation shutting for COVID concerns. So the biggest concern for me would be hikes that heavily utilize the east side of the park or many glacier stress since it's unsure whether those will open. 

Parking is not terribly bad if you are an early bird, but I do mean early. When we were there in 2019 we routinely woke by 6:30 in campgrounds within the park (Fish Creek for West side, St Mary for East and many glacier) and got on the road by 7 am and had no parking issues, but we had a campervan so we could leave early, get a spot, and do breakfast at the trailhead and then come back and nap and go back out again (for many glacier and Logan pass for example).

Rent is best. Cabelas Kalispel has a no return policy even if they are in opened. Im sure most stores are the same. Buy only what you need. I stayed at the Hampton Inn in Whitefish. They had a box of them to loan guests. Great place to stay. Very clean and friendly staff. Lots of bear activity on the east side of the park. All east side trails were closed last week. Bear was sighted at Logan’s pass the evening we were up there. Rangers ran him off. Be safe.
