"Welcome! I'm 24M, also a transplant, my partner is 22F, native Minnesotan. I just started going to MBP a couple months ago.

"Not sure what your work life is like now, but one thing that’s helped me a ton is work at a haunt in the fall. The one I work at allows flexibility for hours, they just like you to try to stick to the availability you give originally. So even if it’s one night a week, that can work. We have all types of people and it becomes like a family. Everyone gets along really well and then within you tend to find your “group” and can make good friends. It doesn’t pay the best but you do it for the fulfillment, the camaraderie, and creativity. It’s also a really great way to build confidence.

"Classes or volunteering have always been the best option for me. They offer consistent, ongoing contact while working towards some sort of common goal. I’ve found that without that shared experience, it feels like it’s always a little forced and a little too “face-to-face just talking about our lives” as opposed to engaging with a task together (which allows the opening up, vulnerability and intimacy of friendship to occur naturally over time).

All the lasting relationships in my life have come from this type of scenario.

"I have a few hobbies so it's been easy to meet people I like. Disc golf has been the biggest one for me. Met every type of person playing randomly at courses and trying out leagues. A few stuck out as cool and I've made a few friends. Also, darts leagues are easy to find. Pool... basically any niche sport that attracts random personalities and has a forced social aspect. You don't have to be good and people there will appreciate some low talent competition. You never make enemies losing games. I like to play music, but I haven't had much luck going to jam nights and meeting people. I guess only older people jam out here... I tried using app groups and meet up but it seems like I have mostly met people with clear personality disorders. You might find one person at an event that you can shit with, but it's like a jail friendship and is over at release. I've since given up on that avenue. I've met countless people by going to a bar and just spamming darts alone until people want to play. Later at night, bars tend to feel like a living room at a house and less like a public area. Nothing like a strange night once in a while. Bomb around town on a skateboard... I don't know. Do ADHD stuff and hope someone likes it?

That's their Feb events calendar.  I used to run a fighting game weekly there that recently moved to GameZenter in Roseville (shilling my event - https://runthemix.org).  Black Ice is a super cool venue.

Like this is just super neat => https://blackice.gg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_7221-1-1536x1023.jpg

Minneapolis/the Twin Cities has a super vibrant competitive gaming scene.

But like shilling again - if you're interesting in fighting games (specifically Dragon Ball FighterZ, Guilty Gear, or Melty Blood) hit up Run The Mix some Monday.

"**[Freeway Sanitary Landfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_Sanitary_Landfill)** 
 
 >The Freeway Sanitary Landfill is a United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site that covers 140 acres (57 ha) in Burnsville, Minnesota. In 1971 the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MCPA) licensed the landfill to accept 1,920 acre-feet (2,370,000 m3) of household, commercial, demolition, and nonhazardous industrial wastes. The state permit prohibited the disposal of liquids and hazardous wastes; however, heavy metals, acids, and bases were accepted by the landfill from local industries. The landfill also accepted 200 cubic yards (150 m3) of battery casings and 448 short tons (406,000 kg) of aluminum sweat furnace slag.

"Well, shit. I got confused and typed out a response about Bloomington, sorry.

The only dive in Burnsville is JRs Family Bar on 13, but that's nearly in Eagan. Everything else is basically a shitty suburban sports bar 'cept Shoooters. Shooters is one of, if not the best, pool halls in Minnesota.

If you're to the west look up Brianos. Ansari's has an excellent ""gyro pizza"" with gyro meat and feta.

Halal Groceries on the west side 35w frontage road is the best Halal store (of the 5 or 6 in town), but the one next to Aldi carries camel, if that's something you're looking for. Taqueria la Hacienda way over on 5 beats the one next to Subway on Nicollet, but the grocery store on Nicollet attached to that restaurant sometimes has Tamales in a cooler. So you know it's legit. Ain't nothing else worth a fuck that far west.

I was so confused why reddit hates Cub so much.  Turns out the highway 13 Cub is among the best in the state.  The highway 42 is absolute dogshit. If you shop at Cub, and live near 42, drive the extra 3 miles down Nicollet to shop at the Cub off of 13.  Trust me.  Please. It will improve your life.  Also, get a Costco membership.

CHAP is the good thrift store. It's some weird strip-mall churchy shit, but churchy-shit is better than the corporate bloodsuckers that run the others.

If you've read this far: Burnsville water is disturbing, to say the least.  The water comes from an active mine.  To the west of the mine is a landfill.  To the right of the mine is literally a SuperFund site. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_Sanitary_Landfill

This is the mine where Burnsville water comes from. Burnsville
https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mm8RfPKgDZxYBLLE7

To the west is the landfill.  Go to the McDonald's and look at how tall it is. To the north-east of the mine, the grassy area, is the SuperFund site.

I'm a tap water drinker, but when I lived in Burnsville I bought 5 gallon jugs of reverse osmosis water from Cub. I threw away my water cooler, in burnsville, when I moved somewhere with aquifer water and somebody grabbed that thing out of the dumpster within the hour.

">best hole in the wall divey spot for food in your opinion? 

I haven't actually been there: Shantytown Grill.  I just sort of randomly bike around and admire how much more awesome than Burnsville that Bloomington is, and ran across this dive bar that's situated in an industrial zone right across the street from houses.  It's like a little taste of Northeast, way down here in Bloomington.

The drinks are cheap. The menu is basic but they have $1 and $2 beer specials, which you won't find anywhere else nearby. This is where my roommate meet my landlord and apparently the drinks are strong.

I haven't been there myself because of covid and that's not the sort of place frequented by vaxxed mask wearers, unfortunately.

"Hey there!

We definitely have some of the same interests. I am 38yr male who just moved here in July from Texas. Because of that, I don't really know anyone yet except one close friend. I live in Maple Grove but can travel all over the Twin Cities.

I love Sports especially Football and Basketball but if the sporting event is live in person, I am down for it all. Never been to a Hockey game in my life and always wanted to try it. I also like shooting hoops. I also love food and trying new places. I have traveled a lot. Lived in San Antonio, Austin, San Francisco, Taiwan, and now here.

Also into coffee as well as Sports cards. Used to have a huge collection but now only have the ones that meant the most to me growing up.

"Hey all - I (30M) moved from Washington, DC to Minneapolis with my wife (29F) this past summer and am looking to meet some new people and find fun Minnesotan things to do this winter.

We enjoy playing board games (e.g., gloomhaven, dominion, wingspan, etc.), cooking and eating good food, watching sports (hockey, soccer, football), taking our dog hiking or to parks, and going to breweries. I also like to cycle, play soccer, and snowboard.

Given the long winter months here, I'm really interested in getting into more winter activities and am just starting to pick up xc skiing. It would be great to find groups in xc skiing, curling, or hockey that are welcoming of newbies and/or to meet other people also looking to pick up some winter hobbies.

My wife can't really participate this year in icy/snowy fun because she is currently pregnant with twins(!) who are due this spring.

"Hey everyone!

Name is Mike and I am a 38 year old who just moved to Maple Grove from San Antonio Texas. But I will eventually be moving into Downtown Minneapolis this summer. I work from home and only know one person in the Twin cities and unfortunately he is a flight attendant so is often out of town on my days off.

So needless to say, I am looking to meet new friends!  I am LGBT if that is an issue but am respectful and happy to have friends of all persuasions. I am a huge sports fan especially Football and Basketball. Love grabbing a drink, watching sports, Coffee as well, hiking, movies, philosophical/spiritual discussions, I even love mall walking/shopping.

I may live in MG but everything is so close to each other I can travel to anywhere to meet up. If you are interested , send me DM!

"Hey I’m a photographer in the cities :) I’ll offer some tips. 

1) Carry your camera with you. Just toss it in your purse or bag as opposed to “going out to shoot photos”. It’s tough to find things while you’re hunting for them, but it’s easy to spot beauty when you come across it in your day to day life. 

2) look at photos to see what you like. Do you enjoy seeing faces, or shapes, or light. It’s easier to take a good photo you like after seeing how it’s done. The Mia has some good pictures on the wall. 

3) don’t be afraid to keep the settings on auto for a bit. The most important thing is to capture the moment. As you progress you look at your photos and say I wish this was a little darker or lighter and that’s when you can adjust the settings manually to achieve your stylish look. For now that camera model is smart enough to work with you. 

4) Finally, print your photos. It’s a little expensive, but it’s worth it. It feels like you made something. Give them to friends and family and listen to their critiques. It’s a blast end up with something tangible",t2_15c540,eyesee301,0,1640309550.0,0,t1_hpr74dp,hpr74dp,True,Old-Bed-1858,t3_rn6g4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/rn6g4a/new_to_photography/,New to photography,/r/twincitiessocial/comments/rn6g4a/new_to_photography/hpr74dp/,7,r/twincitiessocial,0,7

"Just a heads up, Minnesotans already have a lot of friend and family obligations and generally don't have time for new friends. The main way around this is to make prioritize making friends with other transplants over trying to make lasting friendships with busy Minnesotans. For example, my friend group includes people from Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Texas, Virginia, and two married in Minnesotans. Good luck!

"Hit me up in the spring if ya grab a mountain bike! It's a great time and we have some excellent trails in MN. People travel to visit Cuyuna (up in the brainerd lakes area) and I've been told Lebanon Hills is high quality as well. Shoutout to Lake Rebecca and Sunfish, two of my other local favs. I've only ridden in MN and western WI so I can't compare to anything... but I highly recommend checking some stuff out.

Another cool option is renting Fat Bikes and hitting the MN River Trail, especially once we got snow! Extremely beginner-friendly, great views riding along the MN river, and pretty substantial. Once the creeks are frozen, or in the summer when all the bridges are up, you can bike from Bloomington Ferry to Mendota and it's like 99% singletrack hugging the banks of the river.

Shoot me a DM if you wanna connect and I'll send you my #.

"Are you talking the mountain bike trail?

Have you gone before? I heard a couple years ago it was pretty weak and costs $7. [Most of the MORC trails are open](https://trails.morcmtb.org/) and free. I hit elm creek on Sunday and Lake Rebecca a few days before, plus do river bottoms pretty much every other day. I'm moderately skilled but hate big climbs and prefer to stick to flowy stuff. My bike's also SS.

I'm down to mtb some time if you're interested, but afton's a hike for me.. did they improve the trail a bunch recently?",t2_g4uvrl19,struggler-throwaway,0,1638304621.0,0,t1_hmphghv,hmphghv,True,Aaron_and_Maria,t3_r5vlh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/r5vlh8/anyone_wanna_ride_afton_this_week/,Anyone wanna ride Afton this week?,/r/twincitiessocial/comments/r5vlh8/anyone_wanna_ride_afton_this_week/hmphghv/,5,r/twincitiessocial,0,5
