"It’s really not that bad. People get hyped about it. It depends on where you live though, down near the course or Washington Road? Uh oh. Tons of people setting up shop that way, trying to snag tickets. Generally just more traffic. But everywhere else, nah. Expensive hotels right now, expensive air bnbs. Those are the ones who get out of town… the ones who put their homes up for rent. Restaurants will be busy that way, the nicer restaurants in town will be filled up. People will be parading around wealth for that week. There’s a certain demographic that annually attends the masters, and you’ll be able to tell who they are. People attend the masters and buy up merchandise (especially the workers) and you’ll see all the little shirts and memorabilia on FB marketplace for months to come.

They don't discuss coverage _around here_, but Consumer Reports had a nice article _Best Cell Phone Plan Deals for You and Your Family_ in their February 2022 issue of Consumer Reports magazine.


Some extract:

> We get it. Changing cell phone plans sounds like a major headache.
>
> The three big carriers—AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon—bury all sorts of caveats in the small type of their plan descriptions, making it hard to compare offerings, much less figure out what you’re getting and how much it truly costs.
> 
> But based on Consumer Reports’ survey findings, it’s worth the effort to shop around. In 2020 more than half of CR members who switched providers in the previous year reported saving money—with almost one-third pocketing more than $30 per month.
> 
> How? Often by looking beyond the Big Three. Many of the plans recommended on the following pages come from smaller providers that lease excess wireless capacity on cellular networks built and maintained by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. (There’s no escaping them entirely.)
>
> In our ratings of cell phone plans, based on the input of 61,785 CR members, providers such as Consumer Cellular, Mint, and Ting generally rank near the top for value, customer support, and overall satisfaction.
> 
> AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon? They end up in the bottom third. In fact, AT&T is the lowest-scoring provider, receiving our worst rating for value and reception. T-Mobile—which had for years placed higher than its chief rivals—took a dip in 2021, too. After merging with Sprint in 2020, the carrier dropped in almost every category, slipping from above average to average for value, customer support, and data quality. Even carrier-owned alternatives like Verizon’s Visible rate higher.
> 
> Before shopping plans, it helps to know how much cellular data you use each month for things like checking email, getting GPS directions, and streaming music on the go. Without that info, it’s easy to end up paying for more data than you really need.
> 
> […] 
> 
> If there’s one catch to sidestepping the Big Three, it’s this: During peak traffic hours, the major carriers reserve the right to slow data speeds for customers from smaller providers before “throttling” their own patrons to alleviate network congestion.

"The judicial system is not systematically racist because it locks minorities up. It IS systematically racist because it DISPROPORTIONATELY locks up people of color when compared to white people. 

Actually, it disproportionately responds to complaints regarding people of color, pulls over, searches, arrests, sentences, and disproportionately imprisons people of color compared to white people, charges them consistently higher bail, and sentences them to significantly longer prison terms for the same crimes in the same jurisdictions. People of color are also far more likely sentenced to the death penalty, and far less likely to have their death penalty commuted to life in prison.

This one is a good brief summary:

My theory is the router/modem combo box from WoW has a small max on how many devices can connect and it's getting overloaded and just stops allowing any connections.

They also scheduled a technician to come to the house while on the phone with them but didn't tell me they were doing that. We weren't home the next day when they arrived and that's a $50 fee they charge to have someone come out to your house. I called again and they were 100% going to charge me for this unasked for tech visit. It was pretty shady imo to do that.

"It's not just you. I've gone from seeing maybe one or two slip through a light just as it turns red over the course of a week to seeing people do it at just about every light along my commute. The worst offenders are people in left turn lanes who will keep streaming through even after I have a green light to go straight. 

Of course, there's my own personal soapbox about people entering intersections when they can't clear them, so they end up sitting there blocking the intersection for most of the green duration for through traffic. I'm looking at you, Fort Gordon people, but it happens at most of the busy intersections.

"First, welcome to Augusta. Hope your move goes well and you enjoy the area.

As far as pine pollen, It can be pretty bad if you’re not used to it. Everything outdoors will be covered in yellow pine pollen, not unusual to see yellow clouds when the wind blows. Fortunately the pine pollen is composed of larger particles and is likely not going to cause allergies. However other tree pollen will crank up allergies. The pine pollen can be washed off cars, etc creating yellow rivers with the runoff. Basically let the pine pollen season end then hope for several good rains, wash your car and outdoor furniture and you’ll be good till next year. I suspect if you’re coming in a month you’ll likely catch the tail end of the pollen or just miss it.",t2_kthyb,CincyDawg,0,1646656951.0,0,t1_hzp3vid,hzp3vid,True,Nobody_Special22,t3_t8hsxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Augusta/comments/t8hsxe/is_the_pollen_as_bad_as_they_say/,Is the pollen as bad as they say?,/r/Augusta/comments/t8hsxe/is_the_pollen_as_bad_as_they_say/hzp3vid/,2,r/Augusta,0,2

"A local hiking trail in North Augusta has been closed.

The Savannah River Bluff Heritage Preserve, located at 1129 Old Plantation Road, was closed to the public on Feb. 25, 2022 by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.

“The property will remain open to SCDNR employees for management purposes only,” SCDNR said in an online statement. “Over the next several days, SCDNR will post closure signs at the property. Those who fail to comply with this closure may be ticketed by SCDNR Law Enforcement.

Willie Simmons, a spokesperson for SCDNR said that it was due to an easement issue.

“We had a chance to resurvey the upper part of the property and when we did, we realized that we did not have an easement for the public to come in,” Simmons said. “If you are looking at Old Plantation Road, the easement that we have is for us to do management, so now we are currently looking and pursuing to see if someone grants us an easement or unless we can buy property on one end of the property or the other.”

The 1.8 mile trail runs through the Savannah Barony neighborhood. The roads leading towards the park are county, however the nearby neighborhood roads are considered private property.

“When they first bought the property, they initially said they were going to get a road access agreement and I guess it just fell through the cracks,” Simmons explained. “... that is why we have to close the property down until we can get a means to get the public in on a legal access.”

SCDNR does not know when the park will reopen.

A lock stands between residents and the Savannah River Bluffs Heritage trail. It was closed recently, and many people in North Augusta wonder what’s going on.  
  
“We all love the park. We all agree. The park is a wonderful thing,” Diane Koehne told NewsChannel 6’s Aiken Bureau Chief Shawn Cabbagestalk. “I think it’s a real shame and a real loss to the North Augusta community,” Pat Kaerko added.  
  
Koehne and Kaerko are two of several people voicing concerns over the Savannah River Bluffs Heritage trail closure. The trail is off a private driveway, but the driveway is not so private after all.

“We sometimes get 50 cars a day on this road and this parking area is there’s an easement here that’s illegal,” Koehne shared. COVID made the parking situation even worse for Koehne and her family. “They would come out here and this parking lot would be totally full and it would overflow down this road and all the way up this road,” she recalled. “As you can see, the road is so narrow that it was hard for the people that live here to even get to their house,” she added. The parking problems are also a safety concern. “They came speeding down our roads. This is like a 20 mile an hour road and they were at 50 miles an hour. Because it’s a one-lane road, there’s so many curves and blind spots that you couldn’t see somebody on the other side. We would actually play a fake-off to see who was gonna move over to allow the other to move on. And we don’t have shoulders on this road either. So it’s very, very dangerous,” she said.  
  
The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources closed the area last week. While the space offered peace of mind, some say other activities were happening there.

“It’s just not good. I mean, we have speeders, we have drug deals going down. We have all kinds of stuff,” Koehne said.  
  
After years of growth, DNR went back to the drawing board to figure out how to add more parking spaces for visitors, but the agency ran into a roadblock. “Because we were looking at maybe doing a larger parking lot, something of that nature. And that’s when we found out that when they first had the property, they did not establish a road access agreement,” SC DNR’s Willie Simmons said.  
  
“This trail is a beautiful resource for people in the area to be able to get out and exercise and get some fresh air.,” Kaerko recalled.  
  
While those who use the area often are waiting for a fix, Koehne has a possible solution. “The parking area needs to be moved. And honestly, if, if that parking area is on DNR property, then it should be over there in the Savannah Barney area.”

Shawn asked DNR if that option would be feasible, “We actually don’t own that property right there that goes through property that the HOA owns. The easement that you see is a power line. So unless we can purchase property or someone grants us an easement. Those are the only two ways to get into the property,” Simmons added  
  
“I think we can come to an amicable resolution. DNR wants to do something. The people on this road wanna do something. We have to maintain this road ourselves over there. The city maintains the road, which makes sense. And it’s a two-lane road. So if everybody is happy, open up that parking spot over there, and open the back park back up,” Koehne added. “The Department of Natural Resources needs to work with the local community here to not only provide additional parking area but also to help compensate the people that live right here for the repairs on the road,” Kaerko shared.  
  
Meanwhile, DNR says the trail will be closed indefinitely until those matters are taken care of.",t2_hqstr,Travyplx,0,1646426200.0,0,t1_hzd2ffy,hzd2ffy,True,Travyplx,t3_t6saad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Augusta/comments/t6saad/savannah_river_bluffs_heritage_preserve_closed_by/,Savannah River Bluffs Heritage Preserve closed by SCDNR due to easement issues,/r/Augusta/comments/t6saad/savannah_river_bluffs_heritage_preserve_closed_by/hzd2ffy/,3,r/Augusta,0,3

I looked her up after reading and saw she has an annual $10000 scholarship that she gives to a student of an incarcerated parent. It’s not based on grades because she understands the child probably has a lot going on in their personal life and it can be used on college or trade school. She and her children choose the recipient.

"There are a multiple factors that have lead to this market. We have tons of millennials looking for homes and we have many more who have been brought into the market with incredible interest rates. On top of this, builders build to make profits not to meet demand. With so much uncertainty in the materials market, they have to be conservative in their expansion.

It’s just about impossible to predict a shift in the market, any one who tells you different is trying to sell you something. We thought it may have been coming with the foreclosure moratorium but even that proved to be a dud.

"The point is to show support. To let those affected know they are not alone. That what they are going through will be seen by others. Not just the others in their country suffering along with them. 

When people just step back and say nothing, it'll start like WW2. We didn't hear about the atrocities till much later. Wasn't or problem. Then we finally realized it wasn't going to stop. Then the queens army stepped in and we followed suit. Things ended but lasted so much longer than it should have.

We've learned from those mistakes. Also, we don't really on only printed news papers and radio for news. The world is much smaller. Our small irrelevant voices become a chorus they can't ignore when shouting the same thing. 

The people who make the decisions, that have the money, that have the power will notice. And their choices or actions will not be without consequences and they cannot claim ignorance. 

I'm sorry you're getting down voted. You're just asking for explanations. I hope this helps.

"I briefly remember this at a restaurant that no longer exists in downtown Augusta. A new restaurant is currently in it's place called Pineapple Ink Tavern. Before Pineapple Ink there was a restaurant called Fuse that had the stacked seating you're talking about. There were only two booths that had this type of seating that were situated in each front corner of the restaurant right by the large storefront windows. 

They had a long custom wooden bar with a huge selection of draft beer. They also made specialized cocktails. Their food was sort of an American Fusion with like Indian-Mediterranean-Middle Eastern influences. Very heavy on the spice e.g. the Lamb Burger. 

Fuse reopened in downtown Aiken, SC, but it is under new ownership and I don't believe they have any of the same cocktails or food they had prior.

"First, a restaurant update: It looks like [Finch and Fifth](http://www.finchandfifth.com/) takes reservations now. They're great. $20 truffle burger and fries? 100% worth it. But it's in Surrey Center, which you may see as either ""a madhouse"" OR ""where all the action is,"" depending on the experience you are looking for.

Okay, traffic: There's no easy way to get to the course or to get back. Traffic at all possible entrances to the National is horrid. The city and the tournament have really done everything they can to improve the situation, so it's just a thing for which you have to plan. I suggest getting to Augusta an hour before you want to *park*. Not an hour before you want to be on the course. Because after the parking, there is the walking. I very much suggest bringing a [folding tripod stool](https://www.amazon.com/travel-tripod-chair/s?k=travel+tripod+chair) or similar for your dad.

The good news is that the tournament has built *so much more parking*. You used to have to drive around the adjacent neighborhoods to find someone taking cars in their yard. 

The routes into the tournament are:  

* From GA or SC, take I-20 to Riverwatch Parkway to Alexander Drive to Berkman's Road. This is the most popular.   
* From GA or SC, take I-20 to Washington Road and battle your way up to Berkman's. Good luck with that. Washington Road is awful any day of the year, but it's also a direct route with police managing traffic that week. Honestly, between Alexander and Washington Road - it's a toss-up.
   * A variation of this is to get off I-20 at Washington Road, hook an immediate right onto Boy Scout, weave around and take a left onto Igleside, then a left onto Berkman's. I don't know that it's any improvement. I live in this general area and it's torment, lol. I leave an hour early for work all this week. Sometimes I'm at work 45 minutes early. Sometimes I'm 15 minutes late. The years Tiger plays?  
... Just build yourself a teleportation device.  
* Some folks go I-20 to I-520, get off at Wheeler Rd, run Wheeler to Surrey Center, and hook a left onto Berkman's. I've never tried this, so I can't give you any advice, but people who do this do think they're very smart. Maybe they are. 
* From SC, some folks go I-20 to Exit 1, then Martintown Road to Georgia Ave., the Georgia Ave. to Broad St., Broad St. to Washington Road, and come at the National East-to-West. I have no clue if this is effective. I think it is going to run you into the morning commute traffic around the medical district (AU Health, VA hospital, etc.), but I could be wrong. That's a week off for schools and the university, so the traffic IS lighter that week. 

Some folks go I-20 to I-520, get off at Wrightsboro, and then take Wrightsboro to Highland, which runs into Berkman's after a brief detour onto Walton Way. They will try to tell your their super-secret way. Do not fall for this. It's an ugly drive that saves you no time and the Highland/Walton Way intersection is bullcrap every day of the year. All you'll be doing is sitting at that light for ages. If you insist on trying this, go Wrightsboro to Monte Sano, Monte Sano to Walton Way, right onto Walton Way, an *immediate* left onto Monte Sano again, Monte Sano to Wheeler, take a left onto Wheeler, and then a right onto Berkman's. You won't save any time, but you won't be sitting at that light at Highland Ave.

Please be very careful when driving. There are so many people in town in rental cars from all over the world and no two people drive alike, so accidents are very common.
