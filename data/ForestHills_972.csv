"When my 9 year old was born, we lived right around the corner from this place. It was well-reviewed at the time and we knew someone who went there and liked it. That was nearly a decade ago, so take it for what it's worth.

However, it would have been perfect because it was literally a 2 minute walk from our apartment.

But anyway, when our kid was born I went to put him on the list. They said there was a waiting list and I was like ""how long until you think he gets off?"" and they were like ""you should look for other options because he won't be a toddler by the time he gets off.""

They took a deposit check from me but told me they would not cash it unless he got off the list, and they would call me when he did.

9 years later, I still haven't gotten a call.

Moral of this story, if you are considering it at all, I would think you might want to get yourself on the list now.",t2_40uzi,EatATaco,0,1645197353.0,0,t1_hxgd4e4,hxgd4e4,True,VikaBella,t3_sv5drh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestHills/comments/sv5drh/metro_kids_daycare_fh_location/,Metro Kids Daycare FH location,/r/ForestHills/comments/sv5drh/metro_kids_daycare_fh_location/hxgd4e4/,3,r/ForestHills,0,3

"Forest Hills Resident here since '06 and I have lived in various parts.

Parking sucks. If you can find a parking garage, please know that the money is worth it because no one likes to spend upwards 40+ min looking for street parking. With restaurants having outdoor dining pods, parking is also taken up. That is usually on 70th rd (closer to where you are moving) and Queens Blvd.

There are so many great places to eat! I would honestly recommend taking a walk down Austin Street and even on Queens Blvd. We have a great wine bar called Keuka that is between 75th RD and 76th on Queens Blvd. We also had to great bars (food and beer selection respectively) that have closed down but new ones are always popping up.

We also have pretty good Chinese and two good Korean places.

I have personally found the chain grocery stores lacking in recent years but Natural Market (corner of Austin and Ascan) is good for produce and has a small butcher in the back (beef and pork) and both organic and vegan products. There cheese selection is no joke either!

"Also to add: there are condos in FH and Rego Park, and we initially were not even going to consider a coop, but that is where a lot of the decent stock is. It also depends on your budget, ours was under $1 million so if you are going for more than that you may have more choices in the condo / house market. Before you get serious searching, write down what is most important in a place, in order. Your must-haves vs. nice-to-haves, i.e. time to train, rooms/bathrooms, building amenities, outdoor space, parking, minimum viable businesses nearby, natural light, w/d, dishwasher (or the potential for one), green space, home office, do you want to clear your own snow / do your own landscaping or will you pay for a service or look for a building that handles it, are you happy taking out the trash or again, is a full-service building more appealing, etc. They can be different for each person at first! We also were pretty dedicated to in-unit laundry in the beginning, but realized between the elevator-accessible building laundry room (with a nice app reporting on your remaining load time / open machines so you never waste a trip) and the huge price premium for unit with w/d, it ended up not being our top factor (they were space, light and location). In that case we picked a much bigger place (1500 sq ft, not including small terrace) with building laundry over a smaller condo with in-unit (950 sq ft). You can make an offer and then not end up going into contract, so if you find somewhere that could work and you think is worth it, you may need to put in an offer within a day or two.  Last thing: keep a very broad search re: mortgage cost if you are looking at condos or coops because the monthly cost is really the important number. Aside from down payment, a $650k apt might cost the same per month as a $900k one when maintenance or the condo HOA + taxes are factored in. On coops, the taxes are included in the maintenance. If you do look at condos, consider any expiring tax abatements and calculate what the taxes could be once the abatements comes off. A lot of them show $30 in taxes on SE but then it turns out in two years year after that goes up to $1000+. I would also do your own calculation on the houses, sometimes they enter the old property taxes and with your new sales price they will be higher in reality.",t2_6rxz3ys,WillThereBeSnacks13,0,1641398507.0,0,t1_hrd8q25,hrd8q25,False,humanpinball212,t3_rw6a5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestHills/comments/rw6a5k/realtor_recommendation/,Realtor recommendation,/r/ForestHills/comments/rw6a5k/realtor_recommendation/hrd8q25/,3,r/ForestHills,0,3
"We just closed on a place with Ivan Mijalkovic at Corcoran this year and I would whole-heartedly recommend him (\*in FH, a coop, but we also looked at houses and apts all over subway-accessible central Queens). We went through it with our search, had a lot of almost contracts, and he was always so calm and collected and never pushed us even when we were rejecting a lot and being picky. Or in one case when our lawyer advised us to back off signing the contract and start over -- he was completely unbothered. He caught so many flaws onsite in properties that we would have missed! It took us 8 months from search to close and we are now getting the place prepped to move in next month. You want to like your broker as a person because you could be spending a lot of time with them. We have nothing bad to say about Ivan, he's a really good guy, which I never though I would say about anyone in the real estate industry. And he works a ton in Queens, he knows the area really well and in our experience had pretty good insights about pricing and unit features. He advised us against a couple buildings as well. I would say he was very respectful of our time too, he would double-check in his system before we set up a showing to ensure we would meet a building's requirements for DTI, etc.

"Yellowstone runs from the LIE all the way to Metropolitan avenue so it just depends. If you're near houses, you'll have an easier time with finding parking and people who might rent you a garage or parking in a driveway. Closer to Queens Blvd (north or south) makes finding parking much harder. On weekends, parking is easy to find. 
From QB to 108th street, alternate side parking is Mondays/Tuesdays, and from 108th to GCP, it's Thursday/Friday.

As for recommendations: Austin street has many restaurants, bars, retail (including a mini Target). There's a great felafal place (Pahal Zan) by the LIRR station. It's tiny but authentic. 5 Burros has good Mexican. No shortage of Ramen places. Gloria's and Austin Street pizza are good. Martha's has good cakes/desserts.

"People sell their cooperative apartments all the time whether to trade up to a larger place, move elsewhere, or relocate to move in with family members. I wouldn’t consider multiple vacancies to be a red flag unless you have evidence of a fundamental problem with the building.

"I don’t think it’s a red flag but that’s just my opinion. My building, the Normandy on QB x JA will go for years without much turnover, then all of a sudden everyone wants to move. There have been 2-3 apartments for sale (including mine, which sale closed last week) here pretty much all year but in the past, we’d have shareholders meeting where the board reports very low flip tax income.

Depending on your space needs, you may want to look into this building. It’s prewar but in a great location and very well run. The only downsides are that if you need garage space you’ll be waiting for months and if your finances are borderline, the board won’t approve the sale. The only reason we sold is that a bigger apartment in the building became available.

David Dan is a realtor in FH who really knows his business and if you haven’t signed up with anyone yet, I’d recommend him without hesitation. We went from hiring him to a price agreement in 18 days, mainly because he knows how to screen for acceptable buyers and had a good sense on how to price the place we sold.

"Who is QNS Collaborative? We are a diverse group of Queens-based makers, organizers, community members and entrepreneurs collaborating to create a community space that makes creativity and community building accessible.

We envision the fullest embodiment of QNS Collaborative as a cooperatively owned and operated physical space that will offer retail space for small creators and curators; community workshops; resource, knowledge, and equipment sharing; and services + space to community members, organizers, mutual aid groups, and grassroots efforts. We seek to create a solidarity economy, built and controlled collaboratively and cooperatively by community members, for community members.

In this first iteration, QNS Collaborative will manifest as a collaboratively and cooperatively run temporary storefront at 25-09 Astoria Boulevard.

Why Now? Queens has always been full of small creators and self-made businesses, but it has not recently made accessible spaces to amplify and encourage these creators to thrive.

Earlier this year, QNSC surveyed the local community of small business owners and found that the large majority of them were looking for very simple things: an affordable place to sell their goods, resources that would help them take a fledgling business full time, and connection with creators in the broader community. We at QNSC hope to provide that space: one that provides resources, encourages a more localized economy and helps people get invested in their neighborhood’s wellbeing.

What’s happening next? It’s true, we have the opportunity to [temporarily] take over a storefront space at 25-09 Astoria Boulevard [the former home of @earthandme.nyc] and will be hosting a collaboratively and cooperatively run store showcasing Queens-based makers beginning mid-October through March 2022.

Here’s what we envision in this space:

Space for ~25 Queens-based makers/creatives/curators in a retail store. These Vendor Members will pay a monthly rental fee, consignment fee on sales, and participate in the care and coordination of the store [check the link in bio for more details on this]. Curation and collaboration with 3 Queens-based organizing communities (@queensliberationproject; @therollinglibrary; and @kaleidospacenyc) ~300 SqFt of storage, coworking, and small-meeting space for Vendor Members Pop-ups; Skill-shares; shopping parties; and small events for the QNSC @patreon Community [more on that coming soon!]

The QNSC Organizing Team has spent a lot of time the past months visiting available commercial spaces, building budgets, and working to realize some IRL version of QNSC in Queens. What we’ve learned is:

There are a ton of you who support the idea of a community-supportive space that connects community and creativity and fosters community over competition; Landlords don’t want to (read: won’t) rent to an unknown entity without any proof of concept and no financial foundation; We need to start now - even if it’s in a small footprint - to put this idea into practice, engage in new economies, and build the world we want to see for our futures.

How can you get involved? Our application to be a Vendor Member is OPEN [check link in bio] and applications must be submitted by 11:59pm EST on September 20.

Forest Hills is just different.  It tends to skew a little older than Astoria (or Greenpoint) and there's more families and homeowners than where I was coming from, so you'll just have to change your perspective a bit.

The upshot is that the neighborhood is really well kept and there's some good food options on Metro, plus some great places in Rego Park.

"I lived on 65th Ave and 110th for a while- so right around the corner from where you must be.  While yes, its a predominately Russian/jewish area and we felt like we didn't fit in,  the area is incredibly safe- I never felt unsafe walking home from the bus late at night or anything. I also LOVED how quiet it was, and we made great friends with the fellow dog owners at the under bridge dog run. The foot bridge to the park was also really nice in the summer time.

"You can get around FOHI, Jackson Heights, Washington Heights, and many popular NYC neighborhoods without a car. This is because the neighborhoods can be walked or traveled through via public transportation. 

The car comes in handy when you want to travel outside the neighborhood quickly. For example driving to Flushing, Jackson Heights, parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan are pretty short car rides from FOHI  at times with low traffic (weekends or very early or late). Public transportation can take much longer on weekends or off hours. If you are going to spend most of your time in a specific neighborhood, or close by, then you could get by without the expense and hassle of a car.

I have a family of four and a parking spot In FOHI. I use the car pretty often to drive outside of FOHI to go to restaurants and family activities. I also use it in FOHI for short trips occasionally. It’s a luxury.

Parking in popular NYC areas is not fun, especially with a large vehicle. Due to street cleaning you typically have to move the car every couple of days to a new spot. I’ve dealt with this is in FOHI, Astoria, and Manhattan. Yes you get used to the inconvenience, but it is a time drain. I highly recommend a parking spot.

Finally, you can only expect parking to get worse in all areas of NYC due to increased bike and bus lanes and the closure of streets for pedestrian access only.",t2_a7n9nhn7,AnonymousAAP,0,1629461632.0,0,t1_h9nibi6,h9nibi6,True,QuirkyTHTR722,t3_p7tkns,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestHills/comments/p7tkns/family_of_six_without_a_car_and_a_large_family/,Family of Six without a car and a large family,/r/ForestHills/comments/p7tkns/family_of_six_without_a_car_and_a_large_family/h9nibi6/,6,r/ForestHills,0,6

“Forest Hills Gardens is a Charming Tudor Enclave in New York City:

Only 15 minutes by train from Manhattan, and historic to boot, the idyllic enclave of Forest Hills Gardens has remained something of a hidden gem in Queens. The borough’s most exclusive neighborhood is prized by insiders for its winding streets, half-timbered Tudor mansions and architectural integrity.

Forest Hills Gardens was one of the United States’ first planned communities, and strict covenants have allowed it to retain the original look and feel of the community that began development in 1909, under the hands of architect Grosvenor Atterbury and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., whose father helped designed Central Park.”

"How often are you using your car? Daily? Weekly? Monthly?

If daily, park on Ascan each night. If weekly you’re committing to moving the car at least once a week. Wednesday nights are always the worst time to look for parking due to the amount of Thursday spots east and west of QB.

There are usually plenty of spots open on the west side of the gardens starting at Ingram St. It’s about a 10 minute walk back to Austin St from there, which is far quicker than circling the neighborhood for an hour. Alt side is Tuesday/Wednesday over there. 

Get the apps that will help you park. Parkwiz will give you easy to reference alt side info. 311 will tell you when alt side is canceled. ParkNYC will let you pay your meter with the app. Pay at the meter first, then pay with the app to double your max time. The app does not allow piggyback payments.

F trains going home at or after 4pm feel super infrequent, causing crowds.  I've been taking the R and either staying on or swapping to the E at Queens Plaza to get home.

I know that info is super specific to my commute but if your appointment falls somewhere around those times maybe it helps?  I haven't really felt too paranoid on the subway yet.

"I used to live at 76th and 113th (loved the area except our apartment was loud being so close to GCP), commuted out Hauppauge, so a bit further than Melville. This was also probably 6 years ago, so the traffic might have changed.

My commute was 38 miles, but took me only like 45 minutes (because both ends were *right* on the highway) out, and maybe like 50-55 back.

However, the important thing was that I aimed to get to work around 7-730. If I left much later, the traffic would increase drastically. When I had my kid and had to drop him off at daycare, the commute just got miserable.

And even more importantly, and you should be fine leaving at 4, but if I didn't leave by 4:30, the traffic getting back would be horrendous, where I would normally just wait it out until like 630 and work a shorter day the next day.

"Don’t forget the lirr has weekend city tickets which are $4.25 one way from Fh to penn also it’s only 15 mins. If you live that close to the lirr station it is quicker for anything on the west side. E or F for the East side. 

I never get tickets to the concerts, but they shut down the street behind the lirr tracks that runs along the stadium. I like to being lawn chairs hang drink and listen. The music is over before it gets too late so I’ve never had an issue. 

Forest hills is a quiet and safe neighborhood with enough to do on Austin street, a quick ride to queens center mall, quick trip to LIC and other areas as well.

"I lived on Dartmouth, less than a block away from the stadium.  Loved it during shows, despite some roadies smoking weed in the alleys and the large crowds going in and out, it generally makes the whole area come alive and is mostly fun to be around.  Concerts are no noise after 10pm, so everything clear out quickly before it gets too late.  People mostly go in early and drink, so the bars and restaurants don't really overflow.

I took the LIRR in and out every day to work.  At the time, the subway was always slow, but the LIRR was generally on time and less crowded, plus the ride to Penn was only 15 minutes.  And no like, 8am Peruvian flute bands and such.  I think the subway has gotten better?  IDK, we left the city entirely, but the LIRR made my life much better.

"Advocat (advocatrescue.org), a volunteer-run and funded cat rescue based in Forest Hills, needs fosters! Kitten season is now year-round, and there are too many homeless kittens and not enough space in shelters or rescues. 

My bf and I started fostering for Advocat a few months ago while experiencing acute kitten fever. We have 2 adult cats of our own, so at first, we were concerned about having enough space in our 1-bedroom apt, and how our kitties would adapt to it. But it turned out to be so better than we expected! Advocat provides everything to get started, including an enclosed playpen to keep the fosters separated. They also cover all the vet bills, and find furrever homes for the kitties. We had our first set of fosters for about 3 weeks, and our cats loved them. We watched them grow from tiny, scared babies to confident, playful, affectionate kittens. The hardest part is saying goodbye, but that also means that we're able to take in new fosters and save more lives.

The little nugget pictured here was from our first set of fosters in May, and quite possibly the cutest thing I'd ever seen.

Fostering doesn't take much time -- we both have 9-5 jobs and are able to leave the kittens for 8 hours while we're at work. You feed them, clean their litter box, and give them affection and play. Some kittens may require oral or eye meds for a few days, but administering them is easy since they're so small.

Please consider fostering, and fill out the application on advocatrescue.org! Reply or DM me with any questions. ",t2_4hwfxraf,queenscatlady,0,1569802700.0,0,t1_f1xr02z,f1xr02z,True,queenscatlady,t3_db3l8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestHills/comments/db3l8w/forest_hillsbased_rescue_needs_fosters_for/,Forest Hills-based rescue needs fosters for adorable kittens!

Are you female or male? That unfortunately could change the level of comfort if have running alone in an area that early. 

Use precautions and common sense. There are safety solutions out there for this type of stuff.

"God speed. There are lots of shitty drivers out there. Last time I had an interaction with a hispanic woman who backed up in to me from a parked space on home depot parking lot in college point without looking back to her left. Instead of appologizing she started asking me why I placed my car there as if it was done intentionaly. She pretended to be oblivious to the fact that there is not enough room to make a direct 90 degree turn for me to park right away and proceeded to argue with me when I attempted to explain that I was trying to park in a spot next to hers by aligning my car before she pulled out. She shut her mouth and left when I pointed to a dashcam.

"Also the incident happened on the left side of my car- when we pulled over a few feet ahead she wouldn’t let my car park behind her even though there was clearly enough room. I can be seen in the video asking her to move her car forward so no cars behind me would hit me also in light of the incident multiple cars had already lined up  but she wouldn’t budge so I pulled in as close as I could. When I told her I had a camera she made sure to go around her car and dashed to my cars blind spot (where the camera wasn’t in view) 


**during the incident** there’s audio of me honking the horning telling her to stop and even the snap heard and me saying “great you fucking broke my mirror”  as she continued and took out my side view mirror.   

Also she approached my car and thankfully I had the keys so I locked it she wanted me to give her the video and I can be heard saying “get the fuck away from my car if you want the video you’ll be getting it from the insurance clearly showing who’s at fault” and sucks for her because I even have a camera in the back view and you can see my blinker was on and I had already turned the wheel and started to reverse as she forced herself in.",t2_3cbm2p9p,Party_Poison20,0,1561421114.0,0,t1_eryysr9,eryysr9,True,Party_Poison20,t3_c4v15g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestHills/comments/c4v15g/hit_run_in_forest_hills_nypd_looking_for_driver/,Hit & Run in Forest Hills NYPD looking for driver of this vehicle any information helps,/r/ForestHills/comments/c4v15g/hit_run_in_forest_hills_nypd_looking_for_driver/eryysr9/,2,r/ForestHills,0,2

I called the police and I know she’s somehow related to those fuckers at the R&M Glatt supermarket or whatever the fuck because the piece of trash owner came and said “her car wasn’t damaged” and I looked at him and said”I could give a rats ass if her car is damaged SHE CAUSED THE DAMAGES ” I’m only 21 a new driver I stay at the speed limit and follow the rules of driving to a T she was older I’d expect her to at least ask “hey are you ok ? Or it’s my fault “ but from the get go she had a NASTY attitude & I will not lie I gave it back to her because when we pulled over she kept saying stuff like “I don’t have time for this I’m late for work”  and I said well now sucks because you’re gonna stay here until my parents come and check out the damages.

"Just saw this occur. I’m posting here in the chances the owner or someone who knows the owners sees this and needs info. 

At approx 9:19am, this DOT truck was going northbound on Yellowstone and proceeded to make an ILLEGAL left turn onto the Queens Blvd service road. The tires were obviously not tethered as while he was making a sharp left onto the service road the front right tire was lifted off the tow truck and the car began dangling. He stopped for a brief moment, I saw him look back over his shoulder, but he proceeded to drive. As soon as he accelerated, the entire car fell off the hoist and ripped apart the front end of the car. 

I did notice several cars on Yellowstone had a “relocation” notice due to the road being replaced so this person was likely NOT illegally parked.",t2_vkc9o,GoBackToLurk1ng,0,1561037992.0,0,t1_ermv8cz,ermv8cz,True,[deleted],t3_c2w3lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestHills/comments/c2w3lo/blue_vw_suv_damaged_by_dot_story_in_comments/,Blue VW SUV damaged by DOT - story in comments,/r/ForestHills/comments/c2w3lo/blue_vw_suv_damaged_by_dot_story_in_comments/ermv8cz/,3,r/ForestHills,0,3

"When I was a kid, A&J's was consider top notch pizza. The quality has downgraded to simply ""acceptable"" nowadays. Gloria's is in my opinion similar quality. Lillian's Pizza was a childhood favorite of mine. I haven't been there in years, but I still hear raves about it.

Then you got the non-traditional pizza for the fancy types. I like Nick's on Ascan.. Their sausage and pepperoni is good. It's on a thinner crispy crust. I ordered from Numero 28 which is pricey and fancy, but I was not personally impressed, although I ordered delivery so maybe that factored in. There's also Dee's on Metropolitan, which I also have not had in years, so I cannot comment on their quality.

Might I recommend the taco stand on 71st and Austin instead. Chorizo on a cemita is the truth! Also shish kebab at Pahal Zan by the overpass is good.
