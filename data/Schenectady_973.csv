"John Alexander Glen, who lived in Scotia,  across the river from Schenectady, had shown previous kindness to the French. In gratitude, the raiding party took the Schenectady prisoners to him and invited him to claim any relatives. Glen claimed as many survivors as he could, and the raiders took the rest to Montreal. Typically, the captives who were too young, old, or ill to keep up along  
 such an arduous 200-mile journey were killed during the way. As was the  
 pattern in later raids in New York and New England, many of the younger  
 captives were adopted by Mohawk families in Canada.

"Don't forget Schenectady's richest contribution to the US of the Americas . . . the Stockade.  The Stockade was founded around 1661 and was surrounded by a wooden wall or, stockade.  Around 1690 the French teamed up with the Algonquin Native Americans and planned to attack Fort Orange in Albany.  They thought if they could control the Hudson River they could take over the entire East coast and a good chunk of the continent. It was a cold winter with deep snow and the army descended from Canada marching over 300 miles.  When they came upon the Stockade in the middle of the night, they decided to attack that settlement instead.  About 60 people were killed and 90 taken prisoner to be marched back up to Canada.

A local man who lived across the river in what we know as Scotia went over to see what was happening.  He was Alexander Glen who was well known to the French army.  As a favor to Mother France, he was permitted to have released any prisoner who was a relative to him.  He lied.  He said this person is my wife's second cousin, this one is my nephew's wife, this one is . . . The French commander eventually caught on and cut him off at about 20.  

So, if it wasn't for the deep snow, the cold winter, the lack of resolve on the part of the French army, and they made it to Albany instead of attacking the Stockade, we would all probably be speaking French right now and much of this country would be part of Canada today.  Sometimes in history, our paths are not determined by what was done but, by what was not done.

"It was a city with an enormous amount of growth from GE and ALCO and the population boomed, peaking in I think the 30s or 40s, and it was probably twice the population it is today. It was once a city with tons of patents and research happening due to GE's presence, one example is that the first TV broadcast happened in Schenectady... It's only logical some notable people came out of the area as well I guess, Kurt Vonnegut is one example of someone who lived in the area for awhile. I believe one or more of his novels (Player Piano is one, and it was his first published novel iirc) was set in/describes Schenectady. He worked for GE during the 1950s.

There's definitely a lot of neat lil nuggets of history that happened in Schenectady or that the city has somehow helped spawn, but I feel like it's nothing most residents ever take pride or much of an interest in, becuase the number one rule of being a local is that you can only shit on Schenectady.",t2_itnqv0qx,onetreatonetoeat,0,1642747460.0,0,t1_htkh8vm,htkh8vm,True,zlendermanGG1,t3_s93j3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/schenectady/comments/s93j3u/why_is_schenectady_so_famous/,Why is Schenectady so famous?,/r/schenectady/comments/s93j3u/why_is_schenectady_so_famous/htkh8vm/,45,r/schenectady,0,45

"This is me. I also own a two family in Schenectady. I have very good tenants. They all pay below market value for their apartments. I do not raise their rents annually just because I can. Good tenants are more valuable than a few bucks.  I make money still and they get a good value. I fix and maintain the house and grounds, and immediately respond to their concerns.   
  
As soon as one of them leaves (which hopefully won’t be for a long time) im going to sell the house. If I can’t control what’s going on in my own house, then I’d rather not deal with it. I had to remove some awful tenants prior to the ones I have now. They were physically  destroying the property, smoking in the house, being threatening towards the other tenants, and being a nuisance to neighbors, among other things that would be considered “lease violations”. Since they were paying their rent, judges would not let me evict. “Lease violations” are baloney. The courts don’t care. It’s already difficult to get rid of shitty tenants, and it’s hard to screen for them since NY makes it illegal to view an applicants past evictions.

"I'm really conflicted about all of this, myself. I'm a landlord in Schenectady. My first house was 2 family, and I lived in it in the upstairs. 

I've spent close to 70k over the last 9 years in it on just doing floors, redoing both kitchens (high end cabinets and granite counters), all plumbing, all electric, ripping out the old asbestos ceilings adding sheetrock, new roof, and two new tankless heat systems. I fixed the place the same as any single family owner would do for theirs. 

I charged 695 for the downstairs. Just when covid hit I got new tenants who smoked tons of weed. Weed was fine, that didn't bother me. What bothered me was them doing it in the house. Just go out back. I was on a corner, so there was no neighbors to the one side. Literally no one would have known. 

Anyway, covid hit and they tried the we aren't paying rent bit, despite not having lost their jobs and making money. I told them they had to prove covid hardship, and it was only applicable to people who were impacted by covid. I don't think that was true. But why not see if the white lie worked?

They broke their lease a year ago in July. I didn't rerent yet due to my fear of being taken advantage of. I bought a single family last September. The beautiful two family sits empty, I've lost so much money it's insane. 

I work a pretty mediocre govt job. I was hoping to supplement my income by a few 100 dollars with this. I'm probably just going to sell it - at a loss - because the anti-landlord movement even for good local ones that take very VERY good care of their properties is just really hard to deal with.

"> A little while later the Gray family, which resided at 284 Mann Ave., welcomed their fourth and final child.

It's so weird for him to give out the address of where he lived as a child. I'm sure that in his mind that's some type of flex or something but I just see it as yet more evidence that he's a fucking dope.

Does he expect that the residence should have a plaque on it to commemorate his childhood home? Should there be a John ""This Mayonnaise Smells Funny"" Gray statue out front?

All those fucks at the Saratogian have to do is run spellcheck on this shit after they get it from John; a space in the middle of ""to"" will be caught by it. And yet for some inexplicable reason, they don't. Why? Do the elderly readers of John's column not deserve that? It's a pretty low bar.

"> The reason I’ve always hated a late December birthday is because when people see your year of birth they automatically tag you as a year older. Here, let me give you an example. Pretend it’s January 2nd of 2022 and you just met someone who said they were born in the year 2000. You instantly say, “Oh, so you’re 22.”

> But what if they were born December 29th of the year 2000? That person goes through almost the entire year of 2022 being 21 years old and doesn’t turn 22 until the year is almost over. See what I mean?

This is just so tragic. Poor John! He's had to deal with this tragedy his entire life! I can really understand why he ""hates"" where his birthday falls on the calendar.

"I ain't not no keeping my story to myself. We had 15 strays on my dead end street and my neighbor would catch and spay them.  On warm sunny days I'd turn down my road and they'd all be laying in the road sunning themselves.  The problem was there was a foreclosed house down the road that took the bank three years to sell and in the meantime cats were getting in through a broken basement window and procreating like crazy.  My neighbor would bring litters of them to the shelter for adoption. 

On the positive side, we had no mice nor moles for a few years.  On the negative side we would often find dead cats on the road from being hit by cars.  We'd find dead cats under bushes that died from AIDS and other feline diseases.  Everyone found a dead cat or four in their pools during heat waves.  Occasionally we'd see a fox with a cat in its jaws running off into the bushes.  A new neighbor moved in and saw them as a nuisance because they ""voided"" in her garden so she began catching and removing them.   Now that the cats are gone, raccoons, opossum, skunks, rabbits, birds and hawks have moved back in.  ALL OF US have also been inundated with moles.  I had hundreds of cicada in my front yard and this cycle there were none.  

The cats were both a nuisance and a benefit.  Mostly though, it was sad to see them suffer and see their lifespan cut in half for living outdoors. 

I think the best thing you can do is catch them and bring them to a NO KILL animal shelter to be adopted.  I loved watching them in my yard catching moles but it pained me to see them die early and horrible deaths.  If you love cats, you'll want to see them live long, happy and healthy lives.

"Wow, small world, friends.  Like others here, I grew up in Oswego County, lived in Ithaca for a time, and now live in Schenectady.  Just in general, winters in upstate NY are not like what they used to be.  I was just talking a friend over the weekend and as we head into another green Christmas, I remembered that I didn't see my first green Christmas until I was 17 or so.

The property taxes are incredibly high in Schenectady County/City. If councilpersons wish to continue developing the city, I would have thought additional taxable sources would help, especially to improve many of the forgotten neighborhoods of Schenectady. The Stockade isn't the only area in need of revitalization or improvements. With city council dragging their feet, expect them to hold public hearings at an inconvenient time over the holidays.

"You sound like me 10 years ago.  Like others have said, stockade is a great hybrid area of hip and old world charm.  
The entirety of downtown is small and walkable, so in addition to the stockade I would suggest expanding your search to the entire 12305 zip code, except probably excluding anything south of Hamilton st.  

This will give you access to some more places interspersed with local businesses. 
Additionally there are several high end gentrified apartments on state street and Mohawk harbor, but I think these are a little too basic for the vibe you're going for.

"I don’t know what a “nice social-emotional” approach is. The science of behavior has nothing to do with being “nice”. You define the behavior,  track it for a period of time while looking at the antecedents and consequences surrounding it to make a hypothesis about why it’s happening (the function of the behavior) and intervene accordingly. So if a kid swears at me every time I ask him to do math and I send him to the office or he gets suspended and the behavior doesn’t improve, I can make a pretty good guess that the kid is probably trying to avoid their work. Allowing them to avoid it is making it worse. Accountability is key. They should no longer be allowed to avoid the work- no matter how extreme the behavior gets. This might mean using a time out/safe room until they’re calm enough to return to work- you ethically always have to start with positive strategies, but if the behavior is dangerous this can be warranted. This pattern of just sending kids away whenever they act out is not doing them any favors.

Trauma informed practices and care are important (at the most basic level viewing your students as hurt human beings, not “animals”- if this is your view get the fuck out of the classroom), but if you don’t have the accountability piece it’s absolutely worthless.",t2_7peez6ur,ageofempiresismyjam,0,1633081206.0,0,t1_heygknx,heygknx,False,BronzeSpoon89,t3_pxywfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/schenectady/comments/pxywfm/the_state_of_schenectady_public_schools_is/,The state of Schenectady public schools is horrible,/r/schenectady/comments/pxywfm/the_state_of_schenectady_public_schools_is/heygknx/,3,r/schenectady,0,3

"Seeing as this is secondhand from someone naming a school that doesn't exist (no school named ""Schenectady middle school"" is part of the district), I'm not sure what this post accomplishes.

Never mind that the schools are underfunded, and have students with problems like major food insecurity and poverty- problems which schools aren't built to fix and shouldn't be expected to. And this ignores the role that parents and outside influences play in the equation- children are outside of a school for 3 times as long as they're in school in a given year (math available on request).

"SCHENECTADY – One person was killed and two others injured outside a Schenectady bar early Sunday, police said. 
Police identified the man killed as E-Shawn Amir Berkley, 23, of Albany. He was pronounced dead at Ellis Hospital.

Berkley was found in the parking lot of Tropics Bar and Restaurant at 201 S. Brandywine Ave. with a gunshot wound to his chest. He had been treated at the shooting scene by members of the Schenectady Fire Department prior to being taken to the hospital.

Police at the scene also found a 27-year-old woman in the parking lot with a gunshot wound to her leg and a 22-year-old man arrived at Ellis with a gunshot wound to his abdomen. They were both taken to Albany Medical Center and were in stable condition later Sunday morning, police said.
Neither shooting victim was identified.
Schenectady County Dispatch received numerous calls regarding an individual who was shot in the parking lot at about 12:44 a.m..

As officers arrived, additional callers told dispatchers three people had been shot.

When police arrived they found Berkley and the woman in the parking lot.

Officers rendered medical attention to both victims until medics from the Schenectady Fire Department arrived.  A short time later, staff at Ellis Hospital notified officers that the 22-year-old male victim had entered the hospital. The woman was taken to Albany Medical Center, where she remains in stable condition, while the surviving male victim was stabilized by hospital staff and transferred to Albany Medical Center and remains in stable condition.

At the shooting scene Sunday morning, a black sedan remained in the parking lot with apparent bullet holes in its driver’s side panel and door. The vehicle appeared to be trapped on a small grass hill and curb that separated the club’s parking lot from a Speedway gas station.

Some people looked at the vehicle and took photographs of it Sunday morning.

A woman who stopped into the Speedway said to no one in particular that the city should “shut the whole thing down,” adding that “we can’t have anything in this city.”  

The front door to the night club, which is near I-890, was locked.

On Facebook, the club promoted a Caribbean Day afterparty Saturday night. The club was also under new ownership, according to an Aug. 17 post. 

Detectives from the Schenectady Police Department are actively investigating the homicide case with assistance from New York State Police Major Crimes.  Anyone with information is asked to contact the Schenectady Police Department’s TIPS Line at (518)-788-6566.",t2_24ij0g23,steamed_hamburglar,0,1630940776.0,0,t1_hbtdf1d,hbtdf1d,True,steamed_hamburglar,t3_pj13wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/schenectady/comments/pj13wc/surprise_surprise_three_shot_one_dead_outside/,"Surprise surprise, three shot, one dead, outside hood night club in Hamilton Hill.",/r/schenectady/comments/pj13wc/surprise_surprise_three_shot_one_dead_outside/hbtdf1d/,-5,r/schenectady,0,-5

"It's honestly just depend on the way you set up the area. I have a few friends who run successful airbnbs but im only 19 now so i cant rlly do my own as yet. First off you need to secure good photos of the space the guest will stay in, you need to furnish the area and have everyday amenities. Also checkout other airbnbs around the area that your place is located. Compare the prices and check reviews to see why people liked the stay etc. Always have a set of strict rules stated in your airbnb house rules. Price your place accordingly but not too expensive(I'd personally price it well if it was just the whole place). Calculate how much days would require you to get the initial amount you need for mortgage payments or bills and set a goal to have so many days booked or etc. Also up your price and then offer monthly discount so guests would find it more attractive plus its a win if they airbnb it for the full 30 days.

"> Gaslight Village closed in 1989, but if they ever decided to resurrect the place, there's no question Andrew Cuomo should be appointed mayor. Why? Because, even as everyone and I mean everyone abandoned his ship and called for its sinking, Cuomo was ""gaslighting"" until the bitter end.

I'm not offering a ""both sides are bad""-argument here because Cuomo is clearly a piece of shit and can fuck right off and prosecuted to the full extent of the law *but* it it's funny that John gets up on his high horse about Cuomo but pulls a muscle trying to defend Trump's insurrection, isn't it?

"Hi! I feel your pain!! I grew up in the Schenectady area (now living mostly in Philadelphia) but back here somewhat frequently. When I'm home I definitely miss all the action in a bigger city. I think the a reasonable approach is to just try and take advantage of the nature around here. I am pretty impressed just driving around some places how much natural space there is and how green everything is. I saw you mentioned you were into light hikes, which there are many great places for this around (Saratoga has some, Lisha Kill in Niskayuna, Albany Pine bush). Once you go a bit farther there are some really fantastic and beautiful hikes in the Adirondacks, which nice daytrips (climbs like Buck mountain is possibly a good entry point). I use the app alltrails to find good hikes. If you are at all interested in taking up rock climbing as a hobby, there is a climbing gym called the Edge Halfmoon not too far away. In the winter, can consider snowshoeing or skiing as possible hobbies to take up.

I too am trying to find music venues around here.... but have not have a ton of success thus far. SPAC is a nice venue for outdoor shows in the summer time, but the options are fairly limited in terms of what shows they have.

"We lived in Woodlawn for about 10 years and moved to Niskayuna a couple years ago. We liked it there for the most part, and moved because we wanted a little more space and better schools.

Woodlawn is decent, but street to street and even one end of the street to the other end can vary.  Some great people, but some not so good people. Our end of the street was quiet and everyone was very friendly, but there were some broken in cars, and some police calls at the other end. 

That little Mexican place was great for a good lunch, Blue Ribbon too... Stella's looks good, I haven't made it there yet. I like the little park off of Kings Rd. Paige Elementary has a nice playground for kids. I lived near Paige, and those streets were great to walk on.

"Walking trail, I recommend Plotterkill.  Only about a 20 minute drive from where you are.  Idk if you're a cyclist but the Mohawk/Hudson bike trail is great as well and can be picked up not too far from you and you can go from Albany to Amsterdam.  Hour drive north will get you into the mountains around Lake George which are great for a day hike as well, but Lake Geroge is it's own subject.  Kayaking along the Mohawk is fun too.

Restaurants, check out anything Italian around here, you can't go wrong.  My personal fave is Ferrari's but there's no real wrong answer, just your own preferences.  If you're in Woodlawn you're not far from Marinos which is the best pizza in the entire area in my humble opinion.  Spend enough time on this sub or the surrounding area related subs and you'll start to get a good idea of the best places.

Beer/bars/breweries, a short drive or Uber and you could spend a whole day in downtown Schenectady hitting some pretty great places.  ""The Nest"" does a great brunch, and ""Ambition"" has a good one too (try the boozy muffins) 3 great breweries are in downtown proper, (Mad Jack, Frog Alley, Great Flats) and another up by the casino (Druthers), plus the Rivers Casino itself (if you like gambling).  Tons of breweries in the area, I definitely recommend Wolf Hollow and BackBarn (all part of a Schenectady based ""Ale Trail.""  Indian Ladder (25 minute drive) for beer, cider, apple picking and other stuff.  Plenty of places with great patios in the city too.  Nightlife can be a lot of fun, depends on what you're looking for.  Not much of a ""club"" scene, mostly just ""bars.""

Check out the Green Market from 10-2 on Sundays outside of City Hall.  Lots of local vendors doing popups with fresh local produce and other products.  (They do a separate simple farmers market in the same location on Thursdays!)

""Proctors"" gets Broadway musicals and events/acts and is worth keeping your eye out for when tickets come up.  Bowtie cinema gets every new movie you'd want and is only a few doors away.
