"I wanted to add another comment here for everyone. I think this was some of the main things I am trying to get across to everybody out there.

1.We are NOT racist.

2. You have MANY more freedoms here than you would in many other countries.

3. We are not perfect ,nor is any country in the world ,yet we have done a lot to help other countries with our men ,and women.

4. We are not a ""Shit country.."" anyone saying something like this is an idiot ,and needs to look at countries around them before they apologize for what they've said.

&#x200B;

Every country in the world almost has a border..... it's not racism it's just a simple, common sense, normal thing...... It obviously doesn't make our country racist...... By the way we don't even have a fucking border since we have allowed in millions of illegal immigrants in the country... So stop using something so stupid to say we are racist. Again almost every country in the world has had slaves in history. Slavery was abolished long ago in the United States... In fact if you even seem to be racist in anyway at all nowadays ,or even make a racist comment you are attacked by every social media ,every organization ,or business ,or sued.... So also you can stop using slavery that occurred all those years ago to those poor people against this country. Look at all the other countries that had slavery all those years ago people.. We obviously weren't the only ones!! Stop using that against our country to say we are so racist... Or still racist.. We are not. 

Also regardless if you hate Trump or not there are millions of black supporters as well as white supporters who do not believe Trump is a racist... 

Let me tell you one thing that IS shitty about our amazing country. That almost every American will agree with ,and that is our media in our country ,and many democrats. If they don't like Trump they are going to use every single thing they can against him including simply having a border like other countries do ,or if he uses certain words like ""fight"" which apparently every democrat like Biden ,Pelosi have said several times on video ,but when Trump says it, it's racist... ,or it's all his fault that the capitol riot happened... 

In other words. I can completely understand there are many things you don't like about Trump. Yet you have no right to use him ,to hate our country. You also need to understand that there are actually many things about him that news outlets ,democrats ,and others have deliberately lied about ,and did everything in their power to destroy him politically. He's not a racist ,and he doesn't represent our country. He is only a leader ,or president ,not America... Neither is Biden America.. 

&#x200B;

Anyhow thank you very much for taking time reading this. I do hope I didn't offend you ,because it wasn't at all my intentions. Thank you for all your comments. I love America ,and to be honest another country I personally love is Israel. I think they are really cool ,and I like their government. But I do believe America is the greatest country in the world (in my opinion). And I personally love this country. It's why I wanted to defend it for a lot of things that just simply aren't right ,or true. We are not a shit country ,and people should stop putting down on us. Yeah I do think with the presidency ,and current presidents it is a shit storm if you ask me ,but understand that America sees that as well. We are all sick of it ,and honestly you should not put down on us ,because of it...",t2_dkxdomwu,KRKSeven,0,1648057856.0,0,t1_i1tnn8c,i1tnn8c,True,KRKSeven,t3_tfepgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/america/comments/tfepgr/respecting_america_greatest_country_in_the_world/,Respecting America - Greatest country in the world,/r/america/comments/tfepgr/respecting_america_greatest_country_in_the_world/i1tnn8c/,2,r/america,0,2

"Personally, for breakfast I like to have scrambled eggs (with salt and pepper). I sometimes have toast with jam, honey, or cinnamon sugar with butter on it. If I don't have much time I like cereal. For lunch, I tend to have something simpler or lighter. Sometimes a PB&J, or deli meat, something with vegetables. Maybe soup, like chicken noodle. For dinner, I like something heartier. More meat, something cooked. I recently had pot roast. If I have dessert, it'll be a cookie (chocolate chip is most common) or ice cream.

On the odd occasion, because I don't like American Chinese food that much (It's different than actual Chinese food) people who get it will give me the fortune cookies.

For Thanksgiving, it's usually turkey. There's also mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, gravy, etcetera. Dinner rolls and pumpkin pie are common too. Christmas is pretty much the same thing, but everybody has different things they do. For example, a lot of people get Chinese food (once again American Chinese food), because they don't celebrate Christmas and that's the only thing that's open. A Jewish tradition, I believe.

There's a lot of difference. For example, you can find lists of Southern food that midwesterners wouldn't have. There are a lot of financial differences, and immigration. A lot of Americans have German ancestry, for example, and we have brats a lot.

"Really it depends on where in the USA you are- we readily adopt food from every culture, but we also have our own regional cultures. Where I am right now, a really good breakfast might be toast, eggs, and bacon, or grits (think breakfast polenta), or biscuits and gravy (people think it’s weird, but google it. It’s delicious). Other places I’ve lived a more typical breakfast would be cold- cereal, or fruit and granola, or a bagel and coffee. 

Lunch is typically a quicker meal- a sandwhich (pretty much anything but vegemite, sorry bud) so peanut butter and jam, or meat and cheese and various veggies.

Especially the middle isn't ""ready"" for a free society in a western way. The history and culture of these countries differ too much from our own. That's maybe a further reason why 911 happened (ofc not the general one). The people didn't want any American intervention in their country and didn't like a super power occupying their land. It's infantilizing paternalism. We just can't intervene in a from us very different country and tell them how to live. How can we be in a position to dictate them their way of life. Ofc it's going to backfire, it's just to radical. Can't change a structure of society in like a decade without respecting and even noticing the history and culture in this area.

"Fascinating stuff about Missouri.

Also, on my laptop I have a sticker collection of George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Although, I now have a Shrek sticker places over Thomas Jefferson . When I asked why, I said because I like Shrek more than Jefferson hahaha. That’s not to say I don’t appreciate his great contributions, but I just have a lot of disagreements with him. In the Washington/Jefferson feud I would’ve sided with George easily. That being said Madison is probably one of my favorites next to Washington.

I think there is a federalist/confederalist spectrum regarding states right vs the authority of the national government. I think Washington probably leaned a bit more federalist than myself. However, I think that was necessary in our baby years in order to strengthen us to fend off Britain. I’m definitely more federalist than Jefferson, but I’ve just grown so disenchanted by him and Lincoln. Washington, Madison and Ulysses S Grant are more of my kinda guys.

A big underlying factor is Christianity.

"I agree, and I’m very worried about what the other options are.  The way I see it, I’m in America because I’m not trying to live in a place where people are just like me.  However, if they fuck it up so much it’s just unfixable, then I’ll have to go back to living in Europe…which I did in college.  I am Swedish and English and so I can fit in moderately well there.  I don’t speak Swedish, of course…Who learns Swedish if they don’t live there?!  Even the majority of Swedes speak English better than most Americans.  I would happily live there if it weren’t for the EXTREME Hell of the cold and rain.  I can’t stand it.  I thought of Australia, but since CoVid made them out themselves as a dictatorship, now I’m giving up on them.

I’ll fight and die to preserve my country in its state of freedom, but the fact it’s been so grossly irresponsible means that it’s unacceptable to deal with this crap anymore.  Our national debt is at a level that literally CANNOT be fixed.  We will inevitably have to repudiate our debt.  There is no escaping that.  We could put 100% of the budget of the entire United States into paying our debts, for a whole presidency, and it would not succeed in paying it off.  This is what happened when you let grown up babies be in charge.

Anyhow, so I think there will eventually have to be a war that somehow resets the national debt.  That’s how the French Revolution happened.  I would be more than happy to see Biden’s head roll from the Guillotine, but I suspect that instead there will be some hapless victim who is chosen to take the fall.  Whoever that is, ironically, will probably be the honest one.

"You’re completely right about Liberals not getting it about how states rights allowed gays to marry and how it allowed marijuana to be legalized (even when it’s still not nationally okay, which is ridiculous).  If they got it why states rights were important, they might see why the Confederacy wasn’t pure, unadulterated evil.  Nathan Bedford Forrest was a racist, but Jefferson Davis wasn’t, and Robert E. Lee wasn’t.  Half the generals in the Confederacy weren’t overtly supporters of slavery.  I don’t have any known relatives from the Confederacy, and the closest was a Missouri Militia Colonel who actually fought the North AND the South to maintain Missouri’s neutrality…but I still don’t like to see the Gray disparaged by people who don’t get who they really were.

As to James Madison and Thomas Jefferson’s Democratic Republicans, that is my real party 100%.  Before the real racist, Andrew Jackson, ignored the Constitution and created the Democratic Party for his unique brand of mulish jackassery, the Democratic Republicans were the greatest party this nation has ever seen!!  (I would have been a Bull Moose Party member too though).  I am all about Jefferson, entirely.  It’s probably not fair to Madison, but I’m obsessed with Jefferson.

Did you know that he is also the Father of American Archaeology?!  He did everything.  I have been an archaeologist myself, and I would still work in the field if the economy wasn’t so bad that there isn’t any work.

It makes sense to me (even more so if you go soft the Olive Branch Petition that the Founders sent to King George).  The Founders certainly wanted freedom from oppression and tyranny, but a fair number were flagrantly antiauthority in general.  Collectively the likes of Hamilton and John Adams and others wouldn’t let them get too far from a central authority, but the Lee Brothers and quite a few others, I think including Franklin and Jefferson, wanted to really give the power to the People and not a central government.

"I would agree with you that Confederate as a word and ideology has been stained. The primary difference I’ve noticed between Federalist and Confederalist is that Federalists argue for a more centralized power where as Confederalist are ideally less imposing on their subnational counterparts.

I’d have to lean more federalist, though I used to lean far more a state favoring confederate.

"I wish we had a better association with the word “Confederacy,” because besides the positive associations with the Iroquois Confederacy, I also want to point out that the first binding “contract” that the country accepted was the Articles of Confederation.  In a sense we had a Confederate Government before we had a Federal Government.

The word “Confederate” might have endless associations culturally with racism and slavery now, but it didn’t in the early days of America.  It also didn’t have that association to those who formed the Confederate States of America during the Civil War.  Lincoln cleverly made the war mainly about slavery in 1862, halfway through the conflict.  It was a brilliant political move, but it deliberately ignored the MANY Confederates who adamantly and openly opposed slavery.  Political Correctness can’t acknowledge their existence now, but a gigantic number of the leaders of the Confederacy were more than willing to see slavery end. The Republican Party began as the anti-slavery party, but Lincoln was a moderate, and his delegates won the convention’s nomination by shutting the doors and refusing to allow John C. Fremont’s delegated inside to vote.  Lincoln had stated in his debates he wanted to send all slaves back to Africa.  He wasn’t exactly a pure abolitionist.  The war made him one, as it did many Southerners as well.

Anyway, all this history aside, I think the word Confederacy has gotten a very misunderstood cultural connotation for us Americans.  It’s not about the ill-fated uprising of the South in the 1860s, and it’s not about the fetus of the foedus of Ancient Rome;  The concept of the word “Confederacy” emphasizes the coming together of many to make one…That is literally where we get the idea of “E Pluribus Unum” from.  It’s often mistranslated as “out of many, one.”  It seems like it means, “One Nation out of the many.”  That isn’t what it means at all though.  It’s meaning is, “A nation composed of many smaller nations.”  The colonists came from the UNITED Kingdom, which was composed of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Isle of Skye, the Duchy of Cornwall, the Kingdom of Wales, the Country of Scotland, and the Country of England, along with many distant territories around the globe.  It made sense to them for the country they were creating to be broken up into separate COUNTRIES.

States, after all, means “countries.”  It doesn’t mean provinces or regions of a larger country.  They used the word “state” to emphasize the notion that each was individual and had its own nationhood.  We became the UNITED States, so that we could be like the United Kingdom, but not run by a king.  We weren’t supposed to be one Federal Government with a bunch of slave-like vassal provinces, run by puppets who followed Washington like Medieval Lords and Dukes who were to pay homage to the King and send tribute.

It’s essential we RETURN to the conception of the United States as a GROUP of nations, that have individual sovereignty, and the right to differ in their laws.  Yes, we have a Constitution that mandates the ability to for Interstate Commerce to occur, without interference.  We have a “Federal” Government, that can challenge the Constitutionality of state’s laws.  However, we aren’t supposed to have an executive who sits like a king on his throne in Washington, holding a fasces and swinging it at anyone who opposes his rule.  The President is the lead spokesperson for the will of the states and their people.  He isn’t a ruler, but a representation of their collective will.  He is to FOLLOW their will, not to enforce his own will.

Thus, I reflect the fasces.  It isn’t because of the associations with Mussolini’s crazy 1930s Fascism, but it’s because of the fact the basic symbol seems to imply a centralized authority, which I think the essence of this nation should reject.  It is unamerican to have a strong national authority that imposes its will on the People.",t2_5fmhr4f0,Heterodynist,0,1647399812.0,0,t1_i0u7hze,i0u7hze,False,Threshold_OnReddit,t3_t4tqi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/america/comments/t4tqi5/some_of_yall_might_recognize_this_symbol_from_the/,Some of y’all might recognize this symbol from the House Rostrum.

"I think you’re right, but I would prefer a symbol that got back to the country NOT having a strong centralized authority.  The ring of equal links of chain, meaning an interconnected group of independent states, is a better symbol in my mind, than an axe that is surrounded by lesser sticks.  Yes, we are stronger together, but why the axe in the first place?  Why not be all equal, and not a bunch of sticks with one dangerous head in the middle?

"Frankly I do have the historical association of the fasces with “might makes right.”  Even the olive branch doesn’t take away the implication that with enough sticks tied together, you can subdue others.  To me it’s not a good symbol for freedom (not to differ with you…just my personal opinion).

I appreciated Benjamin Franklin’s ideas for the symbols of our democracy.  He designed the “Fugio Cent.”  It is where we get a lot of our later ideas of American Symbolism from.  It doesn’t say, “E pluribus unum,” but instead it says, “One of many,” and it has a wonderful motto on the other side, “Mind your business!”  I prefer the motto “mind your business” for America, because it says a lot lore about the original intention of our country being a country than “e pluribus unum” ever did.

America is a country of, “Stay out of my business and I’ll stay out of yours.”  Being a great one for puns, Franklin also meant, “be aware of your own business interests,” and he liked the idea of this statement being on the money you would use for your business.  I would add the more modern usage of this line, by saying, “Mind your own business.”

The other symbols were a chain of 13 links, and an hourglass.  The hourglass symbolized the concept of “tempus fugit,” or “time flies.”  That was where the concept of the “fugio” came from, for the name of this first U.S. penny.  I think the best symbol of a country like the United States is one that shows we believe in EQUALITY, and that we aren’t a nation of favoritism or greed…but we believe in Free Enterprise and Individualism.  Those are the kind of values we were founded on, and if they aren’t the proper symbols of who we are now, then we might as well start a new country and abandon this one.

If I could then I would find a visual representation of Jefferson’s famous line, that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, and that the tree of liberty must be fed from time to time with the blood of patriots.  I like tree symbolism, but maybe it would be best to avoid patriots bloodletting to revive it…

I’m not saying I have the perfect image in mind, but the fasces isn’t ideal to me.  It’s more a symbol of an Ancient Roman style imperial dictatorship, than a symbol of unity and strength to me.  Olive branches and wreathes aren’t bad, but everyone uses the damn eagle, so I think it would be nice if we used the Northeastern Copperheaded Rattlesnake, like on the Gadsden Flag.

We should also consider using the images of Lady Liberty, and the Iroquois that we used to use almost exclusively on our money.  Did you know, by the way, that there was an early dollar bill in United States currency, that featured George Washington AND Martha Washington, side-by-side, as equals?  I’m infuriated that we like to ignore how NOT racist and sexist many Early Americans were.  From 1775 or so, to about 1840, many different symbols were tried for the United States.  Many were intended to be a departure from the standard “king’s head” coinage of the past.

What I like about the Mohican, or other Iroquois Confederacy members, as a symbol for America, is that the Founders of the United States greatly respected the democratic structure of the Iroquois Confederacy.  It wasn’t by chance they dressed as members of the the Iroquois Confederacy during the Boston Tea Party.  Benjamin Franklin wrote his “Albany Plan” to have delegates of all the colonies meet for representation in 1750, based on the fact that Albany, New York, was one of the three Iroquois Confederacy’s capitals.  Oneida was another…Jefferson and Franklin were honorary sachems in the Iroquois High Council, and they took their membership seriously.

It’s not Cultural Appropriation to say that America owes a LOT to the Iroquois.  We literally modeled the Checks and Balances of our Federal Government after their system of government.  I’ve heard the lie that we modeled these things after Ancient Rome or Greece, but let’s not kid ourselves, Rome and Greece didn’t have the kinds of branches of government that the Iroquois had…and executives didn’t veto until they were granted godlike status after Julius Caesar declared himself a god.

I think we should move away from Roman symbolism, and toward Iroquois symbolism, like the eternal fire.  The Haudenosaunee deserve to be brought into the light as our cultural ancestors.  We should also bring back the chain of many links, and the motto, “Mind your [own] business.”",t2_5fmhr4f0,Heterodynist,0,1647398137.0,0,t1_i0u3w1f,i0u3w1f,False,Threshold_OnReddit,t3_t4tqi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/america/comments/t4tqi5/some_of_yall_might_recognize_this_symbol_from_the/,Some of y’all might recognize this symbol from the House Rostrum.

"Fortunately the answer is simple:  It can’t.  We are currently experiencing massive inflation caused by total idiocy that amounts to a tax on the poorest Americans (the ones who don’t own land or other real estate), and which helps ONLY those in government who seek to exploit the American People.  Inflation is purely destructive.  They are anti-American for intentionally destroying our society this way.

If you wonder what the “economic stimulus packets” are about, it’s about taking money out of the specific earmarked budget that we can’t spend above, and putting it into people’s hands so they will spend it on Chinese goods and then give it back to the government in taxes, which then gives the government money that isn’t limited in the same way, in terms of how it can be spent.  It’s a scam, pure and simple.  It’s a way to funnel our money out of the coffers of the Federal Government, and into the oil company executives that Biden loves like family.  Heck, some probably even are family.

He encouraged a war between Russia and Ukraine so that we can use the excuse of the pipeline from Ukraine to Germany as a reason for why gas prices are out of control.  Never mind that he made them out of control for his whole administration so far.  It has to be the pandemic and the war Russia started, not his intentional desire to milk America for every penny, regardless of how it destroys the economy of the United States.

It can’t be any more obvious than it is, that Biden wants high gas prices.  I guess we are supposed to all be so burdened with the “guilt” of driving a car or using fossil fuels, that we will just accept high gas prices are the result of our environmental evils, and wrongs against nature.

I’ll tell you what’s against nature:  It’s the Administration of this country deliberately maximizing the price of gasoline, without concern for how it destroys everything in this nation.  That’s not Free Market Capitalism, it’s pure Dictatorship Communism.  Only Government is capable of engineering this level of corruption on an international scale.

Printing money is how we ruin this country, so that those with the MOST money can escape to another country and leave the butchered cash-cow of America to rot.  The mismanagement of the United States has NO excuse for continuing.  It’s a destructive force that is being allowed to ruin our lives because of the twisted perspective of those who put every other countries interests ahead of our own…thinking they are being righteous by doing that.  By the time they see how they have damaged every person in this country who doesn’t have the financial status to escape to somewhere else, they will already be shifting the blame to everyone else but themselves, because it’s NEVER their fault;  It’s always someone else who was working to try to make the lives of themselves and their fellow Americans better.

The forces in this country who are behind this printing of money, are also those who try to convince us that every value we have as Americans is evil and wrong.  They are seeking to destroy our culture and convince us that selfishness is what hard work and careful planning is based on.  These people have committed themselves to the idea that whatever helps America is wrong, and if it helps other counties to destroy the culture of America, then it must be right.  Instead of being honest enough to move elsewhere, they choose to stay and ruin this country from within.

Before you accuse me of some kind of sexism or racism or other -ism, remember I haven’t blamed anyone group or any specific person besides the current administration.  That’s who I am talking about.  This regime has to change.  I’m not a Republican or a Democrat, and I’m not supporting Trump or claiming some race or gender is superior.  I’m equal parts traditionalist and progressively opened to social change.  What I’m not in favor of is bald-faced exploitation of the masses.  That’s EXACTLY what is happening here.  Corruption is winning and we are letting it.

We need to stand up to those who are willing to ruin everything in this country, just to take as much from very American as they can steal.  This wasn’t a mistake.  Keynesian Economics isn’t an excuse, it’s a deliberate lie to make use of other people’s money.  Printing money is a way to steal from every single person in the world who owns American currency or has a dollar amount in an account.  They are taking food out of your mouth, purely out of their own pleonexia.  There is no excuse.  No one is able to justify diluting the value of a dollar, unless it’s to take from everyone else, so you can selfishly raise the value of what you own which doesn’t have a set dollar amount.

Rich people who side with the current administration are stealing from everyone else.  That’s all this is.  It’s poisoning and destroying the country, like lead in drinking water.  We could stop now, and try to live within our means, pay off the national debt, etc, but no one is even trying.  The last thing they care about is actually helping this country succeed.  They want it to take what is yours, and the easiest way to steal from you is to make everything you have worthless.

If you’ve ever seen Goldfinger, then you understand the plan Auric Goldfinger had for devaluing the world’s gold supply, to make his own gold more valuable.  This is a similar idea to what the wealthy and immoral leaders of the United States are doing.  They are making all they own more valuable, by devaluing everything else in the whole United States, and in the sphere of economic influence of the United States.  You know who that sounds like?  CHINA!!!  They did the same thing with their own people for 60-70 years now.  They kept everyday people poor so that the leaders could be rich by trade with the United States and all other countries.  This is the most obvious form of corruption I’ve ever seen.",t2_5fmhr4f0,Heterodynist,0,1647392762.0,0,t1_i0trszk,i0trszk,True,Professional-Sense40,t3_tf3oz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/america/comments/tf3oz0/how_can_the_government_print_money_forever/,How can the government print money forever without causing inflation?,/r/america/comments/tf3oz0/how_can_the_government_print_money_forever/i0trszk/,2,r/america,0,2

"25 Reasons why it is indeed Bidens fault.

Updated on March 7, 2022

The national average for a gallon of gas for Americans has risen to $4.065, 45 cents higher than just last week.

As Americans return to work, plan spring break and summer vacations they are faced with rising gas prices. (Not to mention higher costs for electricity, home heating, and groceries!!)

The price at the pump and for home expenses began to rise before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. At the end of 2021, President Joe Biden announced the U.S. Department of Energy will release 50 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Energy experts told PBS interviewers that tapping the SPR won’t drive down gas prices. The decision was little more than “a drop in the ocean” when it comes to energy policy, one person said.

The decision also won’t counteract Biden administration policies that have caused rising energy costs — and that will continue to drive prices higher in the future.

Here are 25 decisions the president has made over the last year that have affected gas prices, home heating costs, and other energy-related burdens U.S. families and businesses face.

#1 and 2: Adopting new EPA oil and gas rules
In November 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new regulations governing methane emissions from oil and gas production, transmission, storage, and distribution that would cost more than $1 billion a year.

Last spring, Biden signed a resolution that overturned Trump administration reforms to EPA oil and gas rules. This resolution will worsen energy poverty, reestablish burdensome regulations, and have a disproportionate impact on small businesses.

#3, #4, #5, #6, #7, and #8: Restricting or impeding energy projects
One of Biden’s first actions after taking office was to halt new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters, the Biden administration has delayed decisions on these leases  — a move that results in higher energy costs for the most vulnerable consumers.

The administration canceled the Keystone XL pipeline and suspended oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and New Mexico (despite opposition from the Navajo Nation). It also resurrected the “Waters of the United States” rule, which would increase barriers to energy projects.

The White House is pursuing new standards for particulate matter and ozone, likely tightening them to unachievable levels for much of the country and creating new barriers for energy project permits.

The president also has rescinded Endangered Species Act reforms, a move that will increase red tape and allow litigation to slow down energy projects.

#9: Rejoining the Paris agreement
In April 2021, without the consent of Congress, Biden rejoined the Paris agreement, which will result in onerous new regulations that could raise energy costs.

#10: Appointing unaccountable energy regulators
The president has created several bodies within the White House charged with creating new policies to regulate energy. The people who run these councils are unelected and do not need Senate confirmation, but they have been given broad powers to come up with new executive actions — which do not need consent from Congress — to regulate U.S. energy production.

#11: Forcing states to restrict driving
One section of the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, supported by the White House, would require every U.S. state to develop state carbon-reduction plans that must be approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation as well as be updated every four years.

These plans are aimed at reducing driving all over the country — even for people in rural areas where public transportation is limited, and driving is the only option.

#12, #13, and #14: Raising the prices of cars and trucks
The Biden administration has failed to take adequate action on annual requirements and small refinery waivers for the Renewable Fuel Standard and in providing regulatory relief from this biofuel mandate due to economic hardship. His EPA  has finalized a new rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. That single regulation could raise the average vehicle price by $1,000.

#15: Instituting a new policy on carbon taxes in organized wholesale electricity markets
This carbon pricing policy statement, issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in April 2021, is a blanket endorsement of top-down policies that have been demonstrated to be costly, ineffective, regressive, and consistently rejected by the American people.

#16: Raising the prices of common household necessities
The EPA has issued a final rule to phase out a common, inexpensive refrigerant. This policy is a de facto tax on air conditioning and refrigeration.

#17: Stifling energy innovation
In May 2021, Biden issued a sweeping executive order that mobilized federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, to enforce mandates on businesses, insurers, retirement funds, and suppliers. These policies will stifle innovation critical to improving the environment and will increase costs for a wide variety of businesses.

#18: Altering regulatory cost analyses
The Biden administration has changed key inputs for economic and regulatory analysis, including raising the “social cost” of greenhouse gases. These policies will mask the true consumer cost of regulatory actions.

#19 and #20: Imposing new costs on power generation
The administration attempted to resurrect an aggressive version of the Clean Power Plan for power sector mandates called the Clean Electricity Standard.

In the Fall 2021 Unified Agenda, the EPA stated their intention to propose what can be considered the Clean Power Plan 2.0. This policy would impose burdensome regulations but would have little or no environmental benefit.

The EPA also has mandated that even facilities with reduced emissions must remain on the list of “major” sources, subjecting these facilities to permitting burdens and higher costs.

#21: Impeding Americans exports
The administration is considering potential restrictions on the export of crude oil that would increase, not decrease, energy prices.

#22 and #23: Raising taxes
More than one-quarter of the administration-backed Build Back Better agenda is pulled directly from the “Green New Deal.” The Build Back Better agenda includes new taxes on natural gas and home heating. It also includes new taxes on petroleum and manufacturing.

#24: Picking energy winners and losers

The Build Back Better agenda would spend taxpayer dollars to push utilities to adopt more costly, politically preferred forms of energy, a move that would reduce Americans’ energy choices.

#25: Fueling the fire for future regulation
Finally, through the Civilian Climate Corps, Build Back Better would fund the salaries of tens of thousands of anti-energy activists who would perpetuate high energy costs by demanding new and costly federal regulations and legislation.

===========================================

and in todays news..
WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats united Tuesday behind a ban on Russian oil and natural gas imports, embracing a politically risky strategy that is expected to drive up already-rising fuel prices while seeking to pin the blame for Americans' pain at the pump on Vladimir Putin.
In a speech announcing the ban, Biden acknowledged it would probably result in more expensive gas for consumers in the United States, a potentially perilous admission for a president who has been scrambling to head off Republican attacks over the rising cost of groceries, rent and other items.

Unlike releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, these 25 steps are not just a “drop in the ocean.”

They have made, and will continue to make, a significant impact on Americans’ ability to afford the energy products that fuel their lives and livelihoods.

Jen Psaki says there’s around 9,000 oil and gas leases that aren’t being used right now. That’s probably true. Here’s a little insight to developing a lease though. Access roads must be built. Requires a permit. Export pipelines must be laid. Requires a permit. Seismic imaging must be done to determine the depths and best placement of wells. Requires a permit. The surface must be prepared to construct the drilling pad area with ponds for mud and water. Requires a permit. Drilling equipment must be brought to the lease. Requires a permit. Finally, the wells can be bored. Requires a permit.
Without the permits, having a lease is useless.",t2_39k1epq4,DadOnGames,0,1646952936.0,0,t1_i063a2c,i063a2c,True,junieteajones,t3_tbaupp,https://www.reddit.com/r/america/comments/tbaupp/duh/,Duh!,/r/america/comments/tbaupp/duh/i063a2c/,10,r/america,2,10

"I would say that many western countries have a great admiration for the grandness of the Roman Empire. Many still learning Latin. The motto of our country “E Plurbis Unum” being Latin for Out Of Many, One. And the Marine’s famous motto Semper Fi is Latin from Always Faithful.

"Well, as far as I know Foedus as a word gained some negative connotation too, throughout Roman history. 

Essentially the Roman Empire consisted out of the city of Rome, and it's provinces, be it imperial or senatorial. Those together would be called the Federation, or in Latin the Foedus. With the splitting and later falling of the Western Roman Empire, among Europeans that used to be a part of the Western Roman Empire, the word foedus, for what I know, gained some shitty connotation since sentiments here, definitely among higher classes and royals, was a pretty pro-Roman one, ironically. Throughout the middle ages, royals would have this divine wish to go back to a unified Western Empire, though with ass loads of different families making claims to the throne, that only resulted in the West splitting up. It's nice to note though, now that we're going over the historics, that for instance Emperor Charles of the Holy Roman Empire specifically wanted to be crowned 'emperor' by the Roman pope, because it carried that classical 'weight'. Mind you: this was full renaissance. The west ended up being divided at some point into quite literally just wheat fields, with feodal lords of a grand total of an acre responding to the one above him, etc etc etc. That entire history, and basically the crapification of the former Western Roman Empire after it's fall, brought with it a sort of bad sentiment towards the system of the Foedus as it was in the Roman Empire. All of the above being based on my basic knowledge of Roman legal history :)

If you ask me though, as an outsider (suuuuuper Belgian), you can try and call a form of state whatever you like, somewhere along the road it's going to get a bad connotation. I sincerely believe that from the point of the United States, calling yourselves a foedus would basically just ignore a simple yet massive part of the American identity, being the English language. On the contrary, I would try to 'cleanse' the word of it's bad connotation by just educating people, and using it for only what it is, instead.

"Hi there!

I guess I'm a month old to the (tea) party, but being a European (Belgian to be specific), I wanted to shed some light onto the issue.

I reckon that first and foremost, we should get out of the way that Europeans do actually take a piss with other European countries. The Dutch will constantly laugh about the Belgians, the Belgians about the Dutch, just to give a simple example. Hell, even in our own country the north part laughs about the south part and vice versa. In that regard I reckon that your British friend might, with all due respect, not be the greatest source, as they're not in mainland Europe. To quickly counter the point about Americans never having a laugh about Canadians, I'd say: just watch a episode of South Park. Really. 

To get to the actual point you were making, however: it's ambivalent I guess. There's very few Europeans that hate the USA (we're quite dependent on you lot), as I believe there's very few Americans hating Europe. Hating, too, is worded suuuuuper strongly for something that honestly never gets to much more than some people having a laugh at a couple of American stereotypes. It's easy, obviously, but stereotypes exist for a reason, too. 

To be super clear, from my point of view, living in the country bang in the centre of Europe: there is *no* 'general', or 'wide-spread' hate towards the US of A in any shape or form. You'll find a bunch of people saying we, as European countries, should continue to grow less dependent on the United States, and you'll have some individuals laughing at stereotypes about the United States as they do about Dutch stereotypes, French stereotypes, Spanish stereotypes, ... but that's in no way, shape or form a matter of hating the United States. 

Every country has it's own down sides, it's just that the US lacks some that a lot of European countries do have, while the US have downsides in our POV, that most European countries don't have, so there's just ever so slightly more to talk about. 

That's it, I hope I could give some more insight :)",t2_6pdo5g19,GenZmusic,0,1646875316.0,0,t1_i01t5lv,i01t5lv,True,gliscornumber1,t3_rq9dcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/america/comments/rq9dcg/i_have_an_odd_american_based_confession_to_make/,I have an odd american based confession to make,/r/america/comments/rq9dcg/i_have_an_odd_american_based_confession_to_make/i01t5lv/,1,r/america,0,1

"if you are asking in good faith, it is because america has made incredibly bad decisions over the past 40 years with regard to its role in the world. The US is the sole reason that many of the world's worst dictatorships exist. It's not conspiracy stuff, it's all on record. Here's a Wikipedia page called ""[United States involvement in regime change](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change&ved=2ahUKEwj1386AwK72AhXxkIkEHYJsBKQQFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0V7RRFTAocxRWErcatatWB)"". 

Between political assassination of foreign politicians, coups that oust democratically elected leaders and replace them with military dictators, and allowing corporations to plunder developing nations for resources and capitalize on their labor, the US has not been a force for good in the world for a while. 

Now we can talk about why that is. In my view, no country would be able to handle the pressure of the cold war and come out well. America succumbed to dark forces because it was facing a serious threat. Stalin was no joke. There's a Hitler line about how authoritarian governments are great because free societies must become authoritarian to fight them.

"It seems to me like your only understanding of America is the America you learned about in history class at school. The school only teaches you the good stuff that makes America look good, when in reality, America is full of terrorists. 

You don't think we are ""capable"" of killing civilians? It happens All. The. Time. Cops come in to shoot at unarmed protestors left and right. And those are our OWN civilians. 
Oh, and the one that you definitely did hear about in school if you were paying attention.... Hiroshima? Nagasaki? Ring a bell? And those are just 2 instances of the hundreds (likely even thousands) of instances that we have bombed civilians.

Nukes do not discriminate, my friend. They don't only kill the ""bad guys."" They flatten entire cities. They kill innocent people. They kill babies. They kill children. They kill the elderly. They kill women and men who had nothing to do with the war. They kill local wildlife, and make the area radioactive and completely uninhabitable.

The fact that you think these are ""conspiracy theories"" is insane to me. It takes 2 seconds to Google search and see all of the finer details you missed in your high school history class.

"It’s long been a symbol for Americanism. This idea of a balance between Unity and Individuality. “Freedom from Anarchy, Freedom from Tyranny.”

I’d like the make the symbol more relevant again in our culture. However, i’m worried calling it a Fasces will cause some people to freak out cause their low IQ and will immediately associate it with fascism which is not a far stretch. However, fasces doesn’t really get the full picture across anyways. A fasces is a bundle of sticks bound to an axe to represent unity and authority. It does not necessarily include anything about an olive branch which is it’s opposite representing peace and freedom. 

I feel the duality of these two ideas together needs a new word. Because saying “a Fasces wrapped in an Olive Garland” isn’t very casual.

I propose “Foedus” which is Latin for Pact, Covenant or League. Which we are in the Colonies or States, we are a United people. A Foedus Populi. So it seems to me that this word would differentiate our American symbol from that of an ancient fasces.

"Literally thinking one side is right 100% of the time is what’s wrong… you both are completely wrong Republicans and Democrats both fucking suck they are two cheeks to the same ass

What has Biden done? His economy is surging? No it’s recovering from the pandemic an economic recovery and a booming economy are two very different fucking things… he left 80 fucking billion dollars of the best military equipment ever made in the hands of the Taliban… he continues to impose mandates while illegal migrants pour across borders with 0 health screening (hypocritical much?) Is inflation a good thing? Because I sure as fuck don’t think it is and I’m paying more for gas, food, clothes, tens of thousands more on a house that’s not going to be worth that much in 5 years all with good ole you ain’t black if you don’t vote for me Joe. Btw the whole racist diatribe bullshit needs to stop especially since Biden and the Clintons (Democrat demigods) would suck David Duke ( a fucking KKK grand wizard) off for his endorsement.

I’m not gonna write paragraphs for the other side but they suck too with the whole remaining socially conservative in 2022 BS, and acting like every democrat is a communist I didn’t vote Don Juan either time (libertarian) but I absolutely loathe the whole holier than thou superiority complex some on the left have it’s ridiculous.

Like you really just want one side in complete power? How would that be productive at all? How would alienating hundreds of millions of people and their ideals be a good thing in the slightest bit? The right has plenty of good ideas and plenty of bad ideas and guess what the left has plenty of good and bad ones as well, the ability to compromise and make the best of both worlds is what we need to do not alienate one side or the other because of tribal politics.",t2_2os2y0fp,Substantial_Bet5764,0,1646027598.0,0,t1_hyqukwh,hyqukwh,False,maztabaetz,t3_rvw2ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/america/comments/rvw2ci/the_next_us_civil_war_is_already_here_we_just/,The next US civil war is already here – we just refuse to see it,/r/america/comments/rvw2ci/the_next_us_civil_war_is_already_here_we_just/hyqukwh/,1,r/america,0,1

I’m free to make as much money as I want, buy as much stupid shit as I want, and the government (although they are trying harder) can’t tell me shit and I love the freedom of that.

I love being able to shoot my guns, I love how I get paid for the amount of work I do (if I work harder I get paid more than lazy people not the same) and I just love being HERE that’s about it.

Sure do the rich folks get away with more than I can, of course they do, but that literally happens everywhere and no it’s not fair but life’s unfair so you just gotta get used to it.

While your point is true there are ways other than dirrect conflict that can end this war. And as we are seeing a fair few of the Russian soldiers are defecting in the middle of the battlefront. If a single nuke Flys all of them will. And as far as military development goes nukes are their only edge over the use (if their bluff is actually legit.)

"Marketplace plans make you eligible for a subsidy unless you’ve declined an employer plan or Medicaid. That subsidy is based on a percentage of your income. So if we take that $280 as an average, understanding that it’s probably not going to be your AGI, then you should qualify for a subsidy of about $400. For a Silver level plan that should leave you with a monthly premium of $0 based on the national average or up to around $50-$100 a month for a gold plan. Though a silver plan may be eligible for a cost sharing reduction that would lower your copays & deductibles. The questions are: did you apply for the subsidy? What state do you live in? And what type of plan did you try to enroll in?
