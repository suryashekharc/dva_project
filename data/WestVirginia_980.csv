"I agree that raw milk should be legal to sell as long as it's labeled properly and that most people should be fine drinking it. But pasteurization exists for a reason: a small chance multiplied by hundreds of millions of people results in an unnecessary amount of sickness and death.

The *main* draw to raw milk is better taste (that's the inherent trade-off in pasteurization). Yes, heating can change nutrition and availability of probiotics, but pointing that out is very different from establishing quantifiable health differences solely between drinking pasteurized milk and raw milk.

It's like drinking kombucha for health reasons. People love to throw around 'gut biome' as if it's anywhere close to being well understood, and maybe there are some benefits to drinking it, but it's the forest for the trees in a country that's mostly overweight/obese and getting little exercise.",t2_4o0ct,MashedPaturtles,0,1648272249.0,0,t1_i25taga,i25taga,False,BenightedAppendicle,t3_tob17r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/tob17r/west_virginia_state_rep_pat_mcgheehan_fallen_ill/,West Virginia State Rep.

"We've been using the Oliverio's hot peppers in my home ever since my uncle who made them at home passed away.

Our favorite and most frequently made dish is as follows.

Slice up several large yellow potatoes medium thin, give them a quick hard saute' in a pot til the edges just start to go translucent. Dump in a large jar, or 2-3 small jars of hot peppers. Fill the now empty jar about half full of water and dump that in too. Add red pepper flakes (however much you like), 3-4 cloves of mashed garlic, couple pinches of parsley, a few turns of cracked black pepper, a pinch of salt. Stir, cover, simmer till potatoes are soft all the way through and sauce re-thickens. Stirring very gently to avoid breaking up potatoes, every few minutes while simmering.

When potatoes are done, uncover and let stand 5-10 minutes to cool and thicken a bit more. Plate, drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Serve with warm 'Tally bread and butter.

This was a recipe I got from my Nonna. I've been eating it my whole life, but I'd say my family has been making this for easily 60-70 years. I just made some for dinner this past Friday, and the leftovers were gone by Sunday morning. It's delicious and I can't recommend it enough.

"Typically 3 crosses represents the trinity; the son (Jesus), the father (God), and the holy ghost. But they also represent Jesus's crucifixion, because on that day there was him and 2 other guys with him being crucified.

He basically wanted people to remember that Jesus died for our sins that he would be returning as the prophecy foretold in the Bible.

For the record I am agnostic. But I have I have studied many religions - it's probably why I am agnostic because I believe every religion holds a piece of the truth and not a single one is the absolute or correct. I don't attend church, I live my life and respect other people's views or beliefs. Coffindaffer was expressing his - so when you see those crosses remember he is not imposing his religion on you, he is expressing his faith in this country.

"You can eat the fish in most areas, just not a lot of it.  And choose the smaller and younger ones while spacing out your meals. Some people are not comfortable with that and that is OK too, catch and release only makes the fishing better.

"First thing to get money flowing in: stop being a grifting social conservative shithole of a state 100% focused on culture war nonsense. Since that isn't happening for another few decades at minimum, if ever, there is never going to be a major investment into WV from the private sector. As long as grifting remains the #1 priority of elected officials in this state, no one outside of Dollar General is going to put major dollars into anything in this state, let alone industries or tourism. This state has to rethink its priorities from the ground up.

Second thing to get money flowing in: improve infrastructure tenfold. Nobody likes dodging 1,000 potholes and driving windy roads for 4 hours to get 100 miles. Also nothing is going to locate here so long as the dominant internet is Frontier 3MB ""high speed"" internet. Money is being dumped hand over fist into this for minimal improvement, which gets back to grifting. Let's not even get into water and sanitary sewer limitations for large scale development.

Third thing to get money flowing in: NOT GIVING AWAY PUBLIC FUCKING LAND FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPERS. Most of this state is gobbled up by land companies from the days of George Washington. And fun note, almost all of our parks sit right next to these kinds of lands. Start getting that land out from under resource extractors and into developer's hands, then all of a sudden we aren't sacrificing things people have spent over a century trying to preserve for the sake of a few pennies on the dollar from some grifter to put minimal dollars in and pay nothing other than minuscule property taxes even after development. If the Boy Scouts paid a dime in taxes, they would be a prime example of investing in private lands, not taking away public lands.

God forbid rich people build homes on our manmade lake.  I know the states history and far more importantly I know it’s current state and most likely future.  Every other year we hear some big plant is going to be built and then after a few years we find out it’s not going to happen.  More people leave and the place gets poorer and more desperate.  You don’t have the first freaking clue of anything to do to actually draw people and their money here.  Somehow people are under the illusion that trail hikers and one day river trips are enough for our tourism to pick up.  Tourism did increase last year after four years of decline.  Whoopi back to neutral.  Most of that was in the panhandles and that evil rich people money from DC and Pittsburgh.  I hate to tell you but we aren’t fixing our issues without outside money.  You still haven’t posted one thing we can do other than this to draw or keep people here.

"I used to work for the State Park Service, only a temporary summer job, so my knowledge is limited, but I did learn a few things. To me, this seems to be a bit of a shot in the foot for West Virginia. During my time working for the parks, I learned that the big parks, like Watoga, which my boss's smaller park was under, make a lot of money for the state. I would feel like contracting bits of state ownership out to private companies, particularly the renting of cabins and camping spots, would strip the State Park Service of so many vital funds. I understand the sentiment of wanting to encourage investment in the state, I'm just not sure if this is the right way of doing it.

Also, I'd like to point out this line, quoted from Angie Rosser, someone campaigning against this measure, ""lawmakers are interested in opening privatization of activities like casinos, like amusement parks."" Most of our parks are centered around natural areas, it would seem that building casinos and amusement parks kinda contradicts the whole purpose of the park being in a natural area.

"Let's be clear - this bill isn't (and never was) about selling state land.  It's about building privately-owned ""recreational, lodging, and ancillary"" facilities in state parks and forests, with eventual transfer of ownership to the state.  The model for this is what the state has done at Stonewall Jackson State Park.  The bill just extends the state's ability to do this, in time and in breadth.

In my opinion, the bill gives the Director of the DNR too much authority with insufficient oversight and counterweight.  It extends what was previously allowed only at Chief Logan, Beech Fork, Tomlinson Run, Stonewall Jackson Lake, Lost River, and Canaan Valley Resort State Parks to all of the state's parks and forests.",t2_auept4k6,SheriffRoscoe,0,1647957731.0,0,t1_i1nu9rl,i1nu9rl,True,Slash3040,t3_tk038m,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/tk038m/wv_bill_would_allow_privatization_of_state_parks/,WV bill would allow privatization of state parks,/r/WestVirginia/comments/tk038m/wv_bill_would_allow_privatization_of_state_parks/i1nu9rl/,16,r/WestVirginia,0,16

"I've only ever been to Morgantown and Wheeling, and the surrounding towns to there, but here's my two cents:   


Favorite: The natural beauty, the being surrounded by grassy hills on all sides. At least great hikes and swimming holes near Morgantown. Great history of struggle among the working class there, some of which still remains in many's hearts and minds.   


Least favorite: The crushing poverty, low wages, and disinvestment from the area. When I was briefly a social work intern at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh we saw a 200% increase in patients from the Ohio River Valley section of Virginia because of hospital closures and general length of appointment times for care. Much of this can of course be attributed to the fact that Gov. Justice and his lackeys are tied to mining companies that are increasingly displacing the amount of workers necessary per tonnage of coal through new tech and methods of production which are harmful for the environment, that continue to allow them to operate without much tax liabilities and regulation, leaving local and state government without the funding base to support education and health care.",t2_g2fta,Tsjr1704,0,1647879596.0,0,t1_i1joenu,i1joenu,True,CRL1999,t3_tir3ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/tir3ln/what_is_your_favourite_and_least_favourite_thing/,What is your favourite and least favourite thing about WV?,/r/WestVirginia/comments/tir3ln/what_is_your_favourite_and_least_favourite_thing/i1joenu/,1,r/WestVirginia,0,1

"Why exactly not tap into our own oil reserves? I know the whole environmental impacts. But think about it this way. Due to the Ukraine stuff oil is now through the roof.

It's not like china and Russia are known for their outstanding  environmental causes lol. 

The entire idea to close ours and just import it to save the environment is dumb anyway. Why not use our reserves, regulate the process more to be safer and more environmentally safe instead of buying it from countries we know couldn't care less. Or is it just one of those out of sight out of mind things ? Lol  because maybe you know this. But **we are all stuck on this earth** so if u just let China or Russia ruin the world it's still ruined. Why ? Why are we paying them for something that will ruin our climate and environment ?

"My favorite thing about WV is... well, it's my hometown. I grew up here, graduated high school here, had my first love here... the Northern Panhandle of WV has treated me well. I moved back here around 7 months ago from East Tennessee (where I've been the past two years), and I anticipated that moving back here was going to be exciting, full of life, and a place for me to grow as a young adult. 

Which leads me to my least favorite thing... from what I can say about the Northern Panhandle, it's the fact that there is basically nothing here. I am right on the cusp of Ohio and Pennsylvania. It's about an hour's drive to Pittsburgh, and a good bit away from anything worth mentioning in Ohio. 

I thought moving back here was going to be one of the best things I could have ever done for myself, but it's turned out to be one of the worst. I regret ever moving back to this part of the state; things aren't the same as they were four years ago when I graduated high school.

"If you are near Canaan Valley would check this place out. We are not originally from WV but have lived here for 13 years now and love it. We don't love far from this outfitter but only discovered this place last summer. My kids are little older and the gal that owns this business rents standup paddle boards and Kayaks for $25 for pretty much as long as you want to use in a day. Her company does float trips and some whitewater stuff too. Floating the Cheat River, a completely wild river, is fantasticly chill. She even rents float coolers so you can tow a picnic along with you. The water is deep in places but crystal clear, no agriculture anywhere along it's path. Then you can go up the Mountain to stay at the newly renovated lodge at Blackwater Falls. Cabins are great there, lots of nice short hikes for kids of that age, petting zoo, etc. Better book now if you want a cabin. I have lived all over the US but WV is by far the best place. We chose to stay here over a paid company transfer to Colorado. You can't go wrong anywhere in the Eastern Mountain Counties. Just drive around and explore, people are super friendly and it's 100% genuine. Place is truly a hidden gem. Here is link to outfitter.

"“You don’t matter to me whatsoever.”

Pro narcissism!

Personally, I tend to care about internet strangers, even when they’re toxic. I tend to wish they felt better and didn’t buy into so much nonsense, but that’s just me.

I say the same thing because I know where I stand. Or what, should I make up new answers I don’t even believe in, to be a narcissist or troll or something? I have nothing more to say than what I see. It’ll always be the same except when I see something new and evolve my perspective.

You know someone who did flip-flip though, making up answers for whatever best suited them? Hillary Clinton. I remember when she rejected gay marriage, but later supported it, because it was gaining popularity. There’s a difference between evolving your perspective, and being spineless and bending with the wind for whatever will keep you in power. Clinton is the biggest thing that broke Liberalism’s stronghold on me. Maybe if she hadn’t been around, I’d still be beholden and voting for Biden. Who knows.

Edit: Also, the whole “you don’t matter to me at all” is a precise narcissistic tactic. It’s a way for you to defend yourself in your head instead of confronting your behavior and hatred. If I don’t matter to you (and if my existence or perspective doesn’t even matter in general), then your hatred, categorizations, and generalizations seem logical and justifiable. You get to treat me or view me however you want, because I and my experiences and perspectives aren’t valid and don’t matter. How very xonvenient for you!

Like I said somewhere, narcissism ain’t original. You’re behaving like any other narcissist. (Which is also precisely what you’re projecting onto me, that I’m just like any other Conservative, even though I’ve already presented differing viewpoints — but you can’t acknowledge them, because it would fracture your superiority complex of being 100% right even if you’re not.)

Thankfully narcissism is not a terminal mental illness IMO, so I hope someday you get better.

Edit 2: oh yeah, Russia is aggressive. Again, I didn’t imply otherwise. I’m only pointing out that America/NATO isn’t perfect or angelic or innocent in this situation. NATO’s progression is a form of aggression. It doesn’t justify Putin’s aggression; it’s just a contributing factor. Like I again said somewhere, Putin’s aggression is innately part of him, and things like Ukraine independence or NATO encroachment are just triggers for him to be more of himself.

I think you all just don’t know how to divorce yourselves from taking sides in order to see all parts clearly. NATO isn’t innocent just because it’s not Putin. Putin isn’t justified just because NATO betrayed him. Etc. These toxic leaders are playing chess with us as the pawns. I’m not anyone’s pawn. You’ll see things differently when you stop being Biden’s/America‘a/Democrats’/Liberalism’s/NATO’s pawn.

All the matters is protecting innocence with dignity.

"I explained in my other post how it’s not typical warmongering. Liberals/Democrats always hold the “right, kind view” on the surface while instigating things behind the scenes. (Or in the case of hating Trump, also throwing Russia under the bus in plain view. You think Putin found Democratic Trump-Era Russia-bashing flattering?)

Putin is an overt warmonger.

Biden et al instigate war in other ways. Like I said, it’s not overt/superficial. With the way they behaved during Trump, it’s a self-fulfilling prophesy are this point. Biden’s so lucky Russia attacked Ukraine too, it’s exactly what he needed for his horrendous poll numbers. Now everyone will forget Afghanistan and applaud him as a hero!

For anyone who watched House of Cards, you might remember how Frank threw Russia under the bus and pushed things to the brink of nuclear war, just to win an election. Remember, Frank Underwood is a Democrat! That show gives us an idea of how some of these top-tier Democrats behave. Obama even remarked it as similar to DC.

On another point, while Biden was calling Putin a tyrant or dictator or whatever the other day, I saw that the Kremlin refused to respond and mocked his comments as “irritable.” That emphasized for me how stupid and reckless Biden is.

"Biden & Friends have been “RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA!” for years. They need an enemy to exist. They hate Russia (xenophobic much?) and don’t care about poking the Russian bear, such as with NATO expansion. Now the bear has woken up and they scream “look, the bear is evil like we said!”

Except it was mostly a sleeping bear before they encroached on its territory.

Liberals don’t warmonger in a typical outright way, like Conservatives or Far Right might. It’s more of a “they're evil and we’re angelic, we’re always right and they’re always wrong, look, their behavior [which our conceit contributed to] proves it!”

I used to be Liberal. I understand its hatred and recklessness from the inside out. I am not Conservative because I always saw through its nonsense.

"Speculation does come into play but this was coming one way or another.   
I don't think its one single thing. A mix of inflation, speculation, a small bit from Russian oil.

Biden certainly hasn't helped since he got in. While his executive actions have done little to the oil industry directly, it signaled the oil industry to hold up or face possible consequences. They have severely cut drilling and fracking. Everyone is afraid to be caught with a ton of investments out and suddenly getting the rug pulled from under them by the white house. Production is behind, it hasn't grown with the post covid demand. It likely won't get better for years. In my area all oil work aside from legacy jobs like compressor stations and water bottles has moved on. Now what little is left is up in PA. I think Antero might do three fracks for the entire year. A few years ago it was 12.

"Grandma!

We had to set her loose. See, she was suffering from dementia. She was living with us for a while because the retirement home would not keep her any more ever since she kept gathering acorns and shrubberies in her hair, and at one point she had an actual birds nest on her head; she would yell ""the Raven's of Satan are comin' for Yee!"" and would cackle at the other retirees. She refused to cut her nails for like a decade because ""them's squirrels gonna get my 'corns"" she would say. Eventually we put her in the back of the pick up and droved her out to Grant County and set her loose. She did not want to go at first, so we took some logs wrapped in old sheets, dipped them in gasoline, lit them on fire and just waved her off. I was only 10 at the time and was sorry for her to go, but we sold her jewelry  to pay for a still which keeps our family business afloat.",t2_ivgrza8v,CosetteGrey,0,1647632028.0,0,t1_i16xuk9,i16xuk9,True,langleyeffect,t3_th3nm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/th3nm0/my_artistic_interpretation_of_the_flatwoods/,"My artistic interpretation of the Flatwoods Monster, a creature reportedly seen in West Virginia decades ago, Created with pen & ink.",/r/WestVirginia/comments/th3nm0/my_artistic_interpretation_of_the_flatwoods/i16xuk9/,3,r/WestVirginia,0,3
