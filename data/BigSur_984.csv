"Hello, Avtonom,

Indeed, knew him very well from over a summer in perhaps 1974, working with him and Wesley Bunniger, a stone mason talented beyond belief. You were a bit older than Wesley's baby Strider, but still very young then. Yuri told me your name meant a soul who was a free man, with no country owning him.  : )

I sent you a friend request on Facebook some time ago. Would be happy to chat sometime. Lost touch with Yuri many years ago when I moved to Colorado. You all were living in the 'bandit house' back then, with no official address, and no phone number. That was necessary then, as being the son of the most beloved man in Russian history, whom Stalin assassinated out of jealousy, would have been considered a political threat to any leader of Russia, where lineage is a very big thing, and the KGB would have made sure he disappeared, too, just to be safe. You, too, even as a child, back then, would have been considered a threat.

One piece of trivia for you.. after that summer, I moved back to the Bay area, and briefly dated a graphic artist, marketing oriented lady, whose studio was above a three car garage in Menlo Park, and her partner and she were incredibly talented, and doing some incredible slogans and art for the silicon valley companies. I had taken her out to dinner one night and told her a story about Yuri and Wesley and my summer with them, and how he inspired me to start my own furniture company. I had come back from a hike to Pear Valley on a Sunday, and he and Wesley were working on Jack Downing's house, madly trying to finish a porch, to be 'floating,' before Jack got there on Tuesday. They were frustrated and couldn't come up with a solution. He said, 'c'mon, you're young, brilliant, and you should be able to figure this out! Prosto dilli, not sure about the spelling. I said, what did you say? Yuri said, 'Just Do It!' He then explained that was a Russian farmer's slogan your grandmother taught him, where you think about what you have for materials, what tools you have to work with, and you use your mind, then, you just do it.

Yuri got me an 'apprenticeship' with Morris Shepherd (who did all of Neil Young's custom furniture), but then after Morris agreed, he then talked me out of it, saying, Prosto dilley!, you're smart, you need to follow your own path, come up with your own designs, and I know you can do it without first spending seven years as Morris' serf. So, I did, and ended up with a furniture company with eight employees. Yuri was the inspiration for all of that.The lady then took me to her studio to show me some of her work, which was amazing, beautiful and jawdropping! As I was looking around the room, she saw my eyes stop briefly on an 8-1/2"" x 11"" piece of paper thumbtacked to the centerpost in the middle of the room, that had a very simple outline on it, with some rainbow stripes. She said, 'oh, that is a logo my partner is doing for two Stanford college kids that are working on something they call a personal computer. They wanted a simple logo of an apple, so she did that, then one of them, with a really funny name, Steve Jobs ‚Äî who has a name like Jobs? ‚Äî comes back and wants a rainbow going through it, so she did that, and then he comes back and wants it to have a bite taken out of it. So she did that, and this is the final drawing of it. That was the original Apple with rainbow and bite taken out of it logo. : )She had been dating another guy, and they ended up tying the knot. But about six months later, while driving up Highway 101, all of a sudden there were 'Just Do It!' Nike ads on all the billboards. Major campaign! And I thought, yay, she ran with the idea! There's Yuri!  : )

Btw, I never bought the Nike story about the director of marketing saying that He got the idea from a news story where the prisoner was saying something like that on the way to his execution. The prisoner didn't even use the same exact wording. And that story was certainly less than inspirational. I've had my own ideas stolen, and I can easily imagine either they did that, or the lady signed a non-disclosure as to the true source.. they wouldn't have ever been able to say the phrase was a Russian farmer slogan. President Reagan's phrase, 'Trust, but verify' was actually a Russian folk phrase that his aide told him about to help with negotiating with Gorbachev around nuclear disarmament inspections.

So, whenever you are feeling like your mojo is lacking, feeling frustrated about not being able to get something done, remember Yuri, and Just Do It! I hope he is still alive, painting, sculpting, building, and philosophizing about life and societies.

Happy that Yuri and your grandmother were given refuge in the U.S. and were able to escape Stalin. As you can tell from all the latest news, you are very lucky you weren't born in Russia.

Cheers!Michael

P.s. do you remember the swing out the back to the huge treehouse Yuri built? Kind of scary swinging out over the canyon to it, but was majorly cool! Remember the big 'tree crutch' your Dad built to keep a big tree branch from getting down too low over the road to Pfeifer Beach from Route 1? Remember the ironing board with a shirt and iron on it, plugged into a tree, down in the canyon? Remember all the wild boar? Remember Yuri's bumper sculpture of the huge Russian Knight with sword and shield? Remember how your mom was always such a great hostess to guests, and fantastic cook? Remember Shelly Downing, Tony Potter and Tim Carpenter? The Nepenthe's astrology / full moon birthday parties? Al Jardeen of the Beach Boys and his Arabian horses down the hill?

Secluded in summer will be hard but you will be able to find places that will provide moments of solitude as long as you dont pick the popular spots

I proposed to my wife in front of Limekiln falls, we got on the trail early Morning and there wasnt many people up yet, got to the falls and only one other couple was there. They left and it was just us and it worked perfect.

There are so many spots like this its just a matter of some patience on some of them to get some time secluded to yourselves

If a turn out is all you need geez there are tons. The obvious big ones will be busy if you are later in the day but there are quite a few that wont have anyone

Also going up North into Garrapata and the bluffs can provide some nice spots with amazing views",t2_6l4hw23z,PsychonautDad,0,1646414302.0,0,t1_hzc7r6v,hzc7r6v,True,Ghostaccount24,t3_t6l15n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigSur/comments/t6l15n/help_searching_for_a_proposal_location/,Help!

"I've never been closer with neighbors than I am in Big Sur, but it took a few years of being open and kind before some people let their guard down. Once people know your face and realize you're not just passing through, they'll treat you like family.  

You'll get used to the road and soon won't find it scary, even at night. The trick is to not get so used to it that you take safety for granted. No matter how good a driver you are, most of the other people on the road are driving this highway for the first time, and you can't control their behavior.  

Other thoughts: get to know the hiking trails, beaches, swimming holes, and roadside hangouts. There's not a lot to do here if you don't enjoy the outdoors, and it's easy to fall into the trap of hanging out at the bar all day just to socialize.  
Make friends with your coworkers/housemates, it'll ease your transition a lot (since you have a job and housing, I'm assuming you're gonna work and live at one of the hotels or restaurants). Then take every opportunity to make friends outside that circle, so you can integrate quickly and feel welcome.

"Update: Sunday, January 23, 2022 11:50 AM
Dear Community,
Per Chief Harris, Big Sur Fire:
Highway 1 remains closed, and is anticipated to remain closed through Monday, January 24, 2022, with IC continually evaluating conditions and opportunities to restore access. Initial planning is for a convoy system for vendors and residents as early as Monday evening, January 24, 2022.
Given uncertain nature of conditions, Monday evening convoy is not to be relied upon, but by Tuesday, January 25, 2022, convoy(s) will hopefully be in place for mid day and early evening access. Additionally, strong push to re-open highway to the public as well, though convoy(s) at this time are intended initially for business/community re-supply/access purposes.
Overall fire conditions are improving and there are substantial resources assigned to this fire.
On power front, PG&E is expected to re-energize Big Sur area by 1:00 PM today.
Please note that while I am attributing above to Chief Harris, this is a summary of our phone conversation earlier today and any errors or misstatements are solely my responsibility.

"How long do you have for a hike? There is the Andrew Molera State Park that has two trails called the Ridge Trail and Bluff Trail that you can either take both as an 8-mile loop (~3-3.5 hours) or do one or the other to save time. Ridge Trail has great views of the mountains and takes you through some redwoods, Bluff Trail is right on the coast. Check it out on the All Trails app. There is also a path that goes to the beach if you‚Äôre looking to keep it convenient but there are better beaches if you have time.

Big Sur- Napenthe is a great restaurant, and I always stop at Fernwood for some ice cream. Check out the river inn in big sur too. The main thing is the hiking- Point Lobos, garrapata, limekiln, are my top three favorites in big sur. 

Monterey- Alvarado street is great to walk around on and it's right next to the bike path (walking or biking) which has great views. Crepes of Brittany is over there and their food is SO good.

If you are in Monterey and you absolutely must get to Ragged Point you can drive south on 101 then drive up and over the mountains in the Atascadero/Paso Robles region (I forget the exact highway) and that will take you from 101 to 1 on the south side.

All the closures are just south of Big Sur (even though Ragged Point likes to call themselves the ""gateway"" or ""beginning"" of Big Sur).

‚ÄúSince the natural hot springs at Sykes are in federally designated Wilderness and within a protected Wild & Scenic River corridor, the tubs that were built downstream from Sykes Camp were illegal impoundments. Unauthorized structures are inconsistent with the Wilderness character of the region. They provided an ""attractive nuisance"" that drained limited management resources due to the need for repeated visitor education, enforcement of fire restrictions, and the constant clean-up of trash and abandoned gear. For these reasons, ‚ÄúSykes Hot Springs‚Äù needs to become nothing more than a distant memory.

"Where are you staying? Nepenthe is about 1 hour drive south of the Aquarium. It will likely take you even longer than that to drive there if you want to enjoy the drive and pull over to let locals pass you. 

Point Lobos is all the way back in town about 45 minutes north of Nepenthe near Carmel. It seems to me like you should make some adjustments to the order of things so you are not going back and forth. Point Lobos is extremely busy so I would recommend getting there early so you can get in. Parking on the highway and walking in can get a little crazy when there are tons of people.

The thing that people forget is that Big Sur is HUGE. If you want to enjoy it then you need to give sufficient time. Soberanes is a full day worth of exploring and hiking. 

I would honestly skip Pfeiffer Beach as it is way over crowded. (though if you can get in when it is slow then it is worth it) Keep in mind you cannot walk to the beach anymore you must drive in and they control access very carefully to keep it safe for residents. 

Big Sur River Gorge is going to be very cold this time of year and the main reason to go there is to swim in the river, you might want to do the waterfall walk or the overlook hike in Pfeiffer State Park instead. There are lots of great walks inside Pfeiffer State Park.

The beach at JP Burns is NEVER accessible it is down a steep cliff and many people have died or needed to be rescued trying to get down to it. There is a simple trail to an overlook where you can look at the beach/waterfall though I don't know if that trail is open right now.

McWay Falls is inside JP Burns and it is a beautiful park worth exploring just make sure you park inside the park and not on the highway.

I would organize all of your visits and stuff you want to do either from south to north (if you are staying in Big Sur) or north to south if you are staying in carmel/monterey.",t2_1g0s8xe7,zoobernut,0,1637263838.0,0,t1_hl5pspu,hl5pspu,True,soldbydianavo,t3_qwio6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigSur/comments/qwio6v/week_long_trip_to_bay_area_did_i_miss_anything/,"Week long trip to Bay Area, Did I miss anything?",/r/BigSur/comments/qwio6v/week_long_trip_to_bay_area_did_i_miss_anything/hl5pspu/,1,r/BigSur,0,1

I would pick up lunch at the Deli or at River Inn and skip Nepenthe. Also skip Pfeiffer Beach. Drive south to McWay falls and take a look then there are some amazing hikes along the highway that you can look up that will be less crowded and are just as amazing as the hikes to the north. Either that or go to the creamery meadow hike spend some time on the beach then drive north from there to point lobos. Honestly the main thing I would recommend is either going north or south but not the back and forth you are going to spend a lot of your day driving rather than hiking and enjoying yourself. If you go North you could do Creamery Meadow and picnic at the end of that walk then drive north to point lobos. Keep in mind Big Sur is huge far bigger than people realize and everything is fairly far apart think 20-30 minutes drive. Also Molera (where creamery meadow is) is a huge park and very beautiful. You could get a picnic lunch and then spend the entire day exploring just that area. Don't rush around and try to see too much spend more time in one area really getting to know it. You can always come back again to experience other areas. Also if you walk past the creamery meadow to the beach and up the bluff trail or up the ridge trail you will get very dramatic ocean views.,t2_1g0s8xe7,zoobernut,0,1630469086.0,0,t1_hb5bpqc,hb5bpqc,True,Jacksonjams,t3_pfji43,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigSur/comments/pfji43/advice_for_this_ldw_friday/,Advice for this LDW Friday,/r/BigSur/comments/pfji43/advice_for_this_ldw_friday/hb5bpqc/,3,r/BigSur,0,3

*SOUTH OF LIMEKILN STATE PARK*  
  
*MONTEREY COUNTY ‚Äì A project to replace a culvert and repair erosion on Highway 1 south of Limekiln State Park will result in long term one-way traffic control beginning Monday August 23.*  
  
*The construction project on Highway 1 on the Big Sur Coast is located at Post Mile 20.4. This is approximately .36 miles south of Limekiln State Park and 1.4 miles north of Kirk Creek Campground. The project location is popularly known as Lucia Fountain.*  
  
*Construction operations will commence Monday August 23 at 7 am.*  
  
*One-way traffic control will be in effect Monday thru Friday from 7 am to 7 pm.*  
  
*Travelers can expect delays of 10 to 15 minutes.*  
  
*Message and directional signs will be in place to assist travelers. Please allow extra time for your travel through the area.*  
  
*Work is scheduled to be completed, weather permitting, by the end of November 2021.*  
  
*The network of culverts that lace Highway 1 on the Big Sur Coast serve as critical infrastructure to keep water and debris off the roadway during winter weather. Maintaining the integrity of culverts and erosion repair efforts contribute to the resiliency of the roadway during inclement conditions.*  
  
*This $750,000 project is being performed by Serafix Engineering of Santa Rosa, CA.*  
  
*Caltrans reminds motorists to move over and slow down when driving through highway work zones.*

"Real talk, your itinerary isn‚Äôt possible in a day, but everyone here has already touched on that. Coming from someone who has been to Big Sur countless times, here‚Äôs what I think you should do.

Forget Point Lobos. It will totally stunt your flow and technically isn‚Äôt even Big Sur. However It‚Äôs really close to your hotel, so save that venture for your second day exploring Monterey (There‚Äôs very little to do in Monterey anyway)

Forget Limekiln. Limekiln is my absolute favorite spot however it‚Äôs too far south and the trails are still closed due to the Dolan fires. 
So unless you‚Äôre already camping there, it isn‚Äôt worth the $10 day use fee just for some beach access.

"From Bixby to Limekiln is just over an hour of driving, nonstop. And it‚Äôs an hour back also. Just based on stopping , parking, etc you‚Äôve got about 4 hours of driving here. Maybe more.

That is way more than a single day and if you do pack it into a single day then you won‚Äôt really enjoy anything individually very much. Honestly I would skip Bixby and Pfeiffer as they are over crowded and overrated. Also point lobos is really far north and only 10 minutes from Carmel so do that in a different day. Also Lime Kiln is at the far south so you can‚Äôt really drive down there and then back up.

"This is a 2-day itinerary jumbled together, I guess that can work if all goes well. No way that is one day, especially in that order. 

&#x200B;

* Must leave early to beat tourist traffic, lately no guarantee the sun will be out near the Peninsula, better chance further south.
* You won't get into Pt Lobos if you wait til noon without walking in, so that's 2-3 hours there easy. Still 1-2 hrs if you can get in at opening unless you just stay 2 minutes for a gram and move on (whyyyyyy).
* There is no guarantee of sunset this time of year, so if you are clear somewhere around 7 PM just hang out and take your chance - no guarantee it will be clear tomorrow or up the road (especially closer to the Peninsula). 
* No guarantee you can drop in and do Nepenthe - last two times we drove past it was very busy and tourists all over the place stopped in the middle of the road and u-turns and general chaos. Last time was this past Wednesday not long past lunchtime, and if we were hungry no way we'd have stopped and waited. Maybe plan a simple picnic with sandwiches from 5th Street Deli or Bruno's. 
* Check trails for Limekiln on the links in the banner and make sure what you want to do is doable, otherwise Plan B with Pfeiffer Big Sur or Molera. 

Bottom line: must be flexible. If something is interesting at the time, take advantage - no guarantee it will be there later.

Fortunately the trail was open and I got into the Big Sur backcountry easily and it was relatively empty. So if backpacking is a possibility for you‚Ä¶now could be a great time and there‚Äôs no quota/permit system in the Ventana Wilderness.

The area is a National Marine Sanctuary and protected - [https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/flight/mbnms.html](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/flight/mbnms.html). Wildlife can perceive a flying drone as a predator and can abandon an area and their nests. There's an example in SoCal recently where 3,000 nesting birds abandoned their eggs after a drone cashed in the area which was an Ecological Preserve.

"And in terms of what to say‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know if this is good advice but‚Ä¶Given the gravity of the hazard this may sound counterintuitive, but talk to them about something that isn‚Äôt the fire first. Get their trust and attention. Be friendly. This can be 15 seconds of small talk. State license plate; surfboard on the roof; what they‚Äôre cooking‚Ä¶

Then address the fire. If stating there‚Äôs a restriction and recounting the past couple of big fire damage/closures/involuntary manslaughters (or active fire‚Ä¶) isn‚Äôt enough, then clearly these people don‚Äôt care about the forest. What they do care about, probably, is themselves - tell them rangers are actively checking these sites and will kick them out. Tell them these are locals‚Äô driveways and if/when they drive by and see/smell a fire, they will end up with a gun in their face (best case). The rangers are receiving death threats for allowing campers (true). 

Then offer to help them put it out safely - don‚Äôt take ‚Äúoh no, we got this‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôll let it burn out‚Äù for an answer. watch them do it. Frame as if you‚Äôre being helpful and protecting them‚Ä¶(I know..). Point out that just the heat of their car could ignite this incredibly dry grass.

I‚Äôve found most people put their tale in between their legs and douse them if you‚Äôre human about 
the whole thing. People have forgotten how to be people - just talk; most people are good natured, even if incredibly stupid/reckless

If you come across dreaded idiots who refuse or are too intoxicated to care, rangers have told me the best thing to do is leave (??) as you don‚Äôt want to be around when a resident finds out - this seems like a weird answer because it‚Äôs not a sure thing, but I guess the moral of the story is 1) there are more driveways hidden back there than y‚Äôall think and 2) you‚Äôre a long way from help and residents will rightly take matters into their own hands (even though that‚Äôs an unfair, ridiculous burden)

"I deleted because it was rather fatalistic and there‚Äôs so much talk about this problem already and not a whole lot on a solution that isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúI got mine, now close it all!‚Äù I am reminded of a comment to one of Big Sur Kate‚Äôs posts from earlier in the year somewhat on this topic which read - 

‚ÄúSuch a huge spotlight, often aimed by Big Sur residents, is put on the visitors and their impact‚Ä¶ which let‚Äôs be honest, is usually no more than the eyesore of their existence. Most visitors just drive, park at some pullouts, take some selfies, and go home. Yet every one of them is looked at in disgust for being there. Many other visitors, like myself, explore the beaches, hills and backcountry and are inspired to protect the land. To truly protect it.‚Äù

I assume a lot of us fall in this latter category and, like you, are lost at how to truly help beyond a) supporting businesses or b) not coming at all. 

Anyway, the original post:

I came across several people having fires this weekend in places where it is painfully obvious they are forbidden. They all played dumb, but they knew - common sense aside, you can‚Äôt possibly miss the huge signs posted everywhere. 

I also came across people who said they knew fires weren‚Äôt allowed, but they were going to try to have one anyway‚Ä¶(they‚Äôve been taken care of)

This is why there are ‚Äúgate keepers‚Äù on this sub; this is why residents close literal gates - to defend against the masses who don‚Äôt give a sh*t because they‚Äôre just passing through and are more concerned w/ which Instagram filter to choose rather than the preservation of Big Sur‚Äôs majesty or even their ability to return - let alone the lives and livelihoods of its residents.

First, who needs to have a campfire when it‚Äôs 80+ degrees at 10pm?? Personifying their own thickness and cold bloodedness.

Second, I am not advocating for the outright closure of these areas. I was/remain heartbroken by the restrictions as nothing can compare to these sites: camping in Big Sur is a remarkably unique American experience steeped in history and mystic. I do, however, totally understand them and am shocked that some have been lifted/they are not more extreme. 

Third, the Forest Service is depressingly under-resourced and is walking an extremely difficult line. They have ONE officer who can actually hand out citations. 

Last, I imagine the would-be-camper demographic in this sub sways heavily to those who DO care and ARE responsible. And, judging by the volume of folks I saw this weekend, there are no more secrets. The problem is: it only takes one spark from one idiot‚Äôs campfire. 

So, if you‚Äôve read this far, here is what I am advocating for in the near-term: responsible campers being HYPER-vigilant and aggressive with rules breakers. If you all care about the place so much, then play an active role in protecting it. There are more of us than Forest Service and - it would seem residents. The places that are now accessible are pretty close to each other. Take a walk. If you see something, say something - your life is at risk, too (some of these pines might as well be dipped in kerosene) and nowadays there‚Äôs only one way down. You can and must report offenders to the the rangers. Walk into Big Sur station. If you pass a resident - tell them what you saw. 

The above is no different than the Smokey mantra and is not really a solution. The FS will likely close all these places in the summer months. There‚Äôs been talk of permits. 

Whatever the solution, there needs to be a mechanism to fund two critical things:

1) A substitute for fire/homeowners insurance for locals, which is not available to them. So if their homes burn - they‚Äôre SOL (they don‚Äôt all live in $30 million estates) 

2) Big Sur Fire Brigade. They lost so much last year and if it‚Äôs camp-induced fires they‚Äôre battling‚Ä¶need I say more.

"I came across several people having fires this weekend in places where it is painfully obvious they are forbidden. They all played dumb, but they knew - common sense aside, you can‚Äôt possibly miss the huge signs posted everywhere. 

I also came across people who said they knew fires weren‚Äôt allowed, but they were going to try to have one anyway‚Ä¶(they‚Äôve been taken care of)

This is why there are ‚Äúgate keepers‚Äù on this sub; this is why residents close literal gates - to defend against the masses who don‚Äôt give a sh*t because they‚Äôre just passing through and are more concerned w/ which Instagram filter to choose rather than the preservation of Big Sur‚Äôs majesty or even their ability to return - let alone the lives and livelihoods of its residents.

First, who needs to have a campfire when it‚Äôs 80+ degrees at 10pm?? Personifying their own thickness and cold bloodedness.

Second, I am not advocating for the outright closure of these areas. I was/remain heartbroken by the restrictions as nothing can compare to these sites: camping in Big Sur is a remarkably unique American experience steeped in history and mystic. I do, however, totally understand them and am shocked that some have been lifted/they are not more extreme. 

Third, the Forest Service is depressingly under-resourced and is walking an extremely difficult line. They have ONE officer who can actually hand out citations. 

Last, I imagine the would-be-camper demographic in this sub sways heavily to those who DO care and ARE responsible. And, judging by the volume of folks I saw this weekend, there are no more secrets. The problem is: it only takes one spark from one idiot‚Äôs campfire. 

So, if you‚Äôve read this far, here is what I am advocating for in the near-term: responsible campers being HYPER-vigilant and aggressive with rules breakers. If you all care about the place so much, then play an active role in protecting it. There are more of us than Forest Service and - it would seem residents. The places that are now accessible are pretty close to each other. Take a walk. If you see something, say something - your life is at risk, too (some of these pines might as well be dipped in kerosene) and nowadays there‚Äôs only one way down. You can and must report offenders to the the rangers. Walk into Big Sur station. If you pass a resident - tell them what you saw. 

The above is no different than the Smokey mantra and is not really a solution. The FS will likely close all these places in the summer months. There‚Äôs been talk of permits. 

Whatever the solution, there needs to be a mechanism to fund two critical things:

1) A substitute for fire/homeowners insurance for locals, which is not available to them. So if their homes burn - they‚Äôre SOL (they don‚Äôt all live in $30 million estates) 

2) Big Sur Fire Brigade. They lost so much last year and if it‚Äôs camp-induced fires they‚Äôre battling‚Ä¶need I say more.

Camping in Big Sur should not be free given the state of things - there needs to be a tax on visitors to sustain the place. I know USDA is probably not thinking too hard about this, but somethings gotta give to keep it alive. It would suck to see a reservation system pop-up - but a REGISTRY, where you provide contact details, pay a fee, and watch a mandatory fire edu video and for which you must present a receipt/verification at a gate to enter would be ideal.

"Basically I was on This subreddit a year ago and saw someone mention this spot..We packed up the Impreza, Fourth of July weekend and headed out.

Not raining but misting, I was enjoying it while drinking my coffee with a beautiful copilot on an adventure to basically.. the unknown. We stopped in Santa Maria and got some Almond Claws that were absolutely fire!! After briefly tending to our stomachs we continued north til we hit Cambria. From what I remember this little mountainside town was situated on the coastline and had a super relaxed vibe to it. We fueled up for the last time before proceeded to our final destination!

It‚Äôs definitely a lot busier in the summer regardless of the day of week.  I live in the area and am lucky to be able to enjoy it year-round and thus avoid summer mostly.  The other issue you may want to consider besides a lot of people on the road and trails is that summer brings our coastal fog and there are days and days of grey when the sun won‚Äôt shine the entire day right on the coast but most likely will shine just a mile or two inland.

"Can strongly suggest Point Lobos State Park as a 5-year-old friendly place. It's just at the northern tip of Big Sur, not far from Carmel.

Be warned that most of Big Sur is wilderness. There are parks and places to pull off and just soak in the magnificence of it all, but services are few and far between.

I strongly suggest you take a look at the map and plan before you go. Big Sur is, well, big.

To give you an overview -- the village of Big Sur, which has the Big Sur River Inn and a gas station -- the fabulous bakery is alas closed -- is about 45 minutes south of Carmel, and there's a scattering of other restaurants and inns along the road south of there. Nepenthe, a really great restaurant, is along there.

After that, there's not a lot of ""civilization"". Lucia is a tiny spot in the road with a tiny 2-star hotel with magnificent views, about an hour and a half south of Carmel. I don't remember if there was any place to eat there or not. Ragged Point (2 hours south)  is the next place along with a restaurant and hotel. (I can personally recommend the restaurant, and it's a beautiful spot.) Cambria is next, at about 2 hours 30 minutes. Cayucos and Morro Bay are at pretty much the bottom of Big Sur at about 3 hours out.

Note that these times assume that you will not want to pull off and look at things (and please, pull off instead of driving slowly! Big Sur's road wind heavily and some people will be driving at the speed limit; no point in having an accident). The last time I did the drive, it was about 7 hours going from Morro Bay to Carmel.

The whole length of Big Sur is a \*long\* drive. If this is a we'll-never-do-this-again trip, and you definitely want to take the time to do the whole thing, you might better enjoy driving down to Morro Bay on the inland route, which is 2-3 hours, overnighting there, and then spending a full day driving up.

As far as places to exchange vows: the beach at Pfeiffer Beach, with the stream running into the ocean, the purple sand, and the window rock, is gorgeous and unchallenging to get to, and would be the place probably easiest but memorable. Many places in Point Lobos, as mentioned, are lovely -- China Cove (if it's open) is the most magical place I know, and there are several other stunning beaches there. Lover's Point and the Asilomar Beach Reserve in Pacific Grove are lovely and very close. The municipal beach right in Carmel has white sand and a magnificent view.

One warning: Monastery Beach, just south of Carmel, is beautiful but dangerous. The beach itself is pebbly, leading to difficult footing, and drops sharply just offshore with a very strong undertow. The locals nicknamed it Mortuary Beach, and it's been called the most dangerous beach in California. Avoid it, especially with a five-year-old.",t2_4jtom,pemungkah,0,1623184133.0,0,t1_h12l7fx,h12l7fx,True,[deleted],t3_nvbn7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigSur/comments/nvbn7h/headed_to_big_sur_68610/,Headed to Big Sur 6/8-6/10,/r/BigSur/comments/nvbn7h/headed_to_big_sur_68610/h12l7fx/,3,r/BigSur,0,3

You won‚Äôt have any signal except for around the one cell tower at post ranch. Though the signal does extend down to the Big Sur deli area. Make sure you know where you are going ahead of time so you don‚Äôt drive slowly on the road or make sure you pull over to let others pass. Keep in mind Google maps is not very accurate for the area so maps are helpful but keep an open mind and a sense of adventure. Exploring the area will lead to some of the best places. And some of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù places are just Instagram famous and really not all that great.,t2_1g0s8xe7,zoobernut,0,1621911240.0,0,t1_gzckyae,gzckyae,True,lavendarblacktea,t3_nk7axa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigSur/comments/nk7axa/downloading_offline_maps_helpful/,Downloading Offline Maps Helpful?,/r/BigSur/comments/nk7axa/downloading_offline_maps_helpful/gzckyae/,1,r/BigSur,0,1
"Yes. I just spent a few days in Big Sur and I didn‚Äôt technically download offline maps, but because I‚Äôd repeatedly navigated to the area the week before and pinned hikes, restaurants, and my campground, most of the map in the area loaded enough for me to use.

It was helpful to have pins so even if the map didn‚Äôt load I could know to drive north or south. 

But, people are also very friendly in Big Sur. When my phone was dead at one point, I was able to ask for directions at a gas station.",t2_9vhrzsg6,0Catkatcat,0,1621898479.0,0,t1_gzbwis5,gzbwis5,True,lavendarblacktea,t3_nk7axa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigSur/comments/nk7axa/downloading_offline_maps_helpful/,Downloading Offline Maps Helpful?,/r/BigSur/comments/nk7axa/downloading_offline_maps_helpful/gzbwis5/,2,r/BigSur,0,2

"Yes, that would be extremely helpful.  Cell signal is sketchy in many areas and flat out non-existent in some places.
