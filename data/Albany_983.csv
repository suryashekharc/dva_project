"I use CDTA, I Don't walk with a cane but have limited knee mobility and pain. Everyday after work I cross a 4 lane intersection by my bus stop.

This is nothing new, 787 used to be a street car line. At the beginning of the 20th century the streets belonged to everyone.  The car company's started a PR campaign to shame the nation into accepting that cars own the roads. 

Terms like Jaywalking emerged during this time to belittle Pedestrians.

"New York has stringent laws when it pertains to tenants‚Äô privacy.  Under normal circumstances, a landlord cannot enter a tenant‚Äôs home unless the landlord provides reasonable notice.

The New York Attorney General‚Äôs office has held that ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù means one week‚Äôs notice for repairs and 24 hours notice for inspections.  As a landlord, you will need to provide the tenant with reasonable notice in writing of your intent to enter.  You should include the reason for your requested access as well.

"I saw your edit and comment, It sucks that Ford corporate would not do much about it.   When I was 18 years old, the hand me down Ford I got from my father was the last one I will ever fucking own.

Anyway, I bought a Certified Used Toyota Corolla from Prestige Toyota in Kingston and everything seemed fine when I test drove it.... but you don't usually test drive a car at 65/70/80MPH... I live up here towards Albany and once I got on the Thruway I noticed the tire shake.  By the time I got home the dealer was closed.  I the next day I got up and looked a bit closer at the car and noticed the rim was bent.   I called the salesman and was basically told oh well.  I was like, dude this is the second car I've bought from you guys... I'm not some asshole off the street trying to run a scam.   I called Toyota Corp and 20 minutes later the service manager called me and was telling me to bring it in.  

I don't go to Prestige Toyota anymore...  Lia Toyota is starting to piss me the fuck off again.  I've already bitched about them here on this reddit a few years ago, someone noticed, and they fixed it.

"Another SWE here. I even do mostly web stuff.

Right now it's tough for entry level folks to get a job in software dev. While I work remotely and am a huge advocate for it, lots of places don't hire entry level folks remotely. I don't know what the industry actually even is in upstate NY, but I've worked in offices + remotely all over the country. I've interviewed well over 100 people.

For a web/front end focus be sure that you can code simple things in front of people. Something like a GET request to [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com) was literally the interview I gave to new grads looking for a web role at a previous company. Often, you can use any framework/method you want too.

If you don't have internships or prior employment, do projects. Make ANY sort of project and throw it on github. Odds are, I won't really ask you too much about this and will just click to it to try it and see if it works. However this lets you put all the keywords needed on your resume ""React, NextJS, ES6, CSS"" blah blah. For new grads, it works just as well as having an internship.

For big companies, find their recruiters on LinkedIn and send them something like *Hey, I'm an early career software engineer interested in the web space and I saw you had \_\_\_\_\_\_ position open. I'd like to talk more about this. What's a good time we can do that?* Recruiters have resume screening software and it blows even on good looking resumes. Some softwares it works like a charm, other ones you'll get nothing. There's no real way of knowing either since all the ATS software is just the slightest bit different, but if you can get your resume in front of them, well thats the first step!

Make sure you know what the process is wherever you are going. Is it practical? Is it LeetCode? Or is it just cultural fit. Lots of gov jobs are just cultural fit.

"Sigh...I simply dread purchasing anything these days-especially big ticket items.

Over the past year or so many vehicles were stored on lots while awaiting delivery  of various components.

The soy based wiring in today's vehicles is a strong rodent attractant .

It is not inconceivable, and frankly it's highly likely, that if your vehicle had been stored by the manufacturer in anything but a hermetically sealed vault prior to shipping the damage occurred then.

That damage may not have been readily apparent in a casual, pre-purchase, inspection or even to an experienced eye depending upon the location.

More importantly, it may be impossible to prove that the damage was pre-existing, though it probably was.

Naturally, while the dealership could have done the right thing in standing behind their product, they chose the low route so many seem to these days.

While consulting an attorney is not a bad idea it may not yield the results you hope for and probably deserve.

Given your(typical) interactions with middle management, you might consider having a letter drafted to the owner of the dealership detailing your situation and a reasonable expected remedy.

I also had a very horrible experience with them! Car broke down 2 days after I bought it and they gave me the run around for 2 weeks finally saying they had to replace the whole engine. I cancelled it all  and luckily got my money back. It was a fucking nightmare and I should have looked into legal action but at that point I just wanted to wash my hands of it all.

"Law student, not a lawyer. If you do speak with a lawyer, here are some things you might discuss:

tldr: Call a lawyer. Revoke your acceptance of the car because your original acceptance was induced through difficulty of discovery. They can fix the car, or you can sue them for breach of warranty.

1) Without seeing the sales contract, this is purely dubious speculation. But contracts will often allocate who suffers risk of loss for destruction of goods after the contract is made but before delivery (UCC ¬ß 2-509(4)). My guess is that the contract stated that the risk of loss would pass to the buyer (you) on tender of delivery. Thus, when you picked up the car, the risk of loss would pass to you and you would end up paying the price for the rodent damage that occurred after delivery. That's why they are pinning the rodent damage on you. The problem, as I'm sure you're aware, is that ""if tender of delivery so fails to conform that the buyer has a right of rejection, risk of loss remains on the Seller"" (UCC ¬ß 2-510). But have you rejected the goods? A rejection of goods must be (1) timely and (2) rightful. It is timely if it is done within a ""reasonable time"" (UCC 2-602). It is rightful if the goods are nonconforming. In your case, it is clear that the goods are nonconforming (i.e. car won't start/rodent damage). This damage probably did not occur in the 24 hours you had the car in your possession. However, a rejection argument can get a little messy because you've had the car for a few days and they can come back with a counterclaim for wrongful rejection. But the point is, if the rodent damage actually occurred before you picked up the car, the dealership is liable for the damage because they carried the risk of loss.

Let's try to revoke our acceptance of the car instead.

2) Acceptance may be revoked if it was reasonably induced by difficulty of discovery or seller assurances (UCC ¬ß 2-608). Here, rodent damage (or whatever is mechanically wrong) is not something that you would easily be able to notice when you went to pick up the car at the lot. You're probably not a mechanic. Furthermore, revocation of acceptance must be done within a reasonable time after acceptance. Thus, call a lawyer. Sooner the better. Then call/email the dealership and tell them that you will be revoking your acceptance of the car. They can choose to either fix the car or you can sue them for breach of warranty. 

Seems like a straightforward case honestly I bet you can find someone.",t2_30on601x,excitedidiot,0,1648229726.0,0,t1_i23a9ob,i23a9ob,True,Admiral-Snackbar_,t3_tnp4t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albany/comments/tnp4t5/in_a_pretty_serious_dispute_with_ford_of_latham/,In a pretty serious dispute with Ford of Latham need help.,/r/Albany/comments/tnp4t5/in_a_pretty_serious_dispute_with_ford_of_latham/i23a9ob/,21,r/Albany,0,21

"Aside from a lawyer (which I know you are working on) the only thing I can think of would be to get their positions on the matter in writing. If you can get them to say that they believe the damage was caused when the vehicle was in your possession for less than 24 hours, that would be helpful when you're pushing forward to legal remedies. You may want to see if you can get an independent mechanic to inspect the vehicle (if you can get access to it) to assess the damage as well.

 It didn't take long to fill a $2,500-a-month apartment on the top floor of a building across from Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York.

""We rented that to the first prospect within an hour of showing,"" said¬†Tim Owens, general manager of Tri City Rentals. ""They moved in rather quickly.""

The two-bedroom, two-bath, 1,342-square-foot unit on the sixth floor of 33 New Scotland Ave. is among the 218 apartments that have been built so far in the Park South development.

The $110 million-plus construction project, which has dramatically changed the neighborhood in the shadow of the region's largest hospital over the past several years, is nearing completion.

When finished, there will be 268 apartments spread across three-story, brownstone-style buildings on Robin Street, Dana Avenue and Morris Street, and two, six-story buildings on New Scotland Avenue.

Tri City Rentals took delivery in May of the last 60 brownstones from the builder, BBL Construction Services LLC.

Altogether, there are 168 brownstone units, 123 of which have been rented.

Another 50 apartments are on the upper floors of 33 New Scotland Ave. Just one or two of those units are available, Owens said.

Tenants include students, doctors and other professionals at Albany Medical Center, Albany Law School, Albany College of Pharmacy, Stratton VA Medical Center, and St. Peter's Hospital.

""We have young professionals who may or may not work in Albany who decided they want to live here,"" Owens said.

The last piece ‚Äî a six-story building with 50 apartments and 13,000-square-feet of ground-floor commercial space at 17 New Scotland Ave. ‚Äî will be done in February.

Pre-leasing hasn't begun, but Owens wants to attract a laundromat and other services that residents want.

The 13,000-square-feet of commercial space at 33 New Scotland Ave. are leased to Bank of America and Bellini's Counter. Tri City Rentals is using some of the space for a rental office, resident lounge and fitness center. An undisclosed retailer signed a letter of intent for the last 1,500-square-foot space.

"A key difference between LLCs vs. sole proprietorships is tax flexibility. Only LLC owners can choose how they want their business to be taxed. They can either stick with the default‚Äîpass-through taxation‚Äîor elect for the LLC to be taxed as an S-corporation or C-corporation. An S-corporation is a pass-through entity. If taxed as a C-corporation, the LLC will pay a corporate income tax at the federal level (most states and some localities also levy corporate taxes).

LLCs can sometimes save money by electing corporate tax status. When a company is taxed as a corporation, dividends from the business are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary business income. Plus, retained earnings in a corporation aren‚Äôt subject to income tax. In contrast, LLC members can‚Äôt treat income as dividends and must pay taxes on all profits of the business, whether retained in the company or not. A corporation is also eligible for more tax deductions and credits.

"Until the last couple years, I desperately  wanted to disagree with your assessment.

Now, I would feel foolish.

&#x200B;

Land and homes are selling themselves these days; on this there is little to no debate.

Sometimes, they sell *despite* the real estate 'professional' involved.

Perhaps the new mentality is why bother to excel when mediocrity pays ??

&#x200B;

I cannot tell you how many times a realtor, during a showing, has asked *me* questions about the home *they* are selling.

Even basic stuff such as the fact that modular and frame construction are NOT the same and how they differ has had to be explained to glazed,lifeless eyes.

&#x200B;

I understand that it is not possible to know *everything* about *every* home/piece of land on the market but the basics should be at their fingertips.

Of late, many realtors seem to feel their job description ends at opening the door and inputting data for listing/purchase agreements.

"I used the ArcGIS tool as well to do some research about the Pine Hills area.  It was both surprising and depressing.   Often it is not any big LLC listed so you could try to see if a company owns multiple properties,  but rather you will see a property owned by 'Its_Own_Address_LLC', so like maybe 185 Quail St LLC.  Each property registered as its own single entity,  making it difficult to find out who really owns anything.   I  actually tried to dig deeper on one property,  it was registered to a corporation out of the Bronx,  so it would have to been registered on the NYS website for public information on NY corporations.   BARE MINIMUM of information to be registered.   No agent of the corporation list, no CEO name listed,  nothing to point to owners of the building.

Further saying that we are misusing healthcare without knowing the situation is just unkind.

"Ask Mohawk Hudson Humane Society or check with Out of the Pits. They both do a great job with training and you won't run into the type of issues you might at Petsmart or another pet product supply place.

Also, years ago I took my dog through Agility training out at Best Road in East Greenbush (could be the Averill Park?

"Bats, bees and butterfliles... 

Scale is important here. You talking putting in a couple raised beds or are you talking fountains, beehives, bat nests, and a butterfly garden.  

1) The government is your friend here.  [NYS nursery sale 2022](https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/75799.html) They still have silky dogwood and ninebark available, super cheap.  Not sure how much space you're looking to fill...

2) [Pollinator.org](https://www.pollinator.org/) has a lot of resources about building a garden.  You'll want lots of flowers and milkweed (for the monarchs and other butterflies).

3) Leave the clover and dandelion in your lawn, that is to say be very wary of using chemicals to get rid of ""weeds"" cause they also get rid of beneficial plants. I have a big lawn and bought a weed puller (the long handled one, I'm too old to bend over) and spend a couple hours a year yanking anything gangly.  Probably a little more time than I used to spend spreading chemicals, but I like the clover and such cause it does attract life. I do use a preemergent to deal with crabgrass, but that has to be carefully applied so as to not get near my fruit, flower and veggie gardens.  I still hand pull weeds in them of course. 

4) Stop into a garden center.  They get paid to help you already. Ask lots of questions. 

5) Use good soil.  My garden exploded when I stopped planting stuff in dirt and started bringing in garden soil. 

6) Feed the birbs not the rodents. Squirrels are super smart so good luck outsmarting them.

7) Fence what needs to be fenced. 

8) There's not many choices to make, yet so many.  Basically pick what you want to plant, and start digging knowing that even good gardeners kill about 1/3 of their plants. The rest is all dressing. If you need help with concrete call a mason.  If you need help with wood, call a carpenter (or invite over a handy friend that likes beer).",t2_2rrer2qx,iwillfoolu,0,1648133356.0,0,t1_i1xqg84,i1xqg84,True,docmcstuffins01,t3_tmc7rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albany/comments/tmc7rh/i_need_good_gardening_advise_i_love_nature_and_am/,I need good gardening advise.

"I had an awful experience. They told us we could move in on X date and when we showed up with a moving truck and all of our stuff, the prior (current?) tenants were still living there. Then they pushed our move-in date back even further - leaving us without a place to live for ~10 days - to ‚Äúclean and paint‚Äù but the unit was still dirty and unfinished when we moved in. Flooring began to separate and lift outside of the bathroom and maintenance said they couldn‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt fixit. Basement where the trash room was would flood pretty regularly and the floorboards were warped as a result. Paper thin walls meant we could hear our neighbors television regularly. They also had four different property managers in the year we lived there which is, in my opinion, abnormal and a potential red flag. 

They seem to cut corners during construction that could lead to issues for the tenant later on. I would recommend looking elsewhere if you can.

There. Feel better?

As has already been pointed out, unless you were fighting in WWII, your role was as pawn to the wealthy interests controlling the US military industrial complex.

Nothing about your mission was concerned with protecting the freedoms enjoyed by the average American.

I'm sorry you were duped into believing otherwise and are, consequently, attempting to dupe others into believing the same.

It simply is not true.

That said, you are not wrong about energy conservation *on the whole*\- every little bit does count and being aware of where our energy comes from is important.

But when you start hinting that those to blame are the 'radical left' and 'Brandon', well,frankly, you've lost me.

If anybody is your enemy, it is the GOP who has viewed people like yourself as  nothing more than cannon fodder and votes for decades.

Beyond that, they do not care about you or yours, at all. At.All.
