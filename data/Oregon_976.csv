"I’ve worked for people like this and they suck.  Sure, what they’re doing is legal in the eyes of the law, but it’s shitty.

Employers who play calendar games to get out of paying people overtime for the extra hours they work aren’t worth my time or effort.  *ALWAYS* ask about the work schedules, what the employer considers a work week and the pay periods, as well as the pay itself, when interviewing.  When you see an employer doing mental scheduling gymnastics trying to regulate what he/she pays workers, they’ve got more problems than just needing personnel.  

I’d much rather work in a lower paying job that at least is straightforward (scheduling and pay-wise], consistent and the boss isn’t penny pinching by micromanaging every little thing to death.

"If you have relatively the same overtime every week, it shouldn’t really matter how you divide the 7 day block. Over the course of months, you’ll still end up with the same average amount of overtime. 

For example, if week 1, 2 and 3 you worked 36 hours Tuesday to Friday, and 6 hours on Saturday, you won’t have overtime in week one, but in week two you’ll start with 6 hours on Saturday + 36 hours Tuesday to Friday, so you’ll be at 42 hours. And in week three you’ll have 42 hours. 

It doesn’t matter how you slice the weeks, over time it will average out to the same overtime.

"Ahhhh thank you for this! Studded tires are HORRIBLE for pavement, particularly concrete roads. They are why we have such bad rutting. And the only way to get rid of ruts on concrete is to diamond grind down the rest of the concrete to match the depth of the rut. You can only do that a few times before you can’t do it anymore and have to replace the pavement (unlike asphalt, concrete is very tricky to overlay with more concrete and while some states do it successfully, not many have success and it’s still an emerging field.)

Some of the urban areas of Oregon (Portland, Salem, west coast) doesn’t suffer enough snow to warrant studded tires. Hearing that rattle down my street when there has been frost on the grass and not even a flake of snow just kills me inside!

"Hi purpledust! Good questions. You’re using a lot of terms interchangeably which I’ll help you with.

Asphalt is a mixture of rocks (aggregate) and oil (binder) and sometimes other things (elastic polymers) to make a mixture to put on the road. “Asphalt” is the product made of all of those ingredients.

Aggregate/rock are the rocks you see coming from
gravel pits that are put into the asphalt mix. They’re usually of a certain size (called gradation) and we like them angular, not smooth (the liquid binder sticks to angles much better and makes a better mix.)

The binder is made up of oil (petroleum product, which is why the cost of asphalt relates strongly to the cost of gasoline.) There are lots of different binders and they have specific grades which come from the temperatures they tolerate and perform best at.

Asphalt concrete is a misnomer that privately drives me nuts, haha. There is no traditional concrete in asphalt. The reason “asphalt concrete” came about as a name is because in that nomenclature, “concrete” simply means “a mix of aggregate and binder”.

To us pavement engineers, the two pavement types are asphalt (aggregate + binder) or concrete (cement, aggregate + water). Concrete pavements also have rebar in them to strengthen them. 

As for where we use things, it varies greatly based on your weather and traffic loads. You’ll see pavement guides for counties and states that have tables in them of the binder grades they want you to use based on the route you’re paving. Stiffer binder grades hold up under trucks much better but are trickier to put down and more finicky about temperature. Soft, pliable binder grades are a breeze to put down and can tolerate big temperature swings- but are too soft to put up with a lot of heavy truck traffic. That’s where us nerds come in- we are constantly playing with aggregate sizes, binder grades, cement content, water content, and trying to come up with pavement mixes that give us the best bang for our buck.",t2_3fgnnpxb,geeltulpen,0,1648672479.0,0,t1_i2rfeai,i2rfeai,False,FaintXD,t3_tsc5co,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/tsc5co/can_we_take_a_moment_to_discuss_the_state_of/,Can we take a moment to discuss the state of Oregon roads?,/r/oregon/comments/tsc5co/can_we_take_a_moment_to_discuss_the_state_of/i2rfeai/,33,r/oregon,0,33

Those new funds represent a 38% and 35% funding increase for those two categories.

[Elsewhere in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/tsc5co/can_we_take_a_moment_to_discuss_the_state_of/i2qvrye/), /u/fatbob42 linked to a [wikipedia article about asphalt and bitumen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt).

I've heard of the great (bitumen) drop experiment at Queensland University but never until today did I realize that bitumen was asphalt! (TIL!!!)  Or that here in the US we actually refer to ""liquid asphalt"", ""asphalt binder"", and ""asphalt cement"" to differentiate from asphalt as being just pure bitumen.

So what is exactly in asphalt (binder/concrete?) that we put on road in the US? Is it different formulations depending on where in the US (or around the world you are)? And what about tar, that's very liquidy bitumen, isn't it?

"ODOT got sued for a ton of money for having ADA ramps that were out of compliance.  Some of these ramps are only 1/10 of a percent out of compliance.  But per the terms of their settlement they have to tear every non compliant ramp out in the state and replace it.  Typical costs are about 40k a ramp.  So you can see how that is taking a huge bite out of their budget.  I notice a lot of highways to the coast or the mountains are in serious need of rehab.  

At the county and city level road maintenance is close to 100 percent funded through gas tax and timber revenues.  Counties with large state forests with active logging (Linn County for example) have pretty decent roads as they have a stable and healthy revenue source.  Polk county has decent timber receipts and on top of that the voters passed a 20 million dollar paving bond 10 or so years ago, they have some of the nicest roads in the state, that is what their voters value.  Benton County has almost nothing for timber revenue, and a minimal road tax share, those roads are held together with a half inch thick layer of chip seals, the voters there are keen to pass a bond for a state of the art mental health crisis center and have often supported homeless programs.  They are to the point of reaching the counties borrowing capacity.  Different voters have different priorities.  The road tax comes nowhere close to covering maintenance liabilities.

"Pavement engineer here who used to work for ODOT and now works for WSDOT. If you’re seeing potholes on state highways, those are ODOT’s responsibility and you should complain to them about them. They’ll send out maintenance crews to patch, or hopefully have a project programmed to fix the entire area if it’s bad.

Similarly if you’re on a county or city road, you contact that county or city’s public works department to complain.

The squeaky wheel definitely gets the grease.

Why are the roads so bad? Simply put, the problems are worse than the funding to fix them. We built a TON of highways after WWII and all of those are “coming due”- especially the concrete ones. Freeze and thaw cycles are hard on the pavement and we are starting to use salt to combat ice in areas, and the salt really attacks the properties in concrete. 

As for our asphalt roads, they’re being asked to accommodate bigger trucks, heavier trucks, and more of them. Roads built in the 60’s and 70’s have been overlaid or milled off and inlaid with asphalt for years, but the base remains the same (because total reconstruction down to the base is so costly) That means that by now, the bases that we designed are crumbling because they can’t handle the huge and numerous trucks we put on them today.

Infrastructure as a whole in this country is not being properly funded to address the need. Therefore you’re going to keep seeing bandaid fixes to limp things along. The infrastructure bill will help with some of that. 

Also while I can’t point to specific corruption at all, it is a common occurrence that politicians in either party like to chose big sexy projects to spend money on that get them votes (new bridges, new highways, new bike paths, etc)… spending money on just fixing roads is boring and people don’t appreciate it unless the roads on THEIR commute are fixed.

"Ambrose's problems really start with the Eisenhower books. People aren't able to confirm a lot of dates where Ambrose claimed to spend time with Eisenhower with Eisenhower's records. It seems that was partially on purpose on Eisenhower's part, but also led to revelations that Ambrose agreed to work with Eisenhower to counter Eisenhower's critics and that Ambrose gave Eisenhower some amount of editorial control. After that you get other problems like the infamous railroad book, the problems with his Band of Brothers books and the plagiarism issues, which also impacted his Eisenhower works. 

I like Ambrose's work. It's a good read and the basic outlines are correct. I just wouldn't trust it.

"If you go far enough back, they were 6 characters, but all numeric. Mine is from the early 80s, 7 digits, starting with 4. As a general rule, people younger than me (or who moved here from somewhere else) have a larger number, and the older Oregonians have a smaller one. As they approached the end of that pattern, they changed the initial character to make them alphanumeric. There are some, particularly among millennials, who have numbers that don't match their age, but I haven't figured out why yet. I assume they're reusing them, but I've so far found no pattern to it.

The first is Cassandra Tate's book, Unsettled Ground. It goes over the details of the Whitman's trip and their work at the mission. The second is Blane Harden's Murder at the Mission, which deals with the historiography around the Whitman Mission.

There's also a fictional account of the trial of the Cayuse for the Whitman murders done by Ron Lansing called Juggernaut. Lansing was a professor at Lewis and Clark Law School. So the whole thing is based on historical records of the trial and get's into the some of the legal issues involved. He uses a fictional narrator to make the story more readable and that's why it's not a non-fiction book. It's fairly short, but it's a fun read about Oregon at the time.

Also, Steve Inskeep of NPR fame had a book about John and Jesse Fremont called Imperfect Union a couple years ago. It's interesting b/c it gets into Fremont's exploration to open and map a trail to Oregon, but to also prepare the US to seize parts of Mexico. It gets into the politics of the time and the interests of different factions of exploration of the west, a little into presidential politics of the time, and just what a weird mess the Mexican American war was.",t2_8ecxx,elmonoenano,0,1648595014.0,0,t1_i2n29ip,i2n29ip,True,Mrcatin123,t3_traiv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/traiv9/im_interested_in_reading_a_book_that_go_deep_into/,"I’m interested in reading a book that go deep into the history of the Oregon trail, specifically one that teaches things that they wouldn’t teach in schools, about the culture and, the problems they faced.

"OK, here's the situation: A minority of voters in southern Oregon and northern California want to form a new state. Their given reasons have to do with limits on resource extraction, public health measures, and the purported arrogance of Democratic majorities in the Sacramento and Salem.

Some of these complaints aren't entirely baseless: Salem and Sacramento do sometimes ignore the needs of the more far-flung parts of the state.

But here's the thing: the people advocating for a new state aren't a majority of voters, and legal voters are actually a minority of the people who would be affected by the creation of the new state. These counties have large populations of children and immigrants who have no say in any elections, and they are the people who are most likely to be harmed by the creation of a state with a reactionary right-wing government. 

So, yes, I absolutely think Salem and Sacramento have the moral authority to tell people in Klamath County that they can't violate US treaties with tribes to drain water from an over-stretched river, or that they can't prohibit local governments from publishing information in Spanish, or that they can't expel students for wearing pride flag patches on their backpacks, or that they can't clear-cut forests owned by the federal government in the name of all the people in Oregon.

We're talking about a region with a deep, troublesome history of racism and anti-catholicism, dominated by a small handful of families whose wealth comes from destructive resource extraction and the theft of land from Native tribes. It's a region where county governments are run by the most extreme of extremists, and are constantly trying to strip rights from the more moderate cities.

"Beaverton maybe, but driving isn't going to be consistent at all, though MAX would get you downtown in 15 - 25 depending on where.

Two big sroads separating Beaverton Central from the rest of downtown Beaverton. Also, is Beaverton even cheaper than downtown? 

Raleigh Hills would be a terrible option: mostly old people and no ""downtown"" area at all unless you count the New Seasons as ""downtown"". 

Milwaukie kinda fits your requirements, though the downtown area is still a work in progress and has been pretty dead whenever I go there. About 30 minutes to downtown Portland driving or TriMet. The waterfront area is epic, like they did a seriously good job on the new waterfront park. 

Gresham is decent but definitely doesn't meet your 30 minute requirement and is about 50 minutes on TriMet.

"Sometimes I have to park on the sidewalk because of the size of my vehicle, the narrow street, and lack of parking. But I live on a short dead end street, and there's no one I'm aware of with disabilities among my neighbors. Thanks to my car-collecting asshole neighbors, I don't have much choice. I can't even park on the nearest cross street and walk home because all that parking is taken up my the dude across the street with his six cars. My next door neighbors have two people that drive, room to park two, but have four. Across the street, two drivers, room for three cars, but have four and a big travel trailer. My street narrows down to the north of my house, and there's no street parking, so anyone visiting those people parks in front of my house, and sometimes stay for days. Luckily, my wife gets home from work early in the day, so she can park in front and prevent my neighbors fat-ass kid from parking there. It wasn't like this when I bought my place, but almost all of my immediate neighbors have turned over and the new ones have too many fucking cars that just sit there without being driven. Fuck.

"So, can you provide me some sources?

We are a representative democracy you silly Willy. That’s like a red herring of the media you consume lol.

“ Founding Father James Madison may have best described the difference between a democracy and a republic:

“It [the difference] is that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person: in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, must be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.”
The fact that the Founders intended that the United States should function as a representative democracy, rather than a pure democracy is illustrated in Alexander Hamilton’s letter of May 19, 1777, to Gouverneur Morris.

“But a representative democracy, where the right of election is well secured and regulated & the exercise of the legislative, executive and judiciary authorities, is vested in select persons, chosen really and not nominally by the people, will in my opinion be most likely to be happy, regular and durable.””

"Auto, not really as I just keep mine inside. Probably wash often, make sure any scratches get touched up before they rust, etc.Similar to what I mention below, if there are any leaks get them fixed before the moss and mold start growing inside your car.

Home: every fastener outside is stainless, check deck hangars and similar if they're not and replace them before it drops 2 feet(ask me how I know).

Keep an eye on the bottom of walls and around decks and make sure moisture can't collect, keep clear of leaves, pine needles, etc. Check siding, especially wood for damage and make sure paint is intact before the wood rots. Personally I dislike T1-11 siding because it's too rough and easy to get paint gaps and damage due to water infiltration and have to replace it, Hardi or SmartSide or similar seems like a better choice.

Drainage is key, once again keeping water away from buildings. When I bought I had to tear down the old garage since it was right on the slab with no downspouts or gutters and the water collected along the bottom and rotted it away.

I see quite a few mentioning mold, I don't have any problems but I also have a a house where you can feel a breeze in spots, so either ventilation or dehumidifiers is important to preventing problems. Also, aluminium windows suck as the inside gets condensation and makes interior rot/mold more common. If you do get a mold or other problem deal with it and figure out the source and fix it, especially if it's a leak. I had to redo one bathroom since it had a leak in the past and ended up having to replace studs and the entire subfloor in the room due to rot.

"Its grown quit abit since the 80s. Lots of farmland then. You have a major railroad and freeways through there. It sits on the Columbia.  As kids our favorite activity was waterskiing and fishing. Between fishing and skiing the Columbia and umatilla rivers kept us busy. The town used to have kinda a ruff night life. It wasn't uncommon to see a good first fight at a bar. 
A place on the outskirts called Hinkle has been a shipping hub for the railroad for years. When e commerce came to be, companies like FedEx, Amazon, and UPS, seen the logistical advantage in turn opened hubs. The cartel also recognized geographical advantages and also set up a hub. At one time there was a high murder rate per 100k I'm not sure anymore.

Umatilla Army depot, which is very close to Hermiston, has stored post ww2 chemical weapons in bunkers. They have been  burning it off  slowly over the years not sure if they still are. Hanford isn't far away which was were the uranium was processed for the Abomb. I read an article a few years ago about the nuclear waste making it's way into the Columbia. 
If you buy a place that has a well make sure the water is tested before signing a check.

"I spent several months homeless in Astoria with my husband who was also homeless, and we did not have a car. Walking sucks ass because of the rain and the streets are ridiculously steep. Just exhausting to walk anywhere but along the main road. I loved the bus service. We lived out side of town on some freak's pig farm,  which was straight out of a deliverance type movie. We had been promised a farm, a horse and a car, we got half a rotting old mobile home he put hay bales and tarp down and that was the floor. There was mud everywhere,  and every chance I got I got on the bus that runs to town and spent time in Astoria, washing laundry, walking around being denied jobs, dodging huge smelly homeless men who were loud and rude, being looked at funny by residents. Thank God they had a dispo to ease my nerves.  It rains all the time. ALL the time. If you have a car and waterproof gear, and I mean spend once and spend well and get the gear, you might like it. I loved the river walk, I wish I could share my video of the sea lion who was up on the sidewalk honking at me that day lol!!  If you have never seen a live bald eagle in the wild, then prepare yourself, because they are everywhere along the water!! And you will never see as many gorgeous rainbows as you will see in Astoria. There are actually some nice cool people there (not the freak farmer we lived with). The Safe Way Is the best grocery store, great food and as a homeless, we would get a sandwich and sit in the window eating and watching the parking lot. There was a little pizza place up on the corner going out of town by the bus stop, Genos great pizza, There is a little store by Genos in that area that sold these little glass bottles of coke, and little licorices. There is a giant ship museum, it is an easy walk from one end to the other.  They used to have an office where they gave us homeless an official address so we can get our medical and food stamps. Very nice  service, heard it is gone now. The bus service is c heap and good, There used to be a lady feed the homeless in Astoria too.

"Another Trail of Tears being observed today by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde in Oregon:  On this day, February 23, 1856, Indian Agent George Ambrose began moving 325 “Indian Refugees” from the Table Rock Reservation in Southern Oregon to the Grand Ronde Reservation in the Willamette Valley. Known as the Rogue River Trail of Tears, this journey required the Natives to leave their homelands and travel, on foot, north. The Rogue River Trail of Tears would take 33 days and cover 263 miles.   Agent Ambrose kept a journal during the removal.  Over the next few days we will share with you some of his entries as a glimpse into that history.  “February 23d Saturday “The weather still continues to be pleasant. It was found necessary to have more teams than at first contemplated. I accordingly proceeded to Jacksonville for that purpose, and also to provide some articles, such as clothing and blankets to add to the comfort of the Indians, although the weather is sett [sic] down as pleasant. It certainly would be regarded as such, especially at this season of the year, however the nights are quite frosty and the morning’s cool, sufficiently so, to render it necessary that they should be provided with Tents, Blankets, shoes & such necessaries as would tend to promote their comfort while on the journey which being procured the day was spent in distributing the articles among them. Also two additional teams were secured to convey the sick, aged, and infirm. Our teams now number eight which I fear will not be sufficient. Thirty four Indians are disabled from traveling by reason of Sickness aside from the aged and infirm, who will as a matter of course, have to be hauled.”",t2_dtq2juaj,Sarraceniapurpurea,0,1648517402.0,0,t1_i2ienj2,i2ienj2,True,Sarraceniapurpurea,t3_tqojnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/tqojnw/history_from_another_group_ill_put_the_text_below/,History from another group.

"Depends on how far up in elevation you go within the forest and what you consider too cold. I went camping in willamette forest last year in early June. Lake Waldo camping at 5000' (ish) was still closed due to snow and it was actively snowing a bit when I drove up to the lake. I drove back down the mountain and found a camp spot lower in elevation and it was fine probably 50's-60's during the day and mid 30's to 40's as a low. Hiking was great for me that the perfect temp to hike since you don't get over heated. Also I got lucky that it was sunny, more likely by the end of May early June but it's still also likely to rain.


 I would say will there be snow on the roads?

 Probably not but maybe, I would be prepared for it. 
Will it rain?

Probably with a good rain coat and waterproof shoes, who cares.

-You will have to go to larger cities inland for some specialty goods. Food especially.
-Salt air will jack up your car. Rust will ruin the longevity of any metal machinery.

No shit. That actually had to be said?  
  
>Ghost guns are untraceable, with their parts typically bought online and assembled at home. They also lack commercial serial numbers.   
  
Well, this is how its always been. People are buying parts online all the time. Its the action/lower or frame (on a handgun) that has the serial. Police/article doesnt say if the guns had their S/Ns filed off or if they were serial-less, which would mean someone has a foundry and original casting and machining for those parts.  
  
Or this guy was able to 3d-print steel and expensive alloys, which means he was loaded with cash.  
  
Its a very sensationalized article highlighting mundane things as 'terrible.'

"Weed, OTOH, like a good sativa, helps folks get into focus and get things done.  Many folks who are high on weed are fairly cognizant of what they’re doing and their coordination is disturbed, for the most part.  While it doesn’t affect judgment, it does distort time, though.  Alcohol, however, impairs judgment.  One can be functional while drunk, but their coordination is also way off because care and consistency require good judgment.",t2_azz6u151,WaywardMork,0,1648481415.0,0,t1_i2g4w3u,i2g4w3u,False,tpaineinthebutt,t3_tpo19b,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/tpo19b/four_people_are_dead_after_a_driver_crashed_a/,"Four people are dead after a driver crashed a vehicle into Salem, Oregon, encampment of unhoused people",/r/oregon/comments/tpo19b/four_people_are_dead_after_a_driver_crashed_a/i2g4w3u/,-2,r/oregon,0,-2

"Luckily earthquakes don't follow a schedule, so calling it ""overdue"" isn't super useful or true honestly. Full-margin ruptures also happen less frequently!

The ""everything west of I-5 will be toast"" line is also a bit notorious at this point, and scientists are not a fan of it because it's quite an exaggeration. Here's a really good lecture about it and the whole thing in general if you're curious: https://youtu.be/tW4D6OE7Qkc
