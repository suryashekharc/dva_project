"I am a late-20s who just left Rome because as a liberal young person, I was completely out of place and at times felt very unwelcome/unwanted. I moved there because I was sent there for my (white-collar) job. I was very hopeful going in, but that diminished fast. If you at all take the pandemic seriously, don’t move there. Towards the beginning of the pandemic, shortly after Publix put out their mask mandate and directional signs on the aisles, a man walked around the store with no mask, seemingly purposefully going the wrong direction down aisle. He was openly carrying and any time an employee would say something to him, he would stare at them and bring his hand to rest on the gun. Then they would get wide eyed and flee. Even when the hospital’s Covid beds and ICU beds were just about completely full, 75% of those I encountered in stores weren’t wearing masks. Additional note with the county hospital, Floyd, is they are horrible when it comes to billing/insurance. I am still settling an issue with them where they aren’t answering my insurance’s calls about the bill they sent me that is GREATER than my out of pocket max. And the coverage I got in carrying that bill was atrocious, had to head to another hospital out of town to get answers. Internet connectivity is also an issue if you aren’t right in the town, inside the loop that acts as a miniature version of the perimeter. 

Also, you WOULD be judged by the fact you don’t have kids or want them. I was heavily judged for not having kids and questioning if I even wanted them in the future. I moved in at 25 and people were shocked I didn’t have a child or plans for one soon.

"Hi, I work in the arts here pretty actively, and nearly all of the people I know here lean more liberal.

If you're in to water sports definitely check out the Etowah. We've also got a pretty decent smattering of great restaurants, as well as a few specialty shops downtown for more exotic kitchen needs. In short, if you want a small town in Georgia that's full of arts and outdoors, Rome is a happening place to be...

Cave Spring is nearby too, they have an annual arts festival and a BBQ cookoff.

We are in our late 20s and definitely have grown to be more liberal in our hiatus. I think if you set your expectations correctly you wouldn’t be disappointed in the conservative nature of this city. Rome is becoming more liberal. With that said the “right wing” people are extremely in your face about it and the “left wing” people are significantly more reserved when it comes to talking politics. 

With that said, after 2 months we are making new friends, most of which them are quite liberal.

Just be warned that there are few “white collar” jobs that pay market competitive salaries; when compared to Atlanta. We both work remotely so this isn’t too bad for us. 

It’s actually kinda nice up here. Traffic is nothing compared to east Cobb or kennesaw. It’s just chill and laid back. 

We live downtown and love walking to anything that is happening. There is always live music happening at multiple venues downtown on the weekend.

I will say Rome (and every other smallish town) has it's ups and downs but it is definitely affordable. That's why I'm staying for a while.

"I lived in Rome for the last decade. There is everything you're looking for, but you just need to know where to look. 

There's a lot of great non-profits that do lots of fun social events throughout the year that will get you connected quick and feel a sense of community. I would start with the Rome Area Council for the Arts (but I'm a little biased because I am a former past president). 

The food and bar scene is thriving downtown. Lots of good places to eat and go drink. There's also a ton of outdoor activities very close by if that's your scene. I would encourage you to book a weekend at the Hawthorn and reserve a night to eat at Aventine during your stay (though you will need to reserve well in advance). 

While you're there, be sure to check out Myrtle Hill Cemetary, grab a drink at River Dog during the day and the Foundry at night and explore all the great venues downtown on Broad street. Also visit the neighborhoods of old east Rome, Maplewood East, and Summerville park. Lots of cute and affordable houses in all three.

Also, there's definitely a liberal presence if you look in the right places....and you know.... it could also use two more. Find and introduce yourself to Windy Davis (the only democrat on city council and active socialite) and she will guide you to everyone else. 

Hope that helps.

Rome is highly conservative and has very few great restaurants but has a great bar scene on broad street. The greenway system is probably my favorite part about the town. Housing is highly affordable within 10 min of broad street.

This morning he left his house to give someone a ride to work and after dropping them off he had a flat tire. He pulled in the parking lot of smoothie king.
He quickly realized that he didn't have a jack and he had left his phone and his insulin at home, he was also still in his pajamas.

So he walked in to smoothie king at 7 am,  and asked explained his trouble (a 75 year old diabetic in his pajamas with a flat tire and no phone, no car jack, and NO INSULIN) and asked to use their phone to call his wife so that she could call for help.

"Well, the word potentially is an important qualifier there.  


However, let me restate... A physician peddling non-FDA approved natural redemies in context of office visits is a potential ethical violation that can have licenses removed ... this is especially the case when they are selling these items. (I had a past doctor that this actually happened to). This is seen as different than medications and samples in terms of professional ethics. 


Of course, I am not advocating for removing anyone's license out of context. That's why you report them to the board for potential investigation. A report is hardly a witchhunt. Although I am sure false accusations happen, it's is actually fairly hard to lose a license without evidence, and even when evidence exists for ethical issues with medical licenses, usually there are many steps to retrain and educate the physician rather than revoke licensure altogether. Doesn't feel like a witchhunt to make sure someone is practicing ethically, especially by folks who are trained in what those ethics are.

"This is a comment from Facebook (for all that’s worth but I do personally know the guy that wrote it and can vouch for him, again, for all THAT’s worth lol)

This guy was also causing problems in Bartow County, too. During the hand recount part of the statewide audit last week, him and a few other GOP audit monitors harassed a few poll workers, intimidated us, and at one point tried to get a lady to add 20 more votes for Trump after they finished counting a batch of Election Day ballots. At one point, one person encouraged the other watchers behind the line to get their phones out and record a table, saying, “keep and eye on *that one*” gesturing to a table with a darker-skinned woman working on the recount. The harassment caused one poll worker to quit and they did not return to complete the audit (luckily we were able to find a replacement the next day). This kind of behavior is only emboldened and encouraged by our president’s rhetoric and the failure of the GOP to acknowledge that it is anti-democratic and dangerous to our republic, and most refusing to denounce it. Me and the thousands of other poll workers who worked during the audit/hand recount are honest, legally bound by an oath, and have no way nor reason to cheat while doing our jobs. The poll watchers ONLY sent by the GOP were there to intimidate, instigate, and cause drama rather than to observe the process and ensure it is carried out accurately and efficiently. The Democratic audit monitors caused no problems, and even went so far as to make conversation with us during our breaks and were very friendly. 

Just wanted to add that this is not just one example, too. It has happened multiple times in multiple places where GOP poll watchers do not do their jobs as they are required to and end up causing problems.",t2_crkk6,PastorJ7000,0,1606484630.0,0,t1_gdrioup,gdrioup,False,PastorJ7000,t3_k20jbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/romega/comments/k20jbz/paging_dr_mckaren_republican_poll_watcher/,Paging Dr. McKaren: republican poll watcher disrupts pointless recount and follows Dominion tech into bathroom while recording him on his phone.

"I was working as a vote panel review judge for this rerecount and this guy who was my republican counterpart kept asking pointless gotcha questions to the poor beleaguered election staff and invading their personal space and just being a rude Karen in general, so I was not overly inclined to like the guy to begin with. Then, in the very cramped and confined space the rerecount was taking place in, the subject of masks came up. He opined that general widespread mask usage served no purpose whatsoever and that maybe just maybe in a clinical setting N95s help just a little and when asked why he thought that he said he read a study from Sweden or something and that he studied statistical analysis. My first thought was ‘Well, this guy might be a fucking idiot’ but then I looked down at his name tag. It read ‘DR David McKalip’ so my thoughts changed to ‘No, this guy is definitely a fucking idiot.’

The Dominion computer tech was a field supervisor of some sort so he was taking phone calls all day from other techs that were under him. At one point he fielded a phone call and left to go to the restroom as well. Dr. McKaren followed him in there while recording him with his phone. I can only assume that he thought he was going to document some of that election fraud that supposedly takes place but nobody can prove for some reason. This absolutely freaked the Dominion tech out, as well as the election staff, and for good reason. Dr. McKaren is a BIG dude and he was acting like a crazy person, and they were not.

When he was confronted about following the tech into the bathroom he tried to claim that he had the absolute right to record anybody in a public setting and couldn’t wrap his head around the idea that the bathroom didn’t qualify. He was asked to leave a few times and eventually he did, but sweet Jeebus that was ridiculous.

We called him Dr. P-tape and I said that he did not deserve to wallow in anonymity when somebody pointed out that Dr. P-tape was already famous.

"There are a lot of small dealerships that will run your credit to get you a loan. Be careful though, many of them border on predatory. I know I was in a bind and had to have a car with no credit years ago. I paid twice the amount for the car just off the lot, which wasn't in the best shape to begin with. Then my apr on the loan was 33%! If you can go to a reputable dealer like Ford/Carmax/etc. Also try to get a cosigner if your credit is bad.

"Gotcha.  Not sure of your price range but downtown Rome (and the between the rivers area) has the best apartments/condos for any type of nightlife convenience.  There are several bars, restaurants, shopping and coffee within walking distance.  If you head over the river towards South Rome you will start seeing some more sketch places but downtown is safe.

I know there have been some new apartment places recently but I haven't paid much attention so I can't really comment of how they are.  If you find something you can pm me the area and I'll let you know what kind of place you are looking at.

"I was there for a few days last month exploring on my own. I was looking to rent an apartment with laundry inside but didn’t see any ( $1,800 / month or less which I believe should be more than enough for the area). 

I basically just drove around, went to the mall (1/2 the stores closed & visited JC Penney.  I hit different spots for meals and Starbucks so I could get a better flavor and make sure I wasn’t inadvertently just in one area of town. At night I drove by (didn’t get off) a section of street that had a few bars / restaurants and has people walking around; looked nice. 

I checked out Kennesaw and Immediately noticed the difference when I got off the highway; much more retail stores, city life, restaurants, and rental apartments. I think I was by the college area...... but too far from Rome for a daily drive to the office ☹️.

The reason I mention “safe “ is bc I randomly also picked some descent looking homes on Zillow and drove to see them and you either had to go past some shady parts of town (check cashing stores, pawn shops, etc) or it was veryyy dark and rural at night (i jog and cycle).

"It really depends on where you are going. There isn't really much deep water in Rome, even the rivers are fairly shallow. I would probably go for bass, they are the most plentiful in town imo. Fishing was way better in the 90's and early 2000's, a lot of lakes have been mostly fished out, doesn't mean you won't catch anything, but it is a lot harder than it used to be. Whatever you fish with also depends on the time of day and where you are. Most areas do pretty well with some type of worm bait. Bottom fishing  or low to the bottom is pretty good in this heat. A lot of places have good cover for fish, such as branches and rocks. Certain lakes have a lot of moss, so a top water frog lure would be good for those.

"The hike up to the ""house of dreams"" from Berry's Mountain Campus is worth it. A couple of miles up an old gravel road.

Some of the houses in the ""Between the Rivers""  district are pretty awesome. Go to the Clocktower and drive around the neighborhood from there.

Jamwhich, Schroeder's, and Jeffersons are the cheap local places to eat, Harvest Moon for a bit more.

"Really depends on what you are into. 

* Broad st and the downtown area have multiple boutique shops and restaurants. 
* Berry College campus is a must see. you can just drive through and enjoy the scenery and the deer (they are everywhere)
* Chieftains museum 
* Myrtle Hill cemetery
* Clock tower
* if its your thing. A beer at river city brewing, on the upper deck, overlooking the river is great.  
* Rome Braves
* The rivers.

Or are they trying to spread the word of Jeebus and his scurry, scurry cross that is apparently also offensive to some by telling everybody how scurry it is?

"That seems like a bonkers-long time for a stored-food pest to go unnoticed in people food, Even at a Kroger. But I suppose it’s more likely than you having a weevil infestation In the trunk of your car ;-). I did pest control for years and often found pet food received less scrutiny from commercial and residential clients alike. If the rice is a dead end, I’d check the dog bowl next. I don’t bother with bugs anymore, but I still run a business out of Rome. Look me up if you need tips to get them under control.
