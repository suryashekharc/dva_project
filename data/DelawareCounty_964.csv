"Well, those apartments are really large and snake around even though the exterior makes the building look small. Mine was a 3 bedroom for a great price. Ahh there was a feeling of terror everytime I came home. It didn't help to have company because that feeling didn't stop with a full house. One night I saw this reflection on the tv. It was turned off and situated in a way so that I could see down the hallway through the reflection but not the actual hallway. There was a man with large, white gloved hands waving at me through the tv reflection and he was smiling. I tried to scream but no sound came out. Started jumping up and down, filled with adrenaline. Heard a thumping sound, so I ran over to look, to see it with my eyeballs but the man was gone. I would hear strange music at weird times- like an ice cream truck was near. Blue lights would run and flash through the rooms all the time. A mouse died next to my foot. This was 20 years ago. I can't find many reviews about the property or the history- which is strange nowadays. Someone named Grizelda manages it but that is all I know. But real history?

"I may be late to this but I'll add my 2 cents. I spent most of my life living in Yeadon and a good chunk of my adult life living in Lansdowne. Lansdowne from when I went to Penn Wood High is different from when I was an adult living there. When I was in high school the area was really nice, there was an awesome diner on the corner of Lansdowne and Baltimore Ave, there was a record shop that I used to love going into and digging through the crates, but alot of that stuff is gone now. To me, it feels like it's lost that charm, reading through some of the comments it seems some folks don't agree, but it's not the same anymore. One point I was living in an apt. complex right on Lansdowne ave closer to the Darby side and it was not a pleasant experience. I feel the closer you are to the Darby side, the more negative living experience you will have. When my wife and I were looking for our first house, we actually looked in Lansdowne since that side of Delco is all I knew, but ultimately the dumb high taxes, the parking permit (more of an annoyance) and the fact that there was too much creep coming from Darby/SW Philly that we ultimately chose to go further south in Delco (which stupid me, isn't much better due to the Chester/Claymont creep). 

The one thing I loved about Lansdowne though hands down is its proximity to everything. Quick Media/Elwyn ride into the city if you take the train.

"Lansdowne is the hidden gem of delco.. if you ask me it has more character than most other areas in the county. One of the best cheesesteaks in delco is found at docs deli. They hold cool events on the main strip from time to time. The old Victorian houses are a plus. They got that sick old ass tree there and one of the first log cabins is found 5-7 minutes away. There’s thrift shops, grocery stores and pharmacies in walking distance. There’s easy access between Philly and the surrounding delco area. The only downside is that there aren’t any poppin bars in the area.

"I moved to a Lansdowne rental this past August after renting for 16 years in Narberth.  I first moved to Narberth in 2005 to be near my first job out of college as I did not have a car and rent was $750/mo. Me and my wife were asked to move out of that apt because our LL wanted to renovate the 3-apt unit back into a single family home and sell it before he retired to Florida (must be nice). We looked around the local mainline area and saw rents were starting in the $1600/mo range and I have no idea how people afford that and still have money left over after paying for their other bills. My wife saw this ad in Lansdowne (which Delco wasn't even in our radar) for a 3rd floor apt unit for $725/mo so we applied. A month later we were told we were \`1 of 17(!!!!) applicants being considered. (I never filled out so many forms for a rental application before... omg how things have changed in the past 15 years).  Soon after that we actually got this cheap apt so affordability is why we're here. (At age 41 I had just paid off my student loans a few months prior so credit score was very high) The immediate neighbors are pretty nice but we both work a lot so there's not a lot of interaction. I ended up making a career change a month later which requires a lot of driving to various construction sites so the proximity to highways has been an inadvertent blessing. We also like the more convenient access to stores round here (Home Depot, Aldi, Acme, LA Fitness, CVS).  We don't have kids so schools don't enter into the equation and we don't plan on it esp now that we are in our 40's.  Idk I just look at our monthly budget and our financial reality forces us to live wherever we can find the cheapest rent so here we are. It's working out pretty great so far here and people are nice.  My wife's coworkers and boss were both ""horrified"" that we were considering Lansdowne due to the ""car jackings"" and ""violence"" but as an Atlantic City native who grew up on food stamps I'm used to people trash talking ""bad"" neighborhoods without ever having lived there.

"I personally love Lansdowne. Beautiful. Lots of history, culture, diversity, and moving, in my opinion, in a great direction economically and socially. Access to media boro, Philly and really the greater Northeast Corridor at your doorstep. Ostensibly affordable.

"I recently left Lansdowne after living there for around 3 years. I think it’s highly dependent on what area you are planning to move to, where you’re moving from, etc. Some of our neighbors weren’t the best to deal with. Before we moved there were quite a few instances of break ins and other crimes. Driving and walking/running in the area can be a bit dangerous. The street we lived on was 25 MPH but people would fly by going 50. We had accidents in front of our house on close to a weekly basis. People in the area don’t seem to know what a stop sign or red light means but that’s maybe not specific to Lansdowne but Delco/Philly as a whole. As a small-ish female, I never felt unsafe running alone during the day besides the typical catcalling, but I definitely tried not to be out alone at night. 

The houses in the area are beautiful. During my time there I noticed many neighbors starting to clean up properties and renovate homes. We sold our house for close to 100k more than we purchased it for about 3 years after buying. If you are buying a house, they recently did a property tax reassessment for the first time since the 90s and the taxes went up by a lot. Our mortgage payment was about go up I believe almost $700 a month due to the tax increase. 

If you have or plan to have kids while living in Lansdowne the school district isn’t great.  We planned to maybe stay long enough to put our kids through elementary school there and reevaluate, but ultimately decided it wasn’t worth it. 

Otherwise, it’s a pretty cute little town that has a lot of potential. We originally moved there thinking more businesses would move into the downtown area, but the pandemic halted a lot of that. There are a few nice little businesses in town to check out and a decent farmers market. I do think a lot of smaller businesses struggle in the area. I was involved in many of the Facebook groups for the neighborhood and there were always complaints about the parking/walking situation in the downtown area. I honestly got the impression sometimes that some of the people who lived there for their entire lives didn’t welcome any change or development of the area. 

Overall, definitely not the worst place to live depending on what you’re looking for. I just think the town has felt some of the same side effects of the pandemic that every area has and it’s a shame because it really does have so much potential. Last I heard, they are building some sort of walking trail not too far from town and there is supposed to be a luxury apartment complex going in.",t2_11twzfvj,Bdglvr,0,1642947805.0,0,t1_htvrjnu,htvrjnu,True,furstiefurst,t3_sal1x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delco/comments/sal1x0/pros_and_cons_of_living_in_lansdowne/,Pros and Cons of living in Lansdowne,/r/Delco/comments/sal1x0/pros_and_cons_of_living_in_lansdowne/htvrjnu/,5,r/Delco,0,5

"Every fire company desperately needs firefighters.  Most companies in Delaware County are 100% volunteer and volunteerism is at an all-time low.

Those who remain are stretched thin as well, handling multiple roles on both the fire and administrative sides.  Each company has a board of directors as well as a separate entity call the Relief Organization.  Both have treasurer positions.  Your skills would come in handy there.

But beyond the administrative side, we really do need firefighters.  If you or anyone else reading this has any interest:

* Most companies pay for all of your training.  And there is also training in-house.  You don't need any prior experience.

* Junior programs start at age 14 for most companies, 16 for others.  There is no upper age limit.  Some people think it's too late as they hit their 40s and beyond.  It's not.

* If you are apprehensive about fighting fires or feel you cannot physically do it, please know that there are plenty of exterior jobs to do at a fire (there's a lot of competition to be the one going inside on an initial attack because that's a smaller crew.  The majority of firefighters on the scene don't get to do that).  We still need drivers/apparatus operators, water supply, exterior ventilation, throwing ladders, filling air bottles, changing out air packs, ""gophering"" (""go for this, go for that"" -- getting needed equipment from the trucks) and clean up.  Plus most calls aren't even building fires.  We respond to rescue calls, clean up after accidents, automatic alarms, brush fires, dumpster fires, car fires, carbon monoxide alarms, gas leaks, elevator rescues, etc.

* There are also plenty of non-fire jobs to do.  Besides the administrative side that I mentioned, we had to maintain the equipment, apparatus, and the station.  Some of that is basic cleaning, but a lot is either repairing equipment, or arranging to have a vendor do it.  So there is a lot of dropping off and picking up of equipment, taking apparatus for repair or inspections, meeting a vendor at the station to receive a shipment, hanging at the station to let in an electrician or plumber to fix something, etc.  It might not sound like much, but when you're one of the same dozen or so people who do this, it gets old fast.  So we appreciate new members who are willing to do all of these extra jobs.

If you (or anyone else reading this) is interested, stop at your local fire station on a drill night to ask for an application.  You can usually find out their drill night by looking it up on their website or Facebook page.  If that doesn't work, call the station.  With volunteers, you probably won't catch someone there, but if you leave a message saying that you're looking to volunteer, you should get a call back soon.  Or contact the company on their website or Facebook page.  Again, as soon as you say you'd like to volunteer, you should get a response.",t2_16qkkh,ConstantReader76,0,1641695463.0,0,t1_hrv0o47,hrv0o47,True,southeasternlion,t3_rz2y26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delco/comments/rz2y26/volunteering_opportunities/,Volunteering Opportunities,/r/Delco/comments/rz2y26/volunteering_opportunities/hrv0o47/,10,r/Delco,0,10

"CH is nothing to write home about. I was a Chester County boy, grew up in Phoenixville and Malvern. My first apartments were in KOP. I moved to CH because I wanted to buy, and DELCO is a cheap suburban area. I enjoy delco as a whole, but Upper Darby ain’t it. I also have super annoying neighbors on the one side of me which makes it miserable some days to be even be at home. So much traffic on bishop, springfield, and Baltimore, always. 

What I like about DELCO is how different it is from the other three suburban counties. It is so diverse down here, people are way more accepting of people of color and other ethnicities, especially because of the close proximity to the hoods of West Philly. It’s so close to the city, there’s so much history.

I asked my aunt to make flavored pizzelles when I was a kid but she couldn’t get it right. I’m convinced that a blueberry pizzelle would be amazing. Never even saw one, though.

"In Africa there are certain crazy people crushing the cores up from the converters and smoking them. It literally kills you considering they're rare and toxic metals, but if you survive the ""high"" is ridiculous, or so I've heard on the interwebs.

If it's not for drugs, it's because it's easy money IF you find a shop/dump that will buy them. Now, cops are hitting every shop and dump to make sure they're not buying stolen converters. Anyone caught is facing time in jail. Shops too.

 I'm telling anyone I know to make sure their vehicle is within camera range, and if not get a shield. The only other way is to rig some kind of flamethrower to the bottom of the car so if anyone steps near it they should be BBQ'd. If you hear an electric or gas saw going on in the middle of the night, call the cops. If you see something, say something.

Since Covid the thefts have skyrocketed, since it's ""easy money"" if you don't get caught. The difference is, if you get caught by the police you're way better off than the guy I heard who got caught near Camden. Dude shot him point blank with a shotgun in the chest when he came at him with a saw. Some shop owner told me about it, but I never saw any news report YET.

"Quality of the school district is a big driving factor in home prices. Look at Wallingford-Swarthmore. One of the highest school taxes in the county but the home prices aren’t suffering. If the school puts out a poor product, then the real estate values will reflect it. That being said, not sure how much has to do with the parents’ involvement or other things. 


I do think something needs to be done about the real estate taxes. In my neighborhood, there are several elderly that will never have need for the schools at this point, so paying that bill has to be difficult for them. Not sure why they haven’t moved yet, but it’s a shame if they need to move out of their longtime home because of taxes. I just don’t know how things will work if Harrisburg determines where the funds should go. While this could help some communities, it could negatively impact others. 


For reference, here are the millage rates for the county https://www.delcopa.gov/treasurer/forms/TaxRate.pdf

"This is the group bringing the lawsuit (which started earlier in November): https://www.pubintlaw.org/cases-and-projects/school-funding-lawsuit/

The argument is basically that Delco school taxes are bananaananas and linking school funding to local real estate shirks Harrisburg's responsibilities under the law to fund and provide equal access to education.  The William Penn School District is a plaintiff, but they've also joined districts across the state that are in a similar spiral where school taxes drive down home values, which depresses real estate tax revenue, so then schools are forced to raise taxes to meet needs, which then drives down home values, etc..",t2_eofbh7ly,Palmer-Eldritch-2021,0,1638812905.0,0,t1_hnhfvrs,hnhfvrs,True,Palmer-Eldritch-2021,t3_racp7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delco/comments/racp7p/updates_on_the_school_funding_lawsuit_william/,Updates on the School Funding Lawsuit (William Penn)-- Results could dramatically shift costs to the state and away from local real estate taxes.,/r/Delco/comments/racp7p/updates_on_the_school_funding_lawsuit_william/hnhfvrs/,6,r/Delco,0,6

"I really appreciate your honesty!  I completely agree, a childs safety is ALWAYS paramount.  

I am not judging you or your family, please don't think that I'm trying to be cruel here.  You are going to have to make a very hard choice, very soon.

I worked in aggressive dog rehabilitation for many years.  I've worked in the best shelters with a ton of funding, and the worst nightmare shelters you can imagine.  I assessed and retrained dogs who were to be euthanized for human or other dog aggression, usually by court order.  Some of these dogs had killed other dogs, or severely mauled a human.  Out of all the core issues that would produce such violent behavior, recourse guarding was the most difficult issue to fix, and the most dangerous issue to retrain.  

There is no shelter that will attempt to retrain a bite history large breed dog with resource guarding.  A no kill shelters will absolutely not take him, and other facilities will euthanize within a few days.  

If you can't find a person to take him, you should take him to a vet with the bite history paperwork and have him euthanized.  You should be there with him, and see it through to the end.  

If you take him to any kind of shelter, he will die alone and terrified.  He will not be adopted, and he shelters will not promote him for adoption.  

Often, in my past work, I would encounter a dog with similar issues that simply could not be helped.  If you would leave food down, for instance, and forget for a split second, it would be all over.  These dogs would be fine for months, then decide they like a specific toy or object, and bite or even fully attack me to protect it.  I loved them all, but I could not help them.  So I stayed when they were euthanized.  I made sure they had one last special day.  I made sure they weren't afraid or alone.

Sometimes, no matter how big our heat is, there is nothing we can do.  The amount of time and money it will take to fix his issues is... Unreasonable to say the least.  It is dangerous for him to be around children, and the recourse guarding will not get better with time alone.

Call a vet, or a shelter that has one on staff.  If they don't understand, fuck them, and call another place.  This is a ""harsh reality"" situation, and although sad, it is not yet tragic.

Even if you're working 9hrs a day, his life alone for that time in a nice home is WAY WAYY better than a shelter.
