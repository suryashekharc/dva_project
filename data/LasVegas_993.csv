"Decent yes. Ellis Island did some remodeling recently and created The Front Yard Beer Garden so I don't think it will be dumpy. It's not a huge hotel or casino, and It's definitely not trying to be as fancy as Caesar's or any of the showy Strip Casinos. If you're staying for several days, you may find Ellis too small. If you do, luckily your really close to explore some of the Strip Casinos.

"I mean at 544ft higher I expect them to look different, but not just based on height. 

Rather, on the following:

-there's a hotel attached to the strat. 
-theres also a casino with restaurants and gaming floor
-theres a restaurant up at top. 
-there are 3 (I think) rides up at top 2 of which put you over the edge of the outermost circumference
-you can jump off of the 2nd or 3rd from top floor
- the space needle has a rotating GLASS floor vs a rotating tables where you can have dinner ( not a great dinner though). 


In 2022 it's $57 to go up to the space needle. 
It's $59 for the stratosphere including unlimited rides. And HALF OF THAT for locals. 

I will say that the view from the space needle is killer because I love the ocean and fog (when it's not blocking 100% of my view). 

But for what it is, the stratosphere is one of the last pieces of old Vegas that gives you bang for your buck. 

Those rides aren't for everyone, but they're fun, and the views on a nice clear blue sky day (no smog) are beautiful. 

The bar isnt expensive and it's overall fun. 

Also, I can see how this might seem like I'm a total shill but I'm not. 

I'm also pissed off that to the west of the strat is one of the most drug riddled and poor parts of our city. Given his thibgs are working out.

"Damn, really wasn’t expecting such a helpful and in-depth reply. Really appreciate you doing that. 

1. Sweet. That’s probably the route I’ll take for places not covered in the party pass.

2. Yea it honestly seemed too good to be true. A lot of the places I wanna check out are included in the pass, so I’ll deff get it when they release it for the rest of may. 

3. I may try to reach out to some promoters just in case. I was planning on getting into everything once they open the doors (except Marquee on Friday since flight arrives around 11am).

4. I might look into a table on the Terrace at the Omnia. I like club vibes but also love a good place more secluded to chill. 

Again, thanks for the reply!

"1. There's no cover if you buy a ticket, buying an admission ticket guarantees entry (unless they're at/over capacity then you'd just have to wait)
2. The party pass is shockingly a good deal, you get access to every nightclub and dayclub on their list for a select period of dates. I got it for 4th of july weekend this past summer and i did hakkasan twice, omnia once, and wet republic twice. All they did was scan my wristband and I was good to go.
3. Guestlist is free, but who gets in depends on the venue, the headliner, and when you arrive. Sometimes on only girls, sometimes its equal parts guys and girls in a group. You need to talk to a promoter to get on a guestlist, there's plenty of them and most are very chill. Promoters are easy to find online or on social media. Guestlist are not guaranteed entry, once they reach capacity you're turned away or have to wait an insanely long time (sometimes hours). You wanna get at the venue earlyy like when the doors open, forsure before midnight or 11pm.
4. All the places you mentioned are the most expensive places in vegas for bottle service, again it depends on where you're going and whos performing. They have something called ""minimum spend"" as in when you reserve you HAVE to at minimum spend x amount, the lesser the price the more likely you'll be put at the back of the club (they have maps on the club websites to show which section  your price range falls in). If you have the money to spend and want the experience id say go for it. Some of the clubs have clubs within the clubs, like Marquee has The Library and Boombox Room, or Omnia has Heart of Omnia and The Terrace. They'll be a cheaper option but you'll be away from the headliner and it will be a different genre of music than the main room. If you're going the same weekend as EDC weekend in late May, expect to shell out couple grand at whichever club you pick. The dancefloors are always crowded, especially at omnia, so just be weary if you're not about being packed in tight. The clubs are fun forsure, XS at Encore is massive and beautiful, the sound at Omnia is unreal, Marquee is on the smaller side but still wild af. For dayclubs theres lots of open space, they're so much fun, and you dont need a cabana or daybed but on those hot days they might be worth it.

Most people are saying don't do it because a lot of the time people have poor time management and it would not take very much wandering off course to miss your window of time and not make it back, but if you are solid and literally just go right to the taxi, go do your 20-ish minutes of soaking in the lights, then go right back to a taxi and the airport then you will be fine.

">But by the early 1990s, the Cold War was over, and bomb shelters, including the Arden shelter, were decommissioned.

Huh. Did everyone get rid of their nuclear weapons in the 90's? I must have missed that one. 

&#x200B;

>The blackboard list in the shelter included long-gone properties such as  
 the Landmark, Riviera, and Desert Inn. These properties could   
accommodate more than 30,000 people each. The total number of people,   
according to the board, was around 500,000. The Las Vegas metro area had  
 roughly 500,000 residents in the early 1980s.

"If you’re going for your Honeymoon, I recommend staying on the strip at one of the nicer properties such as Wynn/Encore, Venetian/Palazzo, Cosmopolitan, Aria, or Bellagio. My husband and I are mid 30s and prioritize our hotel and food in our budget whenever we go to Vegas. If it’s pool season we will pick a hotel with a nice pool and all of the above hotels mentioned do have great pool areas.

For food we will do one or two pricier restaurants and the rest of the time we’ll do more affordable options. So many choices on and off strip.

Alcohol is really overpriced and watered down. I never get buzzed while I’m there unless I’m drinking alcohol I purchased myself from the store. If you want to try a cute lounge or something go for it, but you will spend money. Buy your alcohol at a CVS or Walgreens and maybe just splurge for a fancy drink or two on one night of your trip. If you’re by the pool, maybe stick to beverages in a can or bottle. You at least know it’s not watered down.

"I don't have any experience with any facilities in Vegas, but I just want to extend a virtual hug and say that you've already taken the first step with acknowledging your struggles. For some that can be the hardest step.  


My one bit of info I want to share is that if you're looking for substance recovery groups, of course there's AA but there's also a great program called [S.M.A.R.T.](https://www.smartrecovery.org/community/) that is secular based recovery. If a god belief is not important to you, or your recovery is not faith-based, it's a great option. This is an [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdxYIcJjbMA&t=5s) about the program in case you're interested.

Liquid is more of a lounge. It’s a great spot but more towards locals/lounge style.

Tao Beach is about to open, and it looks very nice. That would be a fantastic location to go.

The consensus best pool party is Encore Beach Club. The best layout, talent, girls etc… they also require even ratio (same or more girls to guys) to get in for free, so there will be more girls there than say Wet Republic which has no ratio requirement.

Talent is a big factor as well in pricing and the level of enjoyment you will have.

I never used Uber until last week myself. I'm sure there are people that have had bad experiences(along with anything in life). I just never used it before because where i live its not used much and i have 2 vehicles so never needed a ride for anything but in Vegas it was great. Some of the drivers didnt speak much English which was fine as my wife and i arent very talkative and then had other drivers that talked our ears off but were great.

"They will, I’ve been playing it forever and I still have not gotten bored of it because of modded content. Someguy2000’s quest mods are amazing and I’d recommend ojo bueno texture pack and a weather mod like Nevada skies to improve the overall image of it and make it a little more realistic and beautiful. You’ll need to install a script extender and some stability mods for it if you haven’t already but there is a great mod tutorial by gopher if you’re new to modding but just don’t use project Nevada it’s outdated and you can install the standalone for every feature of that and it won’t make your load order unstable. Also fco is great for npc overhauls and I’ve had very few bugs using that. If you have a good enough gpu I’d also recommend the brightweight strip overhaul on the nexus as it really makes the strip pop like it does in real life and it’s actually stunning to look at in my current play through.

"I mentioned this in another similar thread. People who get into gig work do so because they're most likely bad with finances to begin with. That's how they got into the situation of needing to drive for Uber in the first place.

That's not an insult at all. Many smart and talented people are bad with money. I was bad with money for many years. It's really a skill that has to be learned.

Anyway, because of that, most people who think they are making money with Uber are not. The same way many small business owners think they're new business is making money until they go under.

You can tell by the way they post about their profit/loss. They'll estimate everything, the same way a paycheck person estimates what they spend until they check their bank account and it's empty. Then they wonder what happened to all the money. When they go back and check, it actually all does add up, but they had no clue because they were estimating and thought they had way more money than they did.

People remember the money coming in much more than the money going out. That's why you can't just estimate with financials. You'll always estimate wrong.

So yeah, you never make money with Uber or any gig work in the long run.",t2_j47c8,freq-ee,1,1648006030.0,0,t1_i1r2tjs,i1r2tjs,True,asseenonworldstar,t3_tk91wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/tk91wc/uber_drivers_of_vegas_how_much_can_i_make_per_day/,"Uber drivers of Vegas, how much can I make per day?",/r/vegas/comments/tk91wc/uber_drivers_of_vegas_how_much_can_i_make_per_day/i1r2tjs/,4,r/vegas,0,4
