As far as how reliable they are, I haven't had a problem, at times being about 10 minutes late, but very rare. I take the bus because gas prices are crazy so it helped me cut down the costs and it's been great.

I think Ventura harbor is more walkable. It's smaller but you can cover it all on foot. Only 10 minutes up the road. Also in Ventura, Main St. is very walkable and tons of shops.

"Raised in Oxnard, left and came back after college. The popular side of Oxnard is The Collection. Has bars, theater, bowling, lots of food. There are some private schools in Oxnard to look into not sure what grade you are looking for. During the summer we have the salsa festival and the strawberry festival:) its really great. In the holidays we have the Tamales festival, there is earth day, havent seen the cultural festival or jazz for a while. Oxnard/Hueneme had the 805 food truck festival last year. So there is stuff to do i think its just been quiet due to the pandemic. Oxnard has great breweries Casa Agria and Red Tandem. I personally really like oxnard, it is family oriented. Oxnard is known for its agriculture, and you can find local farm stores :). On the weekends there is a swapmeet in Oxnard college. In terms of safety I think its fine. Gangs used to be a problem and its been a lot better now. I live close to Colonia and I have never had any issues.

However, Oxnard has the cheapest housing along the coast in the state from north to south and one of the best climates in the nation that I still miss up to today. 

I take the family out there once in a while and they all like it.  They been putting pressure for  the past 2 years to move to Oxnard or Camarillo.

"Excerpts: 

> Last Tuesday morning, Yolanda Pina and Liliana Soria set up a table, a pop-up tent, and a banner that read, “Oxnard Tamale Festival.” The logo featured a goateed tamale wearing a Santa Claus cap while racing in a Volkswagen Beetle. They set up in front of Ocho Regiones Restaurant, the location for the grand finale for the latest installment of the city’s 14-years-and-running fiesta celebrating the Latin American foodstuff.

  In 2019, the Tamale Festival drew more than 10,000 people to downtown Oxnard. Nowhere near that many eaters were going to come by today.

> Construction blocked off one side of Ocho Regiones. The narrow streets of La Colonia, the historic barrio where the Oaxacan restaurant stands, made parking nigh impossible. A pre-sale push by the city drew only 41 purchases of a $10 box of four tamales.

> It was the second year in a row that Oxnard had relegated its tamale party to a to-go format due to COVID-19.

> .

> Tamale festivals are blooming across Southern California this weekend, from Indio to Long Beach, Placentia to Alhambra. All in-person.

> The organizers of the city-run Oxnard Tamale Festival refused to rush back to normal.",t2_97a3,BlankVerse,0,1638734034.0,0,t1_hnd3lg2,hnd3lg2,True,BlankVerse,t3_r9np62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/r9np62/column_in_oxnard_a_tamale_festival_persists_after/,"Column: In Oxnard, a tamale festival persists after becoming husk of its former self",/r/Oxnard/comments/r9np62/column_in_oxnard_a_tamale_festival_persists_after/hnd3lg2/,1,r/Oxnard,0,1

"Just to help out with some details here, Camarillo does in fact have air traffic controllers.  Oxnard has had airline service instead of Camarillo because of the terminal facility, runway length and instrument landing system, nothing to do with air traffic controllers.  And to put a finer point on it, airlines do not require a control tower to land.  They can and do fly into airports without towers.  Crescent City is a good example that comes to mind.  No tower but has scheduled airline service.

Airline service has never really worked in Oxnard.  We're too close to Santa Barbara, Burbank and Los Angeles.  It's convenient for passengers but has never been economical for the airlines.  If the can't make a profit they won't stick around.

People street race late at night, you read news report of 16 year old kids with guns, and there's so much dirty homeless people. I also had someone pull a gun on me on while I was driving through town. I honestly can't tell you 1 thing I like about Oxnard.

"1/3 (suggested max share of income to spend on housing) of $5400 is $1800. Subtract ~$150 for utilities, you get $1650 to spend on rent, or $1800 if utilities are included. Of course, you may already be paying more than this share for housing in which case adjust those numbers as desired.

Here is an apartments.com search for 1 bed under $1800:

We provide nearly 2.5 million transfusible blood components a year to patients in approximately 1000 hospitals in 28 states.   
  
It takes considerable resources to collect, process, test, ship, and manage this lifesaving resource. We greatly appreciate the donors who join us in helping patients. It would not be possible without their generosity.   
  
We owe it to the patients who receive those transfusions to have the most expert, capable people overseeing this vital work. We believe salaries should be both competitive and appropriate to the scope and nature of our work, and we do compete with for-profit corporations for excellent employees.   
  
So how do we determine salaries? Each year, Vitalant’s human resources department reviews compensation studies of similar positions in similar size organizations, both inside and outside of health care. We also regularly retain independent outside compensation consultants to review the compensation and benefits of our key executives to ensure they are appropriate as well as competitive.    
  
Additionally, we have a review system of checks and balances that works like this: we have an independent board of trustees representing the communities and hospitals we serve. The board has a compensation committee that reviews and approves our salary programs. The board determines the salary of our president and top executives.   
  
I hope this has answered your concerns. In closing, on behalf of the patients we serve and the people who love them, thank you for donating blood.",t2_3e4gdj6e,sdevillers,0,1622741241.0,0,t1_h0gotf1,h0gotf1,False,sdevillers,t3_ncifz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/ncifz8/blood_drive_at_residence_inn_riverridge_on/,Blood Drive at Residence Inn (RiverRidge) on Thursday.

"How much are you profiting on a pint of blood? $300? Although you may be non-profit, you're paying your executives very well, even executives that don't do any work\[1\]. Let's be honest, the patient in need of the blood will be paying for more than just the cost to process and handle the blood (that was donated), they are also paying for these high salaries, and in turn, there is no incentive to companies like Vitalant to create a more cheaper an efficient process for the end patient in need. Health insurance doesn't need to cost as much as it does in the USA. But because it has become such a (profitable) racket, pharmaceuticals/health have spent the most money in lobbying\[2\] for a given industry/sector. And people need to realize that health-care can easily be covered by the taxes we already pay, if we don't have to pay for these additional and unnecessary costs like these salaries or lobbyists that's passed on to us when we're paying for the medical bill & insurance. And this is why we're the only large rich country without universal health care\[3\].

"I’m based out of Los Angeles, so I only have passing knowledge of Oxnard based sailing organizations, 

If you are very new to sailing, then I would recommend taking an ASA 101/103 class to get the basics. Marina Sailing and Naos are probably the bigger sailing schools in the area. From there you have a few options and you just have to explore to find a right fit. 

Fairwind YC is basically a co-op that owns boats and members maintain them. They also do sailing lessons, but it can be hard to snag a membership there because they keep numbers limited. They are more daysailing/cruising oriented than racing oriented.

Googling “community sailing” usually brings up low cost options And that brought me to  Channel Islands Boating Center which looks like it could be interesting when it opens up again.

Also look into sailing and yacht clubs. The ones that have a racing calendar are the best bet for finding a ride. Don’t be intimidated by the words “Yacht Club.” Many of them are not that expensive to join and frankly you don’t need to officially join one to get started. Just look on their calendars for events open to the public or call them up and say you are looking to crew. A common starting position on a race crew is ”rail meat.” “Wet Wednesdays” means Wednesday evening races and I know there are some going on in Oxnard, but I don’t know details. Racing is fun and a lot of it is pretty casual, so no need to be intimidated. It is also a good way to learn quickly.

Lastly, you could alway try asking for a ride on r/sailing.  There’s probably someone from the area who is on that subreddit.",t2_12q8bd,Candelent,0,1620606699.0,0,t1_gxk0cno,gxk0cno,False,sworntostone,t3_n8gp08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/n8gp08/looking_to_meet_new_people_and_form_new_hobbies/,Looking to meet new people and form new hobbies,/r/Oxnard/comments/n8gp08/looking_to_meet_new_people_and_form_new_hobbies/gxk0cno/,3,r/Oxnard,0,3

"In a nutshell...

The OFTSE (Union) and the OUHSD (District) entered into a contractual agreement in October that stated any return to school for students and faculty would be voluntary. There was room for negotiation built-in which allowed for negotiation between stakeholders to occur if the Covid situation improved. Rather than negotiate the Union Contract, the District unilaterally made the decision to recall all teachers. This is a breach of contract. The issues include...unfair labor practices, breach of contract, lack of safety protocols, and a disproportionate amount of our school communities who would still be considered in the Purple Tier if looking at the data of individual communities vs on a county level. Ventura County was in the 2% margin, but Oxnard was 15-20% when the return to school mandate was posted. 15-20% is not safe. The numbers have come down, but are still above 5% as of today (Red Tier). The LAUSD requires all persons returning to campus to be tested. That is not happening in the OUHSD. Testing is provided to teachers on a voluntary basis. The MOU (agreement) requires smaller class sizes (up to 14 students 6' apart). The District wants to put 24 students in a classroom 3' apart. The case rates in our community clearly indicate that this is unsafe. In addition, we lack the janitorial staff to maintain the level of cleanliness in this situation. The district's response was to send teachers a youtube advertisement on how to use Lysol wipes. [https://youtu.be/pubSunAhcjA](https://youtu.be/pubSunAhcjA) They aren't providing the wipes btw. Anyone who feels generous today is welcome to flood the district office with wipes.

"You'll be fine, but it's not always the most pleasant road. 5th to Gonzales I haven't done a lot, but I bike Gonzales to Seaward a lot and there's a nice enough bike path that will keep you out of traffic.

"Hi! I'm actually moving to Oxnard from San Diego (been here since 2008) in two weeks with my boyfriend. Also mid 30's. His family lives there so weve frequented Oxnard a lot.

Oxnard is definitely different, and much more low key, than San Diego. But it has its draws, like the best mexican food an panaderias around, and beautiful beaches. Also I love the abundance of little meat markets/neighborhood markets, great deals on all meats!!

And Fun fact, the beaches around Oxnard dont have any bars (ignoring you, rudder room lol) or many vacation rentals (mainly residential) off the sand, so they're very peaceful and quiet. Much diff than the PB/mission beach scene!  

Then again if you're in to that, like others have said, Ventura and Santa Barbara are right around the corner. 

I'm excited to explore the hidden gems here!! The Collection is basically the ""downtown area of Oxnard, but honestly, I like the charm of the ""original ""downtown area by the train station. It's a cute place to wall around, although admittedly a little run down. And not so busy. But the homes around there are gorgeous to drive through.

"I grew up in Oxnard , and moved to SD 4 years ago. I always think about moving back because the big city life can be overwhelming sometimes. There’s a lot going on all the time.

If you like latinas , then you won’t mind living in Oxnard. I may be biased but Latinas are incredibly good looking.

"Excerpts: 

> If you want a case study on how to address the pitfalls, pandejos and promise in California’s fight against the coronavirus, get on the 101 North after morning rush hour and head to Oxnard.

> This working-class, super-majority Latino city remains the brown-skinned stepchild of a county where the split between wealthy suburbs and agricultural towns is straight outta the 1950s. So it’s little surprise the coronavirus has disproportionately ravaged Oxnard: The city represents about a quarter of Ventura County’s population but 40% of its coronavirus cases and nearly 37% of its COVID-19 deaths.

> Oxnard is the type of place where the coronavirus stalks the poor and powerful alike. Carmen Ramirez, a former City Council member who now represents Oxnard as a county supervisor, had a brother die of COVID earlier this month. Ventura County public health director Rigo Vargas, who grew up in south Oxnard, told me his wife lost an aunt because too many relatives continued to party over the winter holidays despite stay-at-home mandates.

> . 

> The situation is so dire that Ramirez said the county looked into banning businesses from renting out chairs and bounce houses (the move went nowhere because cities could simply ignore any mandate). But Oxnard also offers a counter-narrative that we don’t hear enough of when it comes to the media’s depiction of Latinos and coronavirus: resilience. Agency. And folks more than willing to call out their own community.

> One of the things that struck me the day I visited Oxnard was how blunt everyone was about the situation. They realize that the fight before them is both structural and personal — and everyone has to go into battle together, or die apart.

> . 

> For months, their coalition pushed for more pop-up testing clinics in the 93033 and 93030 ZIP Codes, which comprise 29% of Ventura County’s coronavirus cases. They frequently blasted Vargas during his biweekly virtual town halls, which he didn’t mind.

> The push is finally paying off — county-run vaccine centers have been opened in those ZIP Codes, and neighborhood schools and churches are now hosting pop-up testing sites. But Villanueva is still angry the move didn’t happen earlier.",t2_97a3,BlankVerse,0,1614203257.0,0,t1_gomqrve,gomqrve,True,BlankVerse,t3_lrnqlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/lrnqlf/column_what_oxnard_can_teach_la_and_the_rest_of/,Column: What Oxnard can teach L.A. and the rest of California about COVID-19,/r/Oxnard/comments/lrnqlf/column_what_oxnard_can_teach_la_and_the_rest_of/gomqrve/,6,r/Oxnard,0,6

>all quickly built shack houses to accommodate for the naval base

I remember seeing those kind of units around San Pedro many years back. They are very charming and adds character (much more character than sterile condos). 

>neighborhoods prices were driven up

Aside from the beach, what other areas are driving up pricing? I live in SoCal all my life but have actually never visited Oxnard. I would like to visit before all the historic and cultural resources are driven out by developers (after covid of course).

>developers are actively trying to come in and flip our city

City politics is super dirty where I live. I'd imagine it's probably like that for every city, especially cities with big development money coming in. I remember hearing though that for a little bit Long Beach activists were trying to turn back the tide by fighting for more rent justice and development restrictions.

The entire justice system is punitive based, not rehabilitive. Which areas of cities are usually most affected by crime? Lower income working class communities. More police means more tickets and arrests for people who can't afford them, leading to more people being introduced into that punitive justice system creating lasting generational cycles of poverty.

"That's the point STOP building, the more buldings/people the more they can charge for rent based off ""new/modern"" neighborhoods (collection) and also affect the lower income neighborhoods by saying ""look how much revenue we bring in, now we can rebuild those ugly neighborhoods"". 

Again going back to my example of the beach, not too long ago the beaches here were considered a ghetto in a way, especially the farther you go back in time. No modern beach front million dollar homes, all quickly built shack houses to accommodate for the naval base. So houses meant to be cheap get in and get out in a couple years until people started coming in, buying the land, developing, realizing there's beaches besides LA, and now what we're left with is a property value that doesnt match what was supposed to be. Now we have a million dollar beach so naturally the next step is build a harbor area to accommodate for those that cant be right on the beach (seabridge), another high income housing area that wasn't there. Because of seabridge, now the surrounding neighborhoods prices were driven up because of ""location/access to waterway"" and so on and so forth all through the city

And to you're other point of building in the open areas, that's VERY IMPORTANT FARMLAND that basically accounts for most of our local economy. We already shut down 4 of our biggest strawberry fields in the past 2 years to accommodate for more ""housing area"".

"> The property value of creating new housing usually causes rent increases

That doesn't have to be the case though. Local governments could require that a specific percentage of all new developments be set aside for affordable housing. I don't know much about local politics in Ventura County. Is this viable or has it been tried?

>increased police presence in surrounding neighborhoods, which makes it difficult for lower income working class families to continue living there affordably

How is increased police presence making things difficult for lower income working class families? Are you saying they are prejudiced against lower income folks and harass them?

Sorry for all the questions! I've lived close to many areas undergoing gentrification (San Pedro, Carson, Long Beach, Anaheim, etc).

"So basically Gangstalking term comes from people with mental illness with paranoia and delusions. Their delusions have been validated in online forums and blogs by other schizophrenics that talk about their paranoid delusions, so they are being validated by other people with mental illness suffering similar delusions.

Some of their paranoid ideas, for example, if they hear a firework or bottle rocket go off, they believe the perpetrator is someone who is following them and setting off the fireworks in an effort to apply psychological torture techniques against them. If you tell them its just people lighting off fireworks and its nothing sinister then they will attack you and say you're the one thats stupid for not knowing the truth about the sinister people following them and attacking them with these psychological attacks. 

Like i said, its mental illness, people that need help. The only thing i would worry about is if the person thinks you might be an agent of the conspiracy against them that they may confront you, so best to just avoid them and don't make eye contact.",t2_10rhrl,GueroBear,0,1607121048.0,0,t1_gen5i08,gen5i08,True,wsanchez99,t3_k6ei8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/k6ei8v/found_on_pole_in_oxnard_on_second_and_ventura_idk/,"Found on pole in Oxnard on second and Ventura idk what it means, anyone have a idea ?",/r/Oxnard/comments/k6ei8v/found_on_pole_in_oxnard_on_second_and_ventura_idk/gen5i08/,9,r/Oxnard,0,9

"“The event, which was held at Rio Lindo Park, comes a week before the 8th anniversary of Alfonso Limon Jr’s death. Limon was murdered by the Oxnard Police Department in 2012, while walking home from a workout at Pacifica High School.

Around 40 community members attended Saturday’s event. Members of Oxnard Revolutionary Study Group gave speeches on six victims of police brutality, including Limon, while informational slides and pictures were projected in the background.

The speakers also tied the violence and criminalization faced by Oxnard’s working class to capitalism, outlining the police’s role in protecting property rather than serving the people.

A colorful banner was produced, depicting community members, students, and teachers beating down a police officer and military recruiter, with the slogan “Cops and Recruiters Off Our Schools” written at the top, a nod to the ongoing campaign taken up by Oxnard Revolutionary Study Group.”",t2_92padzke,Dramatic-Leader-8592,0,1606548627.0,0,t1_gdugxeg,gdugxeg,True,riley_johnson44,t3_jaripw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/jaripw/article_on_the_history_police_brutality_in_oxnard/,Article on the history police brutality in Oxnard presentation from activist,/r/Oxnard/comments/jaripw/article_on_the_history_police_brutality_in_oxnard/gdugxeg/,1,r/Oxnard,0,1

"Yessir. It's safe.  I feel like the majority of the posts on this subreddit are asking this question, but here we go...

Most of what people hear about Oxnard is just that: what people hear.

To be clear, there are parts of town where you definitely should not be walking around alone at night. I'd confine it to a 1 block radius of Pleasant Valley Road between the canal and Saviers but I'm sure other people can name other places or completely disagree about that area. Most of the parts of town that people would label ""sketchy"" are just working class families not trying to cause or have trouble. And when you hear about somebody getting hurt or something going down, it was a personal dispute. So generally, people will leave you alone if you are out and about. I recommend driving around a little to get the sense of what your neighborhood feels like.

I do hear a lot of stories from young women of being tailed by people in vans or dudes catcalling from their trucks, so I would say it's sadly not completely safe for women.",t2_24gotrs7,PharaohStreet,0,1605072000.0,0,t1_gbwq68c,gbwq68c,True,Jloading808123,t3_js13k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/js13k2/new_here/,NEW HERE,/r/Oxnard/comments/js13k2/new_here/gbwq68c/,6,r/Oxnard,0,6

"I have to agree somewhat to user FriendlyBlanket. If you take a look at the Visit Oxnard social media, it is NOT representative of the culture or pace of this city. While it is a coastal town with excellent weather and decent proximity to both Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, it is not a beach town by any means. 

Having said that - there are a lot of great little finds and hidden secrets that allow for enjoyment because it's not a tourist attraction. The beaches here are never crowded, and you don't have to pay for parking. 

Home prices are cheaper, but they are starting to rise significantly. A lot of people afford to live here while commuting to LA or even working remotely for more metropolitan cities. As FriendlyBlanket stated, there are a lot of farms, and industrial businesses here, which naturally means a large low-income workforce and community. There is a large disparity in quality of life between neighborhoods in this city. 

Culture? It is very proud to have a migrant history with farm workers, and hard working laborers.",t2_7kqt9ip4,vegandodger,0,1600727578.0,0,t1_g65o1tw,g65o1tw,True,earsTOOBIG,t3_iwszm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/iwszm7/what_is_the_general_culture_of_oxnard/,What is the general culture of Oxnard?,/r/Oxnard/comments/iwszm7/what_is_the_general_culture_of_oxnard/g65o1tw/,7,r/Oxnard,0,7

"Look @ Mandalay beach (basketball courts) on Google Maps. Or, intersection of Neptune Sq and Mandalay beach blvd. This area is a ""locals-only"" beach and is way less crowded compared to Ventura Beach. The sand extends super far and is very fine. Most segments of the beach do not have any rocks. The waves are pretty decent. What stands out most is that its waters rank A+. For reference, Santa Barbara & Venice Beach both have a F grade water ranking. There are no runoffs to this beach area and the lack of people really make it one of the most enjoyable beaches in SoCal. 

&nbsp;

Be respectful & don't litter! The surrounding area around this local beach is also a unique ecosystem with a bunch of sand dunes. It's nice for bike riding.

"Hi Chris,

It's very respectable that you are out looking for a job at the age of 16. Are you officially enrolled in high school? I'm not sure about the summer time, but you do need a work permit from your school. There are some limits to your shifts. For example, you are not allowed to work past 10PM prior to a school night. 

&nbsp;

Take a look at your school's work permit & its rules. I will be honest; everyone is either trying to look for a job right now or will be scrambling to find one once pandemic assistance ends on 7/26 in California.

My suggestions to you would be in the following sectors & job positions:

restaurants as Dishwasher

gardener, freelance or with other companies in the area

farming, they *always* need help. I hear you can just go up to a farm and ask if they need help.

if you are interested in some higher entry jobs, I'd perhaps recommend getting a CNA (certified nurse assistant) license and working at a nearby clinic or hospital.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Stay away from retail, bars, schools, and construction. All of these areas will suffer more as time goes on. Many retail stores are shuttering with the recent wave of closures.

Hope this helps! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to DM me!",t2_135wde,Noanswer_merelyapath,0,1594148626.0,0,t1_fx8fklj,fx8fklj,True,CHRISXHURAPE,t3_hmqeru,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/hmqeru/job_search/,Job search,/r/Oxnard/comments/hmqeru/job_search/fx8fklj/,5,r/Oxnard,0,5

"I will open the discussion with the following:

The tone & mood have definitely changed since the last press conference. In his 07/02 press conference, Newsom was **VERY** concerned about spreading the message to stay at home during July 4th weekend. 

Based on the turnout at the beaches and the compliance of many businesses, it seems that many Californians elected to exercise personal responsibility and stay home. Gov Newsom definitely appreciated this fact and it shows in his relaxed posture & demeanor. 

&nbsp;

So, for that, I'd like to thank the community! Thank you for being responsible and caring for your community, your neighbors, your friends, your family, and yourself. Thank you!

&nbsp;

Back to the discussion... Today is the first day that I feel he has taken the strongest stance on re-opening. Despite soaring numbers, Newsom stands by his belief that with proper social distancing & face coverings, we can re-open California county by county. 

It's good to know that business owners have, for the most part, been responsible and are adhering to industry guidelines and standards. What is most concerning about this press briefing is the increase in cases in young populations. Newsom is worried that these ""invincibles"" will act ignorantly, spreading the virus within their communities and loved ones. 

&nbsp;
________________________

"I will open the discussion with the following:

Newsom is taking a conservative, evidence-based approach for shutting down certain sectors. Perhaps he feels pressured from the industries as shutting down gyms and churches without the ""data"" may upset many.

He's dodging some questions blatantly but I don't fault him. California is already so divided, it is difficult to willingly make yourself the ""bad guys"" and enforce masks with tickets. You risk further dividing your people. That's not the goal. We need to unify and work together.

I primarily live and operate in Central California. I'm glad Ventura beach shut down but hope that Santa Barbara and San Diego also close for the safety of everyone involved.

On a lighter note, I'm glad that the Governor is being a human through all this. He jokingly welcomed names like the Governator and Snoop Dogg on the PSA lists.

"Well it's about 45 minutes from LA, less than thirty from Malibu, next to Ventura, and 30 minutes from Santa Barbara. I loved my time there with the constant car shows and community events.

"Oxnard is going to offer you a lot of new things to try out but there are some key things to keep in mind! The city is predominately Hispanic, which means there is a great range of Mexican food as someone else has commented. The city is also very close to the beach, with the Pacific coast highway connecting right along Oxnard. I like to consider it just far away enough from LA that you're not in LA but still within range of a days trip. I generally (leaving at a good time with no traffic) can get to LAX within about 1 hr - 1hr 15. Santa Barbara is a 30-45 minute drive which is a nice place to visit on a vacation or for a days trip also. The mountains in Ventura County can get snow during the winter so it's only about a one hour drive away (although not for skiing or anything like that, more just to go sledding or enjoy a snow day etc.) There's plenty a good mix of outdoors activities well within a 1 hr range of Oxnard. Getting a vehicle is definitely necessary though since Oxnard (like most of Southern California) is a driving city and public transportation isn't commonly used. If you have any more in depth questions feel free to ask! I hope this can give you a broad look of not only Oxnard but also Ventura County (:",t2_52508lw,Dexamoose,0,1580202059.0,0,t1_fft1ioo,fft1ioo,True,[deleted],t3_euo1zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/euo1zp/moving_to_oxnard_from_eu/,Moving to Oxnard from EU,/r/Oxnard/comments/euo1zp/moving_to_oxnard_from_eu/fft1ioo/,2,r/Oxnard,0,2

"Yes the traffic gets hectic. You can avoid most of the traffic by leaving after 8:30 am or after about 6:30 pm. 

Another option which I often use is the commuter Amtrak train. It’s $50 for a 10-ride pass, so $10 roundtrip. The total time is longer than driving, but the train is relaxing so you can sleep, work, read, whatever. There’s a free shuttle both to and from the Goleta train station; the thing is the shuttle runs only at 7:20 am and 4:20 pm, meaning the train that leaves Oxnard at 6 am and leaves Goleta at 4:25.

"I feel this is an incorrect way of looking at it. More correct way is to compare housing + base living expenses to local average income, both on pee household and per capita basis, but percentage wise, not actual number.

For example, I'm moving to Oxnard from a city where average 1 bedroom apartment costs $1400 a month which is less expensive, and you can get actually good food + groceries for around $300 month. But average per capita income is 41k, unlike Oxnard. Minus taxes, insurance, etc., You people bring around 26-28k per year. Now you gotta live on that.

So actual net, not gross income percentages vs living costs is best way to look at it and get a better idea of how a place is doing.",t2_1wixemze,Reddittee007,0,1564323299.0,0,t1_ev9j9fq,ev9j9fq,True,[deleted],t3_cd0pl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/cd0pl5/oxnard_in_top_10_cities_where_you_can_make_6/,Oxnard in top 10 cities where you can make 6 figures and still feel broke,/r/Oxnard/comments/cd0pl5/oxnard_in_top_10_cities_where_you_can_make_6/ev9j9fq/,1,r/Oxnard,0,1

"OPD was under different leadership during Meagan Hockaday.

The Chief of Police was not originally from Oxnard. She was a woman of color and she herself had an Us VS them attitude. It is possible she came from an area that had a lot of distrust of police as well. It was her personal experience.

Regardless, she took this job while her son finished college here.

All the shootings of civilians that took place under her watch, she never wanted to answer to community leaders. She was always resistant.

I lived at the same apartment complex as Meagan when she was killed. They were arguing and she was threatening her fiance. Should she have been killed? No. But she did go after a cop with a weapon. Her fiance did not dispute that. He was the one that called for his safety.

Our new chief of police is born and raised in Oxnard.

We do need shelters and access to mental health, but I'm the type of person who buys them lunch, brings them a care package.

I don't look down on a person who has nothing.",t2_97r6e,charm803,0,1557895984.0,0,t1_enkgq7c,enkgq7c,True,[deleted],t3_bonre9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxnard/comments/bonre9/homeless_problem/,Homeless problem,/r/Oxnard/comments/bonre9/homeless_problem/enkgq7c/,2,r/Oxnard,0,2

Theres a guy around the channel island harbor that feeds the cats at night. Im guessing he’s getting them used to human interactions.

I would think not - if it’s a public street then its for public use.

"This was a while back, but it might have been down Saviers towards five points, then a right turn before Channel Islands (I don't think we went that far), and then on the way back passing through bard.

"You scheduled it in Oxnard? People recommend Santa Paula because of the lower intensity traffic.

However, you'll do just fine. 

At the bigger crossings west of Saviers with no traffic signals pay attention to what the pedestrians (yes, they do exist out there)
are doing on the far side. If they even think about stepping on the street you must not move.
