"# you cannot ignore the difference in frequency, speed, and weight of bike.

# 

* no, most bike party goers are not from other places. most are in the city. some come in from elsewhere. many people put their bikes on their cars for bike party because they don't want to ride alone through random parts of the city at midnight to get home.
* it's a once-perm month published route. more like a parade than the constant bunch of bullshit from the dirt bikers.
* yes, some assholes ride at oncoming traffic. that is the exception, not the rule. most people don't want those assholes where.

but the most important things is:

* **bicycles are way less dangerous to people and property**

they are MUCH slower and weigh an order of magnitude less.

I am a vocal critic of the dirt bikers but if they all just rode once per month, had quiet bikes that weighted 20lb and went slowly, I wouldn't care. I would think it was neat.

I'm not saying there aren't assholes who go to bike party and do stupid shit in traffic. most bike party goes don't want those people there and would ban them in a heartbeat if they could

"articles like this one make me lose hope for baltimore improving transit, but it's not really a baltimore-specific problem. most US transit planning is also equally bad. these people are trying to sound like they know and care a lot about transit. how much do you want to bet that none of them have actually fact-checked their assumptions about transit being green.

>But take a closer look at how much greenhouse gasses from motor vehicles contribute to our growing climate crisis, and you just might see the unmistakable connection here.

let met fact check this for them:

|energy consumption per passenger mile of the baltimore light rail (pre-covid):|2200 BTU|
|:-|:-|
|energy consumption of a Tesla model 3 with a single occupant:|857 BTU|
|energy consumption of Tesla model 3 with average occupancy (PPM):|571 BTU|

ohh, look, an EV actually uses a fraction of the energy. even a fraction compared to the best performing intra-city rail in the US.

[source1](https://www.tesla.com/en_EU/support/european-union-energy-label),  [source2](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/14/3719/pdf),  [source3](https://www.reddit.com/r/transit/comments/qitrt4/north_american_transit_vehicles_actually_use_a/),  [source4](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1040-july-30-2018-average-vehicle-occupancy-remains-unchanged-2009-2017)

I would expect this kind of thing would be a surprise to people who don't think much about transportation because it's easy to forget that a modern EV uses about 1/5th to 1/10th of the energy per mile compared to cars of decades ago.  however, if you are an advocate for transit, work in transit, advocate for green policies, or work/volunteer in a capacity relating to city planning, you would hope that they would sit down and do some basic research. it really saddens me to see such obvious, glaring mistakes by people who are supposed to be helping us plan our city.

but you might say:""but /u/Cunninghams_right, surely all those people in one vehicle is cheaper, so it is still a fiscally responsible to encourage people to ride transit"". but you would also be wrong in that fact as well. a full train is very cheap and efficient, but most trains aren't even close to fully except for the morning and evening rush hour peak. most of the time, they run around mostly empty.

|Cost per passenger mile of DC metro|$0.85 PPM|
|:-|:-|
|cost PPM St. Louis light rail (MTA does not give data for our light rail, likely out of embarrassment)|$1.01 PPM|
|cost to own/operate an EV|$0.40 to $0.60 per VEHICLE mile|
|cost to own/operate an EV, PPM|$0.27 to $0.40 PPM|

an EV costs about 1/3rd of what efficient/effective transit costs, and around 1/5th of what baltimore's transit averages...

[source1](https://www.onestl.org/indicators/connected/metric/transit-ridership),  [source2](https://www.bistatedev.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/0000-Final-combined-book-for-print-for-Web.pdf),  [source3,](https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/transit_agency_profile_doc/2019/30030.pdf)  [source4](https://newsroom.aaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-YDC-Brochure-Live.pdf).

# running more frequent trains/buses means higher cost per passenger-mile and even more energy per passenger-mile. so why are we trying to double-down on a failed strategy?

well, there are really only two reasons:

1. most planners have their brains stuck in early-mid 20th century and try to pretend that EVs are just a bad dream
2. it would be very unpopular to make a ride-share program with EVs for poor folks since those who are paying the taxes for our transit often don't have as nice of cars, so we'll keep paying even more than a Tesla to carry people around on shitty buses because it helps hide the unsightly truth of how expensive out transportation welfare system really is
3. you cannot fit that many cars on the road. we would rather pay poor people to ride slow, greenhouse-gas producing buses and trains so that wealthier folks can continue using the roads.

# but there is actually a solution to all of this. and that solution is: (*drum roll)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\* >!Bicycles!!<\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

yes, that's right. there exists a solution that costs less per passenger-mile than the best transit in the US, uses less energy PPM than the best transit in the world. it makes people happier and healthier, and places like Amsterdam and Copenhagen prove that it can be easily done by folks of all ages and in all weather conditions... and the best part, is that bikes take up such little space that we would no longer have to pay poor folks to stay off the roads. everyone, from all walks of life can share the space.

now, not everyone can ride a bike, though places like Amsterdam prove the the vast majority of people can if they try. however, there are other options than just 2-wheel bikes. there are [three-wheel e-scooters](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/4be46c23-1ff4-42ca-bfdf-0f71f4b6c10b_1.c62763e586d25262024ec7b2d75d8776.jpeg) for those who lack the balance and the physical fitness to bike a couple of mile on their own. there are [three-wheel cargo](https://www.babboecargobike.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/babboe-curve-e-vlt2020.jpg) bikes that can carry kids. there are rental scooters and rental bikes for those who do not yet have one and contracts can be let by the city to ensure that many of those are 3-wheel electrics. on top of that, you can still run some transit. a handful of select routes can be made into BEV busways and demand-shuttle service can be used for handicapped folks and to fill in the gaps.

the article gives a brief mention of Complete Streets, but just like how half-assed the complete-streets initiative is, so is its consideration by the big-brain folks who think adding more buses for marginal increase in ridership is the solution to climate-change.

"I will try to keep my saga short, but upon moving into a brand new renovated apartment that was 'ready to move in' in Winter, I had no AC, no heat, and NO hot water  (illegal!!) for well over a month. During this, they were impossible to get ahold of. In fact, since October, I still haven't gotten ahold of a single Chasen person. They've ignored phone calls and emails and when I finally started threatening to sue and get out of my lease, they had the other management company who only handles maintenance reach out (but still did literally nothing). They have number locks on all the doors and when I first moved in, maintenance people were letting themselves in while I was sleeping because no one told them someone had moved in. This happened a handful of times before I finally sent enough emails and made enough calls that I was able to get an additional lock on my door. The gym I was told was in the building wasn't able to be accessed until months later, the storage I was promised with my lease still hasn't been actually given to me. I also pay $250 a month for guaranteed parking. Only until recently, they didn't have a way to watch this so the parking was constantly full and I'd have to pay to park elsewhere. I reached out about this multiple times and they refused to reimburse me for the additional parking or take money off of the parking I pay them for. They have now given parking permits so we can call to get people without them towed, but fairly sure they've over sold them since people are having to park in random areas that aren't supposed to be parking (and I've seen parking pass #s higher than the actual # of spots). They've been a nightmare to contact about literally anything since the moment my lease was signed. Which was really sad because they were amazing to work with up until that moment.

I know not everyone has had issues with them, but plenty of people that I've talked to have.

And if they see this, they probably know exactly who I am and I hope they reach out (but hahahahahahah they won't).",t2_1zaee7rl,roseapoth,0,1648253954.0,0,t1_i24vgoh,i24vgoh,False,pb429,t3_to7dc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/to7dc3/1_br_housing_downtown_for_less_than_2000/,1 BR Housing downtown for less than $2000?,/r/baltimore/comments/to7dc3/1_br_housing_downtown_for_less_than_2000/i24vgoh/,7,r/baltimore,0,7

"Hey I row and am involved with BCR. If you’ve never rowed, look into the learn-to-row sessions that are starting soon. There is a fee for that and you just pay that fee, no equipment rental fees. I actually don’t know what that’s for, maybe that’s a kayak rental fee? I haven’t heard of someone renting a rowing shell. 

After learn-to-row would be foundations, an intermediate level group, then an “open” group that does as you say: recreational, general fitness, people of all ages and skills. Lastly there is a competitive group that is experienced rowers who enter club races.

Hope that helps!",t2_1jt6v0h,tr6908,0,1648249134.0,0,t1_i24l3l2,i24l3l2,False,BMoreOnTheWater,t3_tkzvod,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tkzvod/baltimore_rowing_club_five_minute_histories/,Baltimore Rowing Club (Five Minute Histories),/r/baltimore/comments/tkzvod/baltimore_rowing_club_five_minute_histories/i24l3l2/,1,r/baltimore,0,1

"When I was a kid about 6-10 of us would ride our dirt bikes in the city. We were in a wooded area, with houses around us on both sides of the woods. The ONLY time we had trouble was IF we actually rode the bikes to the woods, so we just costed on them and/or pushed them to the woods. We did not fire them up until we were in the woods. Never once did anyone complain about noise.

I honestly believe that a place could be setup for them to ride, where complaints would be non-existent IN the city. .... But the problem would be how would the kids transport their bikes to the site, and then the liability issue. 

We were luck, we all lived across the treet from the wooded areas we rode in.

I do recall one time riding out of the woods, hitting a bump and going airborne a bit ... and right there parked on the road was a Baltimore City cop. He waived us over to his car, now you know he saw us jumping the bikes .... and he said "" Now I just know you did NOT ride those bikes out of the woods! "". I smiled and said "" no sir, I pushed it out! ""

">B-360 ""has taught more than 8,000 young riders how to ride safely while equipping them with practical STEM stills to fix and maintain bikes. B360 has been one of the main catalysts to decreasing dirt bike-related arrests in Baltimore

this is complete crap. the measure of the effectiveness of the organization should be whether or not they can stop the dirt bikers from riding dangerously. instead, they're basically measuring success by how well they can keep assholes who endanger the lives and property of others from getting punished for their crimes.

# why does Baltimore city have to be lawless?

# why is it not about stopping the crime but rather just stopping the punishment?

# why does the bar have to be so low?

&#x200B;

yes, we should want to disrupt the ""prison pipeline"", but you do that by stopping people from harming others. harming others is why we have laws. humans figured out millennia ago that to keep people from harming each other for selfish reasons, that we needed rules of behavior around harm to individuals and their property and that a mix of punishment and rehabilitation are needed to ensure those rules are adhered to. in the 21st century, we shouldn't have to re-learn these basic principals of a society.

people wonder why Baltimore lacks investment. why it lacks tax revenue. why it lacks jobs. the reason is because people don't like this bullshit and they take their money elsewhere. for every job B360 has helped someone get in STEM, hundreds are lost due to people not wanting to invest in, live in, or visit baltimore. that is on top of the cost in property damage, insurance costs, and even human costs as these asshole have killed people before and on another occasion dragged someone out of their car to assault them.

laws exist for a reason. instead of being proud of stopping the punishment of the assholes committing the crimes, maybe the goal should be to stop the crimes.",t2_22u0ynwv,Cunninghams_right,1,1648227665.0,0,t1_i234yv1,i234yv1,True,locker1313,t3_tnlcvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tnlcvv/baltimore_group_hopes_to_build_permanent_dirtbike/,Baltimore group hopes to build permanent dirt-bike park,/r/baltimore/comments/tnlcvv/baltimore_group_hopes_to_build_permanent_dirtbike/i234yv1/,9,r/baltimore,0,9

"Thanks for following up. That being said, you did conveniently stop the paragraph before the next section which talks about out the stolen ones. 

“Adam Stelmack is one victim of dirt-bike thieves. In July, his brand-new Beta 250RR bike was stolen just hours after he bought it from the dealer.”

“The theft is getting worse and worse every year,"" Stelmack says. ""I'm on all these boards. A buddy of mine got two stolen a week or two before mine.""

“Plenty of bikes are seized as well. On the Tuesday morning of Sept. 1, an employee whose job is to drive a van through the vast impound lot to help people spot their cars estimated that there were about 1,500 dirt bikes ""in the cage"" at the impound lot on Route 40. (He asked City Paper not to use his name as he worried about his job.) Many of the bikes had been taken since January, he says, when there were none—or nearly none. A spokesperson for the city Department of Transportation puts the official number, as of early September, at 223.”

As for the impounds:

“You just need to have the right paperwork indicating it's correctly registered. ""That gets sent downtown and if it checks out you come back here and get your bike back.""

One would assume that the 1,500 number wouldn’t be as high if the majority of them were purchased legally. 

Obviously this isn’t everyone, the guy who had his bike stolen added: 

""Most of them seem like they're pretty good upstanding guys who just want to go out and have fun,"" he says. ""I wouldn't make the jump to think they were all assholes, stealing bikes . . . I used to think that. But now, talking to some on the phone, I think most of them are just like me.""

I’d hardly claim that a report was done that proves the majority were purchased legally.",t2_hj5kl,jwseagles,0,1648223203.0,0,t1_i22tdit,i22tdit,False,locker1313,t3_tnlcvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tnlcvv/baltimore_group_hopes_to_build_permanent_dirtbike/,Baltimore group hopes to build permanent dirt-bike park,/r/baltimore/comments/tnlcvv/baltimore_group_hopes_to_build_permanent_dirtbike/i22tdit/,6,r/baltimore,0,6

">The Transform Maryland Transportation Coalition, previously known as Save Maryland Transit, recently released our 2022-2026 Policy Agenda. We’re calling for the enactment of policies over the next five Maryland General Assembly sessions through the first term of Maryland’s next governor.

>These policies include:

>*     Creating a Baltimore Regional Transportation Authority;
*     Building the Red Line light rail canceled by Gov. Larry Hogan in 2015;
*     Increasing the frequency and reliability of Baltimore’s bus, light rail and paratransit service;
*     Increasing the frequency and reach of MARC service;
*     And piloting free or reduced fares for low-income and youth transit riders.

>While these items alone would go a long way toward creating the type of reliable, comprehensive transit system Baltimore and Central Maryland are lacking, they represent only part of our state’s need in the face of the growing climate crisis.

"The Baltimore Sun (all three papers) used  to be a top notch operation.

But this was back when it had some real competition in the Baltimore market in the form of the News American. I was not a fan of the News American, but I recognized that having them there was good for the Sun.

The News American eventually shut down .... and as a result the demise of the Baltimore Sun began to set in.

I pray that the Baltimore Banner breaks into the market in stride, and takes off.

Maybe its presence will serve notice to the Baltimore Sun.

I for one will subscribe to the Banner for at least a year or two, just to give it a boost!

"“""We don't steal no bikes. You see what he just whipped out? Them bands. That's all hundreds right there. We not stealing no bikes. Fuck them police, man. They terrible, man.""

Maj. Marc Partee, who is in charge of dirt bikes because so much of the action is in his district, the Northwest District, says a lot of Baltimore riders get the bikes off Craigslist. They either buy them or act like they're going to buy them, get a ""test ride,"" and take the bike around the corner where a friend is waiting with a truck and ramps, he says.

City police could not provide an estimate of how many or what percentage of the bikes motoring around the city were stolen. A county police spokesperson couldn't either, saying that before last year, ""those particular stats were not even tracked"" by the Uniform Crime Reports that go to the FBI each year. City cops seize dirt bikes and ATVs but not if they are registered with the state. The first day of the Reisterstown Road ""traffic calming"" detail, officers stopped a truck with four bikes on it—all legitimately registered in Pennsylvania.”

> In Baltimore — home of the infamous dirt bike pack the 12 O’Clock Boys, who became the subject of a documentary — the police department created a task force more than a year ago to deter mobs of riders who regularly buzz through the city and disturb residents. Of the 420 dirt bikes police have seized since the launch of the task force, 88 were stolen, said Baltimore Detective David Jones. Many of the stolen bikes have been ripped off from dealerships and private owners in the suburbs around Baltimore County and from as far away as Pennsylvania and Virginia.

"Interesting that they specifically mention ""during the Biden presidency"" or was that you who added it?

Both administrations overdid it with the stimulus checks. They should have made it much more targeted. I qualified, but work from home in a white collar job. I didn't need that money. Ended up using it to pay down part of my student loans and buy a new TV. Hardly the best use of taxpayer money (I consider myself pretty progressive)

They should have made the checks more targeted towards people who really needed the money

In terms of the housing market, though, you can't blame Biden for that. It's a structural problem that's been building for decades. Too many NIMBY Boomers and Gen X'ers, too many politicians cozy with luxury developers, not enough support for lower and middle income people to buy homes, generational wealth gaps due to discriminatory lending practices that kept Black folks from owning.

"Looking for greenery, I’d probably avoid Fells, but Patterson Place, Butcher’s Hill, and Upper Fells are also pretty close to the Park and a few smaller parks are there too; all three look like they’re along the Canton Route.

All of these are great neighborhoods close to lots of green stuff, fairly safe and dog friendly neighborhoods; you could probably draw a circle in Zillow ~3-4 blocks deep on all sides and be in a good place. (Maybe fewer blocks north/south as those are long blocks in most of Baltimore).

"I hope you find your stuff, or are able to replace it without too much hassle.  Please take at least a few minutes to learn how credit works, though - if you and your partner have a joint credit card account, you DO have a credit history.   Spend some time on google, in one of the personal finance subs, or stop by a local bank and meet with someone to learn more.  Having a credit card that you charge a single thing to each month and then immediately pay off is better than not having a credit card at all, because when you someday want to rent a better place or get a car loan or whatever else, they’ll pull your credit report and see that you have responsibly used a credit card for X number of months or years, and that can justify them giving you what you’re applying for.   The reverse of that is that if you have a credit card in your name that is maxed out, you will get rejected, so it’s important to know (and if there are issues/mistakes/fraudulent charges, these can be fixed!).

"Yeah, to be clear, there is no “walking around” in any of these Hopkins studies I’m aware of. Having gone through it, you *can’t walk around.*. Like, physically. I’m laughing while writing this because there is *no way* you can do that. 

Fun small story: I was told that most subjects will either throw up or defecate in the first half hour. I was lucky and just had to take a shit. That hit about 30 minutes in. I told the guides as much and they took me to the bathroom where I carefully sat down and proceeded, I thought, to absolutely *shit everything inside of me out for an hour*.  I looked down at some point and the little square tiles were very, very wavy. Lots of movement. So I finished, cleaned up, and got up to wash my hands. 

Pro tip: when on a heroic dose of pharmaceutical-grade psilocybin, do not — I repeat — *do not glance into the mirror above the sink.*. The face you see will not be yours. It will, but it decidedly won’t. 

I made my way to the bathroom door where the guides were waiting and I apologized for taking so long. They were kind, and one said, “It’s okay, your perception is shifted. You were only in there three minutes.”  They then took my hands and very slowly walked me the 15 feet back to the couch.

"In 2019, City Council unanimously voted in favor of a first-in-the-nation plan to end our dependence on the massively polluting trash incinerator and expand recycling and municipal composting.  It would produce 10x as many jobs as our current system and do it in a way that would benefit communities plagued by years of underdevelopment and systemic racism.  The plan was created by consultants from the top Zero Waste firm in the country, who had drafted similar plans for Austin, Boston, San Francisco, and other cities that have pulled off this kind of transformation (or at least are in progress.)

Then, mayor Young went behind everyone's back and signed a 10-year renewal with the BRESCO incinerator that guarantees them income even if we reduce our trash output.  So, even if we do recycle more and have less trash to burn, the incinerator still gets paid.  Thanks, mayor Young!

"Whew that was a lengthy article lol. But to answer your question, I'm guessing they had environmental money to spend from the budget or from fed tax breaks. Also, I think to try to help out with the rat problem by making the recycle bins with lids (which is helpful to those of us who do regularly recycle, regardless of what the city does with the materials once they get it). I do think the article provided some good insight as to why most of our materials don't get recycled. I had no idea that ziploc bags, cling wrap, and plastic bags can destroy a whole load because they jam the machine. You'd think that just like a bill sorter can distinguish between a $20 bill, a $5 bill, and a $1 etc., that a huge machine would be just as sophisticated, especially when Baltimore has been at this recycling game for decades",t2_gtcgfekx,mindblowningshit,0,1648171770.0,0,t1_i20d6mw,i20d6mw,True,FeedUsFetusFeetPus,t3_tnai4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tnai4a/anyone_else_wonder_why_and_how_much_money_the/,"Anyone else wonder why and how much money the city spent on passing out new recycling bins when they only recycle 2% of ""recycled"" materials?",/r/baltimore/comments/tnai4a/anyone_else_wonder_why_and_how_much_money_the/i20d6mw/,9,r/baltimore,0,9

"Yes, put bluntly you are not going to get a recommended, ""walkable"" white neighborhood with that filter. I asked this sub about a couple of neighborhoods and did extensive street view trips (I was buying from out of state, I never saw this house till I moved in because of my health issues. My husband saw it at inspection, we toured via zoom and a very good realtor who really understood what I wanted. 

But we had to go way outside the box with these searches -- I'd never even heard of the neighborhood I'm living in, though it was right across the park from one of my main targets (I picked Belair for my flair because Parkside isn't available and it seems geographically closest, but my main target was that little part of Belair Edison that's right below Mayfield. So, I ended up really close.) One thing that's come from this is that I really think people who move here draw *much* too narrow of a window for what neighborhoods they consider, and this sub especially is too narrow with what it recommends. I may be singing a different song come summer, but it would surprise me if I did. Consider, our first night here was NYE and I didn't hear a single gunshot. One car honking, distant fireworks, and silence. No porch thieves. Small but nice yard, end unit. No litter on the street. One rat sighted so far. When I lived here last time I was in Reservoir Hill. All of the things I said I haven't seen here, I did see there. I feel much safer here! Grocery store in walking distance, too.

I think I got pretty good at using street view to figure out whether should be concerned or not. I wandered around the neighborhood of each hit that looked good, and especially tried to see if it would let me look at back alleys (sometimes it does). How much litter do I see? Do I see outdoor furniture? (In a risky neighborhood people often won't leave out good porch furniture.) Gardens and pots of flowers? How many vacants? General state of the houses? Look at the date of the image captures to make sure they're fairly recent but most that I saw are within the last 2-3 years. Butterfly neighborhoods aren't going to change that much in that time span. It's not an answer for people who are young and want someplace with lots of restaurants and shops they can walk to and has the money to pay for it. But for people who can't afford the Fed Hill, Hanpden, Patterson Park, etc . recommendations and just wants a practical house for not a lot in a stable neighborhood that's decently safe, that is super achievable here!",t2_i1umt,pestercat,0,1648168974.0,0,t1_i206yie,i206yie,False,WhoGunnaCheckMeBoo,t3_tl3ula,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tl3ula/baltimore_and_glen_burnie_rank_among_top_20/,"Baltimore and Glen Burnie rank among top 20 cities for rise of Gen Z renters, RentCafe study shows",/r/baltimore/comments/tl3ula/baltimore_and_glen_burnie_rank_among_top_20/i206yie/,1,r/baltimore,0,1

"There isn’t any one easy answer. A big part of the story is likely base effects and the challenge of measuring inflation during a pandemic.

Pre-pandemic, the Baltimore MSA’s CPI hovered a bit above the national rate. During 2020 inflation was lower in Baltimore than the rest of the country so our CPI was actually lower than that of the rest of the country. Some examples:

In February 2019:

-	US CPI: 252.776
-	Baltimore CPI: 254.433

In February 2021:

-	US CPI: 263.014
-	Baltimore CPI: 261.917

Now, our CPI has caught back up to about where we were pre-pandemic if you measure relative to the country as a whole. In February 2022:

-	US CPI: 283.716
-	Baltimore CPI: 286.243

If we calculate back to pre-pandemic, you get a different view of things:

Relative to February 2020 (2-year inflation):

-	US: 9.7% inflation
-	Baltimore: 10.5% inflation

Relative to February 2019 (3-year inflation):

-	US: 12.2% inflation
-	Baltimore: 12.5% inflation

So prices have been rising a little faster here, but not as high as the initial report suggests. Depends on how long a view you want to take as well as to how much you think prices have changed relative to the US.

So what’s changed between Feb 2020 and Feb 2022? The good news is food and housing have increased by less, as has energy costs. Over the last two years what has increased faster is medical care, transportation, education, and “other goods and services” which includes everything from tobacco to haircuts/mail services to funerals. Again, if you take a longer view there isn’t a huge difference between the two.

"(Pardon me, but I'm pretty angry) What implied I'm not?  By have fun I mean there's nothing to take, nothing to spend, and if they ruin my credit I'll file for bankruptcy I guess bc I'm already bankrupt.

I'm facing inevitable eviction, lost the best job I ever had months ago, can't get hired anywhere and now this.  Believe me. I have to laugh about it or you'll hear about my very public suicide.

I just also don't even know how credit works because the only credit card I have my partner opened for me as a joint account.  I never used the card and I know nothing besides debit which is a cash app card because it's easier to set up especially when flat broke.  

I filed a police report and printed a copy. I told people in my building, I am in the process of contacting SSA/IRS (easier said than done) and my building (which will yield no results bc I have a slumlord). I just kind of need to laugh at it.  Because it's stupid.  The thief didn't get a laptop and I get a security crisis so they can find out I'm broke and my dad owes the IRS.

"I participated in a psilocybin study at Hopkins in 2015. Smoking cessation. I believe I was one of only two in the group of 57 or so who did not quit smoking long term. 

But for me that is beside the point. The true benefit I got from that session was an incredibly intense, incredibly introspective trip with myself through a much broader and more incomprehensibly enormous place than I had ever been. There, with an eye mask on and wearing headphones that pumped in a variety of music ranging from classical to Gregorian chant, I spent almost nine hours with all ego and emotional hang-ups removed, like corn silks and husks stripped away from the closest thing to my individual soul and personage. 

This wasn’t a simple “mushroom trip,” it was a guided session while under what was later described to me — as referred to in medical literature — as a “heroic dose” of pharmaceutical-grade psilocybin. 

It was, to put it mildly, perspective-inducing. 

I got a sense of the precise place I occupy in this vast universe, and to know your smallness and, incongruously, the absolute improbability of your miraculous existence at this time and in this space…it’s nearly indescribable. 

Did I quit smoking? Not then. Was it worth it? 

That one session was better than eight years of weekly therapy. 

You’re goddamned right it was worth it.

"It’s not inconvenient if the security door is unlocked. The package is likely to get stolen if it’s visible. That’s one issue. The other issue is no one takes city routes. 

There are no “full time regular Amazon drivers”.  Amazon doesn’t employ drivers. Every delivery person is a contractor or sub contractor. There are also no “rented vehicles”.  Drivers deliver in their personal vehicle or a leased blue Amazon van. The drivers in their personal vehicle are *usually* early morning or late evening. They’re not supposed to knock before 8 am or after 8 pm. I have no idea what trucks you’re talking about. Maybe vans. But the tractor trailer trucks don’t deliver packages to customers. 

The thing about drivers in their personal vehicle. No one wants Baltimore routes. So the packages sit at the Amazon station for days until some one finally takes it. Like I posted before. It’s usually down fo the Hispanic immigrants cuz they can’t talk their way out of the city routes. They’re usually bringing their kids along. They don’t speak English. A lot of times they have some one else’s ID to check in. I guess they don’t take the time to knock cuz the kids or cuz they don’t want to get in trouble or some thing. I’m only guessing. 

I think it’s weird you get off yelling at thieves. Especially knowing the driver gets in trouble for stolen packages. Why put other people down for your kicks?

">On November 26, 2004, according to Maryland land records, the Thompsons signed an agreement to appoint Nick, who at the time was engaged to their granddaughter, as their agent and attorney.  
>  
>This was done despite the fact that Marilyn Mosby was then a third-year law student and Nick Mosby had no legal training.  
>  
>The specific purpose of Nick’s POA was to use the Thompsons’ assets to “finance and obtain title to” a rowhouse in Reservoir Hill owned by Baltimore City.  
>  
>Nick and Marilyn purchased and moved into the house, while the Thompsons, back in Massachusetts, were named as co-owners in the deed along with Nick.

What would be the reason to give your granddaughter's fiancé POA over your estate? If the reason was just to buy a house, why not just gift your granddaughter the money? And  why wouldn't Marilyn at least be a co-owner of the house?

Just really odd, questionable decisions being made, even way back in 2004.",t2_ppp4g,rockybalBOHa,0,1648126138.0,0,t1_i1xa2yq,i1xa2yq,True,aresef,t3_tkvxsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tkvxsj/giving_from_the_grave_marilyn_mosbys_dead/,Giving from the grave?

"Thank You I'm working through that list as I type.

I'm in a tiny apartment and only had two places I put it. Searched everything anyway.  Checked every square inch and I mean that - there's a lot of open space so nowhere for it to hide. Searched where I was staying. Going to search the security cameras there.  I distinctly remember having it in a bin and securing it but then I don't remember it being there when loading onto the elevator.  Hoping the mail room cameras caught something.  Worst part is the days turned into a blur and were already traumatic for other reasons.  And maintenance has been unsupervised in my apartment too.  There's a hard drive missing as well.  Which is just like... great.  The hard drive I know exactly where I left it and it's gone from there. Still can't tell if it was a theft of opportunity while the stuff was sitting in my apartment or on the window sill.

"I'm sorry you're going through this. Assuming it is indeed stolen, one positive thing is all of those things can be replaced, but: 
1. First, I'd file a police report anyway since the things potentially stolen could be used for identity theft. 2. I'd call/contact SSA about the card. 3. I'd call/contact the licensing board about the provisional license. 4. And I'd contact the state health department (or whatever body) that issued my original birth certificate. 5. For the name change stuff, if it has been completed/filed I'd just get new copies. If it hasn't been filed I'd prepare to reproduce those documents so I could go about filing them... Probably the biggest pain on this list. 6.  I'd also notify my parents that their SSNs may have been stolen so they can take their own action steps. 

Now assuming maybe it wasn't stolen, I'd probably check whichever vehicle helped transport my stuff thoroughly, the place/home I moved from, and the new place again. If I had a personal vehicle I'd also check there.

"I can only speak for a certain segment of real estate but a few times for curiosity's sale I've run my realtor app filter around other places just to see how many hits I get. 2+ bedrooms, 1.5+ baths, <200k, for reference.

Philly they're usually fixer uppers that need a fair amount of fixing to be move in condition. Baltimore gets me a plethora of good quality hits-- not as many as it did pre-pandemic (I've been waiting to move for a LONG time), admittedly, but still more than enough for us to finally pick a place and buy it.

"Baltimore has a lot of museums, so check out the exhibits up during the time you come. Here are a few other ideas that come to mind if you only have a 1/2 day and are comfortable walking. I listed the neighborhoods where possible.

\--Walk 10 minutes around the harbor and go to the top of Federal Hill (the actual hill) for a beautiful view of the Baltimore skyline at dusk. Take a stroll around the harbor in the other direction, 15 minutes. Visit the aquarium in downtown. Keep walking east (5-10 minutes) and check out a beautiful view of the city from Bygone- a bar in Harbor East at the top of the Four Seasons. Be sure to check out their dress code first. Walk east (10 minutes) and check out the cobblestone roads in Fells Point. It's not what you would expect to see in a city. There are a lot of restaurants and bars there.

Food-

\--You can hop up to Hamden via rideshare. There are some great restaurants there.

\--If you eat meat, Maiwand Grill (not Maiwand Kabob) has a fantastic chicken kabob (downtown/inner harbor).

\--Crabs at LP Steamers (Locust Point)

\--Ekiben (Fells Point). Cool fusion food. The owner is a great guy and his passion trickles down to all the staff. You can't eat there so you'd have to take it to go. You could pick up food and eat it on the benches in the grass next to Bond Street Social.

\--For a beautiful view of the city during dinner- Rusty Scupper (Inner harbor). It's pricier but I have no idea what your budget is.

\--Also a beautiful view but less pricy: Topside (Mt. Vernon). You'd have to rideshare

Music-

\--If you're a jazz buff by chance, Keystone Korner is in Harbor East. It's owned by the same person who owned the well-known Keystone Korner in SF decades ago.

\--Fells Point has several bars with band that do covers of popular songs

\--Cats Eye Pub; music varies

Those are just a few suggestions that come to mind.
