"I grew up on Stone Spring, just across from Prowell...my parents still live there. The homes on the Prowell Drive side are generally more prone to flooding since many appear to be in or *just* above the floodplain.

I'm sure the dam not being replaced (well, replaced and then removed) will help with it, although if you have a time with steady heavy rain, the water may still come up to the road and beyond. 

I heard it was a resident on Prowell that complained, leading to the dam going away. I don't want anyone to get flooded out, but I do miss being able to kayak without hitting the bottom constantly.",t2_elsw2han,heycoombsie,0,1648266412.0,0,t1_i25jzo7,i25jzo7,True,Hoglord,t3_tnebx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/tnebx2/condguunet_crewk_flooding_in_camp_hill/,Condguunet crewk Flooding in camp hill?,/r/Harrisburg/comments/tnebx2/condguunet_crewk_flooding_in_camp_hill/i25jzo7/,1,r/Harrisburg,0,1

"What exactly do you use as a rubric for how ‚Äòsafe‚Äô a community is? The thing about metropolitan areas in a state with a decades-long history of financial misappropriation & abuse is that anytime you pack together 50,000 people of varying lower-end income levels into a relatively small area, you're **going to have crime**.

From my experience the bad neighborhoods are obvious, and the crime stays isolated to those pockets across the city. It's very WYSIWYG. I've lived 2 blocks from the river just before 2nd Street in Midtown Harrisburg for almost 5 years now and in that time there have only been 3 shootings within a 2-block radius (further eastward away from 2nd Street) and 1 swat raid a couple houses away. Never anything that has ever directly affected me or my neighbors! Obviously nothing like Philly.

If you want the near locality of Harrisburg but are paranoid about safety consider options along the west-bank of the Susquehanna river opposite to Harrisburg, boroughs & towns such as Enola, Camp Hill, New Cumberland. This is where price becomes a larger consideration though.

People enjoy Harrisburg because it sits right at the happy-medium precipice of many aspects people look for in a city. If safety is a primary checksum for you I think it'll be obvious to you how safe an area surrounding your potential housing is just by a quick look around google streetview.",t2_dp1ddamg,MasterZosh,0,1647591250.0,0,t1_i14noj9,i14noj9,True,aapanda11,t3_tf7fja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/tf7fja/moving_to_harrisburg/,Moving to Harrisburg,/r/Harrisburg/comments/tf7fja/moving_to_harrisburg/i14noj9/,1,r/Harrisburg,0,1

"Not to be negative but nobody's suggestions here will come even CLOSE to what you're looking for. I too moved here from NYC, 5 years ago, and I've tried pretty much everyone's suggestions of ""closest to NY pizza"" level places and they all weren't even close. While I've found some that are thin crust and crispy, they still all lack something in flavor. One thing that helps though is to shake some dried oregano onto pizza around here--in NY they use a lot of oregano (and most places also basil) at pizzerias, here I've noticed there's zero seasoning it's just plain bread and sauce and cheese. So there's something ""missing"" flavorwise--if you're from NY it's most likely the oregano!

Immensely. Same with my kids (teenagers and young adults). There is no culture, no diversity, nothing to do, it's dingey and run down (yes, even those suburbs) and most people who live here were born and raised here and are very ""exclusive"" behaving.  It's like junior high, and when you are the new kid here, you're *always* the new kid. They don't welcome newcomers. Everyone I have spoken to who transplanted here has had the same experiences. There is also a lot of drugs (even in the suburban schools) and mental illness. Have spoken to several mental health professionals (due to my job) who say it is a crisis here.

">barely make above minimum wage

bro then you need to quit your job.  A minimum wage job is never worth the opportunity cost.  Move in with your parents and build a skill set in demand by the market.

Learn to code or something, call a recruiter, and entry coding jobs around here should see you start between 55-60k a year with the opportunity to build a career. 

After two years of hard work you should be making more than your blocks drug dealer and can probably start to think about crossing over to the west side, building a social life, and maybe even look at a home to invest in to settle down in for life.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Don't believe the people that just tell you to get a job.  A job can be a waste of time and hold you back from getting good jobs.  Good jobs require skills and investment in yourself.  Build those skills and invest in yourself.  You're 18, you're young.  Its ok to still be dependent on your family while you build yourself.

"Across the Harvey Taylor into Harrisburg... I would just park on the streets where there is no meter and walk. Just be careful with the day and time north of Forester, they do street cleaning certain days and certain hours are permit only parking for residents. The signs will give you the info you need. Like Herr Street, weekdays 8-10am and 3-5pm are permit parking only, the 2nd and 4th Friday from 8am-noon they do street cleaning.

Just in case, across the Harvey Taylor into Wormleysburg, there are painted spaces along US 15 (N Front St). No restrictions though (that I know of).

This way you aren't trying to find a parking lot that may or may not have a hostile owner.

"Agree with other posters.  On the positive side, you have an excellent budget for this area and can definitely be competitive in the market up here since real estate tends to be more in the 250-450 range.  You mentioned your child possibly relying on public transportation.  Although we do have good bus systems, they are somewhat limited.  However, please look into CATShare.  (capital Area transit) - it's a bus only for people with disabilities and it does a door-to-door pick-up/drop off (pre-arranged), it may help if you end up with a property not near a bus route, if your child is eligible.  

There are small pockets of walkable communities but they are disconnected.  Camp hill is a very desirable community.  Midtown Harrisburg as others mentioned.  Linglestown, Hummelstown, Hershey.  

Although it's definitely lacking a lot of what DC has to offer, it's still a lovely place!

"Ditto what the poster above stated. Harrisburg is a very small city, and kind of run down and ""has been."" Not much to do in the suburbs of this area either.

"First off, keep in mind that Harrisburg is a *small* city - you can walk across Downtown the long way in 10-15 minutes.  If you're expecting DC, you're going to be disappointed.  I'd strongly suggest taking a drive up here to walk around and get a feel for the city before you get too invested.

Condos aren't really a thing here.  There are a couple buildings with them, but the majority is either apartments or townhomes.  As for where to live, Midtown probably fits best.  It's a short walk to Downtown, you have the Broad Street Market and Radish and Rye for walkable groceries, and lots of nice restaurants and coffee shops nearby.  Downtown could also work, but parking is a bear and most of the places on 2nd Street cater towards the younger (20-something) crowd, so keep that in mind.

$500k is way more than enough to get a nice, renovated townhome in Midtown.  For the most part, the market tops out around $250-300k.  The suburbs can go significantly higher, but the city stays fairly cheap because the school district is terrible.

"Harrisburg is an underrated city. Offers a decent COL, and a nice QOL.

If you want a ""big city"" experience, however, you will have to consider Philadelphia or Pittsburgh (both are amazing).

Harrisburg is still a nice small city with a great location. Hershey, Carlisle, and Camp Hill are some other highlighted areas in the Harrisburg region.

You may also want to consider Lancaster, PA, another nearby nice small city with great offerings.

Good luck in your search and research.

""Thank you for contacting me about legalizing recreational marijuana. Pennsylvania‚Äôs medical program has been a national leader with its focus on scientific research.  Access to the safe use of medical marijuana has treated the symptoms of illness and other conditions for hundreds of thousands of patients. We must ensure clinical research on cannabis continues to be a priority.  
  
There are now 18 states that have legalized marijuana for adult use, including two of our neighboring states. Advocates of legalization rightly argue Pennsylvania will soon have to deal with the implications of purchases brought across our borders without the revenue or resources in our legal system to address them. This is in addition to the fact that marijuana prohibition has perpetuated organized crime, gangs, and cartels selling state residents product laced with toxic additives.  
  
Advocates say marijuana legalization provides access to safer products, supports tens of thousands of new jobs, and raises significant revenues to support law enforcement, educational programs, and state infrastructure projects. But issues of primary concern remain public safety and the societal impacts and costs to social programs of legalization. There must be assurances of robust DUI enforcement, strong deterrents for underage use and possession, and legal clarity for employers. It is vital Pennsylvania evaluate the successes and missteps of other states and thoroughly vet the key issues before enacting any new legislation.  
  
Again, thanks for writing me.""

"If I was moving into the Harrisburg Area in my 20s-30s with your preferences, I would be looking for housing in the following areas:

\- Linglestown Road, Harrisburg 17112 - Views of Blue Mountain, New housing/condo complexes, popular franchise restaurants, golf courses, quaint shops and eateries in the old town area, easy access to 22-322, Progress Avenue and Colonial Park retail outlets and Routes 81/83. If you want to hike the Appalachian Trail or take nature drives the valleys north of Linglestown along both sides of the Susquehanna River are gorgeous.

\- Camp Hill - Suburban City lifestyle, Cross the river in 5 minutes to access Riverfront park, seasonal festivals, downtown Harrisburg nightlife and a growing commercial district adjacent to Route 15 near Holy Spirit Hospital. In town Camp Hill has a new brewery as well as the Cornerstone Coffeehouse, a fabulous public library with foreign films and eateries within walking distance. There should be plenty of administrative job opportunities between Camp Hill and Mechanicsburg within 10 minutes.

\- Arcona or Walden Communities in Mechanicsburg - Rent or own new suburban planned communities with town squares featuring restaurants, coffee houses, salons etc. Both have decent access to retail corridors like Carlisle Pike and Rossmoyne/Simpson Ferry Rd. I have a girlfriend who lives in Arcona and she is happy there, good mix of young professionals, biking and walking trails and close to rural outlets as well.

"I went there for most of my childhood and adolescence and it was wonderful. I went on to college, graduate school, and then have had successful employment since. Sounds like you've done some research and have read about the basic philosophy so I won't describe it. Feel free to message me directly if you have more questions. Just to clarify some of the info in other comments, there is no other Circle School. It's just one school. It is similar to a Sudbury school, or a democratic school. There are many, many books about it. One of the best is called Free to Learn and is written by a psychologist who studies education and child development. Some people are turned off by it because it is so different from conventional schools, and it's hard for them to really wrap their head around it. This is especially true of conventional school teachers. They tend to be skeptical of Sudbury schools because the ideas don't really align with their idea that teachers should be in control of what and how kids learn. One commenter mentioned that they heard about a kid who wasn't on grade level with reading and math. But what they didn't mention was maybe that student spent their time focused on things that brought them joy, and developmentally they weren't quite ready for the same type of math and reading they were teaching in that particular classroom. I think we all have had experiences where we were forced to learn things we either weren't interested in or we weren't ready for and it went in one ear and out the other. So, don't be scared by a story of a kid who wasn't reading on grade level because he spent a couple of years pursuing his passions. If you go visit the school, you will see such an amazingly wide variety of pursuits going on. They have a really cool booklet/extensive brochure that has lots of current photos and stories and is a really neat way to get an idea of what the day-to-day looks like. Call them and schedule a tour!

"So my wife is a third grade teacher in the Harrisburg area. and this year she has a student who up until this year was enrolled in the circle school in Harrisburg. There‚Äôs basically zero structure in both academia and behavioral (call teachers by their first name, kid decides what punishments they get when they misbehave, etc). Academically, they just do whatever they want and whatever interests them. If they want to read books about dinosaurs all day because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre interested in, that‚Äôs what they do. While unstructured learning has its uses and should be employed in moderation, having it be all day is detrimental.

"1. No property tax on car.

"My fianc√© and I just moved to Mechanicsburg last May from Alexandria, VA! Get ready for a very different pace of life. We‚Äôre both from the area so we knew what was coming, but it‚Äôs definitely still a bit jolting. 

1. I don‚Äôt know about Dauphin, but Cumberland County (the west side of the river from Harrisburg) doesn‚Äôt. 

2. Again, can only really speak to Cumberland County, but Camp Hill/Mechanicsburg are a nice balance of having things to do and the city nearby but also having plenty of room, lower cost of living, and less traffic. I had a friend live in Hershey and teach in Middletown, and he said Hershey is great but Middletown is a bit rough. Also, growing up we were always told to avoid the Allison Hill neighborhood of Harrisburg. It very well might have changed (as a lot can in 10-15 years) so take that with a grain of salt, but it had the reputation of being pretty rough. 

3. Can‚Äôt really say, but seems good enough.

4. Things are a lot more spread out here than NoVA. Take the time to explore everything between Hershey/Harrisburg and Carlisle. There are some hidden gems in the small towns.

"I have a lot of info for you.  I'm in Shiremanstown (a boro of Camp Hill) but am former military who is originally from PA, lived in VA for 10 years, and now is back in PA, after some years in between in Italy and California.  

Ok, PA charges local tax by way of boro tax instead of attaching extra fees for registering a vehicle.  This makes registering a car about half the cost of in VA.  BUT like in California, there is a special inspection that tests emissions now, which will make you just about break even between PA and VA when speaking about car registration/inspection fees. Insurance, gas prices, all about the same or a tiny bit less.  

 The boro tax is a witholding from your income based on the school district you live in.  I ""file"" taxes by turning in my W-2 and tax paperwork sent by my boro.  I refer to it as my ""thank you very much"" tax return.  No biggie.  Takes 5 minutes to fill out.  I never pay or get refunded a cent. 

State income tax withholding is a little less in PA than most states because of this. The ""boro"" or ""district"" tax, catches PA up.  Where they get you is with property tax on home ownership.  For some reason, that's super high around here.  If you don't plan on buying a home soon, then don't worry about it.  I am looking at buying, and am like ""sheesh.""  

Still, I'd take high home ownership property taxes over cost of living in California any day.  And this area, like I said, is a little less expensive overall than in Virginia.  What we've got going on for employment, well, I can't exactly speak to.  I was laterally transferred from my job in CA to here, so my pay is CA pay, therefore I'm doing quite well and I'm not looking for a new job.  I'm gonna just coast on in to retirement.  Lol.  

Other people will also be able to tell you more about living in the area.  I stepped in shit- found a great little one bedroom place for $600 like a half a mile from where I work.  Love my landlord, love my neighborhood, but like I said, I'm looking at buying a house in the next year or two.  I'll be lurking to see what other people say.  I do LOVE Camp Hill and Mechanicsburg.

"As far as recommended places to live, I'd say that depends on your budget and what you're looking to get out of your community.  Also what type of place you're looking for (large apartment, house, townhouse?).  

Downtown can be fun if you're into bars and restaurants and like the idea of living in a (small) city, but parking is terrible.  If you do need to park, you'll either want to get a place that comes with enough parking for all of you or budget an extra ~$200/month for a parking garage spot.  

Midtown is similar, but a bit more relaxed - there are still lots of shops and restaurants, but it's more residential overall.  Lots of cool old buildings if you're into that.  Parking still kind of sucks just due to the lack of it, but at least it's cheap ($35/year), and you're still in pretty easy walking distance of anything downtown if you want to go there.

West Shore (Enola/Lemoyne/Camp Hill/Mechanicsburg/New Cumberland) is generally pretty nice - very suburban.  Little more expensive thanks to the school districts having a better reputation.  You get a similar feel as you go east of Harrisburg (Rutherford/Colonial Park area) towards Hershey.

As far as places to avoid, I'd say West Fairview on the West Shore (in Enola) as well as Allison Hill and parts of Uptown (mainly between McClay and Division) in Harrisburg.  None of them are *intolerably* bad (depending on your own personal tolerance, of course), but they are the worst neighborhoods in their respective areas.",t2_8hyyo,ChristophColombo,0,1644507688.0,0,t1_hwdmt82,hwdmt82,True,theruneweaver,t3_sp5e1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/sp5e1t/moving_from_northern_virginia/,Moving from Northern Virginia,/r/Harrisburg/comments/sp5e1t/moving_from_northern_virginia/hwdmt82/,3,r/Harrisburg,0,3

"Welcome to the area! 

I'll comment on commuting since people haven't touched on that yet. 

Nova traffic is awful, so the traffic here isn't nearly as bad. The most traffic that happens is on I-83 when crossing the bridge near Harrisburg. Someone recommended living in Camp Hill, Mechanicsburg, etc. This area is known as the West Shore. It's a nice area and I like it a lot so I'd recommend it. However, I recommend that if you want to live there that you also work on that side of the Susquehanna river because there's a lot of traffic going from one side of the river to the other during rush hour. But again, it's not that bad when you compare it to Nova, but you'd still have a better quality of life if you picked one side of the river to live and work in.

"The Brick Haus has a shot that tastes like eating pancakes and bacon, and actually has a strip of bacon in it. Pretty fun.

The Broad Street Market is fun on a weekend morning or lunchtime. Donuts, fudge, all kinds of yummy international food stands.

Urban Churn has amazing and interesting ice cream. 

Midtown Cinema is super fun and Zero Day has a bar and restaurant in the same building so movie and drinks or dinner is fun. 

Harrisburg Improv Theatre is also in that area and has pretty fun shows on weekend evenings. It's extremely relaxed and small. Very warm and welcoming group of people. I think it is BYOB.

The SpeakEasy has yummy american food and a cozy bar.

McGraths is a great bar. It might still allow smoking. Not sure if that's good or bad for you. 

The Millworks has great food and drink. They have an extensive bar and also brew their own beer. It's a fun place to go because the building also has a ton of art studios so you are invited to just casually walk around and look at art. In the warmer weather, they have a rooftop beer garden with board games, and sometimes love music. 

There is a block of 2nd Street that has some bars for young people. Fairly cheap and bar food, but there are people there to meet so it can be fun. 

Lots of nice restaurants you could stop in for dinner or dessert or a cocktail: Home 231, Note, Cork and Fork, Rubicon, Mangia qui. There's a bar called Suba that has awesome love music and tapas and a great atmosphere. 

I also agree that the Midtown Scholar is a great daytime activity. A beautiful bookstore with lots of space to get some coffee or a treat and explore their book collection or hear a talk.

"(Pls excuse any errors) Cumberland County is pretty big. There is no one size fits all in human services.  

You have Carlisle, which has most of the resources but not everyone in need is in Carlisle. Mechanicsburg has needs but not as many resources as Carlisle and the size of the town is a barrier to receiving services. You have rural areas like Newville, Mt holly springs with no or few resources outside churches. 


What part of the county do you want focus on? What type of assistance do you want to provide? The need is definitely out there but you'll need more research than what reddit can provide.


I would recommend volunteering with an agency like New Hope and see what gaps you can fill.",t2_4waj2,ohsilly,0,1643430115.0,0,t1_huoi8yp,huoi8yp,True,Low-Fix-7595,t3_sf1fwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/sf1fwp/any_opinions_on_local_charities_the_region_needs/,Any opinions on local charities the region needs more of?,/r/Harrisburg/comments/sf1fwp/any_opinions_on_local_charities_the_region_needs/huoi8yp/,2,r/Harrisburg,0,2

"Actually existing charities have existing client bases. Every community has people with needs that are not being met by any existing charity.  

Could I spend the last 15-20 years of my life helping people that would already be getting help anyway? Sure. Would it be better to help people with NO ONE set up to help them? I think so.

In Baltimore I met a homeless pregnant woman that no long term shelter was in a position to help because she was unemployed.  No employer was willing to hire a woman due to give birth and need maternity leave in 5 weeks. I spent three days making phone calls.  NO ONE was set up to help someone in her exact situation so she was about to give birth living in her car.  I eventually helped her find a solution but it should not have been that hard.

"Hello! We kind of found ourselves in the same boat a few years ago, moving from DC. It‚Äôs going to be culture shock, sure, but it‚Äôs not as bleak here as you may envision if you haven‚Äôt visited.


Mechanicsburg is where we landed (35/32 married couple) and it‚Äôs a good spot. There‚Äôs all sorts of neighborhoods sprouting up that remind us of the DC suburbs like Walden, Arcona, Legacy Park, etc. that will let you be around other people. I can only speak to the one that I live in, but it‚Äôs a friendly, diverse (at least compared to central PA as a whole) neighborhood with many young professionals. That area will put you right between Carlisle for Dickinson and the ‚Äúcity‚Äù for weekends or other activities.


There are more and more restaurants every month that will keep you out of the Olive Garden or Chili‚Äôs (unless that‚Äôs your jam). Millworks, Watershed Pub, Home 231, Issei Noodle, Smoke & Pickles are just a few places that we frequent.


There‚Äôs a climbing gym called the Climbnasium nearby that‚Äôs really great, tons of hiking around with the Appalachian Trail passing right through the area, and casual sports leagues that play in Harrisburg that will help you meet people. Plus, I‚Äôd imagine your husband will be meeting people in law school in your same boat.

"u/classyhwale \- FYI, Emaus is pronounced 'E Mas'.  They also extended Emaus street through the new station to Main St. - it used to end at Wood St.  (Source - lived here for 50+ years).  

For the busses, CAT probably has not done much in the way of updating their routes for the road that never existed.  My personal opinion of them is that they have never really been all that smart.  CAT probably did not bother or want to spend any money on the signage, since the station was largely an Amtrack project.  CAT really sucks.  No surprise the app was not overly useful.  Wonder how long it will take CAT to figure out you can come up Emaus to one shelter then on to Main, and down Emaus past the other shelter coming from Main.  Add a stop by the borough offices (not far from the other end of the new section of road) while they are at it :)  They already go out Emaus street the other way (towards the east side of the town, the station is at the west end of town).

The Ann Street bridge (or whatever they call it now, it was always the Ann St bridge for me :) was built quite some time ago, and probably not even a thought was given to the bridge when the station was built.

I liked the shot from above the rails, going to have to stop over there with my camera some day.  Been meaning to take a drive up Emaus to the new station anyway.  Wonder how long it will take the maps to update.  Amtrack was on top of the signage, it went up a couple of weeks before the station opened (it was bagged so you could not see it, but what little was peeking out didn't really take much thought to figure out what the signs were for).",t2_mx3sao,radiowave911,0,1642728656.0,0,t1_htjenfo,htjenfo,True,classyhwale,t3_s8ms99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/s8ms99/i_reviewed_middletowns_new_amtrak_station_is_it/,I Reviewed Middletown's New Amtrak Station!

"Not that it really matters to me (I live close enough), but I would not be surprised to see SARAA do just that.  Would make a lot of sense and certainly increase convenience.  Just need to figure out the timing changes.  Too bad they couldn't build it to both sides of the tracks :)  I am guessing the borough would not easily give up that space, though.  Nor would Librandi if they went to the other side of the bridge.

I remember watching them demo the old fire water tower on this property in the 90's.  Pretty neat to see it come down in such a controlled manner.

"To deny crime in Harrisburg is to deny a symptom of a larger cause.

Police are racists. So are banks and employers. Discrimination doesn't stop or start at policing. It's pervasive and denying that crime is an outcome of that is insane.

People commit crimes for a simple reason.
Their needs aren't being met. Sorry, but if I didn't have the money to feed my family or felt the only way to provide for myself and loved ones was to commit crimes. I'd do it in a heartbeat.

So, who's denying them? Police, banks, and employers.

There's not crime in Harrisburg? Oh, then I guess all their needs are being met, they're all gainfully employed, and have the opportunity to grow with their community.

Yeah, ok, bud.

As someone who's worked on Alison Hill and in Midtown for years. The crime and blight is real.

To say there is no crime is to ignore the discrimination that causes it.

"Nah, crime rates are highly inaccurate and influenced by police bias. Police are famously racist.

"A lot of people gave a lot of good advice. If it is just you and your significant other... downtown, midtown below 4th street, and uptown beyond Division are all fine.

People talk amount murders but if you actually look at where they occur they are almost all in allison hill and above 3rd street in midtown and old uptown. It isn't a huge issue for most people. 

For schools, there are a ton around and downtown isn't exactly great.

Susquehanna township is pretty quiet, but housing prices are up a bit, so be aware.",t2_cjzn9,thenewtbaron,0,1642703223.0,0,t1_htho881,htho881,True,[deleted],t3_s815be,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/s815be/hello/,Hello,/r/Harrisburg/comments/s815be/hello/htho881/,1,r/Harrisburg,0,1
