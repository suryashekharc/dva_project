Yes In a food setting I do understand where it's coming from. But in other places of work that deal with papers etc the use of a mask is probably worse for the users health than anything. The normal use case of these masks is between 2 days to a month depending on the person between washes. That in itself is not healthy on top of this since you are trapping droplets and any airborne particles in the mask it means your carrying around these germs and holding them to your face. As far as I am concerned from a person who has worked with both these masks and proper cartridge masks for the past 10 years I do not belive this is acceptable health standard.,t2_7wcqo1fh,AHPhotographer25,0,1643405861.0,0,t1_humzdah,humzdah,False,Safe_Egg460,t3_se3ux8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leduc/comments/se3ux8/whats_up_with_leduc_coffee_shop_reviews/,What's up with Leduc Coffee Shop reviews?,/r/Leduc/comments/se3ux8/whats_up_with_leduc_coffee_shop_reviews/humzdah/,0,r/Leduc,0,0
"Just for reference, I've worked frontline on a COVID unit for the last \~2 years. You can't deny that it still reduces indirect transmission of infected respiratory droplets. I'd rather they wear a mask to help lessen the spread than contaminate the food by not wearing a mask at all. I can definitely understand how expensive, scarce, and uncomfortable higher grade masks such as KN95 and N95 masks can be, but the population of Leduc is also (demographically) at a higher risk of contracting long COVID and/or dying should the virus spread and then mutate.

In my place of work we are constantly working to minimize the risk of outbreak by following guidelines regarding infection prevention and control, so that I don't risk bringing the virus home with me.

No defenetly not. But if this is the way they want to protest all power too them.

"> Power from asking if someone is gay?

This coming from the guy who said:

> Do some research and stop using this symbol.

I am on your side that we want to stop racists, so I will ask you to get past your knee-jerk reactions and start paying attention.  As people who care about blunting the power of racism, we need to carefully consider the power of symbols.  Racists like to create new symbols, like using 88 to refer to ""heil hitler"" because 'h' is the 8th letter of the alphabet.  

But we don't want to give the racists power over numbers or hand signals.  So, there are ways of blunting that power.  One way is [cultural reappropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation).  You comments earlier suggest that we need to learn all the symbols that racists take over and stop using them.  Let's go one better, we can reclaim numbers and hand signals and derogatory words and give them a competing meaning.  

> Power from asking if someone is gay?

Maybe you weren't born, but, in the 80's, ""gay"" was the standard insult thrown around junior high schools, as in, ""what are you?  GAY?""  So, the gay pride movement pulled that word back from the haters.

Then make fun of the racists who are now trying to be racist, but keep signing ""black lives matter"".

"You can book through the AHS website. Things to know for your second shot:

If you got an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) for your first dose, you should get an mRNA vaccine for your second dose to become fully vaccinated.

When to book:
* First dose in March or earlier – book second dose starting June 1
* First dose in April – book second dose starting June 14
* First dose in May – book second dose starting June 28

If you got AstraZeneca for your first dose, you can choose either the AstraZeneca vaccine or an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/Moderna) for your second dose.
Both options will provide additional protection and count as completing your immunization in Canada. International jurisdictions may have different standards for a complete immunization series.
Effectiveness and safety information is provided below to help you make the decision that best meets your needs.

* First dose in March or earlier – book second dose starting June 1

The schools are on a different level of awesome. The kids are actually kids and not brain dead test machines who come out know jack all.

The rent.... don't get me started...  A 1400 Sq ft. town house here is 1400 on the high side(fancy place). You can't get a shoebox for that in Toronto. 

Make the move brother you won't regret. Initial relocation costs may be a drag to get everything moved over but you won't regret it. People on Leduc won't tell you how awesome it is cause they don't know how shitty other places are. Believe me get the hell out of that province.

"i can understand wanted to rebrand for cultural sensitivity reasons... but ""Eskimo"" is not an inherently racist term. (anyone can be a fish eater)

Also, the name suggestions at the end of the survey are kinda bad - the E-alliteration is semi-important, but none of them are phonetically appealing with ""Ed-mon-ton"" ... well, ok, ""Eagles"" is phonetically appealing, but what about Edmonton, Alberta, or even Canada shouts ""EAGLE!!"" 

Energy isn't phonetically appealing either, visually certainly (Monster Energy for example).

So, here's a few options:

* The Edmonton Millions - Edmonton proper (not the metro) is about to pass a million people, it has that paired M sound, it has a feeling of wealth to it and can represent the town as well as the environment

* The Edmonton Glaciers - similar to icefields, but has colder - harder connotations and supplements the glacier fed Nt.Sask River

* The Edmonton Mallrats - a younger connotation, fun, reflects the economic ties the city has with its local businesses.  Also shares that recessive 2nd syllable 'M'.

I remember in the run up to the election I asked each candidate on Facebook what their plans for diversification was, and Shaye took 2 full days to respond, with literally almost 10 paragraphs of different local businesses and initiatives that help our local economy, and he wasn't just listing off what these businesses did, but the names of them, and the names of the specific products that helped diversify our economy.

My daughter is in the school play every year and It is quite a good extracurricular activity...she practices 3 times a week from Oct- March. They have an i a tense show week where they put on 2 shows a day and every year, it amazes me how great the productions turn out. The kids put so much work into them. 

At the comp (where my son is in French immersion as well) they also have a great drama club. He isn’t involved but has friends that are and I think they put on a few shows every year at the Maclab. They have really good art classes at the comp as well. And so many different artistic type options.  Also for French they aren’t over run in Leduc. My sons class size is pretty small.

That said, that doesn't mean that a store is opening up any time soon. Large corporations have no issue sitting on land until they feel the time is right to invest in building a store - based on the economy, roads & traffic, nearby amenities, etc.

If you have a boat, Wabamum and Lac St. Anne may be you better bets. The lakes around Leduc (Wizard, Coal) are pike and perch, which can be fun, but wears off after a while. You can get rainbows out of the reservoir at Fred John's - not too much action because the water tends to have low visibility. I used to fly fish there and had some OK years.

Lakes like Pigeon and Gull and Sylvan can produce, but there are so many people there. I preferred ice fishing those spots.

"I see how that could be odd. We are relatively new to Edmonton and the area we are presently in is not what I'd consider safe. Multiple stolen vehicles are dumped, in the year in this building there have been a number of break ins.  The Edmonton crime map shows all the areas that have break ins, assaults, etc. But I haven't found a map that does this for leduc. When we originally moved here we were told that this area is pretty safe, but that really doesn't seem the case. I guess what I'm looking for is just some ""inside"" information on good places in leduc.

"Having been born and raised here and recently moved back, this strikes me as such an odd question. As in, why wouldn't it be safe? Just don't pick fights at bars late at night and you should be fine! Living in the newer neighbourhoods is likely more desirable insofar as there are (typically) younger families there.
