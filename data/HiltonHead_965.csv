"Your concerns are valid. The 30-40somethings crowd on the island is very small, and while Bluffton is growing, there still isn't a large community of tech professionals as far as I know. The region is mostly retirees (the vast majority of which fit into a very specific demo), tourists (ditto), and the people who support the infrastructure that keeps them fat and happy. 

We moved here from a major metro five years ago and still haven't fully adapted. There's not much of an event calendar (although that's gotten slightly better) and there's almost no nightlife. 

But it's not all bad. It's an incredibly easy place to live 99% of the time. That idealized ""island time"" pace of life is real. Parking is never a problem. It's safe. The beaches are fantastic, the golf is great, the seafood is great, the offseason is awesome because you get some of the nicest weather and you can actually get a table at the most popular restaurants, etc. We have days where we couldn't imagine living anywhere else. (Mid 40s, two small kids.) But then we also see exciting things happening where we used to live, or we travel to a more happening place, and we get major FOMO.

Palmetto Dunes has great pickle ball and tennis Courts, driving range. They have the dunes house which is great for a drink on the beach and are close to CoCo’s which is even better.

"Hi! HHI Realtor here hoping I can shed some light on what we're seeing.

While the market is certainly hot, all indications point to this NOT being a bubble. A bubble implies prices being over-inflated to the point where they could 'burst'.

Unlike 2008 when the housing market crashed, there isn't currently a sub-prime mortgage crisis looming. Most of the loans being made today are considered good and healthy.

The biggest factor driving up prices is simple supply & demand. 

Demand is higher than it has been in a long time due to several factors - the biggest ones being millennials finally being able to move up in jobs as baby boomers retire, and the widespread adoption of work from home opportunities allowing people to live where they want while still making a good salary.

Supply has been hampered severely by COVID. Between supply chain disruptions, illness on a massive scale, and skilled worker shortages - they simply cannot build new houses fast enough.

And with both of these at work, it's causing inflation to climb higher and higher.

So...long story long we aren't really seeing this as a bubble. I do expect in the next year for it to normalize and maybe come down a bit on the top end. But for better or worse, I think the current home prices will stay in this ballpark for the foreseeable future. 

The best thing for the real estate market as well as home buyers would be for inflation to come down and wages to rise. We *want* a healthy market. For every one of our listings that sells quickly for over asking, we have 2 buyers that are getting outbid on every home they find.

Hope this helped!",t2_c5ljo,titanaarn,0,1642817840.0,0,t1_htorci8,htorci8,True,jscott280,t3_s9krwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiltonhead/comments/s9krwo/is_the_hilton_head_market_going_into_an_extreme/,Is the Hilton Head Market going into an extreme bubble?

"Posiden has an upper bar and dance area. It's over near shelter cove. The Triangle is on the south end and has Riley's, the Lodge, and one hot Mama's.

"Palmetto dunes has 3 good courses. Prices are fair. I’d recommend Poseidon both for food and then they have a good scene upstairs at night. The triangle for shitfaced college aged and tourists.

Dunes house has the best fish tacos on island. Java burrito for coffee and lunch. Side hustle brewery for beers is a must. And the tiki bar at Coligny has live music and cold drinks. Never eaten there…don’t think I ever would. These of course are all just in my opinion. Lots of cool places to go there and see. I have not spent much time in Sea pines so it could be rad….

"I agree-ish with the first poster. We stayed there in September as my wife’s parents were staying there. We generally stay at the Westin when in HH. 

Her parents room was relatively nice and updated, ours was pretty dated (but we got highest floor with an ocean view). 

Location is pretty good. You can walk to coligny and it has good beach access. There’s one elevator but it’s a bit hidden, and right in the middle of the building, so using it is a pain in the butt. 

As noted, the bedroom setup is odd in that they are on the other side of the hallways, so if you are near a well traveled area, you might get a lot of noise. The building is a little run down.  As noted, some of the rooms are nice though, as it’s case by case. 

I wouldn’t likely stay there again, but we sort of have high expectations. The location is pretty good and if you find a decent room and can look beyond the dated building… you could do worse in HH.",t2_3k6bna12,CreepyTeePee123,0,1637549947.0,0,t1_hlldfdj,hlldfdj,True,keepinup246,t3_qzapl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiltonhead/comments/qzapl4/seaside_villas/,Seaside Villas,/r/hiltonhead/comments/qzapl4/seaside_villas/hlldfdj/,2,r/hiltonhead,0,2

"There are two ""Hudson's"", Hudson's the restaurant and Benny Hudson's the fish market. They're pretty close to each other on Squire Pope/Skull Creek and they're both great, if a little pricey.

Fish Camp on Broad Creek is also good for oysters. 

Be sure to call ahead to make sure any restaurant you're going to has local oysters in if that's what you're looking for. You can get oysters at any of them but they're not always local.

I’m here now. The last two days the jelly fish have appeared. I saw a lot washed up today as the tide was coming in and a kid got stung by one yesterday. Someone also said they saw a stingray. I Don’t normally see those though. As a kid my dad would take me to chest deep water to search for sand dollars. Never really thought of other animals out there until I got stung one summer by a jelly. That’s really all you have to worry about. There’s horseshoe crabs too. I normally only see those washed up after a storm.

"There are plenty of ways to socially distance them but it will definitely limit their ability to go on any water activity that aims towards kids because most boats take more than just one group.   I’m in the industry.    Most dolphin tour boats, a few of the kids style fishing charters boats, and the pirate boat all cram as many as they are allowed on the vessel.    If you want to get them on the water, make SURE your charter Captain is vaccinated and that they only offer private trips.    I do only offer private fishing trips, shark teeth and fossil hunting trips along.   I’m vaccinated as well.   I’d be happy to get you guys out in the water if my schedule allows.    

I’m not promoting my business or just trying to make a quick buck, by the way.   I’m normally fully booked at least 6 weeks in advance so that’s not the issue.  Just want you to be aware of how some things are done out here.

"...so, all of above is correct...anywhere along beach st low tide will reveal tons of sea life...however, cuz it's a beach w/ a tide (in fact, @7-9ft difference, one of the biggest on east coast 🙃)...most of the good/larger stuff goes out w/ the tide.

...thus, uwant to go where there is shoreline on the sound side of the island...the two best/easiest places to go for this are:

1) Pine Island Beach - Dolphin Head: (Hilton Head Plantation - northend of island)
     - they are very strict at gate about letting anyone in...however, if you go to the back gate (from either Squire Pope Rd...or Gum Tree Rd)...and tell them that you are going to country club to play golf (just wear collared polo shirts), they will let you in...then just stay on that road approx 6miles (they'll be a bend in the Rd, jus bear right) until you come to the end where you'll see the water of Port Royal Sound...and the sign for Dolphin Head Park to the left...pull in there and drive left and to the back of parking area and you'll see sign & parking for Pine Island Beach.
     - this beach is not good for laying and playing...it is ""magnificent"" for beachcombing tho...when I lived near there I walked it everyday and would practically see different see life each day (baby sea turtle hatchlings in surf or rocks...and just watch them...huge natural hermit crabs and just watch them...schools of baby hammerhead sharks...starfish, horseshoe crabs that are alive (on the beach they'll be dead as they were washed up and got stuck there)...etc...
     - also on other side of parking area you'll see the rock embankment along non-shoreline coast of the sound and beautiful waterfront homes where there is a 1.5 mile public/grassy trail you can walk/bike along the water.

2) South Beach - Sea Pines Plantation (Southend)
     - enter thru ocean gate on South Forest Beach Rd...it costs $9 to get into Sea Pines and is well worth it if you plan accordingly...Lawton Horse Stables w/ great petting zoo...beach club public beach access (best ocean front ding on island @Coast Restaurant)...Harbor Towne - (marina/lighthouse/shops/restaurants)
     - stay straight on this road approx 8 miles until the end where South Beach Marina is on the right and South Beach beach access is on the left
     - Salty Dog Cafe/store, marina, and other stores is on Marina side (great water excursion point...and excellent dolphin yours)
     - the ocean at the beach access area has a more common tide pattern as the oceanfloor drops approx 20 yrds out (high tide) & 10yrds out (low tide)...ocean life, shells, driftwood, etc...will wash up here as you keep walking south around into south beach inlet.

I think what amazes me about many people who come to vacation on HHI is the fact that they’re still uptight and acting as if they have to be somewhere immediately. Maybe because I’m in the hospitality industry I am definitely more laid-back and easy-going when I am on vacation. I have a tendency to be much more patient and just a go with the flow kind of person.

"OP - We have noticed this as well, but have also noticed the cliental change more so.  We are essential workers at home, so we never stopped living life as normal including going to HHI for vaca 4-6 times a year.  At first it was others like us who did not mask up, not scared to go out, things were ""normal"" and relaxed, staff friendly etc... March came around and the people who had been staying at home, demanding masks, etc... came out, you can tell because of the masks on their kids and they don't want to ride the elevator w/ you, they get mad at the wait staff for not masking up, they get mad at other patrons for not being 6' away at all times, they get mad that they have to wait, they are demanding and rude.  Fast forward to this past weekend and you add to it EVERYONE trying to get that last ditch vacation done and not have to fly (because that is a mess too) and now everyplace is packed and every industry is understaffed.   Even when the restaurants raised their prices to almost TRIPLE what it was in March and the hotels are now double, people are still flocking over there, and quite frankly they are rude and have no travel etiquette, tipping is low or non-existent because these are the people bragging how they are getting their weekly hand out check.
