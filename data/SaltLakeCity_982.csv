"> You seem oddly confrontational on things we agree on. I think we should build so many houses that housing is no longer an investment vehicle

I don't agree with that strategy for the simple reason that you cannot outpace the demand by simply building more. I gave the example of NYC. If you can simply outpace the demand by building more, how come NYC is so expensive?

EDIT: 

looks like /u/Dense-Adeptness blocked me.

lol exactly. If a city that's known for sky scraper can't beat the demand, what makes you think that SLC can? You build them, they will come. Ton of people are eyeing SLC and for many, the price is the only reason why they haven't. Build more houses, the price won't go down, but the number of people at SLC will.

"> simple high school econ

it's an armchair economist. 

> Even a high rise in Manhattan clearly had huge demand as seen by the prices people are willing to pay

And? So why didn't the skyscrapers of Manhatten solve the housing problem? If anything, it seems like it exacerbated by making it one of the most expensive city in the world, nevermind in the nation. 

Every single city think it has supply problem even in this thread that literally laid out the problem. The investment nature of the housing that is clearly evidenced in the post, yet we are claiming more houses. The main problem is speculative nature of real estate industry. We are not treating house as a place to live but a vehicle to make money. It's literally the same problem we have with healthcare where a for-profit does what it does and makes it out of reach for those who cannot afford despite of the fact that a human needs shelter and healthcare. If only select number of people own all the houses in America, that's called oligarchy and they get to dictate the price. That's literally what's happening as evidenced in the literal thread.

What the armchair economist fails to recognize is that demand is not bound to the city limit. Look at all the people who settled out of SLC because of the cost. Look at all the people who settled out of NYC because of the cost. Look at all the people who settled out of SF because of the cost. The moment the cost comes down, these people move in.

"I was at the rally last night. There was a touching moment where a speaker asked all the trans kids to come up to the steps of the Capitol so the speaker could honor them. She then asked the crowd to raise their hands in the air and make hearts and tell these children they are loved and supported, not just by their families but also by total strangers. It almost made me cry. It’s so annoying that every minority group has to fight for their rights over and over and over again. When can we just accept people for who they are?

"Yeah, I can understand how you’d feel that it’s best not to name him.

I had an English teacher in my early teens that I thought the world of. He was just different, he knew what it took to help kids feel like it was ok to be ourselves, and not have to fit into a mold. He fostered true creativity. He seemed to really care and go out of his way to help kids not feel marginalized. He never came close to doing anything inappropriate with me, or make me feel uncomfortable.

Anyway, about a decade after I was done with school, I was saddened to hear through the grapevine that he’d been convicted of some kind of indiscretion with a student, and was in prison. He died there.

It messed with my head a little because I had adored him so much, yet he had been convicted. How could I adore a criminal? Does it disrespect the victim if I don’t know what happened, and still have a fondness for the teacher? Also what if he didn’t do what he was accused of and was wrongly convicted?

To this day I don’t know what happened, and have not been able to form my own opinion about it, or reconcile my feelings about him. I can’t find any news articles or info about what happened.

"The physiological advantages start at around puberty, and if a kid is on puberty blockers the issue is moot. And last I checked, there is nothing here to ""protect"" girls from. Your argument is premised that transgender girls are inherently a threat when they're not. There's 1 transgender girl playing sports in the state. 1. 

Also, transgender women have been playing sports for literally decades in this country without ""threatening"" women's sports. Even the Connecticut track girls and Lia Thomas - the source of all this hysteria - lost plenty of times. Lia won precisely one event (500 yard freestyle) at the NCAA championship by one second (the gap between 2nd and 3rd was wider); in her other events she finished 5th and 8th. Her school, Penn, didn't finish in the top 10 of any relay race and Virginia won the team championship. That's it. That's what all this national moral panic is over. One kid in the state of Utah, and one Division 1 swimmer.

"Depends how you plead through the court process and your criminal record.  IMO it’s all about how your public defender gets you through the process.

I’ll elaborate a little more. 

Since you didn’t get a DUI you will probably get a substance abuse evaluation and from there the court will be notified if you require more rehab or classes based on the assessment. 

Best case scenario, you get a plea in abeyance and a dismissed case if you complete the agreement which typically includes a fine, a substance abuse course, an evaluation,  community service, and not getting into anymore trouble.  

Be more mindful out there.  Drug charges will hold you back from lots of things in your future.

"Basically in Utah currently it’s a classic case of supply & demand (supply is very low some stats showing 20-30k houses short of what we need, demand is insanely high 2-30+ offers and/or serious buyers per home). Combine that with hyperinflation due to the government printing a shit ton of money in recent years among other things, and people bidding above the properties listed/asking price it’s created momentum especially in the last 3 years that have caused home values to go up an avg of 20%+ each year. Utah’s economy is diverse with industry (we aren’t a state that has an economy based on one single industry like tech, but we have multiple major drivers for our economic growth). 

On the seller/homeowner side, all of that growth leads to equity (the amount the house is worth above what they owe). Sellers then can sell, and use that equity to buy more real estate or do whatever they want.

5 properties is a far cry from market manipulation. Even if they owned 100, it still wouldn't classify as such in this size of a market.

The mess is ugly but as long as the house property is sold, then it is worth the price. If the market won't bear the price, then it isn't worth the price.

"Check out the district you're in and see if there are any contenders for their house seats. They need money to get the vote and the information out about how terrible this bill was.

Millions of Dollars in legal fees on the backs of our taxes. Kids' lives in exchange for a poll bump. These are the trade-offs of Trumpist Republicanism.

Full Disclosure, I'm one of those candidates. I'm running against Jordan Teuscher in HD44, mostly Daybreak and some of South Jordan. He's particularly vulnerable because he wrote that terrible classroom-material-monitoring bill and also voted for this, and the area is growing more liberal.

1. As an investment/asset that they can rent out and/or sell at a higher price tomorrow.
2. A relatively stable vehicle to park one's money when the general economy is in turmoil.

This one investor effectively owns an entire block of housing with this sale since they control so much of the pricing in that area and to get it they offered $75k OVER asking per unit?

"They should be assessing square feet, number of vents, insulation, and windows. Once all that is done and they're making recommendations, they should be offering information about what the different options would mean for you in terms of cooling, cost of running, and wear and tear from on/off cycles. When we chose an installer, we went with someone who took the time to make sure we fully understood our options and what each one meant. If the company giving you quotes hasn't done that, they may not be the right company.

Note: I don't have any meaningful advice besides that. It's been a year and a half and I honestly have no clue anymore what size AC we got. I don't think that info would help anyway, because while we're at 1800 sq ft, it's also a condo with 2.5 outside walls, three newer windows, and a really shitty sliding glass door.  


Edit: I had to schedule spring tune-up anyway, so I asked about my AC. It's a 13 SEER, 2 ton, 1 stage unit. It cools 1800 sq ft, first floor 1200 and finished basement 600. One basement window, two first floor windows (all roughly 10ish years old), and one really shitty sliding glass door that radiates cold in winter and heat in summer. We have a unit above us so we aren't losing anything that way, and have 1.5 exterior walls shared with other units. Two walls are fully exposed, but get lots of shade and very little direct sunlight. The other half a wall is in a breezeway so it's fairly protected and gets zero direct sunlight, the breezeway is *always* 5-10 degrees cooler than it is in the yard in summer. I don't wanna pull out my stack of paperwork to look at my insulation, but it's probably shit. The building is a few years older than me (44) and I believe I recall that the insulation is still from the 70's.   


We replaced our AC and furnace together. Nothing was wrong with the old furnace, it was just old enough to be worth paying the install fee to get it ""free"" with the AC unit.

"I am in the mortgage industry. I own a broker shop here. I don't really think that's relevant because it doesn't necessarily give me insight into the RE market, but I do talk to a lot of people and here are my opinions:

There will not be another ""real estate bubble burst"". Anyone who didn't buy in the past two years is going to need to make more money to afford a home in the future. 

Interest rates are rising, and are now higher than they were pre-pandemic. One of the things that enabled housing prices to rise so quickly the last 2 years was low rates. It costed the same to get a $370,000 loan a year ago as it costs to get a $300,000 loan now. But because of a number of economic pressures (not the least of which is the psychology of limited resources), prices are STILL rising even though it's costing significantly more per month to buy a home. 

In Utah the problem is exaggerated. In a year with a net negative national population growth, Utah had three cities within the top 10 highest population growth - so we're still growing. Our birth rates are higher than elsewhere, and people are moving in. 

The only real way to fix things is to increase supply. But that's pretty hard to do along the Wasatch front due to geographical constraints. With mountains surrounding us, and the GSL to our West, where are people going to build? Not to mention that every single neighborhood in the state is vehemently against high-density housing. 

Whether people like it or not, real estate and housing prices are not going down. They may stall slightly if there is an economic downturn, but there is no bubble to be popped. The moment prices look like they'll drop, hundreds of thousands of Utahns and investors are going to be ready to buy, keeping everything afloat.",t2_ngf9j,JRoeBing,0,1648231793.0,0,t1_i23fjnk,i23fjnk,False,Historical-Plant-362,t3_tn8x1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tn8x1g/surprised_to_see_rents_so_high_in_the_west_side/,"Surprised to see rents so high in the west side, then realized that 11 out 19 of them are managed by the same rental company, StreetLane Homes.

">We didn’t solve the issue by saying that black people are white and that women are men. 

Ignoring the fact that these issues are far from ""solved"",  that is absurd and not at all analogous.

The crux of the trans bigotry is the lazy classification based on physical attribute vs. a person's innate identity. Society has long held notions of male and female are intrinsically tied to physical attributes that reside between their legs or on their chest, and the related physiology. Even going so far as to ""rank"" a level of masculinity by the size of a penis or femininity by the size of breasts, etc...

If you can, for a moment, accept that the size of physical attribute is no measure of someone's gender, then you should be able to accept that the the lack of a physical attribute is only one more degree of that and still has no measure of gender.

You, presumably, are able to feel right and correct about your gender aligning with your physical attributes. But just as it's possible that you might have been born with an an arm, how would you feel now? Likely not much different, right? What if you were born without (whatever gender aligned genitalia you might poses)? Could that not the same as being born without an arm? How is that different?

While identity generally seems to be linked with physical attributes, and there is an understanding of physiology and hormones and chemistry that emphasizes this link. There is also an understanding that just like being born without an arm, folks are born without these other things as well.

Yet, they feel, they know, they ARE. Be it man, woman, or other, that is their determination, not yours, not legislatures, not anyone but theirs.  


>I disagree with that. I accept and recognize them as transgender men and/or women.

\*You\* disagree.....\*You\* accept and recognize...this isn't about you.

Ask a transgendered man if they disagree with it? Ask a transgender woman if they feel recognized and accepted not as a woman but as an ""other"".

">Racism is based on someone being ""other"" than an accepted race. Sexism is based on someone being ""other"" than an accepted gender.

Yeah, but society changed to accept black people and women as valid categories (well, uh, to a degree). We didn’t solve the issue by saying that black people are white and that women are men. In the same way, we could accept transgender people as a legitimate category of humans that don’t deserve discrimination.

> By putting a transgender person in not male or female classification despite their identity for any reason is the definition of not recognizing them and is discriminating against them.

"First and foremost, everyone involved here are children. 

These trans kids are not wrong or bad. They are kids. I can’t tell you what they feel or what is going on in their heads as I am not trans but the evidence shows that when they are in a healthy trusting environment their rates of suicide and depression are the same as all the kids around them. But when society turns on them their suicide and depression rates sky rocket. Every major religion teaches that we need to show compassion to our fellow human. Just being a good person dictates that we help these kids. Any solution we come up with needs to show compassion and understanding. 

Now some history- title IX was a major milestone in getting women equal access to public funds and improving their positions in the world. Without title IX most women’s sports scholarships wouldn’t exist. See a football scholarship brings in money to the school. A softball scholarship costs the school money. 

When title IX was passed the ugly people came out just like now and said things like women belong in the kitchen, not on the field and if these girls are good enough to beat the boys then they can play. In other words almost the same things they are saying to these trans athletes. 

So in both cases a disadvantaged group is asking for an opportunity to play and be part of sports and both times a group of ugly people are trying to stop it. This has nothing to do with protecting girls sports. These same people would throw an absolute fit if the girls soccer team got the high school stadium on a Friday night and the football team had to play on the practice field. 

I can go into reasons if you want but if you can’t see the bigotry going on here you probably won’t accept the reasons.

">Being an “other” isn’t the end of the world.

This is literally the core of oppression of anyone ever. It's just a matter of degrees. Racism is based on someone being ""other"" than an accepted race. Sexism is based on someone being ""other"" than an accepted gender. Ageism is based on someone being ""other"" than an accepted age. This is the basis of it all.

All bigotry is founded in the notion of ""other"".  To the extreme, it very literally is the end of someone's world when they're killed over it.

"I don’t think that’s quite the right analogy. I think it’s more like what if we discovered a third gender with traits specific to it and had to stick them into our existing binary, rather than discovering an unusual individual specimen of one of our existing categories. Presumably, the transgender people, regardless of surgeries and hormones they take, will never fully manifest the traits which we associate with their new gender. In my view both genders are thus ill-fitting to some degree.

That said, I don’t presume to know the answer. I’m sure that this bill isn’t the right answer, and I’d expect that the problem it presumes to address probably doesn’t occur with any relevant frequency.
