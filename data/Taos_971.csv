"On top of the snow difficulty, we had a crazy wind storm come in and uproot hundreds/thousands of trees up in that direction last year and it made a huge mess. It may not even be 100% cleaned up yet, making the trails even worse. Definitely wait for late Spring/Summer.

If you want a nice hike that goes vertical, try the Devisidero trail which is just east of Taos on Hwy 64. The trailhead is at the mouth of the canyon when you start driving to Angel Fire/Eagle Nest. Trail is on the north side of the hwy. It goes up pretty vertical and makes a nice several mile loop. Probably still going to be icy but it's not as dangerous. You'll get a nice view of the Taos valley.

"I don’t have a lot to add except, having lived here for a while, it is very different living here than visiting or even staying for a few months. What Taos lacks is variety - yes there are some decent restaurants, maybe like 10 - and you get pretty tired of those same 10 restaurants in your first year. A new restaurants might open every few years or so but something else you like closes. Museums - we have maybe 3 or 4 - and they are small.  Music venues - a couple happening places but just not a lot of variety and you can burn out on same old same old pretty quickly.  We have other attractions, but don’t move here for any of those “scenes” because they don’t exist like you are used to in any urban area.

"If kit Carson internet - fiber - is available at the property you are looking to occupy, it’s your best bet.  Century Link is DSL and slow and their customer service is terrible.  Don’t know which canyon you are talking about (there are three), but TAosnet is your next best option (after Kit Carson) but not everywhere - you have to be line of sight of their broadcast and repeaters and I’m not sure a location in a canyon would work. Some people with few other options are getting connected with Starlink and love it but it can be a six month or longer wait time and it’s kinda expensive. If you have you to pay for a new installation of Kit Carson Fiber, the cost could be comparable to Starlink ($500), the KC does offer multi-year contracts to bring down the installation cost but that only works if you plan on being there for several years.       Some areas of Taos have access to comcast internet (cable) but you’d have to research it, it’s mostly in town I believe).

"Hi! I will only comment on the music. My husband and I are more into the rock/alternative scene and came from a large city where bar music and concerts were readily available. We knew nightlife would be more limited here, but being in our 50's it wasn't a huge deal. We've been here full time for 4 months and we are usually able to find something to do for a night out. Believe it or not, we have found the best music venue currently to be Gutter's Bowling Alley. Great mix of weekend music, local and otherwise. You will find young and old people here bowling, drinking and dancing. The food is good too. The Alley Cantina has live music also which I believe starts at 10pm. The Sagebrush has nightly ""regulars"" playing. Sometimes on weekends they have ""bigger"" acts (usually local bands) that are fun to see and dance to. I really hope that Taos Mesa Brewing Mothership re-opens as planned. It was a fantastic music venue. There is a smattering of live music at other bars also. Keep your eyes and ears open.

"I am not a local but someone who is test driving Taos for the next few months, so I'll offer my perspective on the things you ask about. I haven't yet gone out to see any music since arriving last month, but know that there are at least a half dozen or more live music shows, open mic nights, etc. each week. Granted these may be the same musicians playing each week, though it appears a few places bring in bands from downstate.  When I was here a few years ago, Taos Mesa Brewing had a 13 piece Cuban band out at the Mothership. Such a unique spot for music. So for a town of this size, I'd say there is definitely music to be had.  I feel like I have also seen bands on the Plaza here, but maybe that was Santa Fe.  I think Kit Carson Park has music in the summer as well.  Food - OMG love it.  If you love all things Southwest, Mexican, or Native, you will have your fill here.  There seems to be food to fit any budget; upscale/foodie, food trucks, diners, etc.  And quite a few other types of cuisine as well; a Filipino food truck just opened, a few Sushi/Japanese/Chinese restaurants. Just do a Google search on restaurants and you will get an idea on the food scene.  As for cultural scene, you may want to be a little more specific on what exactly you are looking for, but this is an art town - so tons and tons of art and galleries.  The Pueblo has feast days that the public is sometimes invited to, but it is currently closed due to COVID.  When I was here over the holidays, someone was doing a Rumi poetry reading with whirling dirvish dancers - I was sorry to miss that!  Just driving around and soaking in the beauty of the surroundings feels like culture to me.  The local newspaper is great and also does a great job covering stories from the rich heritage of the area.   The Paseo Project also sounds really cool, but I haven't experienced it yet. And the historic museums are another great cultural aspect.

"I mean, it’s New Mexico. It’s fuckin weird vibes but it’s also very chill, very quiet, very slow and down to earth vibes. 
I’m from a small town in southern NM. It’s weird but there’s charm. 

Taos is full of eccentrics, magis, hippies, religious people and regular ass people, and some bad people. Just like most places that are rural and don’t have a large, thriving economy. 

For food you have to check out the farmhouse for breakfast and also Orlando’s!!!!! Get the posole bowl. I could eat that multiple meals in a row.

"The thing about Taos, and northern New Mexico culture in general, is that there is no good way to describe it to someone who hasn’t lived it. Taos is a strange town. Living anywhere in northern NM is choosing to live a harsh life. It’s not easy to be here. If you have a good job with good money it will be easier because you’ll be able to afford to do things like go out to eat, maybe you’ll get to see some music, but it’s a tough world up here. I don’t know what you mean by loving the “heart beat”, I hope you still love it after you’ve lived the reality of this place for awhile.

Be prepared to be an outsider, to be inherently distrusted, to deal with weird and uncomfortable shit that will take a long time to make sense of.

"[Get up to date on avalanche conditions here.](https://taosavalanchecenter.org/)

I volunteer with Taos Search and Rescue. We pull people out of the Wheeler area every winter. 90%+ of the time, it's navigation issues. The snow means the trail will be difficult or impossible to see, so people get mixed up and ascend/descend the wrong way. Obviously weather becomes far more dangerous too.

You will need snowshoes and/or crampons for the final ascent past Horseshoe Lake. Lower parts you may get by with yaktrax or whatever.",t2_3in07,nateberkopec,0,1642012779.0,0,t1_hsdqnam,hsdqnam,True,Brooach,t3_s21o9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/taos/comments/s21o9f/wheeler_peak_conditions/,Wheeler Peak Conditions,/r/taos/comments/s21o9f/wheeler_peak_conditions/hsdqnam/,6,r/taos,0,6
"Doesn't mean the danger is mitigated.

Safer bet to take Bull o the woods (very long way) and stay on the ridge. Taking the standard route mid winter is just excess exposure. You're crossing multiple avalanche paths before you get to the lake, then you're exposing yourself to cross loaded slopes above treeline in the Southern Rockies mid winter.",t2_ahjo6,restlesslegs8,0,1642009937.0,0,t1_hsdiyq6,hsdiyq6,False,Brooach,t3_s21o9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/taos/comments/s21o9f/wheeler_peak_conditions/,Wheeler Peak Conditions,/r/taos/comments/s21o9f/wheeler_peak_conditions/hsdiyq6/,5,r/taos,0,5
"I haven't been over there this year, but I backcountry skied in that area a couple of times last year, and have been skiing in the Williams lake basin quite a bit this year so you can make some correlations.

I would bring snowshoes and crampons for the upper portion of your route. The lower part of that trail system seems to see a lot of traffic and is probably plenty packed down by now and fine for just boots, maybe some traction device for the icier areas. However, I'm going to assume not a lot of people, if any, are going up to the peak especially from that side so the snowshoes and crampons are going to be wise for this section. As a side note, having 4x4 with some clearance is going to be clutch to make it to the actual parking area for that trail.

General snow conditions: it has been a while since the last storm and things are healing and becoming safer, but the avalanche danger is still real. Being on the leeward side of the ridge there's is probably substantial wind loading and a lot more snow than the west side (which is pretty much stripped clean above treeline) and the possibility of wind slabs. The east side of kachina and that ridge is pretty wind-loaded, with some decent cornices in spots. Anything that held snow in the early season dry spell has some gnarly ground facets that were super reactive after that last storm. One ridge over from where you will be a majority of the east and north slopes slid, plenty of them to the ground. While it is getting harder to trigger these slides (even with bombs at the resort) if you do trigger one on these ground facets it may be big, and potentially take the entire snowpack with it.

Again these observations are from one basin over, so take it with a grain of salt. Also, be sure to check out the Taos avalanche center for a more in-depth snow report.

The place you see as beautiful and attractive is only so for those who can afford it.  The economic gap is widening, and the working class is getting the shaft due to rural gentrification, pandemic real estate inflation, increased land and utility costs.  The working class doesn't have a hilltop view of a mountain, they are looking at a kitchen, a construction site, or another lens while on the clock for many hours of the day.

The locals are working 2 or 3 jobs to try to save enough to afford their rental, to save for a dilapated house, or remote raw land that is more expensive than ever. Covid is ravaging segments of the population because vacationers are entitled and disobeying guidelines ( I see why you want to leave your state, and this is the reason I stated Taos isn't an escape from these people).

Recently people are selling houses in their home states, buying houses in Taos, moving without putting any effort or benefit to the community. They are fattening real estators pockets and raising price tags for others. They are working from home, ordering everything online, and wonder why they are outsiders in the community.

It is a terrible idea to drive during a bad snowstorm. Especially long distances and no experience. But if you had experience you’d know it is a terrible idea.

"You probably need snow tires, and not chains.  I25 near walsenburg can get really bad because of the winds blowing off the plains.  In my experience, la veta pass from walsenburg to fort garland is not really too bad as mountain passes go.  You just need to get off i25 safely.



The road from ft garland down into taos is pretty flat and not heavily trafficked, but it's not maintained outside of daylight hours so keep that in mind.  


My advice would be to head down with a plan to sleep in walsenburg, and take it real slow on i25, especially the 30 or so miles before walsenburg.  I wouldn't do raton pass because it's steeper than la veta pass and has a lot more traffic.  It also puts you east of angel fire so you'd either have to go through the mountainous roads to get straight to taos via cimarron or go the long way round via Las Vegas, but the pass through sipapu is usually worse than la veta pass anyway.

How comfortable/experienced are you driving in winter conditions? This winter has been ridiculously mild, but we are finally beginning to get some snow. Usually (in Taos), road conditions begin to improve once plows start running. It always seems like the first snow catches everyone off guard, and it seems to take longer to get the roads cleared.

Which route are you taking in to Taos? Also, will you be primarily in Taos? Or will you be visiting surrounding areas? I can't really comment on the roads in Colorado. The Colorado highway department or department of transportation would be a good place to look (as suggested in another comment). Generally the main roads in the town of Taos aren't bad. Even though it sometimes takes the Town a while to get them cleared. You're more likely to encounter icy and/or snowpacked roads the further you venture from the Town, although the highways are usually not horrible once the plows start running. 

I've been driving during winters in the area since I was a teenager, and the majority of the time that has been on  FWD cars, with all season tires and no chains. It's definitely doable, but it does depend on your experience and comfort level. 

Finally, it is rarely a good idea to drive during a storm. But there are storms and then there are STORMS. As you'd imagine, visibility, traction, and traffic are all factors you have to consider when driving in a storm. Sometimes visibility and traction are low, but you have more room for error because there just aren't a whole lot of cars on the road. And of course the opposite is true as well.

This turned out to be a long post for a simple question, but I'll just leave with this: I believe other vehicles are the most dangerous part of driving in the winter. Whenever possible, give yourself enough space. There are many people in the area that have been driving in winter here for decades. But there are also many people from out of town who may have less experience. All that being said, I think you'll be fine once you're in Taos.",t2_dg7yb66m,Strange_Magazine_322,0,1640715521.0,0,t1_hqb0p3c,hqb0p3c,True,[deleted],t3_rqjpbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/taos/comments/rqjpbv/road_conditions_this_weekend/,Road conditions this weekend,/r/taos/comments/rqjpbv/road_conditions_this_weekend/hqb0p3c/,2,r/taos,0,2

"If you have common sense you can easily look at the road conditions or check them online or ask on Facebook or just wait till the snow melts to travel.  Only in the worst of multi day storms (rare these days) have I just hunkered down at home in front of a fireplace waiting it out for a day while the world turns into a magical winter wonderland.  There nothing horrible about winter or traveling in the winter 99% of the time it is sunny and clear and roads are fine to drive once you wait for the plowing and cinders. You have to keep tabs on the weather if a storm starts in the middle of the day, if you are out, to be sure you can get home before road conditions deteriorate to make it unsafe to drive - but again, common sense is the solution. If you wait too long to head home and it turns out to be a doozie, then stay where you are until it is safe. If you are asking specifically about the drive from Dixon to Taos - your worst problem is going to be the stupidly slow drivers (not just a problem in winter though) and the irrational folks who decide they have to pass when it’s unsafe. Oh, and I drive a Prius and generally it is fine. Dixon to Taos is paved and maintained in weather, so just don’t drive when it’s obviously unsafe and you will be fine.  And yeah, you’ll have to dig your car out after a big dump if you don’t have a garage but the snow is almost always powder and super light to dig....",t2_mtwoy,carlab70,0,1639714210.0,0,t1_hovidms,hovidms,True,[deleted],t3_rhknuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/taos/comments/rhknuh/can_someone_please_tell_me_what_winters_look_like/,Can someone please tell me what winters look like in Taos?,/r/taos/comments/rhknuh/can_someone_please_tell_me_what_winters_look_like/hovidms/,1,r/taos,0,1

"I don't work in education, but the schools usually close a couple times during the school year, and have a delayed start due to snowfall a couple times as well. 

I would say a lot depends on where you live, what kind of vehicle/tires you have, and the time of day you travel. If you live on the Mesa, windblown snow accumulation is a concern. It's certainly possible you could get stuck in a snow bank if you are going too fast for conditions, or if just have to swerve out of the way for a car sliding.

Many side roads in Taos county are unpaved, dirt roads. If you live down one of these, or a long ways down one, after the spring thaw snow melt, these roads become muddy.

- It would be a lot easier to rent a car. Taos isn't a walkable town, and as a former road cyclist, there's no way I'd ride my bike in town.

My info is from a few years ago. You have to apply through the county for an address which can then use for a building permit. It may already have a designated address. The county has that info. They told us that address would not be legally usable as a mailing address unless we built a permitted residence. My understanding is you can’t get mail delivery to an empty plot of land. You can’t use it as a residential address until you have a permitted home completed. And after your home is completed there is probably some next step to take with USPS to get it registered. Maybe there is some way around this. I just don’t know. The county and USPS will have the answers.

"Eh. Lived here since 2007. Moved here from Philly but originally from the SF Bay Area. Used to love Taos, it’s really a former shell of itself anymore. Since Covid, it’s been over run. Housing has always been hard, it’s nearly impossible now. Traffic is awful. Need 2 weeks advance reservation to eat in any restaurant - most restaurants are closed during the week. Used to have art openings and live music - with few exceptions these are no longer. Maybe that’ll change, maybe not. Cell service frequently sucks, don’t expect mail delivery and tracking down UPS or Fedex packages can be a part time job. You’ll be ordering a lot online because very little specialty anything is available locally. Driving to Santa Fe or ABQ to meet needs is common, including healthcare and groceries. Did I mention that traffic is awful and frequently dangerous. Did I mention the 2+ month wait if your dog or cat needs to see a vet (there are only 2), or you can drive to Santa Fe (but even there they will only see existing clients). Airport in ABQ is 2.5 hour drive away - big drag for going anywhere or anyone visiting you. No Wells Fargo or BofA, just small local banks which is fine unless you bank at a big bank and don’t want to have to change. Anyway, I could go on and on about all the annoying day to day realities. The air is dry, the weather is generally agreeable (I don’t mind snow) except spring (ugh wind). It’s a short growing season - you are lucky if you have 3 months to garden and even then not every place you might live is it easy to garden (think wind and hail).  Our last frost can be in June and our first frost threatens in Sept. The views can be awesome (rainbows, sunsets, mountains) if you have the right vehicle (4 wheel drive Toyota or Jeep) there are fantastic outdoor adventures where you can completely get away from any other people.  Fall is beautiful (this year spectacular). Taos Pueblo is unique (but closed to the public since Covid).  Within driving distance of places like Chaco Canyon, Moab, Durango, etc.  I’m actually planning on moving out of Taos to get away from the stupid traffic and over crowding.

"Taos is facing a grievous housing shortage. Long term rental units are basically impossible to find--everything is an airbnb.

I've been here almost 12 years and I'm in the process of leaving for good. It was cheaper and easier to buy a house in Albuquerque than it was to find another place to rent.

I'm also from the east coast originally--there are some cultural differences that might drive you insane. The slow, lenient pace of life is nice until you need something done. The frustration I've experienced (and money flushed down the toilet) trying to do things as simple as signing up for a cell phone has been unreal. The consistency, competence, and accountability you are used to being from a large, Eastern city will not be part of your life here.

Here is a typical Taos experience. I rented my last house through a property management company. They did less than the bare minimum--I had to talk to two zoning boards and the county tax assessor just to be able to have 911 service and get mail. (Forget getting mail delivered to your house--you'll be lucky to have a cluster box on your street. And the Ranchos USPS office is a living nightmare. Avoid at all costs.)

I really don't recommend living here. If you're set on the homesteading thing, try the surrounding areas. Dixon, Questa, etc. Same great view, same restricted access to...well, everything...but the prices won't be as insane.

"True story. I was living in San Cristobal which is north of Taos. I was Waiting tables for a living in a restaurant in a resort on the highway going towards the ski area. It was 93-94. I was struggling in my life. Lost. The artist RC Gorman lived near by and would frequent this “fine” dining restaurant.  And I waited on him several times and this one fine evening  he asked me, How do you like it here in Taos? And I told him it was okay.  I hadn’t quite found my footing at that point. Again, I was lost. And then he proceeded to tell me this:  “ you know Taos Mountain. Yes? Well, the mountain knows. And. It will either accept you, or it will SPEW you out.” I’ll never forget that. 

Because guess what. It indeed spewed me out eventually. I swiftly got out and ran towards Las Vegas (New Mexico)to find myself (and the future father of my son who is now in his freshman year in college). 

Long story short- when you move  to Taos just listen to the mountain. The energy here will either flow for you or ask you to take pause and consider somewhere else. It’s a magical place. But it can be kind of a crossroads for people. It’s a vortex.

The taos way in my experience of a few years living here is 2021 rates for labor but old fashion sloppy work.  You really better learn to do things yourself.  If you live in the right place, it's quiet and scenic.  


I like summer and winter, spring is just very windy and too warm to close the windows and run the humidifier.  Fall is alright, but again uncomfortably dry most of the time, but with a chill that's hard to shake.  Mail delivery is on par with third world countries.  Package delivery is somewhat better, but ""two day shipping"" is a week plus in Taos, so plan far ahead, or plan periodic trips to espanola, Santa Fe, or Albuquerque worst case.

"This is a phenomenon that takes place everywhere across the globe. Try as we might, we are tribal creatures. For a good many years, the xenophobia against Texans here was kind of subconscious- something that you did when you remembered to and was more about the cultural differences than anything else. Covid changed that in a big way and for multiple reasons. All of a sudden, everyone seemed to want to be here and Taos did not appreciate it. The new resentment seems to have stuck. The good news is, Coloradans have taken up the mantle as the new go to visitors/newcomers to hate. Texans have been a part of this place for a long time. Many of their grandparents and great grandparents visited here regularly. They basically just want to party, they’re generally polite and they spend and tip like money is water. Coloradans, on the other hand are uptight, snobbish, want to turn Taos into some utopian version of Salida and are definite newcomers.

I'm very conscious of your opinion and want to very much not be *that* person. Thank you for sharing.  I live in a community that has also become very popular to a point that we could not afford to live here had we not bought a house 25 years ago.

"I can’t speak for the rest of Taos but I can say for myself that the #1 reason not to move here is that we don’t want you here. Okay, not we, I. Me.  And it’s not personal, it’s really not. You could be the coolest motherfucker and have tons to offer and you and I might have everything in common and I’m still not going to be able to get past the fact that I now have one more person to compete with for resources. Believe it or not, Taos used to be something bordering on affordable. Those three to four jobs we held down in order to make the whole thing work were kind of fun. We knew everyone and when someone new arrived, we were skeptical but generally happy to have someone new to talk to. Bonus if they were attractive and single. Now there are hordes of hipsters dressing like extras from some Santa Fe eighties show and you can barely park at Cids for all of the Sprinter vans. We had to shut down our favorite hotsprings because no one knows how to keep shit off of Instagram and finding a rental, even as a long time local with connections is basically impossible.

"Nope. I'm 25, gay, and live in Los Alamos, but from the east coast as well. Before I moved into town I spent two years renting a guest house in the middle of nowhere on Pueblo land. The only thing that I think people understand about why I live here is that I have a really solid career track, but the real reason I live here is the place. I could've gotten a job back home easily, but after a summer here I had to come back. The mountains, the canyons, the desert, the seasons. Northern New Mexico is incredibly beautiful and I while I feel you on wanting to move to a big city (my sister lives in Denver) to find a stable partner, I'm just not sure I could *really* do it. The Land of Enchantment (or Entrapment) can really get it's claws in you. The other thing that really helps is how progressive this area is. Coming from the East Coast I don't feel at all in opposition with the values of those around me. I get that same feeling of, am I wasting my youth in this place, but going for a hike with my dog always reassures me that, at least for now, this is the place I want to be.

"Pretty much all dogs will chase fast moving cars, bikes, etc. It’s instinct (how wolves catch their prey and dogs are descended from wolves) and it should be obvious if you have any life skills.  They are also protecting their territory from intruders - you. Whether the dogs are pets (likely if you see them running out from a house) or truly wild (it’s possible, I’ve heard some feral dog packs exist in the Mesa), they were there first. An air horn is a fine idea, I’ve also heard if you ride directly at them, aggressively, they’ll break off their pursuit. Unless they actually bite you, there isn’t anything to “report” to anyone and I’m sure animal control would have a good laugh once they heard you were riding a bike being chased by dogs.

From this, I'd agree with the post you shared.

"Ranchos Plaza Grill is in my opinion the best restaurant in town. Bent Street Deli allows dogs on their patio, their Ruben is delicious.

Lots of great hikes, Williams Lake is good for a chill mountain hike. Go early because it is heavily trafficked, but not in the mornings. If you're looking for a challenging day hike, you can go up to Wheeler Peak. If you want to avoid people, Gold Hill has similar views but much less popular as it isn't the highest point in New Mexico. It's also worth going to the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge for sunset. You can walk out on the bridge, but there is a trail that runs south from the parking lot called the West Rim Trail. It's flat and very easy but you're walking next to a 600ft deep gorge and if you go at sunset you'll understand why the mountains are called the Sangre de Cristos!

"You make good points. I will say that there have been several fatal shootings in the blocks around us in Bed Stuy in recent weeks, but completely agree that they seem confined to people involved in shady shit. Of course, there are ""collateral"" deaths (bystanders killed) sometimes, too. Some really sad stories like that of late. 

Agree about the desperation factor and the meth. Though just because hipsters are living near you doesn't mean that you yourself aren't desperate, and there is still a lot of crack here and a real epidemic of K2 and other ""synthetic weed"" in certain parts of Bed Stuy/Brooklyn. 

There is something about the unhinged, desperate vibe from meth heads in more rural areas, though... it freaks me out in an entirely different way.

"I was through there a few weeks ago. There is very little housing and it’s really expensive. I saw a lot of help wanted signs and they all said $9-12 an hour. So idk how they plan to solve that. But the “government handout” thing is a lie. If it was true all the restaurant had to do was call the employment office and let them know that they’re trying to hire their employees back. Any employee has to go back to work or lose benefits. 

On my way back home I drove through small north Texas towns .. they are all completely shut down. So those people are screwed. Can’t afford to live in the city. 

And I did not encounter many travelers until I got to mid Colorado. Pikes peak area was packed. Plenty of staff too. Every hotel there was full. I got lucky and found a one room at a cracktale.. apparently someone canceled 

If they want laborers in Taos either pay way better so they can drive in .. which is crazy considering the traffic already on those roads .. or build affordable housing. 
It looks like they all found other jobs either better paying or closer to home.

"Taoseno here. I've ridden plenty on the pavement here (usually as a means to get to dirt/gravel roads) and can't remember a single time an overtaking car has failed to get completely over into the other lane (if there is one) to give a wide berth. The license plates that do this are NM, TX, OK, and every other kind you see here.

We live in Seco and mostly bike around here, Valdez, and other not-far-from-Seco places. If we rode down Paseo del Pueblo Norte/Sur we'd have a different experience I imagine. And now that I mentioned it, I can recall a few times where motorists did not give a wide berth or seem to slow down when overtaking, but that's on the more heavily trafficked highways (522/230/64) with lots of traffic in both directions, making motorists have to choose between slowing down or not giving a wide berth. They do sometimes choose the latter, but again it's mostly on the heavily-trafficked paved highways. And I've experienced zero hostility.

I've had more hostility from motorists when biking in PDX where I was a daily bike commuter for years (supposed bike capital of the US, but the amount of ballsy cyclists there actually creates conflict w/motorists) and feared for my life way more when biking in Nashville, TN.

I recently said to my wife: Taos has almost no bike trails and hundreds of miles of great biking. You just need to get off the beaten path onto the local backroads, most of which are dirt.

RE: the other comments, I do notice that drivers here weave a lot. I don't know why -- altitude maybe? That seems like it would make for dangerous biking, but again, I haven't experienced that.

Let your own risk tolerance be your guide, but I think Taos is a freaking great place for cycling if you're willing to get off the pavement.

Sidenote: there are tons of private roads here. Those aren't like gated-community-call-the-cops-on-you private roads, they're just owned and maintained by the neighborhood association rather than the county/state. If you're respectful, nobody seems to mind a bicyclist cruising down their private road.",t2_8j5lm8cz,pmtnm,0,1625107539.0,0,t1_h3mzegy,h3mzegy,True,waveofgradients,t3_oapciy,https://www.reddit.com/r/taos/comments/oapciy/road_and_gravel_biking/,Road and gravel biking?,/r/taos/comments/oapciy/road_and_gravel_biking/h3mzegy/,2,r/taos,0,2

"I agree Taos would be a great riding destination, at least 6 months out of the year. However, road riding in the area is a bad idea, far too dangerous.  It is totally ride at your own risk.

There has been some discussion of making Taos more pedestrian friendly, but road cycling is not a priority.  Mountain biking is seen as a tourist attraction and being developed as such. You’ll probably get better answers by checking with Taos Cyclery in El Prado - they have brochures and such to biking in the area.

Or the last week of Sept/first week of Oct - usually best for fall leaves, warm days but cool nights.

Vaughn Dearing. He has done what you're trying to do. He bought land and built a home about 20 minutes from town. So did Sharon Gilster. You should definitely interview realtors and see how you connect and if you like their communication style. Harvey Blaustein also sells a lot of land.

"Displacing renters still makes you the enemy. It's a contradiction of philosophy because sustainable housing isn't profitable. 

It's more than just gentrification: realize that the money it takes to move is more than most people have, higher purchases prices means higher taxes for those people who do own, but because of the structure of our economy and inherent classism, as a country, we're screwed away. Landlords have no loyalty to their renters and will sell to you at surge pricing even if it makes their tenants homeless: this is why we poor people dont want you to come to NM.

"Sounds like you’re targeting NM monsoon season [1], which is probably the best way to beat the heat during the summer. Monsoon is relative, of course, and don’t plan on snowing in Sep, but it’s nice as afternoon clouds/storms cut the heat of the day.  You should plan for early morning hikes only, as thunderstorms in the mountains can be dangerous and you don’t want to be on a peak at the wrong time.

"Thank you for this.  I'm in a similar boat as OP and am sensitive to this attitude on this subreddit against those wanting to relocate to Taos.  We're hoping to retire earlier than expected and live modestly and respectfully off-grid, hike, bike, ski, cook... I don't want to  be made to feel like an intruder, but I also get it --'people want their space' and 'change sucks'.  Taos is a very special place and I respect those defending their way of life, but many who want to live near Taos want to live and protect that very same way of life.  Not sure where I'm going with this, but not everyone wanting to move to Taos is some Sprinter-driving trust-fund-kid.

"Best way to buy in there is to go to the county office with the owner and get the documentation that they actually own it, but it can be hard to determine survey markers out there to be sure of what plot you are looking at.  You could try to get a surveyor to go out there to verify that you are seeing what is documented at the county office by the seller.
