"I have been coming to LBI for many, many years. I love it. I also just spent close to two weeks in Southampton. LBI isn't even close to being like the Hamptons... which is a good thing. Both places have fantastic, clean beaches but the Hamptons is an entirely different vibe-both are great but LBI has a much more laid back vibe. I do agree that LBI has changed and continues to change- for good and for worse. But the entire tri-state area is going through that (look at the prices in the Hudson Valley in NY).  I moved to Brooklyn in 2004 and I can't believe the change in landscape and prices(some the largest increases in the nation in real estate). I do feel bad and can relate to those who long for the more low key vibe LBI had once because I see it too. My friends are shocked at the fact I rent an ocean-front place in Harvey Cedars every summer for a week or two and I do not even get the entire house for the ""bargain price"" of $4200/week but this is happening all over the shore. The Hamptons are much more expensive so NYers come down and think LBI is a terrific bargain (vs. the Hamptons) and they are buying up houses. The island will become more diverse in demographics of buyers (race/religion/sexual orientation). I see many NY plates here which I do not recall back in the early 2000's. Please do not hate all NYers though. I was raised in NJ and I continue to embrace the LBI traditions even though I have NY plates! I can't wait to visit again this Saturday.

Actually does make you feel alert and imparts a sense of euphoria.*

"I see where you’re coming from. The problem is that the property values even on the older houses are already so high, that it narrows the buyers down to those who can spend $800,000 or more on a small house that in most cases can’t be used in the winter. Unfortunately those buyers are usually developers, who can also come in at an all-cash offer at full asking price because they can knock it down, rebuild, and sell for $1.6-2M easy. A lot of it has to do with the bigger picture of declining wealth in the middle class and the fact that even with renting out seasonally, they can’t afford to keep their houses, and a large percentage of aging homeowners needing to pad retirement with whatever they can.

LBI has changed a lot in the last 30 years. Even going down the past few years it is almost unrecognizable compared to how it was growing up. It is changing a lot now, you are right, but it’s been doing that for awhile. I remember when Ron Jon used to be a tiny shack. I remember going to the beach and not seeing so much plastic washed up all over the beach (although one summer a bunch of dead fish washed up). I remember going to the movie theater that used to be next to the old Acme. My mom remembers when she was a child, being able to collect mussels on the rock jetties at the beach for my grandmother to cook for dinner.

With the rise of remote work, it’s possible that year-round rentals will start to take the place of the classic summer cottages, and a new winter or late fall vacationer population will take hold. I think the small seasonal businesses will need to adapt, but I don’t think they will all die out completely. 

The Increase in severe storms and flooding each year will eventually demolish or destroy the older small houses remaining on the island that haven’t been raised, if they outlast the steady turnover of real estate that’s already been happening. And eventually, the island will disappear all together (grim, but very plausible given the current state of the climate and the fact that LBI is a skinny barrier island). But as I’ve mentioned before, I probably won’t be in LBI to see this since our house will most likely be gone in the next few years, sold off so my mom can retire without financial worry. I certainly can’t afford what it costs to vacation there on our income, so “goodbye house” means “goodbye LBI”.",t2_2hj3k38e,beeinabearcostume,0,1628557477.0,0,t1_h8cu0il,h8cu0il,False,rsvp_nj,t3_p15syo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/p15syo/priced_out/,Priced out?,/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/p15syo/priced_out/h8cu0il/,1,r/LongBeachIsland,0,1
"Oh I’m not blaming anyone. I understand the concept and benefits of property investments. 

Based on what I wrote, I suppose my wish would be for property values to rise, without demolition with oversized replacements. In the long term I don’t think this benefits local businesses that rely on vacationers coming in and out. Perhaps the future is now bringing more year ‘round occupants which will offset that, and help local businesses. Not sure. But I am sure it would change what most of us know to be LBI.",t2_p81z02,rsvp_nj,0,1628553681.0,0,t1_h8cm46y,h8cm46y,False,rsvp_nj,t3_p15syo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/p15syo/priced_out/,Priced out?,/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/p15syo/priced_out/h8cm46y/,1,r/LongBeachIsland,0,1
"Wow. Okay, so…You can’t blame the homeowners on this one. There are a lot of people that are about to retire and that retirement income might come in the form of selling their vacation property. My mom always talks about selling our LBI house (grandfather purchased in the 50’s) that we rent out during the summer and enjoy ourselves maybe 2 or 3 weeks out of the year. I can’t blame her because there’s no way her 401k will be able to support her, and owning a vacation property is a bit of a luxury at this point for any normal person, even if she only ever goes down there to do maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. Renting it out all summer she barely breaks even with taxes, insurance, utilities, etc. And a good amount of renters steal or break things. Not all, but enough. Renting out is something we did and MANY do in order to hang onto the property, not to use it as income or because we want to, and probably sometime soon we’ll and many others will have to sell just to make ends meet.

As boomers slip into retirement, it’s only natural the old houses are sold off to help pay for that. Good news is that in 10 years it’ll all be underwater anyways I guess.

But in all seriousness, it must be nice to be able to afford to spend $1-2k a week on vacation. You can probably vacation many other places. Or book a hotel. I actually feel bad for the year round residents that have to deal with this because they actually live there. That is their home. I have absolutely no place to complain if my annual vacation home goes away, even if I have been spending time there every year for the past 35 years and it’s actually my family’s own house, not someone else outside my family who owns it (in which case I REALLY couldn’t complain because there was never any guarantee I’d be able to rent it out every year anyways). Whether it is sold completely —as seems logical for people retiring— or the owner decides they just don’t want to deal with renting it out anymore in their old age. Yes it does suck for some renters who have had the privilege to rent each year at the same place, but think how shitty it is for someone to be forced to sell a house that has been in their family for generations, or how crappy it is to have to rent it out to strangers and no longer be able to enjoy it themselves or with their own kids as a summer destination. Even then, it feels really obscene to complain about.

"So I totally misused that term, my apologies. I meant to say that you want a home that has the capabilities to have occupancy during the colder months. A lot of the beach cottages and older homes on the island that were originally meant as vacation houses do not have heat or insulation, so there is no way they can be rented out over the winter. Our home is one of those. Before winter we close everything up, drain all the pipes, plumbing, and appliances of water, and shut the water off. In the Spring we go back down, inspect everything, make upgrades, and prep for occupancy. The home is empty in the winter, and we rent out in the summer. 

We only spend time down there ourselves in the Fall, which a lot of owners who rent out are typically doing more of as each year goes by. The water is still quite warm through September (especially for us now coming down there from MA), and the weather tends to be warm enough to stay down there through October. The only drawback is that it is also the height of hurricane season, which thus far we have been very lucky with. Apparently my grandfather selected the lot for the house very carefully because it has just enough elevation that even during Sandy, our home did not flood, and it isn’t even raised.

We also have a small number of neighbors who are year-round residents. They help us out so much with keeping an eye on the house and letting us know when tenants aren’t being very courteous. The last thing we want is to have our tenants bothering the people who live on our street. They also supply us with tons of hot gossip about happenings around the neighborhood.

If you do ever get into the market for owning a home on LBI, definitely pay attention to the elevation of the lot you are looking at. Even raised homes can be at risk for erosion or flooding depending on where they are located. If we ever do manage to convert our home to one that can be rented out year round (hopefully in the next few years), I’ll make sure to reach out to see if you happen to be looking for a lease.",t2_2hj3k38e,beeinabearcostume,0,1607184946.0,0,t1_gepj3wo,gepj3wo,False,arw1993,t3_k6f3q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/k6f3q7/rentals/,Rentals,/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/k6f3q7/rentals/gepj3wo/,2,r/LongBeachIsland,0,2

"Hello - good luck with your search! There’s some rentals groups on Facebook that might be able to help.

"We only rent out in the summers because our house is not winterized, and from what I’m told we are almost booked through next summer, and into the first few weeks of my precious Fall. Coronavirus has made this coming summer something for people to look forward to I guess. Definitely reach out to a realtor or a few realtors ASAP, especially since you are looking for a winterized home for a year’s lease starting right at peak season. Each unit of our duplex (not a new build but an older home built in the 1950s—well maintained and updated) rents out for at least $2k per week from Memorial Day through Labor Day, so prices during the summer may be very steep. You would probably find an easier time summering on the mainland and renting out a winterized home in the off seasons. 

Im not sure what your budget looks like, but fixer uppers near where we are sell for no less than $750k, even if they are complete tear downs. You basically are paying for the location, not the house. But again, I don’t know your financial situation so that might not be an issue. Our house has been in our family for 3 generations and my parents started renting out to help with costs and we took over from them, so that’s the only way we even still have it.

EDIT: I realize now that I misused the term “winterized.” We are still new to managing a summer house, so I am still new to some of these terms.

"You see right off the island on Rt 72. They built a giant team building gymnasium thing with zip lines and go carts.

"Pretty decent list. But some of the restaurants in there aren’t on LBI, and some are owned by the same people, so you kind of get a similar food experience with those. The Arlington is open year round which is awesome and is okay in terms of food, but since opening several years ago, the menu hasn’t changed. Same goes for Daymark, it’s sister restaurant. Considering the entree list is short, it would seem logical that it would be short so items would be changed or rotated, but it’s just the same 6 or 7 items. For years. 

The Gables for dinner, The Local for Lunch, and The Chegg for quick comfort food are my favorites on there. But, you’re bound to have a good meal at any of those places.

"Hey, took me a bit to reply because I wanted to get the exact math for you. Yes, our weekly July-August rent is 110% of monthly carrying costs. 

I went into this hoping to get close to break even, assuming I would “charge myself” that same rate that we would have paid for nice vacations. 

I’m just short of breaking even so far but we had some start up charges - repairs, new stove, painting - that were more than I expected. 

The upside is that we are getting much better off season rental than I expected and some inquires for full off-season rentals too. 

If you’re willing to consider pets in case by case basis in the off season, you’ll attract more people. 

I also changed up the interior- adding some colors, special art and better quality kitchen things. It makes our listing stand out hopefully in a good way. 

We bought a smaller place. I think they are - at least until recently - relatively overlooked. LBI is now about these huge places.

Interesting thanks. Yes I guess if you can get some May or early June renters in the books every year that helps a lot even if rent is 1/2 of high season. out of curiosity what is your weekly high season rent as a % of monthly tax + mortgage? From what I can tell properties I'm looking at weekly rent is probably about 100%-120% of monthly cost.,t2_awvbfv,snarfydog,0,1599742381.0,0,t1_g4o4g88,g4o4g88,False,snarfydog,t3_iphmhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/iphmhc/lbi_owners_do_you_rent_did_you_plan_on_renting/,LBI owners - do you rent? did you plan on renting when you bought? have your plans changed?,/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/iphmhc/lbi_owners_do_you_rent_did_you_plan_on_renting/g4o4g88/,1,r/LongBeachIsland,0,1
"Hi, I bought earlier this year. We rent, use some weeks and then give weeks to my parents, do some swaps with close friends. 

We are about two hours away and won’t make it down for every weekend. 

When I bought the place it came with a series of established renters including off season and early season renters who have been in place for a long time. That was a plus for me and we’re glad to continue with most of them. I did have to increase the rent - in part because our carrying costs are higher but also to allow for the improvements we’ve made in outdoor furniture and a better cleaner. 

I won’t break even on renting but it gets closer than I thought due to low interest rates and extremely high demand. People are already very eager to book for next year - you get those deposits now and can apply them to costs in the off-season.",t2_2o0ndig5,sterlingmanor,0,1599699334.0,0,t1_g4lutgi,g4lutgi,True,snarfydog,t3_iphmhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/iphmhc/lbi_owners_do_you_rent_did_you_plan_on_renting/,LBI owners - do you rent? did you plan on renting when you bought? have your plans changed?,/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/iphmhc/lbi_owners_do_you_rent_did_you_plan_on_renting/g4lutgi/,0,r/LongBeachIsland,0,0

I own a rental and agree with all of this. We allow re-books for well-behaved renters October 1 and are mostly booked up by early June.

"VRLBI is a site that a ton of owners use, run by someone who is also an LBI landlord. None of the insane vrbo/airbnb fees, I think he just charges owners a small amount annually. There's also a VERY useful LBI rentals facebook group, find a friend in it to invite you, it's private and hidden at the moment. Owners post cancellations, renters post things like ""looking for 4 bedroom on x dates for y price,"" etc. That's where I've found all of our rentals. 

&#x200B;

There is a huge uptick in scam rentals esp. through craigslist. If you are sending money be sure the name and address you are sending to matches the owner of record of the property (you can use [njparcels.com](https://njparcels.com) or the ocean county tax website to find out the actual owner). 

&#x200B;

As for timing we usually book in Spring but that's fairly late. Most owners offer returning renters the chance to book once the season ends (so, September) and then open up the books for new renters shortly thereafter.

"This may make you feel better in a backwards sort of way - my family has a very similar situation, in that we used to have a house in LBI and after selling it a while ago, we have rented a house for a family reunion for a week every year. I'm 46 and have never missed a summer.   Almost all of us used to live in the tri-state area, now almost none of us do but we still have lots of local friends on the island and who come down to visit during the week.  In our circumstances, we decided to cancel as we happen to all be on states and cities with super high infection rates and we would all have to fly.  We've been renting the same house for several years now and the person we rent from said most of their regulars whose families have to fly in have cancelled, and none of the driving distance families have. She was able to rent the house out for our week within 2 days to local-ish people.  If she hadn't, about 5 of our local friends were also interested in taking over the week.

So probably way too long story short - I think a lot of people who might otherwise be coming from areas you don't want us coming from are staying away.   And you've probably got pretty much the same risk you would have in the city, since a lot of people who normally go far away for vacation are now going down the shore.

"My entire family has been living on the island for the entirety of the quarantine so far, south of Beach Haven. My parents are in their mid 50s and my siblings and I are all mid 20s, we all still go out to the grocery store and a single outdoor bar that we think is being serious enough about the virus and safety conditions. Our area is clearly one of the less crowded spots on the island but I can honestly say that I feel safe enough for my parents and myself down here. The beach during the weekends and peak time of day is quite crowded so my family tends to go past 5pm or early in the morning and the beaches are much more cleared up. Luckily we are in NJ which is handling the virus so well. Most older people seem to be serious about wearing a mask in public but my entire family has decided to not go anywhere near Bay Village/Fantasy Island because people, especially the roaming squads of highschoolers, are very cavalier about wearing masks.

"So, I grew up in Manahawkin and we still keep a house there. My parents (mom in 70's, dad 80) have been down there a month. I spent a few weeks and just got back. I was really nervous about them spending most of the summer there. But honestly, everywhere I went that was necessary (stores, coffee shop, restaurant pickups) had people wearing masks and allowing space. We have had zero issues with people being unsafe in general. It felt to me like everyone was maskless outdoors, but staying only with their family groups. Outdoor dining areas had tables that were well separated.  I will say that I trust my parents to leave an area if they saw people gathering without masks or if there are too many people, as per common sense. You will see people being a little too causal about it, but it's not like those people were coming near us for any reason. My parents don't go out on the beach during the day or to any amusements, so I didn't have to worry about that. Although distancing on the beach shouldn't be hard. You're always going to get a few stubborn people that are gonna do what they want, but I felt really safe there and I felt safe leaving my parents there to go about their lives. As long as they are following common sense and guidelines, and are washing hands/making sure nobody gets too close to them while out in public, they should be fine!! Most of what we love about LBI is just hanging at the house with family, going out on the boat, or walking the beach early in the morning, so it's been low risk for them in general. As long as they aren't seeking out close contact with others in crowded places, it's really no different than being at home.",t2_3fwk8klw,T00narmy1,0,1595352814.0,0,t1_fysa73w,fysa73w,True,karenin89,t3_hvbemt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/hvbemt/lbi_question_about_covid19/,LBI Question About COVID-19,/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/hvbemt/lbi_question_about_covid19/fysa73w/,3,r/LongBeachIsland,0,3

"I grew up in Manahawkin, and still keep a house there in beach haven west. I've been down here near LBI for 2 weeks and I've seen plates from PA, NY and even Maryland pretty much every day. Other than wearing masks and outdoor instead of indoor dining, it feels very much like any other summer. There are common sense restrictions, and people are generally staying with their family groups and respecting social distancing. I didn't go to the beaches but they are open and I heard they were packed as usual for the July 4th holiday. I haven't seen or heard of any hassles of out of state visitors. The businesses and economy here depend on summer visitors so I'm sure it's seen as a good thing, generally. If you wear a mask when near others and social distance as much as possible (even on the beach, 6 feet should be no problem to maintain), I think you will be fine. Restaurants are open for outdoor dining/takeout and outdoor amusements (Fantasy island, water park) are open (with limited occupancy). I wouldn't be worried about it. It's our new normal for now but as long as you're following the requested guidelines you're fine.

">Im liberal but this is Trump Country to an extreme and most of the business owners won't be wearing masks if they can avoid it.

Maybe nobody has told you this, but you do not speak for the entire community.  Who asked you what party you support? Why do you need to make a discussion on wearing masks, which is recommended by public health officials in the midst of a global pandemic, a debate by even bringing political parties into the discussion at all?

I gotta admit boss, this kinda made me roll my eyes as much as it made me chuckle. Guess I shouldn't be surprised that someone is going to be so arrogant that they think they can effectuate guidelines around what ""a local"" is.

That being said, could you please direct me to the criteria which will determine if I qualify for your exclusive ""local club""?

"First off, I’m not suggesting to “gate keep”. It’s a tourist economy, and I know a whole bunch of people who would be drastically hurt financially. Also other people own homes here, and no one has the right to keep them from their property. I was simply suggesting that if it’s not something you’re comfortable with-you might not want to stay, as it’s mostly not locals who aren’t following all the rules but also vacationers from places that have been at the heart of it. Obviously, since you are a local, i guess you can’t leave. For the outdoors point- you can get it just as easily sitting next to someone outside. So unless you are going to protest outdoor restaurant seating, I’m not sure how someone behind a plexus glass sheet is more harmful to you-who kept their mask on. 

I never once said I didn’t wear my mask. I wear it every time I go into a building. However, i dont panic when I see people who don’t. I have my mask on-I’m doing my responsibility. When you walked into the building, and saw that both he and other customers ahead of you in line didn’t have their masks up-it was up to you to stay in there, that was your own decision. If I was that uncomfortable with something, I wouldn’t stay there for 10 minutes, wait for food, sass him and then leave. I simply would have left, called & explained or left a review to why I wouldn’t shop there again. You had every opportunity to not give your money to them-and yet you still chose to. Frankly im amazed at the idea that an actual local(not a second homer) would call police over this, on a locally owned small business who has already been hurting. I know someone who owns a restaurant here. All their business was outside-but their family was eating dinner inside. Someone called the cops. Guess what, having cops show up at your business -tends to hurt a business. The fact that you’re being so cavalier about potentially ruining a guys livelihood is somewhat shocking. 

I pick up groceries for neighbors on my st. I’m in acme almost every other day. While I’ve only seen a member of staff have their mask down twice, I’ve seen plenty of people walking around with their noses out. On top of that, I’ve witnessed more then one fling used gloves out a car window when leaving the lot. Should it happen? No. Does it happen? Yes. 

Many people think that things are going to far, so if every other customer in the store decides to lower their mask-you have every right to leave. You have every right to say something. You have every right to complain online. But calling the cops, and the health department in an attempt to shut them down is ludicrous to me. From what I’ve read of your comments - there wasn’t other customers that were pissed off, just you. They all new what they were doing-you don’t need to protect them. If you had just written this or a yelp review and talked to the owner I would have been 100% on your side.  But throwing a local business owner under the bus over something that clearly wasn’t offending anyone else in the situation and that you are a person completely able bodied to leave the store but didn’t-is what I find terrible.",t2_64iqqbpy,G_GaffGaff,0,1593386032.0,0,t1_fwban4p,fwban4p,False,tricksandkicks,t3_hhei6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/hhei6s/do_not_go_to_bageleddis_in_lbi_owner_is_not/,"DO NOT go to Bageleddi’s in LBI.

"I refute your point. I’m a local. Even when Acme started following guidelines back in March, I never, ever saw this. I go there once, sometimes twice a week at various peak and off hours. Even if this is something you’ve experienced, it’s not good that people are doing it, nor is it recommended. Out in public is one thing, because there’s a lot less control outside a private business. I understand that locals and vacationers follow varying levels of compliance in regards to masks. 

I have been careful to follow social distancing and other guidelines. If I’m going to give my money to a business to support them, I expect that they enforce the basic recommendations, or at least take the minimum steps to not be doing something against those recommendations.

"Another great round of information. I will hit the local tackle shop to see what they recommend and to get my rigs and try to stick with pretied ones in the beginning to make things easier.

"It all looks like you're in the right mindset. I would always recommend buying your rigs in person as opposed to online, that way you know they wont be bent when you get them, but to each their own. 

I don't see any line on your list, and rods come with no line on them. I personally prefer braided line for fluking because you can feel a lot more with it, but as a beginner you probably want to start with monofillament, line at  10-15 lbs test. its easier to work with and more forgiving

The only things I would recommend would be to buy pretied rigs rather then just a few different types of hooks. It looks like your hi-lo rig is one of these, but the wide gap flounder rigs look like they may be just the hook and no spot for the weight. This is fine but as a beginner its easier to have something set up already. I would grab them from your local bait and tackle shop. I really like the Fin Strike brand. 

The color choice didn't come through in the links, so make sure you're buying White and Chartreuse (lime green looking)  and you didn't link any weights. [This is the style you want if you're fishing for fluke](https://www.amazon.com/LEAD-BASS-CASTING-SWIVEL-SINKER/dp/B00EBHHLT6) they tend to drag nice along the bottom and weeds fall off easier (nothings perfect though) I would get a few different weights from 0.5-3oz. You don need more then 3oz because if you can't hold with that, you wouldn't want to be out in a kayak anyway 

I also forgot to mention [Bucktails](https://www.ownerhooks.com/product/bucktail-jig/), you fish them the same way as the flounder rigs, except the weight and the hook are one piece so it's a different presentation to the fish. sometimes the rigs work, sometimes the bucktails work. same with the rigs, you only want a bucktail thats about 1-3 Oz, and same as the rigs, the lower the weight that you can feel the bottom with, the more likely you will  be to catch a fluke, especially a big one. you might not get the feel right away but you will eventually. 

The last piece of advice I have is local tackle shops are way better then a bass pro or cabellas especially for a beginner, because they typically only carry things that work for the area, whereas bass pro would happily sell  you a lure that won't work in the area, they carry everything which includes many many wrong options for fishing locally.

When buying tackle just keep in mind that not every lure is designed to catch fish, many of them are designed to catch the fisherman in the store, just because its expensive and looks flashy doesn't mean its good, some of the best setups are under $5",t2_ykaig,Catesucksfarts,0,1589896903.0,0,t1_fr4u3z5,fr4u3z5,False,[deleted],t3_gm1by3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/gm1by3/any_fisherman_want_to_help_a_beginner/,Any fisherman want to help a beginner?,/r/LongBeachIsland/comments/gm1by3/any_fisherman_want_to_help_a_beginner/fr4u3z5/,2,r/LongBeachIsland,0,2

"Welcome to the best hobby you can pick up! I've been fishing the bay/ocean of LBI for 15+ years now so hopefully some of this information will help, if not, I'm bored at work so at least it will kill time for me!

Kayak: Looks great, the only recommendation I would be would to grab [A Drift Bag](https://www.fishusa.com/Drift-Control-Fisherman-Series-Drift-Sock?quantity=1&L-Size1=501&gclid=CjwKCAjw5Ij2BRBdEiwA0Frc9ZjJlUhhCJ1qFGazli1IVFC21Noo1P_2_Tw2XGDCqfk9arEBAS6D4BoCMaAQAvD_BwE)  You don't need it, but sometimes your drift can end up being to fast on a kayak to the point that you spend more time trying to get back to the spot as you do fishing. I linked a basic one, but honestly I've always just used a 5 gallon bucket with some holes punched in it  and it works fine. The bag might be better for a kayak though because you can fold it up when not in use.

Rod & reel: perfectly fine for back bay fishing, Just because you can spend a ton of money on setups that may be nicer, that is a great set up to start with. make sure you rinse it off after every use, I've had one like that corrode in a season because I was lazy with it

Bait: entirely dependent on what you are targeting.  to break it down to its simplest, big fish eat bunker chunks or clam, small fish eat minnows. Squid is great for fluke but not much else in my experience (feel free to correct me)

Fish by season starting now (mid may)

* Bluefish--> sometimes called the pariahs of the Atlantic, they will eat anything and tend to frenzy when eating, if you ever see something that looks [Like birds are hitting the surface like this](https://www.carolinasportsman.com/content/fly-ing-though-saltwater/attachment/diving-birds-usually-signal-feeding-trout-bluefish-or-spanish-mackerel/) thats a sign bluefish are forcing the bait up, otherwise they would get out of the way of the birds and swim down. Bluefish hit bait tail first, so [This is my favorite lure, but anything similar will work](https://www.jandh.com/products/deadly-dick-3-4-long-casting-jigging-lures.html?c=6095&gclid=CjwKCAjw5Ij2BRBdEiwA0Frc9RJoahhndW3EoKMfc7Nn3Vo_givRoD2d2tmmlWJTYIe0xS6L-riRbhoCxMQQAvD_BwE) BE VERY CAREFUL OF THEIR TEETH , they're like razor blades
* Striped bass: you're likely only going to get shorts in the bay unless you get lucky.  there are 1,000,000 books how to catch them but the short answer is if you know how to fish for large mouth bass in freshwater it is a lot of the same techniques but on a larger scale
* Seabass- same with striper, the keepers are almost all out at the wrecks this time of year but you might get lucky, its not really worth targeting in the back bay 
* Fluke (summer flounder)-- DO NOT FORGET BUG SPRAY -- This will be your bread and butter for back bay summer kayak fishing, try to find a spot up near an island or sandbar where the water goes from shallow to 6-8ft. They love to lay down in the natural troughs that form at the mouth of the little streams that cut through the bay islands. They lay on the bottom and don't move much so you have to find them. Do this by figuring out which way the tide/current is taking you and go ""upstream"" past where you want to target. Drop your line and allow the water to drift you down through the spot, when you get to the end, or a spot you don't like simply paddle back to the beigning and start over. I like to use a rig like [This one](https://www.westmarine.com/buy/sea-mar-tackle-co--fluke-rigs--11322591?cm_mmc=PS-_-Google-_-GSC%2520-%2520Product%2520Type-_-11322591&product_id=11322591&creative=108421551844&device=c&matchtype=&network=g&gclid=CjwKCAjw5Ij2BRBdEiwA0Frc9eVOoELEp6kzT-X9FwRz-qCDBf9IwERJYt0CZMltzYfGC54_F-a83hoChuUQAvD_BwE) with either a live minnow, or a [Fake Minnow like this](https://www.berkley-fishing.com/berkley-bait-soft-bait-berkley-powerbait/powerbait-power-grubs/1317176.html#start=10) or both. Sometimes white works, sometimes green, occasionally pink. I normally start with white and change if it isnt working. You want to use a little weight as possible while still holding bottom while fluke fishing because they are visual ambush predators and can tell when something inst swimming naturally. also, because the hooks are different due to their sideways mouths, you want to make sure you DO NOT jerk the rod to set the hook, simply bring the rod tip up and start reeling, otherwise you'll rip the hook out of their mouth. It takes some getting used to and you'll lose a few but thats normal don't get discouraged 
* Blowfish: good all summer long, grab an anchor and anchor up over a hole or trough, let out a chum slick and [a rig like these](http://www.allfishingrigs.com/2_GOLD_BEAK_LONG_SHANK_HOOKS_WITH_RED_BEADS_p/464.htm) you can use bits of clam or really anything that will stay on the hook. Their beaks can cut through most things so you'll get stripped a lot. I like to use [Fish Bites because they are cheesecloth with bait on them which makes it difficult for them to strip you](https://www.amazon.com/Fish-Bites-0007-Fishn-Strips/dp/B003OC14HY/ref=pd_lpo_200_img_2/146-9454213-3089131?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B003OC14HY&pd_rd_r=d000bca7-a10f-4a0f-81be-d882118126ff&pd_rd_w=zsOVs&pd_rd_wg=MHCIH&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=4MM60PGH1F72RGTB2M1S&psc=1&refRID=4MM60PGH1F72RGTB2M1S) key to blow fishing is make sure your chum slick is up stream from you. They're really easy to clean and delicious so they're fun to keep [This is the easiset way to prepare them, then you fry them up like chicken fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uysGRiIkxu8)
* weakfish: I honestly don't know because they are just starting to come back, find somebody over the age of 60 and they'll tell you all about what it used to be like 

as the weather warms up it will switch from blues and striper to fluke and blowfish, and then when it cools down it will be blues and striper again in the fall.  you can target winter flounder in the winter, but its likely way more effort then it will be worth especially off a kayak 

I feel like I'm forgetting some things so if you have any questions just shoot me a DM or something I'm happy to help! Welcome to the community and good luck!

"So we've been home for a few weeks and I'd love to update what we ate for anyone ranked worst to best...

Shore fire Grill - 3 out of 10 - Very Bland very disappointing. Would never eat there again.

Buckalew's - 5 out of 10 - Sushi was good, rest of food Ok. Great beer. Ok overall experience. Would maybe would go again, but defiantly would try something else over this in the future.

Woody Burger's - 7 out of 10 - Great Cheaper Burgers. Mine was Ok but wife's was great. Would defiantly go again.

The Local - 8 out of 10 - We didn't eat much from here but got coffee every morning. Very good coffee and great help from the employees. Wife got a Smores Latte 2 times during the trip. We'll stop here at least once on every other trip we do to LBI.

El Swell Taqueria - 8 out of 10 -  Great lunch spot. Was quick and delicious. Would recommend and defiantly go anytime I can.

Pinky's - 10 out of 10 - At first glance we were very skeptical based on the looks of the place. We were wrong. My wife and I got a bunch of things to share and EVERYTHING was delicious. This is a must do for every trip ever again to LBI.
