"I openly do not care about the politics in your town, that's for you folks to work out. Likewise I don't expect you to care about the politics of my small town on the otherside of the country.

My post isn't about left or right politics, which seems to be the issue you are taking with it.
It's a call for transparency in political advertising, something I had believed people from all viewpoints would want.
We're suffering from a group pretending to be local grassroots, and theyre garnering support that way.
They are doing the same in your community, they're not from Richmond Hill either. I'm not telling you how to vote, only informing you of a problem that I believe is worth dealing with.

"> road who *paid* the lowest

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Its a book about economics, its called basic economics its literally in my reply. The reality of economics is not a left or a right thing.



“*The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it.
The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.*”

― Thomas Sowell, Is Reality Optional?: And Other Essays 

*“The vision of the anointed begins with entirely different premises. Here it is not the innate limitations of human beings, or the inherent limitations of resources, 
which create unhappiness but the fact that social institutions and social policies are not as wisely crafted as the anointed would have crafted them.”*

"> They spoke about how the council was wasting tax payer money on bus shelters, but the money came from a provincial covid grant specifically for this kind of thing, not from our local municipal funds. 

The central banks print money out of thin air. Where does it get its value from? Or can we all just sit around and print money? Do you understand the implications of running an economy on fiat currency? Do you understand what is inflation or what is happening to your purchasing power of the loonie?

>They spoke about how they're spending tons on a new office block, but it was actually the cheapest option for tax payers, our tax would have had to increased otherwise. 

So these ""political operatives"" are people who want grown adults to make their own decisions? Instead of organizing society where the 40 percent use legislation to coerce the rest of the country to believe what they believe.

>Or recently there's been talk about a new park, and how developers were going to make the strata pay for it, but the council decided the tax payers should cover it. But the meeting notes show the pro's and cons of each option the council considered, and they went with one that they believe served the community best, and kept access to the whole community, not just the strata.

What is the issue if adults decide for themselves if they want their money to go to that? What is it about making decisions for other people that you believe is the most efficient way to organize society?

The market is magic, it can do wonders if you just let it. You think grown adults cant decide on where and how to build parks? And need other magic adults to tell them how? 



*The idea that third party observers can impose morally better decisions often 
includes the idea that they can define what are 'luxuries of the rich', 
when it is precisely the progress of free market economics which has 
turned many luxuries of the rich into common amentities of people in general, 
including the poor. Within the 20th century alone, automobiles, telephones, refrigerators, 
television sets, air-conditioners, and personal computers all 
went from being luxuries of the rich to being common items across 
the spectrum of Americans and among millions of people in many other market economies. 
The first video-cassete recorder sold for $30,000 each before 
technological progress, trial and error experience, and economies 
of scale brought the price down within the budget of most Americans.*

*In past centuries, even such things as oranges, sugar, and cocoa were 
luxuries of the rich in Europe. Not only do third party definitions of 
what is a luxury of the rich fail to account for such changes, 
the stifling of free markets by third parties can enable such things to 
remain exclusive luxuries longer than they would otherwise.*

Overall, Richmond Hill's population grew 3.6% between 2016 and 2021. For comparison:

* Toronto CMA: +4.6%

* City of Toronto: +2.3%

* Scarborough: -0.3%

* Downtown Toronto: +16.1%

* York Region: +5.7%

* Markham: +2.9%

* Vaughan: +5.5%

[I made one for Markham too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Markham/comments/tb6b0a/population_change_by_census_tract_20162021/)

Similarly to Markham, growth rate of private dwellings was higher than the growth rate of population. Total private dwellings increased 8.4% between 2016 and 2021 vs. 3.6% for population.

"Well, the GTA is really a rotting shell of a housing market, holding no real basis in “worth” of homes but rather an artificially inflated number due to a variety of economic shortcomings we face as a northern country, the lack of building materials and new construction projects is another factor; doubled with the immigration of people into the city at an unprecedented rate and now the COVID taxes. People really can’t afford to buy the house they moved into 10 years ago! despite earning more since they bought it. An average property in RH that was 650k in 2011 is now worth 2M… if that doesn’t scare people from selling here IDK what will. It seems as if the entire province has become a playground for foreign investors to further chokehold the middle class working people. Truly sad to see this happen but it’s our reality.

From this article: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-government-doesnt-want-to-harm-mom-and-pop-real-estate-investors/

“Small-time landlords do add to the rental stock,” Ahmed Hussen, the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion, said in a recent interview. “They provide rental stock to Canadian families and individuals. And so we don’t want to negatively affect them because they are actually providing a rental service to a lot of people.”

And from the same article:

""But with the country’s typical home price 41 per cent more expensive than in January, 2020, individual investors are increasing competition for properties and contributing to the rise in home prices""",t2_8ptqkdgx,Significant-Ad-8684,0,1645592665.0,0,t1_hy2btyw,hy2btyw,True,mamaliga-maker,t3_syujya,https://www.reddit.com/r/richmondhill/comments/syujya/how_are_young_people_going_to_be_able_to_live/,How are young people going to be able to live where we grew up?,/r/richmondhill/comments/syujya/how_are_young_people_going_to_be_able_to_live/hy2btyw/,3,r/richmondhill,0,3
"The Great Depression was one of the worst economic calamities in the 20th century, following the Wall Street Crash of **1929**.

John F. Kennedy (born in 1917) learned about the Great Depression **through studying textbooks** *while attending Harvard University.*

This inflating of real estate prices will absolutely devastate home ownership dreams of *some* local Canadians, born and raised in Richmond Hill.

But there will always be some Richmond Hill Canadians whose wealth will completely insulate them from trouble, and will never know that there was even a struggle.

This may or may not go against your perception of “hard work definitively pays off”. In truth, the booming economic situation of the 1950s to 1970s is much likelier to be the outlier rather than the norm.

Supply and demand is always true - if there aren’t enough houses built to supply the demand for purchase, the prices of homes will continue to skyrocket.

If your goal is to live in Richmond Hill, live in and enjoy it! There are amazing cultures, cuisines, and amenities present and vibrant within!

But keep in mind that we welcome in 400,000 (and increasing) new immigrants into Canada *every year* - and that most of them want to live in big cities like Toronto or Vancouver. You are unlikely to be the only person who wants to live in and own a detached home.

"I moved back here permanently from the fashion district in Toronto right before the Pandemic. I was here before that because I have an elderly parent here, but I hadn’t decided to relocate. 

I went looking for the kinds of organizations that used to be there when I grew up. The Curtain Club (which was given a hundred year lease on the land where it built the theatre by the town) was still here but nothing else seems to be. 

The Curtain Club funded itself for decades and paid for the building  equipment and workshop and productions itself. I expect that’s why it survived. 

When it reopens I’ll try to find out more. 

The Libriary System still offers a lot of services, I don’t see hands on workshops there. What they have is good though. 

There used to be all kinds of funding for things like art classes, writing workshops. Artists, book clubs, sewing (I’m not sure how well a sewing group would fly now or do people still play chess or Bridge?). There was a group called Helpmate, manned mostly by volunteers but also funded, that connected people with all kinds of health services or ANYTHING they might need, including --(especially salient now after all the lockdowns) mental health services.

Volunteering itself was a pleasant activity. 

There are some activities at the Community Centres that are not exercise oriented but they are primarily targeted at elementary school children. 

Wood working and DIY groups would probably work now. Neighbours with know how and training used to get together informally  to do these types of things. It doesn't look like they do now. So funding for meeting space and part-time administration and perhaps people to come in and conduct one or two day workshops might help here.

Interior Design and Decorating groups might work or Architecture groups.

A film club could work, with screenings and discussions. 

Kids used to have coffee house/candle bars where they’d hang out and discuss ideas. I’m not sure how this would work now--but there *were* places where young people could go to mix that we're suitable for high school students and primarily run by them. Maybe those are still here and hiding? They definitely are not funded. 

Is the Camera Club still around? Photograph/video classes and groups might work.

We used to skate on the Mill Pond this time of year. It was professionally cleared by the town and conditions were monitored. As of last week I couldn’t find any info about this except ‘I don’t think that happens anymore’. 

Do we still do a Winter Carnival with ice sculpture, outdoor music events and other attractions? I think we might and haven’t been able to do so because of the lockdowns. Is it still supported by the town--err...city. 

There used to be windsurfing and canoeing on Lake Wilcox. Looks like that’s gone. 

I have to check the names of the politicians who withdrew the funding. It’s not something you want to get wrong. 

But Richmond Hill used to be so much smaller and yet it had so much more to offer. All this needs to be jumpstarted again for the town to feel vital, alive and connected. 

A conservation club might be of interest to a lot of people since saving the environment and the earth has finally come into high focus.

There should have been more city planning. An action group or think tank for that might be of interest. In the past, we were trying to save the wetlands behind the Mill Pond and start the first recycling depot in the Toronto Area. In the 70s it was an uphill battle but we did it and the idea caught on:) 

People will usually volunteer out of passion, but they need meeting spots and running costs. 

There are $0 now. 

It’s crossed my mind to try to start some of the groups I wish I could participate in, but I’m not a leader by nature at all. 

When we’ve adapted to COVID maybe things will restart. Maybe there could be video conferencing groups until it’s safe to meet face to face. 

The Liberal used to cover and list activities. I found a Facebook group that was trying to list them, but there wasn’t much and I’ve deactivated my Facebook because I don’t believe it offers a very hospitable environment for interacting socially. (That’s how I landed on Reddit). 

We’ve got an election coming up and normally there would be meetings and places people could go to discuss past policy and issues. Some effort was made to do that in this group. 

You are not alone though--not many seem to be looking and talking. What happened to canvassing and candidate meetings? Suspended because of the pandemic or 
gone completely? 

I don’t know but I’d like to and I’ve seen Richmond Hill at its best. I know it can have a lot to offer. 

People need to step up and I believe they will if a leader doesn't have to fund the whole thing out of pocket.

"I sympathize with you. I spent my childhood years in Richmond Hill. That was early 2000s. Richmond Hill felt completely different then. I miss that RH. It's probably just nostalgia, and I should learn to let go, but honestly.. it feels like watching someone rip down your childhood home to replace it with a bigger better home. Does it make sense? Yeah, I guess. Does it take away the feel of the neighbourhood, or the culture of a town? Yes. Especially when a good chunk of those mansions are sitting uninhabited and they all look identical. Even down to the cars parked out front of them lol. It's sad to see the old vibe die.

"A unique culture - Richmond Hill is lost - there is no chance of us developing any unique local culture - it is just a suburb of Toronto - and with all the urban expansion it will soon be unrecognizable as something different

There used to be a unique sense of pride back when this place was very small and mostly rural because  the distance between here and Toronto was great - but now those lines are being erased 

not that it's all a bad thing - things change, places develop, but it leaves something to be desired and after spending my whole life growing up here I'd like to get far away from the sprawl and live to raise a family in a nice small town with a strong local identity 

my favourite part of Richmond Hill is the war memorial in old downtown that remembers the 6 people from Richmond Hill killed in the world wars - even though my family came to this country in the 90s and I have no connection to that era it just feels good to be surrounded by a local culture   

 This is just a place for people to live now. So any improvement would be just something practical that just connects us further to Toronto ( like transit) and not any cultural or figurative development

"Absolutely agree with this, but it does need to be balanced, right? Extreme intensification can't be the only answer. Not everyone needs or wants the same thing. Extreme intensification is dozens, if not a few hundred actually  of 40, 60 and 80 story towers at RH centre, Hillcrest and Bernard are not the complete solution. I heard 30 towers at Hillcrest,  40 towers at South Hill plaza, towers along time, at RHC and on the other side of 407 in Markham. Gentle intensification could provide more housing alternatives in more traditional neighborhoods. One key is having a well thought out plan that meets many needs and ""passes"", so to speak, the consultation processes. What's frustrating is having a plan and then having a council that just votes to override the plan in favour of certain by motion or provincial order.

Yes I can. This is me saying MSM is bad. ~~All~~ Most of mainstream media is working with the federal government. They are literally the 4th branch of government.

>We have to actually think - use our brains - to separate the wheat from the chaff. 

Running society and the economy into the ground because your own media is running weaponized propaganda that the majority swallow isnt showing a lot of critical thinking.

Keep on meddling in the economic affairs of other grown adults because they dont make the same choices you approve off. 



Firing front line health workers, not allowing truckers to do their jobs, literally creating artificial shortages and then blaming all of that on freedom is downright moronic. Good day statist, keep worshiping the state.

"When buying and selling is to be controlled by legislators. The first things to be bought and sold are the legislators themselves.

“*If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free, how is it that the 
tendencies of these organizers are always good? Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race? 
Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind?*”

― Frederic Bastiat, The Law


How about **NOT** voting away the rights of other people?

What is your precious state does that the free market cannot accomplish on its own? Politicians produce, invent, fuck all. They innovate fuck all, hire fuck all, employ fuck all. By what wisdom are they ordained with to push their beliefs on others? Or decide who should buy or sell what and at what prices? Or who is essential or who is not?

An economy cannot function on consumption and very little production, all while handing out money for people to sit at home. Production precedes consumption. Combine that with not allowing truckers to deliver goods and services and you have artificially created a shortage. And who is the culprit? Why its people's liberties of course. 

Bring back the gold standard and watch your purchasing power skyrocket. You dont need corrupt politicians to engage in mutually beneficial trade with one another.

What you are in effect stating (by voting): You believe that you have a moral obligation to forcefully and coercively use the state to push your beliefs on other people who dont agree with you.

Is that a sustainable way to organize society? Statism is no good.

[Philosophy of Liberty Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSB-ekz8To8)

“*The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; 
it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy. It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people 
who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another.*”

"You are certainly entitled to dislike someone for any reason and likewise vote however you choose.  But what you have said does not meet what many would interpret as corrupt or shady.  All councilor voting and expenses are public record.  There is no investigation or gotcha that uncovered any of this.  Some vote to approve more projects, other councilors deny most of them.  You can vote accordingly but there is nothing corrupt in either of it, in and of itself.  

You can take the exact opposite position and say those councilors who vote against all development projects are in the pockets of the environmental lobby and thus corrupt.  Then take out a paid for add to make it look objective, which it is not, and put an F beside their names. 

It seems to me you guys have a political preference, which is fine, but conflating it with something more is a mistake IMO.  There are a ton of arguments one can write about in favour of development serving the community in a sustainable way.

I don't like self promotion at taxpayers expense either, but it is legal, open public record and your favorite councilors seem to do it also, just a lesser dollar value.

As for Joe's wife running for office as an independent (I think it was the last federal election?), I don't really understand it either, but don't see anything shady or corrupt.  It's not like they are hiding who she is, it says so in big letters on her signs.  There must be some reason people run for office while knowing they have no chance of winning.

"When buying and selling is to be controlled by legislators. The first things to be bought and sold are the legislators themselves.

“*If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free, how is it that the 
tendencies of these organizers are always good? Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race? 
Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind?*”

― Frederic Bastiat, The Law


How about **NOT** voting away the rights of other people?

What is your precious state does that the free market cannot accomplish on its own? Politicians produce, invent, fuck all. They innovate fuck all, hire fuck all, employ fuck all. By what wisdom are they ordained with to push their beliefs on others? Or decide who should buy or sell what and at what prices? Or who is essential or who is not?

An economy cannot function on consumption and very little production, all while handing out money for people to sit at home. Production precedes consumption. Combine that with not allowing truckers to deliver goods and services and you have artificially created a shortage. And who is the culprit? Why its people's liberties of course. 

Bring back the gold standard and watch your purchasing power skyrocket. You dont need corrupt politicians to engage in mutually beneficial trade with one another.

What you are in effect stating (by voting): You believe that you have a moral obligation to forcefully and coercively use the state to push your beliefs on other people who dont agree with you.

Is that a sustainable way to organize society? Statism is no good.

[Philosophy of Liberty Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSB-ekz8To8)

“*The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; 
it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy. It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people 
who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another.*”

― Milton Friedman



“*The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it.
The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.*”

― Thomas Sowell, Is Reality Optional?: And Other Essays 

*“The vision of the anointed begins with entirely different premises. Here it is not the innate limitations of human beings, or the inherent limitations of resources, 
which create unhappiness but the fact that social institutions and social policies are not as wisely crafted as the anointed would have crafted them.”*

― Thomas Sowell, The Vision of the Anointed: Self-congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy 


“*It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong.*”

2. Extreme shadiness from his wife’s political run in the last election. I just don’t believe that they didn’t have conversations about how that was going to work and that he wasn’t somehow part of that equation.

tendencies of these organizers are always good? Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race? 
Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind?*”

― Frederic Bastiat, The Law


How about **NOT** voting away the rights of other people?

What is your precious state does that the free market cannot accomplish on its own? Politicians produce, invent, fuck all. They innovate fuck all, hire fuck all, employ fuck all. By what wisdom are they ordained with to push their beliefs on others? Or decide who should buy or sell what and at what prices? Or who is essential or who is not?

An economy cannot function on consumption and very little production, all while handing out money for people to sit at home. Production precedes consumption. Combine that with not allowing truckers to deliver goods and services and you have artificially created a shortage. And who is the culprit? Why its people's liberties of course. 

Bring back the gold standard and watch your purchasing power skyrocket. You dont need corrupt politicians to engage in mutually beneficial trade with one another.

What you are in effect stating (by voting): You believe that you have a moral obligation to forcefully and coercively use the state to push your beliefs on other people who dont agree with you.

Is that a sustainable way to organize society? Statism is no good.

[Philosophy of Liberty Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSB-ekz8To8)

“*The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; 
it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy. It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people 
who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another.*”

― Milton Friedman



“*The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it.
The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.*”

― Thomas Sowell, Is Reality Optional?: And Other Essays 

*“The vision of the anointed begins with entirely different premises. Here it is not the innate limitations of human beings, or the inherent limitations of resources, 
which create unhappiness but the fact that social institutions and social policies are not as wisely crafted as the anointed would have crafted them.”*

― Thomas Sowell, The Vision of the Anointed: Self-congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy 


“*It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong.*”

"I think you should give yourself more credit! You're doing more than most, asking questions and engaging here, and I certainly don't mind sharing my thoughts if it helps you in your research and decision process, no matter how you decide. 

This is a city staff report from the meeting where council thankfully voted to clarify that perrelli would have to pay for his own event out of his own funds (unclear if this has actually happened yet). 

[https://pub-richmondhill.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=42769](https://pub-richmondhill.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=42769) 

To make it really simple, on page 2, they indicated a few things: 

\- Prior to Aug 2020, bin exchanges were free, and the program cost the city around $31k each year to exchange \~3,900 bins 

\- Perrelli's 4-day event costed the city \~$140k, and he was going to keep running the event until the city paused it until they were paid first 

\- Perrelli raised \~$56k from sponsors (presumably for this event) 

\- Perrelli then said to the city that the \~$56k raised is for something else, and that the city should cover the entire \~$140k, **his words!**

I don't even know if he has actually reimbursed the city back for the cost of his events. **In my view, if he truly cared about the taxpayer and doing what he promises, he would raise the money and reimburse the city so that the city (and all of us) is not left on the hook for his personal event.** 

Of course, this is just one specific example, but from what I've been reading, perrelli's actions display a pattern, and the cost / impact of these actions / decisions eventually add up, with residents absorbing any negative impact in the end.",t2_kd2lo,forevernameless,0,1641866206.0,0,t1_hs5ddtj,hs5ddtj,False,constantlyhere100,t3_rx5fbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/richmondhill/comments/rx5fbm/the_past_council_voting_record_of_the_major/,The past council voting record of the major Mayoral candidates - See where they stand,/r/richmondhill/comments/rx5fbm/the_past_council_voting_record_of_the_major/hs5ddtj/,4,r/richmondhill,0,4

"I think most of what perrelli has done is generally with the aim of self promotion, which is probably why you (and many others) may hear an incomplete message on things like the bin exchange. 

I think what was more troubling was that when he launched his bin exchange program he said it would be paid for by sponsors. He raised some funds from sponsors, but when it came time to pay for the bins, he asked the city to cover it for him (and he would keep what he raised from sponsors). Thankfully council voted against that motion to and required perrelli to pay for his bin exchange events, as it would not have been good value to use ~$140k of city funds to pay for his personal event.

1. The city will generally always advise against unsanctioned activities, regardless of whether it is actually safe or not. 
2. The statement was made on Jan 4. At a certain point it will no longer be meaningful, as in disconnected from the true reality of whether the ice is or is not thick enough. But because of point #1, the city will not update it to anything different... until the city is managing the activity.
