"A fire back in December left over 80 cats and kittens without a home.  Many of them are still living on the property, which I think is abandoned.  Subsequent trips to the site have led to them discovering newborn kittens, as well as dead ones.  They're trying to get all animals medical treatment and rehomed as quickly as possible.

Some will need more of a ""barn cat"" environment.

[Their latest post](https://www.facebook.com/kellerskats/posts/3220796438152306):

>Urgent barn homes and fosters needed. We will return to the propertry where the 80+ cats are this Sunday to rescue more. We were contacted last night as 4 newborn babies were found and 3 deceased. We have them safe in a foster home and are trying to catch the mom. This will continue to happen unless we secure fosters and barns to place the cats as we rescue them. We need:  
>  
>Fosters to that are willing to take 1-2 of these cats. They will be in a large dog crate so they can decompress and we can determine if they are adoptable or if they need a barn home. If they are adoptable they can be moved to our adoption centers.  
>  
>We need barn homes for the cats that are not adoptable but would do great in a safe barn environment.

>If you can help PLEASE text Karla at 585-802-6454 or Jen at  585-703-3049 . We have our vet ready to help with veterinary care of 25-30 cats Monday morning of we can secure fosyers and barns.

"Bad solution IMO, I'm in favor of helping out people with low incomes, but do it in a way that doesn't dig us deeper into the hole that produced this problem (people buying vehicles that are too inefficient, people having commutes that are too long, bad city planning / too much sprawl, insufficient mass transit, insufficient bike culture and infrastructure, etc).

I prefer California's solution of giving universal, flat dividends directly to all taxpayers independent of gas use. Why?

Because it gives a lifeline to the low-income, but it doesn't give the largest subsidy to the people most driving up gas demand and the least subsidy to the people who benefit society the most (people who use little or no fuel).

It maintains the very necessary disincentive towards people continuing to buy unsustainable gas-guzzling vehicles, while encouraging people to switch to compact/EV/hybrid (or reducing car use entirely).

Our fuel is still too cheap. Our nation is sensitive to gas price hikes because we built our nation wrong, it was only possible because historically we've always had among the cheapest fuel on earth (especially relative to incomes).

When you *only* touch the gas tax, you continue to make purchasing gas guzzlers viable. You subsidize the worst offenders the most and the most efficient the least; it's a perverse incentive structure. You continue to encourage urban/suburban sprawl, single-use zoning, low density development, and other bad land use practices.

Keep the gas prices high, make the relief a flat amount. This helps *everyone* while discouraging bad habits (by both people and city planners / govts) and encouraging good ones.

And we *all* benefit from the externality implications.

Below that are local numbers which are around $30-$32/hr. and you're at $36/hr with your tenure which sounds about right.

"I appreciate your willingness to have a discussion about this, and I recognize that I haven't put the effort in to be as clear about the abstract idea I'm trying to describe, so let me try again.

* The sticker implies that the reader's right to speak English is due to the sacrifice of veterans 
* The sticker is not inclusive of non-english speaking people who are also American and free - i.e. if I'm a Vietnamese speaking American, I shouldn't thank the veterans because they only fought for english speakers

Here's a couple thought experiments:

* How would you interpret this sticker as a german speaking jew that fled to the US from the holocaust?
* How would you interpret this sticker as an Iraqi fixer who was granted US citizenship as a result of their work in the gulf wars?

I'm just saying. The sticker should say (if we're trying to achieve the intent I assume the guy with the truck has) ""If you're able to read and speak the language of your choice, thank a veteran.""

Get home, put water and a dollop of olive oil for couscous on to boil. Throw broccoli in microwave. When water boils, turn off heat, add couscous and cooked broccoli. Let sit for a few minutes. Stir in crumbled feta. Serve with salad and chicken.

Sausage and tort soup:

* Box/can of broth

* A few spoonfuls of Plain/garlic hummus

* Fresh Rosemary

* Can of white beans

* Can of diced tomatoes 

* Bag of Frozen spinach

* 1/4 c Parmesan cheese

* Fresh tortellini

* More parm for on top

* Rosemary sourdough bread 

Sauté and break up sausage in a soup pot. Add broth through 1/4 c parm and let simmer for a bit. Cook torts separately. Serve soup over torts with parm on top and bread to dip.

"To be fair, there's a difference between invading countries winning and defending countries winning.  The Axis wanted to literally take over countries/territory, so it makes sense that they would have at least partially forced their culture on others--especially Japan.  

Plus, do you think English would be as wide spread (even if as a second language) if the Allies hadn't won?  The Allies winning is what largely resulted in the US becoming an economic powerhouse and thus being able to insert itself into global economics/trade, which is probably the biggest reason English is so prevalent.
