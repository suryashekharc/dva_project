"When they announced the move to Atlanta, I wasn't surprised at all. Tallahassee was a very weird place to put a brand new network. Atlanta already has a very strong TV/broadcast world - WarnerMedia, The Weather Channel, and Atlanta's local TV & radio markets to name a few - and let's be honest the available talent or new grad hire/undergrad intern pool in Atlanta is far stronger than FAMU's journalism program or FSU's lack of a real journalism program. It just made sense to be there instead of here.

When that move was announced and there was no real information about what would happen to their Tallahassee location, and then no actual update about the move for months, I began to suspect that it wasn't going to happen after all. I figured they couldn't get the space they needed or some of their talent wanted to stay here. I never thought it was on the verge of bankruptcy.

"I used Two Maids and A Mop for a move-out cleaning last year and they did a good job. On time, made sure they knew what I wanted/needed to be done and confirmed everything with me while I was there to meet them, and called me when they were done.

I would never recommend Molly Maids.

"It's easy enough to ignore. Like someone else said it's 10 min to south tally and if you're smart you don't interact with neighbors much anyway.

Fact is with increasing real estate prices woodville and crawfordville are becoming more attractive if you're buying real estate. In 10 years the MAGA thing will balance out with people coming from Tally who are educated. For the cost of a 2 bd single family home in Tallahassee you can have a compound of privacy and acreage.

"This is a sincere question ... are you sure it's in Tallahassee? Apparently it was in Tallahassee in 2014 (according to his website), and while it would be weird for it to have left, that's 8 years. If he doesn't know for sure where it is, it might not even be here. I would feel bad if he thinks it's still in town and it's in like... Nebraska or something.

Aside from that ... the largest churches in town would probably be where I would start. Maybe the St. Thomas More Cathedral next to FSU?

"Hey kids, I'm late to this thread, but am going to share FL driving and insurance facts for future reference. 

Yes, OP can and should get the FL learners permit while they learn to drive. Learners permit does not require a road test, just a written one. OP, sleep late this morning pls. 

When OP is eligible to test for operator's license, they will very likely be driving a car they don't own - accompanied by the owner who has given permission. The owner's insurance automatically transfers covers permissive drivers and will be primary in the event of an at fault accident.

Florida companies do offer what is known as non owner liability coverage, but it's designed for REGULAR drivers of a non owned vehicle. It's mostly used for those who drive a work vehicle also for personal use, and don't own a vehicle.

"Like another comment said, when I took my test, they didn’t actually get in the car with me. The comments here provide some solid advice. The only thing I would add is to use the smallest car available to you when you go and take the test (as long as you feel comfortable driving a small car vs a larger vehicle). I say this because the road where you do the three-point-turn is VERY narrow. The instructor will have you do the three point turn on this road and, when I went, I was specifically told not to touch the grass and to stay on the paved road. You get points off for touching the grass. I took my parents’ sports utility, and because of how narrow the road is, it was physically impossible to complete the turn without touching the grass or without going over three turns. I didn’t touch the grass, but my three point turn was actually a five point turn, so I did get a couple points off for that. I still passed my test, and really I don’t remember getting many points off for being unable to complete the three point turn on that road.

"Wtf are all these meth comments? I've lived here almost 20 years I've never seen anyone on meth then again I'm a devoted practitioner of minding my own fucking business. I've seen crazier shit in Killearn and ox bottom from entitled Karen's/Kevin's flipping out and making a scene than anything I've witnessed in woodville. Just sayin. Most people down here are polite and keep to themselves. As for racism, I didnt know it was just in one designated part of town, pretty sure its everywhere that assholes exist. I have not seen anyone be openly racist like no public freakout type shit but there are lots of ""let's go brandon"" ""maga"" types down here. Thankfully they are easy to spot with all their flair so they are easily avoidable. The draw backs I've experienced living here: the main road I live on is dirt and it sucks to drive on especially after it rains and it's also very hard on your vehicle; the IGA is hit or miss, but publix and walmart deliver and arent terribly far away; fireworks, gunshots, dogs barking - a lot of the time/late at night; have experienced loose dogs that wonder around, dont approach or feed them, they will maul you or your pets, pls call animal control for wondering dogs, trust me; it takes 30, 40, or even an hour to get anywhere in town from woodville, so probably be good if you like/dont mind driving alot. I think the advice about flooding is good and you should definitely check that. Positives of being down here: people generally keep to themselves; wakulla springs is 10 minutes away and is absolutely beautiful; lots of wildlife, bears, deer, rabbits, etc.; access to the state forest, lots of good ditch fishing.",t2_84ghibab,hella850nervous,1,1647974482.0,0,t1_i1p0wox,i1p0wox,True,Competitive_Shock928,t3_tjuy3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tjuy3f/what_does_everyone_think_of_woodville/,What does everyone think of woodville?,/r/Tallahassee/comments/tjuy3f/what_does_everyone_think_of_woodville/i1p0wox/,2,r/Tallahassee,0,2

"As someone who moved to FL from the Midwest (Minnesota and Chicago for about 20 years, total) and recently bought a house here, I can tell you if you are looking to buy and especially you're looking at homes that are 30+ years old: the home insurance market in Florida is totally bonkers because of hurricanes. Which means that you cannot get insurance unless the home you want to buy has relatively new plumbing and new electrical wiring. It's maddening because in Chicago and Minneapolis, it's a very different insurance market with greater flexibility for older homes.

"I just got my license on the 7th of march. It was really easy because the testers do not go in the car with you due to covid. You need to be with a parent or adult over 21 who has their license in the car with you. 

First, they give you a walkie-talkie and do a general car inspection. Then, the tester tells you to drive down the lot and park between some cones. Afterward, you reverse out of the cones and drive out of the parking lot. You drive down the street for a bit and into a residential area. They give you all the cues for when to turn in advance.After a bit of driving, they tell you to stop and the instructor drives up to you and asks how to park a car uphill. You then do a three point turn on a narrow road and do a quick stop. After that, you drive back toward the tax collecter office and if you do well you get your license. It was super easy; just always make sure to use your turn signal and make full stops at stop signs. For me, it just felt like the practice driving sessions with my mom. Watch a couple driving test videos and it is just like that. Good luck!

EDIT: If you haven't yet, make sure you make your reservations today because it is almost a month wait to get an appointment on the tax collector site.

"There are a lot of things that I think you may want to give much more thought about than just ""I've always wanted to live in Florida"" because everyone thinks living here is like vacationing here and it's not, but I won't go into that.

What about the FSU graduate programs appeals to you? I went to grad school at 22, but I knew it was what I wanted to do and I had a good understanding of what I wanted to do. Are you moving here in hopes that you will then want to go to FSU for grad school, or do you already have an application in and are planning to move to start if/when you are accepted? If you aren't certain about grad school or why you want to go, I wouldn't move halfway across the country to be near a school just in case I attend.

Now, that said, if you are planning to move here and buy a place - I think your budget might be an issue, because what you're looking for may not really exist. There are townhouses and condos around town that are under $150k, but most of them that aren't near the universities are family-oriented and wouldn't meet your goal. Midtown, Levy Park, and *maybe* the area around All Saints would probably fit what you're looking fo,r but most of what's available in those areas isn't going to be under $150k and what is isn't something you'll want to buy. The only areas of town that I think skews younger, isn't family oriented and has anything available under $150k would be The Timbers, by San Luis Mission Park (not to be confused with Mission San Luis, although they're in the same area), or the area by I-10 along Stone Rd or Pullen Rd.

"So I checked these three listings.

The two on Lake Ave are not in a great part of town, but ignoring that both are extremely outdated and one of them looks like there are parts that are about to fall down. The one listing has a porch or something that's clearly an addition and it looks like it's on the verge of collapse. They've been on the market for almost 6 months with no movement and no price reductions (if you haven't sold in 6 months in this market, the hell are you doing?). You must likely would need to nearly gut either of them to really make either of them up to par.

The other listing is in an area that's basically all students - if you're a young professional then maybe you can tolerate that for a little bit, but you're going to have to deal with all of that crowd. It's really aimed at investors that want to buy it up and just rent it out for $1200-1500/month to a couple college kids that are going to party and probably wreck the place. The kitchen cabinets are going to need to be replaced soon as they're cheaply made garbage from probably close to when the house was built in the late 80s.

"2 years ago I bought a ""starter home"" built in 1959 for 175k plus and had to put 16k into it to replace the entire electrical system to get it insured. It just appraised for 220k and I got a HELOC for more renovations. Am I excited for myself? Yes. Am I depressed for every other person trying to buy a home? Absolutely and when I sell it will only be to an individual buying their primary residence.

I toured a house down the street from me yesterday. 1 extra bedroom 1 less bathroom listed at 240k. Hardwood floors were buckling due to moisture. It needed the crawlspace encapsulated, sad the floors planed and refinished. It had offers above asking price IMMEDIATELY.

I'm not sure where I am going with this but the market has boomed significantly with Covid and while we do have starter homes there aren't nearly as many available as there were pre Covid and any that get listed under 200k, in any kind of move in ready condition, are immediately under contract for more than asking price.",t2_6wxko,gnerfed,0,1647820951.0,0,t1_i1gwf21,i1gwf21,True,hugooo124hduh3,t3_tiv5nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tiv5nv/why_does_tallahassee_have_so_many_homes_for_sale/,Why does Tallahassee have so many homes for sale that are moderately or cheaply priced?,/r/Tallahassee/comments/tiv5nv/why_does_tallahassee_have_so_many_homes_for_sale/i1gwf21/,6,r/Tallahassee,0,6

"Agree.  I find it incredibly difficult to see the road with those purple lights.  The single wavelength put out by them washes out all the colors far worse than HPS (yellow) lamps did.  The roads just look flat black underneath them.

On the upside, I hated HPS lamps in the rain, as the yellow would scatter on the windshield and block the view by dazzle.  These UV lamps don't do that.  


I do believe this is an economic measure though.  Considering the mass manufacture of LED lamps, some companies have had bad batches.  Rather than eat the costs themselves, they sell them at a discount along with their regular lines.  Cities charge us full rate, but then get these discount luminaires to plug the hole.

"Food nerd here.  Heavy cream and heavy whipping cream are the same thing.  Definitions of cream are really strictly controlled by the FDA, which defines ""heavy cream"" and ""heavy whipping cream"" as both acceptable names for the name product, a cream with >36% milk fat.  ([Source](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=131.150), if you're interested)

Heavy cream can also contain emulsifiers, stabilizers, sweeteners, fruit juice, and flavors.  My go to is Whole Foods's store brand organic heavy cream at as it's the only one I've found that doesn't have stabilizers or emulsifiers added.  At 6g of fat per 15 mL serving it's approximately 40% fat, so it's super thick.

Another option would be asking at the Community Co-op (formerly the New Leaf).

I'd also look at your temps, batch size, and ingredients if you're having issues with soupy ice cream.

"Friendly reminder to those with keyless entry to place your key fob where you usually keep them at home and then go try to open your car door without the fob. My neighbor was victim of this type of burglary with a new car, and I (nerd) immediately thought he was victim to Relay Theft until he showed me the cam footage of a kid just trying the (locked) door and getting in. Kid was able to unlock it because the keyfob was kept on a hook right near the door and the car was parked steps away. I tested this with an older (2010s) keyless entry car and found the signal range to be broader compared to newer cars where its more proximity.

"> Them coming to town was secretly in the works well before the study was scuttled.

Again, MetroNet even starting to begin their network was not happening as long as the City didn't have open access policies for their utility poles *and* as long as the City had even the slightest plans to consider building a municipal network or partnering with someone for one. MetroNet's execs have said this openly. They might have had initial discussions with the City, but it wasn't happening until MetroNet could get the open access to utility poles (among other concessions) from the City. The study to look at municipal broadband was one thing that stopped MetroNet but it wasn't the only thing that was preventing them. The City *had* to cease the municipal broadband study and open city utility poles to all ISPs and provide a number of concessions to MetroNet for them to even want to come here. Fiber isn't cheap to build out and they can't charge what Comcast does for their internet, or nobody would switch.

>Comcast also lobbied against the study — do you think Comcast’s motives for doing that were in the public’s and consumers’ interests?

Are you serious? Of course Comcast wasn't doing anything for the public's interest. They didn't want municipal broadband because it would impact their local profits. They don't like that MetroNet is here and they don't want any competition. 

>the public deserves a deliberative analysis of where our broadband assets are and where they could could be improved

The funny part of this - the telecom companies know exactly where their assets are. The companies also basically know what each other's network looks like in town. And we already know which areas of town are the ones needing improvement, as we have census tract level data on availability of broadband publicly available. We don't need an expensive study to tell us which areas of town are getting extra screwed by Comcast because that's their only option.",t2_wz3bh,Paxoro,0,1647485597.0,0,t1_i0yzl5e,i0yzl5e,False,tgiokdi,t3_t9p6i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/t9p6i1/oev_deo_promote_internet_speed_test_survey_for/,"OEV, DEO Promote Internet Speed Test, Survey for Tallahassee-Leon County Broadband",/r/Tallahassee/comments/t9p6i1/oev_deo_promote_internet_speed_test_survey_for/i0yzl5e/,1,r/Tallahassee,0,1

"Mostly everyone in this thread is saying the same thing, get in the door first. Meet people, meet the crowd meet the staff, see if you feel comfortable in that environment. Every bar is different from bottom to top different owners, different rules. Read the room, see if they need help before being too aggressive about working for them, and make sure you ask at an appropriate time (not when the bar is slammed) that might make initiating things a little easier. 

But I’m gonna be honest and say we’re coming up on summer time and a lot of the college population migrates, this usually means bars cut down on staff. You’re probably better off being an Uber driver- they make bank, and you’re pretty much your own boss.

"When I was first moving here, I asked this sub to give me the skinny on burgers in town. I got lots of recommendations, some of which panned out at one level or another when I tried them and some of which didn't. 

One of the main ones mentioned was Bird's, the dive bar. But I didn't think the burger was any big deal there. Just kind of meh. Never went back. Though someone in this thread says they've had really variable burger experiences there, so maybe I should try again.

I thought Vertigo and Cabo's and Voodoo Dog, three other recommended places, were also fine but just kind of meh. Nothing special, didn't live up to it.

Another one mentioned a lot that panned out best for me was Midtown Caboose. They've got some great burgers. I have found service to be slow, and that was before the pandemic, so who knows these days. But it was good stuff. 

Grub Burger Bar just north of I-10 by Trader Joe's is pretty solid.

I had never seen a Culver's before coming here but had always heard good things about their burgers and in the fast food category it actually is really good. I've been there several times since.

Edit - forgot about Sage, but someone here reminded me. Pricey place, great burger.

"In my experience it's all about who you know, realistically. I'll get downvoted for this but if you're a woman you're expected to be reasonably attractive. Men not *as* much but you gotta have charm. It boils down to what kind of pull you have to get people in the door. The more pull and popular you are at bringing in people who will become regulars, the better.

Like others have said, try to get anything. Barback, kitchen, serving, door. 

Don't aim for the most popular spots in town. You'll want to aim for something like a restaurant, a small pub, or a hole in the wall joint to get experience under your belt and something on your resume.

"My favorite food!

I think Canopy Road has the best burger in town and is overlooked because they do a great breakfast. They cook it on that flattop with all that delicious breakfast food.. Woodchucks would be 2nd for me.

I have to say I might be the only person who's had a bad burger at birds but for the most part they are very good. Really like the place alot though.

Some standouts for me(not in order). Teds, Birds, Canopy road, Vertigo, Voodoo dog and Woodchucks Cafe.

Birds is a weird one for me because i've had a burger that was amazing there a couple times but a few times i've had average to subpar. I understand why it get's mentioned but feel like if you go there enough you'll get burned(literally). I love their grouper sandwich.

"I started as a busboy at 17. Then food-runner, server, then bartender. That last promotion happened 18 years ago.  

My advice would be to temper your expectations. Right now is basically the easiest time in history to get a job in hospitality, everywhere is hiring, everywhere needs shifts covered.  

That said, as a hiring manager personally I will not hire *outside* with no actual bartending experience on the resume. It’s just too big of a risk. I’ve got to at least know if you can handle the stresses of a service, which I would learn if you were already working as a server. Now, I’m not saying no one will hire you, it could happen, especially in this environment.  

The other consideration is your availability. “Something to do on the weekend” might not jive with what a bar or restaurant needs. Weekends are often the busiest shifts (not always but usually), and they may not want to put someone with zero experience on their busiest shifts starting out.  

So I’m not saying it’s impossible to get hired with zero experience on your resume, it does happen. I’ve heard about it happening. Honestly what you should do is just apply to any FOH job you can find, express interest in bartending and see if you can get a foot in the door somewhere.",t2_63kuu,FunkIPA,0,1647443336.0,0,t1_i0w5mzw,i0w5mzw,True,Self_Cloathing,t3_tfhdlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tfhdlq/bartenders_of_tallahassee_how_did_you_start_out/,"Bartenders of Tallahassee, how did you start out?",/r/Tallahassee/comments/tfhdlq/bartenders_of_tallahassee_how_did_you_start_out/i0w5mzw/,8,r/Tallahassee,0,8

"Another thing is some places have a bit of a hierarchy of people waiting in line for the position and getting the spot is unlikely.

A fool proof way is to work part time at multiple places to get full time hours and increase your chances of getting behind the bar. I knew a girl who did this and it took less than a few months. 

Some places the bar pays really well, have earlier hours and you may not want to leave. 

Its important to know that you wont just be making drinks for people who come to the bar and have to make drinks for servers and serve food. It makes the job more difficult vs just making drinks.

"Mental health is such a misunderstood topic.  It boils down to - this guy had problems that a lot of people noticed, but nothing that raised to the level of being incarcerated.  There is a benefit to forcing treatment.  Crim studies have shown positive effects of psychological 'treatment' even when the offender/subject did not want the so-called treatment.  

A friend of mine had a son the same age as mine. When our sons started to come of age, mine was forced into residential treatment. His son started hearing voices and acting out. My friend eventually had to sleep with his door locked for fear of what his son could do while he was asleep. Mom stepped back into the picture and had her son move out of state to be with her.  She thought she could help. Long story short, my friend's son had a psychotic break and he stabbed her to death. The voices in his head told him he had to, or she would kill him.  He was sentenced to life in a mental hospital.

Before things got that far, my friend sought help everywhere.  He's an educated guy with more resources than most. He had the ear of local and state politicians. He is a well-known figure in Tallahassee.  He knew people and he asked for help. Even though he knew his son was a danger to himself and others when he was off his meds there were NO RESOURCES to help for the long term.  His son could not hold a job because of his mental health and the medications he needed were expensive.  This is a kid that walked around with a broken brain and there was no help to be had for him.  If he had a broken leg, this would have been cruel and unusual punishment.

My humble proposal is juvenile courts.  If we can waive bad children to adult courts for heinous crimes, why not the reverse for those with mental illnesses interfering with their ability to keep life, liberty, and property?  Juvenile courts are civil and not criminal, and they take a treatment focus that does not exist in the criminal (adult) courts.  The reason for the juvenile courts is because young people are not as 'culpable' as adults in understanding the consequences of their behavior. Isn't this true of those with mental health issues as well?",t2_dh8u2b7b,TheMindfulNuttyProf,0,1647386299.0,0,t1_i0td3oi,i0td3oi,False,malapropistic_spoonr,t3_tev7st,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tev7st/us_secret_service_releases_case_study_of_hot_yoga/,U.S. Secret Service releases case study of Hot Yoga Tallahassee shooting,/r/Tallahassee/comments/tev7st/us_secret_service_releases_case_study_of_hot_yoga/i0td3oi/,13,r/Tallahassee,0,13

">do something about it instead of doing nothing

yeah, thats what i got from the quote i posted but what does 'do something' mean?

force them into tolerance counseling that will likely be resisted and counterproductive?Minority report their asses and eliminate the potential of them doing something bad?

Whatever the 'do something' is has to come before theres even an established pattern of behavior cause a lot of these folks likely cant be fixed... but also cant be isolateded till they actually did something really bad...

> As concluded in previous research, there continues to be no single profile of an attacker. Rather, attackers tend to demonstrate observable concerning behavior across a variety of community systems, which often elicits concern in bystanders before violence occurs. This case study describes how the attacker’s misogynistic views and associated behaviors resulted in him being fired from multiple jobs, banned from public locations, and being arrested.

>The case study also sets forth that a multidisciplinary threat assessment program established at the community level may reduce the risk of future tragedies if the appropriate systems are in place to identity warning signs, assess an individual’s risk of violence, and apply the appropriate community resources. Such proactive safety programs have been established by workplaces, universities, local police departments, and other organizations with a role in public safety.

No, it does not. A landlord can still deny an ESA in a number of cases regardless of ""paperwork"" being in order. 

If the ESA poses a threat to residents or property, the landlord can deny them. *That's the law*. It doesn't matter if your ""paperwork"" is in order - if an ESA is a perceived threat then you can be denied.

I have a large cat tree, a smaller perch, a wire carrier, a large covered litterbox and some food and treats with a food storage container. I'm willing to sell those to whoever gets her for $100

The leopard gecko is a rescue who's been with me for 2 years, it's estimated that he's about 3 and a half years old. His name is Edward.

I have a 40 gallon long tank with front opening doors, a under-tank heating mat with thermostat (to prevent over heating), a heat lamp and uv bulbs with a timer (so you never have to manually turn anything on/ off) and plenty of decor. he mainly eats meal worms but will also eat crickets. He loves wax worms but they should only be fed as a treat. I also have calcium powder and multivitamin powder for him.  I'd prefer that he go to someone with reptile experience and if you have leopard gecko experience that's even better. 

I'll let his whole setup go for $100 (I won't let him go without the set up).

I just got a new job that keeps me busy and I have a baby on the way and there's just a lot going on in my life and I don't have the time or resources to properly care for them any more.
