"I post on here and on an App called NextDoor, in the group Georgetown Hiking Club. 

We hike on the first and third weekend of each month. The  first is a short hike, usually 2 miles or less, and the second hike is the long hike, usually around 6 or less than 8 miles. 

We are a relaxed hiking group, we stick together and stop for water breaks and at nice views for pictures. We talk at the end of each hike of somewhere to go after and get some food and something to drink. It's been a pretty good mix of age and gender, usually between 8 and 15 people show up.

"Who's up for a good 6 mile hike this Saturday?

Our next hike will be this Saturday, 3/19, from Overlook Park to Jim Hogg Park using the Good water Loop Trail. 

Well meet at 10:45 am and the hike starts at 11am. We'll meet at Parking 1, and start the hike from there. Well be going about 2.5 miles an hour, and figure we'll take about 2 hours or so. 

598 Lake Overlook Rd, Georgetown, TX 78633

We'll stop at the half way point, which is a really nice overlook cliff, so bring some snacks.

It's a popular place where parking can be an issue, so I've posted 3 places to park. I'll try and get there a little and carpool or drop hikers off if there's no parking off and then I'll walk back. 

There will be a restroom at the start point, but nowhere else on the trail.

There are sites where you can check provider coverage for an address, and then go to that provider to confirm exactly what services are available.

"I have suddenlink. It’s generally pretty stable. I’m a network engineer by profession. I see a lot of complaints about various ISP’s for problems that aren’t necessarily the problem of the ISP’s. Given that, here’s my advice:

If you experience slow or laggy service, call and ask for a field technician to come to your place. They’ll have the tools and the knowledge to diagnose the problem and it’s less stressful than dealing with phone support. 

Most of the common issues are related to poor or damaged cabling or connectors, so having a tech on site is the way to go. They’ll be able to diagnose, isolate, and resolve the problem quickly. Depending on the problem, they may charge you a service fee, but it’s usually less than $150, which is worth it to not have to deal with the hassle of phone support. They should also tell you how much the service charge is before they do any work all.",t2_p22az,packetgeeknet,0,1646674585.0,0,t1_hzq79fe,hzq79fe,True,dqwin26,t3_t8twu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetowntx/comments/t8twu1/internet_provider_in_georgetown/,Internet provider in Georgetown,/r/georgetowntx/comments/t8twu1/internet_provider_in_georgetown/hzq79fe/,3,r/georgetowntx,0,3
"The service itself I've had no issues with, in my experience it's fast and reliable. I can't say if that's true for everyone, but a good number of the issues over seen people complain about seem to be related to customer service. The only interaction I've had there was when mine was initially connected, that took two goes, the first time the tech missed the window by an hour or two and I'd gone out, the second time the tech was on-time and professional, took maybe 10 minutes to install the modem.

Pro tip, if you want, you can buy the modem yourself to avoid paying to rent theirs, I bought an ARRIS SB8200 which is one of the models they use and gave it to the tech when he arrived and he installed it no problem. It cost about $200 to buy, but that pays off over like 2 years compared to their rental fee.

Edit: that modem doesn't have WiFi built-in, but I already had a separate WiFi router I was planning to use, so that was fine for me.

The first mile or so of that hike is rocky similar to the Crockett Gardens hike.  After that you will be on an old double track dirt road that is easy hiking.  There are no restrooms at all on the trail.  

The campground has picnic tables and lantern poles but that is all.  If you go onto Twin Springs Preserve make sure it is open before you go out.  There are endangered species in the area so they restrict the number of hikers allowed there at certain times of the year.

We skipped the first weekend of February due to the mine freeze. This week is the third and I'd like to get back on schedule. 

Well be exploring the other side of the lake and we'll visit a primitive camp ground near the lake. The weather looks like it will be really nice, so I'd like to hike about a mile past the camp grounds, then turn back, for about 4 and a half miles round trip depending on the terrain (if it's rocky like Crockett Gardens we'll turn back a little sooner). It will be a there-and-back hike, so bring some water and a small salty snack.

"Yeah, prices are expected to keep rising, I don’t know if any analyst that thinks they will stop anytime soon. Basically put, there is a current need of about 4 million houses in the US. Before COVID hit we were in short supply and there was a need of 1 million houses. Supply and demand, it’s getting worse as so many people are retiring and buying a second home or working from home and buying a second home etc. So many people want to buy a home but cannot as prices are rising and causing a house Ong shortage. You can get a mansion in Killeen for $400k though….

The Austin area has become the new big place to move to, everyone I have talked to that is moving here or is here now is from Chicago, New Jersey, California, people are from everywhere and are converging here. I just bought a second house on the low end of $400k in this area but that same house was $250k just like 2 years ago and was less than a $100k just a few more years back, pretty insane but, well, supply and demand, location, location, location.",t2_bvzdwdb4,Wreddit_Wrangler,0,1643039371.0,0,t1_hu14b9h,hu14b9h,False,opalrun,t3_sbfe8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetowntx/comments/sbfe8f/moving_from_ca_to_tx/,Moving from CA to TX,/r/georgetowntx/comments/sbfe8f/moving_from_ca_to_tx/hu14b9h/,5,r/georgetowntx,0,5

I'd start by checking out some online tutorials to figure out the rules.  Try youtube I'm sure there are plenty.  Then just go rent a court for an hour and practice serves and hitting the ball around.  You can usually rent rackets but you will probably have to buy a can of balls or two.  Get used to hitting it and start talking to other people you see renting courts and at some point someone will offer to play you / help you learn.  It isn't too difficult but be prepared to get hit with the ball.  It stings.

"Well, that’s why I don’t try and tell people what to buy, just help those interested figure out for themselves what they might need. For some that may mean a solar panel to keep a freezer of bacon charged and enough cooking material and gas to cook it all.

"Sure. In general, I’m referring to being prepaid for the most likely disasters anyone may have to deal with.

I start by going over a risk matrix, explaining how to plot an incident by probability and severity. We measure probability by the things that have happened in a general area in the past 20 years or so, and then by severity according to the survival fundamentals of air, shelter, water, and food, and how long we can survive without each.

I would then go over how to make a plan for yourself with your own variables like family size and ages, and health concerns. Prioritizing the survival plan for yourself (put your own oxygen mask on the first kind of thing), then your family, then your car, then your home. I make suggestions for certain kinds of gear, but more the type and quality of gear.

Using all of these in their correct order, you can make a plan for the situations on your list, learn how to practice and test your plan, and then update it to be prepaid for almost any disaster. Take only one weekend a month and spend money on gear you can afford, like a flu kit.

It may sound complicated all at once, but I break it down a step at a time and use some graphics to help explain things so you can have confidence in your survival plan.

I don’t seek anything, and this class is free to anyone interested.

You can find more information, and what I will use to teach the class, on my website [survival411.org](https://survival411.org).

"I've been in Georgetown for 20 years, and aside from a lack of diversity and people being very conservative, it is a nice place to live.  (Diversity has increased in the last 7 or so years as well.)  We are no longer an extension of Sun City.  The people are nice.  The downtown is small and beautiful. We need a better traffic engineer, as the lights are poorly timed. GT has some really nice parks and trails.  We have an astounding amount of Donut and fried chicken places for our size.   If you end up working in Austin, you'll like the quiet of Georgetown and absolutely hate the horrific drive to work, mainly due to Round Rock.  We are growing at a frantic pace.

"Ordering breakfast tacos at the walk up window at El Charrito is a must do for any new Georgetown resident. It is a very Georgetown thing to do. You will rub elbows with everyone from elected officials to regular Jo's. Are the tacos ""the best"" no, but they are very good, classic, breakfast tacos.


Mikey Vs tacos is new but very very good. These are more of your fancy (think torchys) tacos and priced accordingly. I think this is more of a late lunch type place, but not a bad choice. Bonus points for being on the most beautiful town square in Texas. 


San Pedro Limon is also good and more of your ""authentic"" Mexican breakfast taco. 

BUT...

The BEST real deal breakfast tacos made with fresh corn tortillas, served with onion and cilantro and red and green salsa, with cold Mexican coke or fresh horchata is La Plaza Meat Market on South Austin Ave. 

They look really busy with workers getting food for the day in the morning, but they move people through really fast.

"No. The new one will replace the very old Georgetown #1 store.  And why would they want to get rid of a nicely sized store (with the best bakery department out of the local HEBs)?

However, this is bad for those of us who live on the East side of 35, because TXDOT has started work on redoing the [Williams Drive](http://www.my35.org/capital-project-williams-drive.htm) exchange. Once that’s done, they will be redoing the [University Ave](http://www.my35.org/capital-project-sh29.htm) exchange. At that time, I’ll be shopping at Aldi, or the Round Rock H-E-B.

By the way, H-E-B [is also considering a store at Longhorn Junction](https://communityimpact.com/austin/news/2012/11/07/developers-eyeing-property-within-longhorn-junction/). Perhaps that will get built before the work on the 35/29 exchange happens, which would be really nice!

"Hello everyone and happy holiday season. I have scheduled the small classroom at the library for our second meeting. 

Go upstairs and turn right, it’s the first classroom on the right, after the bathrooms. 

This class is free and information discussed in class will be made available free online. There is also nothing for sale at the class. 

What will we cover? 

I will start with the basics of Risk Management and Mitigation, as well as how to use a Risk Matrix. Knowing the basics concepts and vocabulary are an important first step and will be necessary for any conversation about being prepared and safety. 

Then we will learn the fundamentals of Survival and how they are used in context of determining Risk and how it can be used as part of a risk matrix. This will help us prioritize basic needs quickly and effectively when seconds may matter. 

Thirdly we will go over how you can use the above skills to you own unique situation and needs. How to prepare in an organized way for what is the most likely to happen and making practical choices about what to buy or learn. 

We will go over why and how you can prepare for yourself first, then your family, then your community, and why community survival is so important. 

Then we will have some question and answer time and have a conversation about what you want to know more about and go over anything specific you need.

"That’s a great question. There are a lot of variables when making recommendations to someone about survival and being prepared. 

I’ve been thinking of how to present the information needed for families and communities to make educated decisions. So they can ask more specific questions about their unique circumstances.

For the most part, right now it’s important to make your home ready for another freeze, even if we don’t lose power again. The cdc and fema and our local authorities here in Georgetown all recommend the same thing, to be able to be self sufficient for three days while emergency services get the help they need to help. 

That means water, 1 gallon per person per day for each person in the house for three days. 

A good first aid kit. 

Mylar hear reflective blankets and painters tape to put on your windows to keep the heat in your house. 

Survival food that you eat on a somewhat regular basis. Store what you eat and eat what you store. Don’t horde, but have three days of food. If you don’t eat your survival food with some regularity, your body may have a hard time adjusting to it if you switch to it all of a sudden. 

Have some tea light candles to use on your home for when the lights go out. 

Practice. One weekend try only using you’re survival equipment and supplies. What do you whisk your had? Think through what you may need if you had to stay in your home for three or four days. 

Consider talking with your neighbors about community survival. Get on apps like next door and see who your neighbors are. 

Read books like The Unthinkable by Amanda Ripley to understand the mindset of survivors. 

And ask questions when you get stuck. Don’t be afraid to try something and to ask questions when you get lost or confused or don’t know where to look for the answer. 

Take care of yourself first, then help others.

"Survival doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The best way to survive an emergency or disaster is with the people in your community. Being able to take care of yourself is the first step, the second is helping others when you’re able. 

We will talk about things like how much food and water to store in your home and how. What to do in the next freeze and power outage. 

We meet at the Georgetown Public Library and talk about the basics of survival, how to reduce the danger of an emergency by being prepared, and what we can expect from our city and county in an emergency.

The only weekend free this month was on the Thanksgiving weekend. We are booked in the classroom on the second floor from 1pm -3pm. 

There is no charge to attend this meeting. You can feel free to stop by for however long you are able.

"This weekend our next hike will be a short hike and hopefully some cooler weather. We’ll meet at Chautauqua Park at 10:45 am and start the hike at 11am. 

The plan is to hike the trail from the park, and then hike back. 


Pickett Trail
Distance: 0.5 miles
Pickett Trail is a rustic, natural trail that follows the cliffs along the scenic South San Gabriel River connecting Blue Hole Park and Chautauqua Park.

The trail connects to the existing San Gabriel River Trails which is fully accessible and 8.2 miles. Pickett Trail is a natural progression down the South San Gabriel River. This trail provides for a more challenging hike than our other trail systems and is not ADA accessible. This newly restored trail has been made usable and safe for the citizens without damaging the natural beauty of the river corridor.

"Been commuting up to Temple from West Georgetown near Sun City since 2006.   Before Before Ronald Reagan opened, the 35 was the only option.    Other than the time when the stretch through Salado was under construction, the commute has consistently been between 44 and 50 minutes.   RR is my preferred backroad to connect w the 35 in Jarrell. Other than the occasional 18 wheeler trying really hard to spit rocks at my windshield, I personally find the drive to be somewhat relaxing as it’s mostly open road with some good “country” landscape.    A good opportunity to charge up for the day, make a few calls if needed.   And wind down at the end of the day as well before hitting the door.

I have a gehan home and I love it!  I’m in Blackhawk in Pflugerville though.  I built at end of 2017 and closed Jan of 2018.  For me it really came down to the value they offered over others.  Like in my neighborhood they did irrigation for front and backyard. And other builders in area only did front yard. I also really wanted the 8ft entry door. And not many builders were doing that as standard at the time either. They are a production builder but to me a higher quality than a Pulte or other popular names.  Drees has some amazing looking homes. Just remember with any builder the model home has tons of upgrades! So take note of those things like lighting etc.  ultimately go with location and a floor plan you love.  And when building become friends with the superintendent and your sales person.  I talked to mine every week if not more.  I may have been annoying. But because I was always nice they were extra involved in making sure my building process went smooth. And explained everything to me.  And if I wasn’t happy about something they fixed it.  I know not everyone in my neighborhood had that experience.

"I’m Texas the number of CV patients in the ICUs averages just 5.5% Even if they meant ICUs they are not telling the whole story. ICU “beds” are expensive because the staffing is expensive. This hospitals limit the number of beds to reduce costs. In the event they need more, they convert regular rooms to ICU rooms. Ever notice everything is on wheels?

What they aren’t telling you is that he issue is a lack of qualified staff. They laid off tons of workers because hospitals make almost all their profit on elective surgery. CV shut that down. Now they are having trouble bringing them back fast enough. 

At this point 100% of CV related stories can’t be believed. The political agenda has overtaken the entire thing.

"Central Texas has a little different weather than the stereotypical Texas weather due to our hills and streams, causing it to be not as hot as the is normal in Texas during the hot months, and not as cold in the cold months, and we do have more humidity than other cities not by the gulf. 

Last September had more days over 100°F as the high then under it. So, in Texas it’s a nice place to live, which is why a place like SunCity is such a popular retirement community. 

In short, the winters can be mild to very cold, but are generally short, fall and spring last for about a month, and the rest is summer, sometimes lasting till October. 

Lately though the weather has been changing, seemingly, and getting cooler summers and colder winters, which isn’t something we’re really built for yet, i.e. our power grid failing during a week long ice storm this year. 

We also have tornadoes and hail with severe thunderstorms pretty often, and we can get tagged by a passing tropical storm every decade or so, but we are built pretty good for flooding for the most part.

"The study says that people who were previously infected received further protection from the vaccine in the section I quoted.

There is no reason to not get vaccinated. It helps people who were previously infected it not. The side effects are very low.

On an individual basis, I think it is probably fine to skip vaccination for those previously infected. The process of proving previous infection status is probably harder than just getting the vaccine. Blood would have to be drawn and analyzed to check for antibodies.

"It is a major study:

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-greater-immunity-vaccine-no-infection-parties

No it’s not peer reviewed yet because it just came out. Peer review takes considerable time. The vaccine has been being administered for under a year. I challenge you to find a single statement on the following page that is supported by a peer reviewed article:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/prepare-for-vaccination.html

My point is as I’ve stated, there is no legitimate reason to mandate vaccination among the previously infected because they are already better protected from reinfection than vaccinated individuals. This issue is extremely relevant to virtually every community in this country as more and more institutions try to force people to receive injections against their will.

I am not saying the vaccine is bad and if previously infected people want to get it or have already gotten it, I am completely supportive of their choice.

"You were spamming this same stuff last week on posts on this sub. Did you even read through the conclusion section?

""This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.""

Even if this effect is borne out in other studies, the vaccine still helps. The vaccine may not prevent all delta-variant infections, but it lowers their severity compared to the baseline of people who haven't encountered SARS-COV2. It is safer to gain some immunity through vaccination than natural infection.

"Sure, I wouldn’t argue with anything you said as a general rule. But some places and times call for a different approach. I have, in the past, attempted to inject facts and data in forums like this in a more conciliatory, objective manner. The result: my contributions are immediately smothered, marginalized and I am bombarded with accusations of being a terrible person. It has become apparent to me that the primary participants in these forums have no interest in incorporating data points that run contrary to their existing beliefs and only care about directing as much fear and outrage toward the designated villain(s) of the hour as possible.

So I no longer put any effort in appealing to their reason or in trying to appease or persuade them. I care about reaching the lurker: the casual observer that has come to view the unabridged thoughts of anonymous peers, probably seeking guidance in forming his or her own opinion whether cognizant of that motivation or not. In a town like this, every heart and mind matters and I want to ensure they know public opinion is not a monolith; that views like mine are held by their neighbors, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances, and probably more of them than they realize. 

Then there is the other group I wish to reach: those who share my views but who fear retribution from their friends, colleagues, acquaintances, and sometimes even their own family for expressing them, or simply don’t think it worth the trouble to do so. While hesitant to sound immodest, it is my sincere hope that my efforts are what enable them to overcome their trepidations and join the discourse as is their right and even their obligation as a citizen of a republic.

I anticipate you will counter by contending that these are exactly the type of people put off by my approach. Again, that’s probably true as a general rule but not here where those in the majority are equally or more so abrasive, combative, scrutinizing, and unforgiving toward adverse opinions. On many subs, they will go as far as simply removing content they deem counter-narrative. Fortunately that isnt the case here…yet.

When your views are not just in the minority but very much taboo among those that direct the dialogue, it is critical to be bold, conflicting, irrepressible, to compete, and to demand recognition without apology or equivocation just as those who hold the majority view do. Otherwise, you are easily ignored, marginalized, and made invisible to the only audience that matters: the lurker.",t2_14kefo,truthysmuthy,0,1629944506.0,0,t1_hadicly,hadicly,False,[deleted],t3_pb3u8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetowntx/comments/pb3u8o/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/georgetowntx/comments/pb3u8o/deleted_by_user/hadicly/,1,r/georgetowntx,0,1

"Is it… ok? I mean, if I had to choose an adjective to describe that anecdote, “ok” would probably not be the one. But I’ll generously interpret your question as: “doesn’t this local news story about a child who was ultimately admitted to a hospital and made a full recovery mean that no one can debate whether we need mask mandates in schools?” And I’ll respond: No. I’m pretty sure my 3 year old could identify 5 analytical errors in that argument if you promised him an Oreo after. I’ll link a great graphic of the most common logical fallacies that we have hung up in their playroom…Honestly, it was a mistake to show them. They’ve learned to use them against me.

But in any event, your argument first requires establishing that the hospital capacity problem is a result of not having mask mandates and/or that implementing mask mandates would fix the problem. Given these capacity shortages started weeks ago before any schools were open, tough gap to bridge.

But aside from that, if you read past the first two paragraphs of the KXAN panic porn hospital articles, they very often state that the overcapacity is a result of *understaffing*, not COVID or at least not exclusively COVID. 

Finally, although there’s more points I could make, I think this one is important. Hospitals are supposedly full because a bunch of unvaccinated rubes keep getting COVID at their Bible thumping, indoor gatherings where they scream into each other’s faces about dinosaurs being fake and then get severely ill. If that’s actually the case (and it’s far from a settled matter… will probably be a year before we have the actual data) then here’s an idea: Just give everyone else priority over those people.

Why didn't they rename that headline to ""More Than 0.55% of Texans Have Been Hospitalized for COVID So Far In 2021""? Not scary sounding enough?
https://www.kxan.com/news/coronavirus/hospitalizations/more-than-160000-texans-have-been-hospitalized-because-of-covid-19-so-far-in-2021/

Let's try another one, from Houston Chronicle -- ""40 Texas children newly hospitalized with COVID per day, the highest rate in a year"". About 7,393,950 children under age 18 in Texas. How about renaming that headline to ""0.0005% of Texas children newly hospitalized with COVID per day, the highest rate in a year""? So we can get some perspective?
https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/texas-children-hospitalizations-covid-highest-rate-16382741.php

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 6.1% of all children in the U.S. have gotten COVID since the beginning of the pandemic. Of these cases, 402 have died (with data from 45 states and 2 territories). There are 74.2 million children under age 18 in the U.S.... That comes out to 0.00054% of all children in the U.S. dying of COVID.

Now look at these headlines from Google. ""Kids sick with Covid are filling up children's hospitals in areas seeing spikes."" ""As Texas Schools Reopen, Kids With COVID-19 Are Filling Hospitals In Record Numbers."" ""Texas children and children’s hospitals are under siege from two viruses: RSV and COVID-19."" (clever, that last one, lumping covid with RSV.) We get bombarded with headlines like these every day, and people freaking out about this on all kinds of public forums, and you think OP is the one with the harsh language?

Parents - people - need to wake up and get a grip. For the sake of your children and yourself, move on. There's more to life than this virus. We knew it was going to become endemic from the very beginning. We can live with it, and we are doing so. The kids are doing so.

"Thanks for the reply. A few things. You are absolutely correct, the incidents of a child having poor outcomes from COVID-19 is extremely know. I don't know anyone who would disagree with that. However, with the current rate of infections among children there will physically not be enough children's ICU beds to handle the statically unlucky kids who do have a bad reaction. See the post by Your Local Epidemiologist for the current numbers (1).  Dallas is already at zero bed available. So, masking and social distancing can bring that curve down to help keep resources available for the kids who do get COVID and need medical intervention. Unfortunately, there are thousands of them.

For me, this is not just about protecting the kids. Kids do take the virus home and give it to others in the house. A meta study from JAMA showed ""more than one in three, roughly 38%, of COVID-19 patients passed the virus to their spouses or significant others they live with"" (2). This was pre-Delta variant. So, kids do fine, maybe not even show symptoms while mom, dad, or extended family get COVID and they are much more likely to have bad outcomes if non-vaccinated. At my school in GISD there is a much higher population of Hispanic and lower income students. Both of these groups have worse outcomes when it comes to COVID and have a lower vaccination rate than non-hispanic whites.  

Most of what i've read read and observed shows kids do wear masks properly. At least the K-5th ones. I'm sure high schoolers so whatever they want. They can at least get vaccinated. The elementary school kids can't.

I'm not denying there are really bad things out there impacting kids besides COVID, but as a society, right now the biggest impact kids can have is to help slow the spread. And it might keep a few kids from winding up in the ICU, just by wearing a mask and socially distancing. Pretty damn low bar of effort.

"People can read the articles for themselves if they want but I stand by my characterization. The UK Study is ""mixed"" in that it freely acknowledges the myriad assumptions on which its findings rest and, even assuming its assumptions correct, that the results are still to a large degree uncertain.

&#x200B;

As for the August 2020 study, I would direct people to Section 7 if you want to see the author's feelings on the matter in as plain English as possible. I'll quote this particular passage as I think it particularly illuminating:

&#x200B;

""Of particular relevance for schools may be the experiences with face masks in hospitals, including psychiatric hospitals, such as the clinic which I am heading. I implemented the general use of face masks for all staff and patients on March 16th 2020, and it soon became clear that they interfere with practicing psychiatry: The decreased emotional observability made the job harder to do. A psychotherapist wrote me an email, noting that socially complicated and challenging inpatients in psychotherapy are very difficult to treat, “as dissociative states and tensions are much harder to detect early enough so that appropriate interventions can be performed. In addition, exposition training (such as in patients after trauma, patients with panic disorder, and patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD) which implies the conscious provocation of anxiety, are hard to do with a face mask obstructing the perception of the patient's emotions. \[…\] Even in diagnostic interviews, face masks interfere with decisions regarding diagnosis and therapy” (Bosch, personal communication \[11\]).""

&#x200B;

Would the author's opinions be different in light of Delta? Perhaps. But ""perhaps"" is not good enough and that is exactly the point. We are ham-fistedly imposing onerous and detrimental masking requirements on our children in a panicked delirium without any real degree of circumspection about whether it is actually a good idea on balance.",t2_14kefo,truthysmuthy,0,1629296268.0,0,t1_h9etph8,h9etph8,False,ChristaKaraAnne,t3_p4dj5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetowntx/comments/p4dj5w/if_only_georgetown_isd_or_fred_brent_had_courage/,If only Georgetown ISD or Fred Brent had courage or cared about our children.

"1) COVID is not a significant threat to the health of your kids. To date, 354 kids under the age of 17 have died ""from"" COVID.[1] Of those kids, most are likely to have other major complications, including things like leukemia. In a study by the UK, they estimated that 25 out of 12 million kids without any major complications died from COVID.[2] They didn't control for obesity, however. COVID is less dangerous to your kids than:

a) RSV, which hospitalizes 60,000 people per year, and kills between 100 - 500 children under 5 every year.[3]

b) Regular influenza during a regular year - The CDC estimates that the 2019 - 2020 flu deaths in children were ~434. That's in one year, compared to 18 months[4]

c) Cancer - Cancer sucks. It kills twice as many kids per year than COVID. I know its not communicable (with some possible exceptions), but it's still a bigger killer of your kids than COVID.[5]

d) Suicide - kills about 2,000 kids per year. Contemplate that when you are thinking about these lockdowns and mental health.[6]

2) You know how many kids have died from the flu during the COVID time? One. [7] Something about COVID wiped out the flu, or at least that is what the data says. So, prior years, flu, but no COVID. COVID year, COVID but no flu. The difference in the dangers to your kids from flu compared to COVID are not statistically meaningful. This means that kids face no more danger from communicable diseases this year than they have in every other year since we wiped out polio.

3) Your kids wearing masks will do nothing to help anyone. They aren't going to use them properly. They aren't going to make themselves safer from a non-dangerous virus. They aren't going to prevent the spread of the disease, because they touch their mouths constantly.[8] Even if masks do help with the spread of COVID, it's not worth mandating kids wear masks during a normal flu year. The call for masks on kids is propaganda related to political power.

4) Anyone that makes a plea to protect our kids from COVID is either uninformed or lying to you. Educate them on the low mortality rate, based on CDC data, and then assume they have bad intentions if that doesn't shock them.

5) The damage that we are doing to our kids by robbing them of their education is FAR AND AWAY more damaging than the minute chance that some kids will get sick. Kids, by and large, aren't learning *****[8] If you have highschool age kids right now, keep them learning. Because, once they get to college, they are going to be the ones blowing the curve in every class they take.

6) While we don't have good data to support this, kids might be spreading COVID to parents / teachers. That's a valid point. That is worth discussion. There are pros / cons to each side, like the presence of a vaccine, for example. But that argument is separate and distinct from arguments that something is to ""protect the children"". No, it's not. It's destroying our kids lives for the sake of keeping adults safe. We have already pretty much destroyed their adulthoods with the crushing debts we are creating to make elites rich, why not at least let them have a few more years of innocense before they realize how ****ed they are.

"THERE IS NO PEER REVIEWED LITERATURE SUPPORTING MASK MANDATES IN SCHOOLS. Of the studies that have been done, they range from mixed conclusions to leaning heavily against mask mandates in schools. examples below;

"Did you know that keeping your child home from school for a couple of days (less than the 10 school days in a six month period as requirement per TX law to be considered truant) is not even “truancy,” nor is it in any way illegal? 

You must not be aware that [in 2015 the Texas Legislature removed the criminal offense of failure to attend school from the Texas Education Code](https://www.tasb.org/services/legal-services/tasb-school-law-esource/students/documents/compulsory_attendance_and_truancy.aspx)?  Still, if a child is absent for the more than 10 school days or parts of days, a parents ***may*** be changed with “contributing to a student’s failure to attend school” (a misdemeanor offense punishable by a fine) and the complaint has to be brought by the school district and the burden of proof is on the school district. 

Have you read the laws regarding child abuse and neglect?

Both child abuse and neglect are defined by the [Texas Family Code Title 5, Subtitle E, Chapter 261.001 ](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FA/htm/FA.261.htm).  (***See***: the below quoted definitions). 

• Child abuse is defined as the following:

> “(A)  mental or emotional injury to a child that 
> results in an observable and material impairment in 
> the child's growth, development, or psychological 
> functioning;
> (B)  causing or permitting the child to be in a 
> situation in which the child sustains a mental or 
> emotional injury that results in an observable and 
> material impairment in the child's growth, 
> development, or psychological functioning;
> (C)  physical injury that results in substantial harm 
> to the child, or the genuine threat of substantial 
> harm from physical injury to the child, including an 
> injury that is at variance with the history or 
> explanation given and excluding an accident or 
> reasonable discipline by a parent, guardian, or 
> managing or possessory conservator that does not 
> expose the child to a substantial risk of harm;
(D)  ***failure to make a reasonable effort*** to 
> prevent an action by another person that results in 
> physical injury that results in substantial harm to the 
> child;”

- e.g., Knowingly allowing your child to attend a school that is putting all children in substantial danger of physical, psychological, and emotional harm/ injury, including potential death, and not making a reasonable effort to prevent actions by “another person[s],” that cannot be explained as accidental because you were forewarned of the substantial risk of harm to your child by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html), the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/american-academy-of-pediatrics-updates-recommendations-for-opening-schools-in-fall-2021), the [Texas Medical Association](https://www.texmed.org/TexasMedicineDetail.aspx?id=55662), the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners ([AANP](https://storage.aanp.org/www/documents/education/COVID19-Webinar-Patient-Tool_updated.pdf)), the [Texas Nurse Association](https://www.texasnurses.org/news/news.asp?id=554655), the American Medical Association ([AMA](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-cdc-s-updated-mask-guidance-combat-covid-19-spread)), the American Nurses Association ([ANA](https://www.nursingworld.org/news/news-releases/2021/ana-supports-cdcs-updated-guidance-on-masks-to-mitigate-impact-of-delta-variant2/)), numerous [public health officials](https://www.covidcollaborative.us/infection-prevention-and-control-in-schools#ipc-press-release),[epidemiologists](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/636-epidemiologists-disagree-cdc-one-155310906.html), and infectious disease specialists ([IDSA](https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2021/idsa-supports-new-cdc-guidance-on-mask-wearing-as-delta-variant-spreads/)). 

• Additionally, neglect is defined as:

> “(i)  the leaving of a child in a situation where the 
> child would be exposed to a substantial risk of 
> physical or mental harm, without arranging for 
> necessary care for the child, and the demonstration 
> of an intent not to return by a parent, guardian, or 
> managing or possessory conservator of the child;
> (ii)  the following acts or omissions by a person:
> (a)  placing a child in or failing to remove a child 
> from a situation that a reasonable person would 
> realize requires judgment or actions beyond the 
> child's level of maturity, physical condition, or 
> mental abilities and that results in bodily injury or a 
> substantial risk of immediate harm to the child;
> (b)  failing to seek, obtain, or follow through with 
> medical care for a child, with the failure resulting in 
> or presenting a substantial risk of death, 
> disfigurement, or bodily injury or with the failure 
> resulting in an observable and material impairment 
> to the growth, development, or functioning of the 
> child;

"What made so many people think that saying something over and over again will make it become true? Harry Potter? Do you think its some kind of spell that makes things the way you seem to so desperately want them to be?

Make your case that there is a compelling empirical, statisically significant, outcome focused basis for the contention that it is necessary for children to wear masks in school. I am not just asking for evidence that masks reduce the transmissibility of COVID (although there is also a dearth of that showing they do so at any meaningful level in the school environment). I am asking for evidence that not wearing masks places children at a greater degree of risk than other risks facing children that we tolerate. For example, show me that attending school without a mask is substantially more dangerous than not wearing a helmet on a jungle gym, climbing up and down staircases without assistance, eating solid food despite the risk of choking, etc.",t2_14kefo,truthysmuthy,1,1629061006.0,0,t1_h92r0xw,h92r0xw,False,ChristaKaraAnne,t3_p4dj5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetowntx/comments/p4dj5w/if_only_georgetown_isd_or_fred_brent_had_courage/,If only Georgetown ISD or Fred Brent had courage or cared about our children.

"Wait. So your not cool with the government making people wear a piece of cloth in their face when it's been proven to be an effective practice that protects the public.

But you are totally cool with the government restricting the rights of local businesses and schools to make their own decisions that are in the interests of their communities?

That seems a little backwards too me. The government has the ability to ask it's population to wear a mask because it's backed by science and health officials, isn't unreasonable, oppressive, or arbitrary, and basically common sense. 

The government SHOULD NOT have the ability to FORCE people to act AGAINST the public interest.

And no, I didn't forget to mention the spike in teen suicides, because I'm not fucking stupid and I understand that a stressful shitty situation can be a factor in something like that. But what I am not doing, is using said numbers to justify a crusade against science. 

The virus put us in uncharted waters, and clearly nobody knew what to do. Adults, parents, teachers, students, kids, doesn't fucking matter, we all had to work through this shit mess together. But the surprises are the part of the population willing to stall and fight against the grain because of a political ideology, rather than the public interest. Suicide rates were actually higher in the 18-29 year categories, but that wouldn't fit in your narrative, so you left that out. 

One life lost is one too many.

But sure, a piece of fabric over your nasty ass mouth is oppression and the government is just trying to steal our freedom because you can't fucking breath on another person.

"Never said you were. I’m just giving you facts.  I am not sure why that’s insulting to you. 

Call me what you want. I seriously do not care what you think of me.  Here are more facts:

With uncontrolled viral replication in unvaccinated populations causing mutations, making the virus more virulent and able to evade the active immunity you acquired via your vaccination—any innate natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2, particularly earlier varients or the original strain are worthless—and become resistant to the therapeutics we currently have. 

It is similar to bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, except viruses replicate more rapidly than bacteria.  If you don't take all your antibiotics and kill all the bacteria, you will end up with an infection resistant to antibiotics. 

In microbiology, it is the most adaptable that survive. 

#Common sense! 

Now, I will explain this phenomenon in less simple terms.  Context is helpful.  For instance, this was in the CDC report and an article about the MA cluster of post-vaccination delta infections [1]: 

> “The breakthrough infections were among people 
> vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & 
> Johnson. **None of the vaccinated people died,**
> but most had some symptoms.”

Please understand that vaccinations are intended to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. The fact that they prevented symptomatic, even mildly symptomatic infections was a bonus. Immunizations usually do not entirely prevent infections or eradicate a disease unless a specific percentage of everyone in the population is vaccinated, depending on how transmissible (the degree to which the virus is contagious [the R0 or R-not]).  For some, the percentage of immunized persons needed is 50%, while for more contagious viruses, it is closer to 100%.  

As the virus replicates and adapts through mutations, it becomes more virulent.  Viruses are better at doing this than bacteria because they reproduce so rapidly by making your body make copies of themselves, instead of replicating on their own like bacteria. Once a person is infected with a virus, they become the virus factory because viruses take over your cells and mutate them.  


However, according to the Texas Nurses Association’s “COVID Fact Check:”

> Fact #1: The COVID vaccine is not gene therapy.

#TRUTH |

> The vaccines do not change or interact with your 
> DNA. The vaccines provide a code to your cells, 
> which then make a protein to teach your immune 
> system how to identify the virus. The mRNA cannot 
> change DNA and, in fact, cannot even get into the 
> nucleus where DNA is. After the code is read, your 
> cells naturally break down the mRNA and get rid of 
> it.

Because viruses, unlike mRNA, take over your entire cells, some viruses cause cancer (not SARS-CoV-2 so far as we know because it is an RNA not DNA virus), but not bacteria.  Fortunately, we have a vaccine with upwards of 90% effectiveness in preventing cancer and genital warts, called The HPV vaccine Gardasil 9.  The HPV vaccine is one of the only primary prevention interventions (preventing the development of a disease or condition that can cause life-long disability and death) against cancer.  With most cancers, the sole semi-preventative measures we have been screening and early disease detection (secondary prevention).  Finally, once you have contracted a disease or developed a disabling and often life-threatening condition, clinicians aim to manage the symptoms and halt or slow the progression of the disease to prevent or lessen end-organ(s) damage and failure (tertiary prevention). 

For example, HPV is known to cause squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the cervix, oropharynx (mouth and throat), esophageal, penis, anus, vagina, vulva, and many other cancers that are associated with cellular mutations related to high-risk HPV infections.  According to the National Cancer Institute, “There are about 14 high-risk HPV types including HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. Two of these, HPV16 and HPV18, are responsible for most HPV-related cancers”  [3].  The Gardasil immunization protects against infection from nine of the hundreds of thousands of HPV types: the two low-risk HPV types that cause most genital warts, plus the seven high-risk HPV types that cause most HPV-related cancers, including HPV16 and HPV18. 

Anyway, now that the delta variant is more transmissible than smallpox, chickenpox, Ebola, and measles, we need more people to be vaccinated to erratic the delta variant that is also more deadly than the alpha variant and the original virus, specifically for those that are unvaccinated.  The good news is we still are protected against severe infections and death when vaccinated. 

MA has one the highest percentage of vaccinated residents in the US, with a rate of 64.66% (74.4% above the age of 12) of their population fully vaccinated [2,6].  Whereas TX has merely 45.5% of our population fully vaccinated. 

Therefore, Texas currently has a surge in cases (18.88% molecular positivity rate & 8.16% antigen positivity rate), and our COVID death rates are on an exponential growth curve [7]. 

Moreover, you might be begging the question, “But, did they die?”  First, deaths lag hospitalizations, which lag increased infection rates (testing positivity).  Finally, a better question would be, how many died and how many suffer from life-long debilitating sequelae (reduced quality of life) and require treatment for new chronic diseases caused by COVID (increasing the burden on medical costs and need for more healthcare providers to participate in the multidisciplinary teams they now require)? 

Finally, in States where Governors are implementing anti-science mandates and going against the advice of healthcare professionals—like preventing local ISDs from implementing necessary public health measures, specifically universal masking, testing, contact tracing, and isolating/ quarantining, or telling parents about all positive cases in the school district—there are no more hospital beds, especially pediatric hospital beds [7,9,10].  When someone’s house is on fire, would it help to argue with the firefighters?

"Lol, your tinfoil is a little too tight on your head, bud.

Wearing a mask to prevent germs from spreading is not radically altering the fabric of society.

I'm not using dead children to prove my point. I'm literally just stating the facts, but it isn't the facts you want to hear, so I can see why that would upset you.

Drug use and suicide rates in teenagers have been on a steady incline for the last five years. Last year it was the highest, the year before that it was the highest, the year before that it was the highest, etc.

So it sounds to me like you are the one using children/teenagers deaths to prove a point when the incline has been happening long before covid. 

And the fact that you are trivializing the suicides of teenagers to fit your little political belief is fucking disgusting.

Let's not even get into the fact that if we wore masks more, and got vaccinated more, our children would be able to slowly reintegrate themselves back into some form of normalcy.

Was the lockdown a bit extreme, yeah probably could have been handled better. But it happened, and we can't change that. It's not like everyone is rushing to get vaccinated to help stop the spread of this thing.

Probably because Bill Gates wants to control your brain with 5G cellphone waves. You definitely seem like the top notch type sort of intelligence the government ""wants to control"", so I can understand your hesitation.

Will masks protect my child 100%? Probably not, but it's what we got to work with at this point.

Will masks protect my child at least 1% more then not wearing one?

"So first off, not a ""sheeple"", just have common sense and know that wearing a mask isn't the end of the world. Ever been to a hospital with a cold? They give you a mask. Wonder why. 

Oh, and the fact that you say ""sheeple"" tells me all I need to know. The government isn't holding a gun to me to wear a mask, I do it on my own because I'm not fucking brain dead and understand basic science.

> Studies by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that children made up 14.2% of all COVID cases as of July 15. The report also stated that children comprise 0.00%-0.26% of all COVID-related deaths and, in 23 states, children make up 1.3%-3.6% of COVID-related hospitalizations.

That was released in July, and that was about 400 kids **DEAD** at that point.

My kids don't see the mask as an oppressive weapon being used against them. They haven't reached the point where politicians think for them, so they understand that covering your mouth is a normal practice when your sick.

They just see a cool design they like, on a piece of cloth, which is the same reason they pick the shirts they want to wear.

One kid dying is already too much and your a piece of shit if you think there is even an argument against that.",t2_wmj0q,scavagesavage,0,1628970631.0,0,t1_h8y4ggd,h8y4ggd,False,ChristaKaraAnne,t3_p4dj5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetowntx/comments/p4dj5w/if_only_georgetown_isd_or_fred_brent_had_courage/,If only Georgetown ISD or Fred Brent had courage or cared about our children.

"I love it when sheeple like you pretend that forcing someone to do something by point of government gun is the same thing as freely choosing to do something.

It let's me know how worthwhile of a conversation it will be. But go on troll, keep on pretending that all of the cases of children contracting the virus were all in the realms of super detrimental and deadly. After all, it's why things like you keep spouting off that 'millions' number about how many children have had it and then go on to talk about the nuance of how many showed zero symptoms and only found out they even had the disease after having been tested ... oh, no wait, you don't do that. You just point at the number of infected and pretend that you actually care about health in it's totality (physical/mental/emotional) by wrapping them up in a non-N95 masks while going on to claim how *you* are the person who *actually* cares about children as you continue to emotionally and mentally traumatize them.",t2_8qdo12ip,Mister_Grins,0,1628969715.0,0,t1_h8y2g7r,h8y2g7r,False,ChristaKaraAnne,t3_p4dj5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetowntx/comments/p4dj5w/if_only_georgetown_isd_or_fred_brent_had_courage/,If only Georgetown ISD or Fred Brent had courage or cared about our children.
