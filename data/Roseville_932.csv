If you’re looking to stay in Roseville then Miner’s Ravine trail is your best bet. There are some decent climbs for runners. False Ravine splits off Miner’s Ravine and is ~ 1.5 miles uphill. Or you can run up Sierra College from the end of the trail there. There’s also some dirt paths that go uphill toward houses by the Sierra College end. I believe Miner’s Ravine is about 8 miles from one end to the other. You can extend that to 10 miles if you include the Sierra College Blvd to False Ravine Loop.,t2_ax6ad,w11,0,1647786007.0,0,t1_i1em8bz,i1em8bz,True,scruple,t3_tia3n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/tia3n9/a_question_for_rosevilles_runners/,A question for Roseville's runners,/r/Roseville/comments/tia3n9/a_question_for_rosevilles_runners/i1em8bz/,3,r/Roseville,0,3

"People drive similar speeds inside and outside of Roseville, but Roseville has lower speed limits, for the same roads.  This doesn't affect how fast people drive, but it does affect the revenue from speeding tickets.  A decade or so ago, Roseville lowered the speed limits and switched to issuing a different kind of speeding citation that sends most of the money to the local government, which the gave out more aggressively.

It hurt their relationship with other government organizations, which were throwing out Roseville's citations on appeal. and Roseville eventually went back to normal citations given out at normal rates, but the low speed limits stuck around.  It's still a little easier to get citations thrown out, because in California, for speed limits greater than 25 MPH and lower than 55 MPH, the burden of proof is not that the driver was going faster than the posted speed limit, but that going that speed is unsafe, and when the speed limits don't follow convention that is more difficult to prove.",t2_az9fk,Who_GNU,0,1647414873.0,0,t1_i0uvkq8,i0uvkq8,True,whey_to_go,t3_tf6q1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/tf6q1q/why_does_everybody_drive_so_fast_here/,Why does everybody drive so fast here?,/r/Roseville/comments/tf6q1q/why_does_everybody_drive_so_fast_here/i0uvkq8/,16,r/Roseville,0,16

"It's a bit late for citrus, so you'll mostly just see sumo oranges and kumquats, as well as regular oranges which more or less store year round, but only taste good in season.

Denio's will have them all.  (Although kumquats aren't common there.)  The best fruit there is cherimoya, usually from San Luis Obispo, which is entering its season, but is on the pricier side, rarely reaching a low of $5/lb.

There's not much other fruit in season this time of year, because most everything is budding, so you only get fruit from trees that ripen super late.  I recommend checking Denio's in a few months, when you should start seeing a lot of interesting fruit from the area.

"One thing to keep in mind is that Roseville is the most wannabe So-cal city in Nor-Cal.  White bread mainstream, in my gothy-punky wife's words.

Prevues in Sac might be worth the drive, and Evangeline's costume shop MIGHT be open by appointment, dunno if they're doing that again since I'm pretty sure they stopped for COVID.  If you know what you want specifically, they try not to turn down the sale, but I'm sure they try to limit the folks up there.  It's a zoo around Halloween when they have it open normally.

Solstice in Nevada City might be worth planning a day trip to the gold country for, stop by Yabobo and Asylum Down as well while you're up there, too, my wife likes looking for accessories there.

"A large Roseville restaurant space that's housed several eateries over the past few years is empty once again.

Fahrenheit 250 BBQ has permanently closed its restaurant at 390 N. Sunrise Ave. in Roseville, according to a voicemail message at its phone number.

The locally owned barbecue restaurant, known for menu items such as ribs and pulled pork, opened the Roseville site in early 2020. It was a relocation for the eatery, which was previously located near California State University Sacramento. With the move, the restaurant grew from 4,600 square feet to more than 8,400 square feet.

Operators of Fahrenheit 250 did not immediately respond to an email seeking additional details about the closure.

Fahrenheit 250 had 3 1/2 stars on Yelp, based on more than 240 reviews.

The two-story restaurant space in Roseville, which was built as Mision Rogelio, has housed several short-lived eateries in recent years.

Before it became Fahrenheit 250, the space was occupied by Ciao Pizza, which closed after a few months of business, amid a legal dispute between its operators.

Prior to housing Ciao Pizza, the space operated as Ettore’s Bakery & Cafe, which closed after about 10 months.

"A Marin County-based bicycle shop is growing its presence in the greater Sacramento area following its acquisition of Roseville Cyclery on Vernon Street in downtown Roseville.

The acquisition was announced on Tuesday in a YouTube video. Helen Dyda, a public information officer with Roseville, said the city's economic development department was notified that Roseville Cyclery was being purchased by Mike's Bikes.

The bicycle shop will now be called Mike's Bikes of Roseville.

Mike's Bikes was founded in 1964 and has since expanded to 12 locations throughout the Bay Area and Sacramento, including locations on Gold Lake Drive in Folsom and I Street in Sacramento, according to its website.

Last August, Bicycle Retailer & Industry News reported that Netherlands-based Pon purchased Mike's Bikes, though the Marin County-based company was expected to remain independently run from other Pon companies. Pon's portfolio includes more than 15 bike brands, including Gazelle, Santa Cruz, and Schwinn, according to its website.

Representatives of Mike's Bikes could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.

In Tuesday's announcement, Roseville Cyclery founder and owner Oliver Bell said he bought his first mountain bike in 1987 at a Mike's Bikes location and worked for the company at one point.

""When the opportunity presented itself to become part of the MIke's Bikes team, I didn't blink an eye and we move forward,"" he said. ""This is something that's meant to be.""

Bell said the transition will provide his employees with a better benefits package and opportunity for upward mobility in the larger Mike's Bikes company. It will also provide a deeper inventory for store customers, he said.

He is expected to remain on staff in a leadership role.

Oliver and Yi Bell opened Roseville Cyclery in 2013. The business serviced and sold bicycles, including electric bikes, bike components, accessories and clothing, according to its website.

The shop is located at 404 Vernon St. in downtown Roseville. Last November, Oliver Bell filed plans to improve a vacant space at 105 Lincoln St. in downtown Roseville. Plans called for the remodel of the more than 3,000-square-foot space into a bike store. It's unclear if that project is ongoing or included in the deal with Mike's Bike's. Oliver Bell did not respond to a request for comment, and Mike's Bikes representatives couldn't immediately be reached by the Business Journal.",t2_80g1a,gamefaqs_god,0,1646259338.0,0,t1_hz3v785,hz3v785,True,gamefaqs_god,t3_t5boi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/t5boi1/mikes_bikes_expands_presence_in_area_after_taking/,Mike's Bikes expands presence in area after taking over Roseville Cyclery,/r/Roseville/comments/t5boi1/mikes_bikes_expands_presence_in_area_after_taking/hz3v785/,3,r/Roseville,0,3
"A new housing project is planned for the former site of a courthouse in downtown Roseville.

Though the city still owns the site, Bridge Housing in San Francisco has filed an application to build a five-story, 69-unit affordable housing project for seniors at 505 Royer St. Bridge Housing didn't return a call for comment Tuesday, but city spokesman Brian Jacobson said in an email that city officials and Bridge are discussing a purchase-and-sale agreement for the property.

According to the application, Royer Street Apartments would be mostly studios and one-bedroom units, ranging from 469 to 675 square feet. There would also be one two-bedroom unit of 896 square feet on the top floor. In addition to the apartments, the property would have a 933-square-foot office and a 1,328 square-foot community room. There would also be 61 parking spaces. Royer Street Apartments' community room would open onto a courtyard with a covered patio.

LPAS is the project architect.

The application doesn't lay out the income levels for the apartments.

Bridge Housing has done a handful of local affordable projects, including Rivermark in West Sacramento, but doesn't appear to have carried out one in Roseville before.

Until about a year ago, the 1.17-acre site 505 Royer St. had a courthouse building on it dating to 1969 but unused for several years. Roseville acquired it from Placer County in 2013 for $540,000 and considered making it available for other uses, such as coworking, but dropped those plans when the cost of renovations to bring it up to code was too high.

In late 2020, the city issued a request for proposals for the property itself, with plans already in motion to demolish the building. The site was one of several city officials have identified as key to giving Roseville's downtown a stronger identity, along with others along Vernon Street near City Hall.",t2_80g1a,gamefaqs_god,0,1646259243.0,0,t1_hz3uz7u,hz3uz7u,True,gamefaqs_god,t3_t5bnex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/t5bnex/senior_apartments_planned_for_former_downtown/,Senior apartments planned for former downtown Roseville courthouse site,/r/Roseville/comments/t5bnex/senior_apartments_planned_for_former_downtown/hz3uz7u/,7,r/Roseville,0,7

"An industrial developer hasn't done a lot with empty land in Roseville since selling a piece to the FBI more than a half-decade ago – but that's about to change.

Schnitzer Properties is working with city planning and cost estimators for what would be a four-building project of more than 300,000 square feet, called the Blue Oaks Commerce Center.

""We knew we had a good location, and we knew development would be moving toward us,"" said Schnitzer senior vice president and regional manager John Shorey of the 25-acre project site, south of Blue Oaks Boulevard between Industrial Avenue and Washington Boulevard. ""The time is right.""

Shorey said all four buildings will be built on spec, with two smaller ones closer to Blue Oaks and two larger ones to the south. The smaller buildings would probably be aimed at engineering firms or back-office users, with options to add small offices, he said.

Companies in e-commerce or distribution would be the more likely tenants for the other two buildings, the larger of which would be more than 100,000 square feet, Shorey said.

Shorey said Portland, Oregon-based Schnitzer, known until recently as Harsch Investment Properties, plans to start construction as soon as this fall, and have buildings ready by late spring or early summer of next year. While costs are still being determined, he said, company managers have already noticed they've risen 20% to 25% from a couple of years ago when the project was first being considered, and likely will rise further before work starts.

Most of the local building activity has focused on larger distribution centers of 500,000 square feet or more. But that provides an opening for Schnitzer to meet its niche: Buildings with several tenants who may eventually springboard into larger space elsewhere.

""The smaller ones are so intensive, you have to build little offices, you have to manage them,"" Shorey said, explaining why many companies build larger.

Even so, he said, he wouldn't be surprised if Blue Oaks Commerce Center is 20% to 25% leased before it's complete, given how hot the industrial market is.",t2_80g1a,gamefaqs_god,0,1646176308.0,0,t1_hyz5i1t,hyz5i1t,True,gamefaqs_god,t3_t4l591,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/t4l591/schnitzer_properties_plans_more_than_300000/,"Schnitzer Properties plans more than 300,000 square feet of industrial buildings in Roseville",/r/Roseville/comments/t4l591/schnitzer_properties_plans_more_than_300000/hyz5i1t/,5,r/Roseville,0,5
"A vacant space adjacent to Eureka! in Roseville is being taken over by a higher-end taqueria concept based out of Mexico City, which is expected to open later this year.

Eureka! opened in Roseville's Highland Village center in November 2019. The Southern California-based eatery serves American cuisine, with options such as burgers, sandwiches and salads. It also has a bar that serves a variety of cocktails, whiskeys and local craft beers.

Shortly after the Roseville opening, a Mexico City hospitality company called Grupo Carolo invested into the Eureka! Restaurant Group with a plan to take its taqueria concept called La Popular and adapt it to the United States market.

Paul Frederick, founder and chief development officer of Eureka! Restaurant Group, said the first U.S. La Popular location is planned for the Roseville site.

The full-service restaurant will occupy an approximately 3,700-square-foot space adjacent to Eureka! at 234 Gibson Drive in Roseville. The location also features an approximately 1,200-square-foot patio area.

Frederick said the taqueria will have about 25 to 30 menu items and its meats will be slow-cooked al pastor, meaning roasted on a vertical skewer or spit.

Some of the menu items include rib eye tacos, veal Milanese, cheese-crusted quesadillas and churros. The restaurant's bar will also serve about 40 different mezcals and tequilas, as well as Mexican beers, he said.

Roseville was selected as the first U.S. location for the Mexico City taqueria because it is a top three location in Eureka!'s portfolio, Frederick said.

""Our strategy for La Popular is to take it into our Eureka! markets where we already exist and have found success, which will provide way better economies of scale by having multiple brands in a particular region,"" Frederick said.

He said having the two locations open next to each other will result in delivery efficiencies and be a better use of the restaurant group's supply chain.

La Popular is expected to open in Roseville this August and will employ between 55 and 60 people, Frederick said.

He said the restaurant group also plans to open a La Popular in Austin, Texas about three months after the Roseville location.

"Credit scores are based on credit history. If people don't pay their debts they are riskier to lend to. Higher interest rates offset those risks. The alternative is that people that have bad credit history can't get loans.

The rich aren't stealing from the poor very often. Stealing implies they are taking something of value away from someone against their will. 

Most poor people aren't criminals but most criminals are poor. I don't want crime rates in my community to be artificially increased because we make accomodations for people that cannot afford to live here. It could literally cost the lives of one of my family members (not likely but it increases the chances). Risks of financial loss also increases due to poor people being more likely to steal and less likely to have auto insurance. 

If it doesn't make our community safer then I don't want it. I don't care if it increases their quality of life.

"My sister is a community development professional who teaches in one of the most expensive universities in the Philippines. They have immersion programs that show students, many from the upper class of our society, the fact of life for the poor and marginalized members of the community. Your thought process here shows why it is important that the rich see the plight of the poor and how hard they work to provide for their family's needs. Not everyone who's poor resorts to crime, there are more hard workers than criminals among the poor. The rich steal from the poor, the process is just institutionalized, ingrained, and made legal in many ways. What's the interest rate offered by banks to those who have stellar credit scores? When we moved here I was offered 12.5% for a car because I had no credit history. I didn't need to take a loan to buy a car so I just declined but I was appalled by the situation. I know that risks determine the rates but that just goes to show how being poor is very expensive. Anyway, I digress but I sure hope your kids will not share your mindset.

"paywall:  
Seeing a shortage of big available parcels, industrial developer Buzz Oates has bought undeveloped Placer County land for a new project of more than 300 acres.

The Sacramento-based company closed escrow in recent weeks on 393 acres flanking North Foothills Boulevard and south of Athens Avenue, southwest of Thunder Valley Casino.

""It was brought to our attention and we got interested in it,"" said Kevin Ramos, Buzz Oates' chief investment officer. ""We like the site and the infrastructure that's there.""

Ramos said Placer Commerce Center is in early stages, but the company envisions developing 4 million to 5 million square feet of mostly industrial space on the land, which is within the recently adopted Sunset Area Plan. After the company puts in roads and other necessary infrastructure, the developable land is around 330 acres, he said.

In recent years, large logistics and e-commerce companies have looked for large parcels where they can locate a distribution center of a million square feet or more, Ramos said. Even Metro Air Park in Sacramento County, where Buzz Oates is one of the biggest landholders, doesn't have much anymore to match that requirement, he said.

Placer Commerce Center could host some of those type of users, he said, as well as light industrial, data centers, industrial buildings with small office space and research-and-design sites. There would also be a small amount of non-industrial commercial development, such as restaurants and gas stations, to serve the larger industrial sites.

About $30 million of necessary infrastructure work could start within about a year, Ramos said, while vertical construction could start in a couple years. Build-out would likely take 10 to 20 years, he said.

Based on current costs, he said, Placer Commerce Center would likely be a $750 million project. But with inflation, that could end up being $1 billion, he added.

Because the project is within an approved plan, it won't need an environmental impact report of its own, he said. Placer Commerce Center is also north of the planned Placer Parkway project and the Placer Ranch master plan, which Taylor Builders is planning to carry out.

A Placer County campus for California State University Sacramento is also planned nearby. ""It all dovetails to create a nice employment center,"" Ramos said.

According to property records, Buzz Oates paid $15 million for the land, which was sold by Placer Athens LP. Representatives of Placer Athens couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

""We've built a lot of business parks in the region, and this is a key component of what we do,"" Ramos said. ""And it's always good for economic development to have these things ready.""",t2_suonh,MoDa65,0,1645493993.0,0,t1_hxwr2os,hxwr2os,True,MoDa65,t3_syasnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/syasnc/buzz_oates_buys_393_acres_for_placer_county/,Buzz Oates buys 393 acres for Placer County commercial project,/r/Roseville/comments/syasnc/buzz_oates_buys_393_acres_for_placer_county/hxwr2os/,15,r/Roseville,0,15

Builders can always choose to not take tax money for roads and infrastructure but they won't. Notice how they always build the low income housing last?

"You do understand that Roseville categorically has always been a working class town, right? A lot of blue collar workers and their families. The entire economy of Roseville is centered on service-oriented jobs. Jobs which might not afford people a $700k house.

The average cost of a 1 bedroom apartment in Roseville is upwards of $1,800/month. Just because these people can’t afford a nice huge house doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to have affordable or comfortable cost of living standards.

You’re basically afraid of people in a lower socioeconomic class from being your neighbor. It’s pretty shortsighted and unfair to categorize all people who make less money than you as potential criminals. Cite your sources dude. You’re acting like this place is going to be a crime haven. Seriously, wake up. You obviously have no clue how the other half live. Not all of us are criminals my guy. I make exactly $60k/year and have 2 college degrees and even I struggle to make it in my Hometown. You need to realize that Roseville has always been a blue collared town. It’s a service oriented economy. You’re literally afraid of everyone who works basic jobs in the community. You’re afraid that the McDonalds Manager or the dude who sells you car insurance might break into your Tesla. You’re making all these people out to be lowlife criminals and it’s unfair.

"More than 300 affordable apartments are in the works for Roseville's Fiddyment Ranch area, with the possibility of work starting by the end of 2022.

San Francisco-based Maracor Development is teaming with Eagle, Idaho's Pacific West Communities on an unnamed project of 330 units on the southwest corner of North Hayden and Crawford parkways.

""Its location in a master plan community is really attractive to us,"" said Maracor Principal Chris Hawke. ""Shopping, schools, trails, all those features.""

The apartments would range in size from 626-square-foot one-bedroom units to 1,200-square-foot three-bedroom units. There would also be 950-square-foot two-bedroom units. The two larger sizes would have 84 units each, while the one-bedroom units would number 162.

In addition to the apartments, the site would have a pool, exercise area, basketball court and 6,000-square-foot clubhouse and leasing center, Hawke said. Rents would be set to be affordable to people making 30% to 80% of area median income, or about $24,000 to $64,000 annually for a family of four.

Hawke said the project site is about 11.9 acres, with the 11 apartment buildings each three stories. Density is just under 28 units an acre for an area mostly developed with single-family homes.

A site plan also shows 577 parking spaces, including 14 for motorcycles.

SDG Architecture from Redwood City is the project architect.

Timing to build the project is subject to financing, Hawke said, adding estimated project costs are still being finalized. Because of its high unit count, the project would likely be built in phases, he said.

Property records show Pacific West bought the property for the project in recent weeks for $4.155 million from JEN Partners, a landholding entity based in New York.

Maracor's project would be the second affordable multifamily project planned at that intersection. Last spring, Hampstead Cos. filed an application with the city of Roseville for a 198-unit affordable project on the northwest corner of North Hayden and Crawford parkways.",t2_suonh,MoDa65,0,1645373965.0,0,t1_hxpujya,hxpujya,True,MoDa65,t3_sx4sme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/sx4sme/west_roseville_could_see_330unit_affordable/,West Roseville could see 330-unit affordable apartment project,/r/Roseville/comments/sx4sme/west_roseville_could_see_330unit_affordable/hxpujya/,8,r/Roseville,0,8

"> Covid19 is very very different because the data shows the older population are the most vulnerable and the younger are in fact the safest. Dr. Mackary from John's Hopkins examined the data of all kids who had died from covid19 (a very small number) and found that every single one had a pre-existing condition. So what he found was no healthy kids in the U.S. had died from Covid19. These results were published in the Wall Street Journal.

Google: ""Herd Immunity"" and ""Contagious Disease"" and think reeeeeeeeeeeeeal hard about those two concepts.

>All medicines across the globe are safety tested with a double blind inert placebo safety study. To explain what this is... There could be 20,000 people in the safety study. 10,000 get the medicine and the other 10,000 get a saline shot. Then both groups are tracked over time to see how the two groups differ. If the 10k that got the vaccine have excessive myocarditis and blood clots etc where the 10k that got the saline shot didn't then they know the vaccine is causing those things to happen.

You heard this on Joe Rogan, but didn't actually bother to actually look it up yourself. You really are a ""critical thinker""!

Here are all the trial's details, they all say the same thing! A Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2/3 phase clinical trial.

Where is the source for this almighty standard of science?

>If aspirin or Viagra was tested this way they would never get appropriate approval to be given to the public.
