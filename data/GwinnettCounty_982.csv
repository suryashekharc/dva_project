Covid allowed me to experiment with my cooking side, knock off some of the long list of novels from my Kindle, and make a huge dent in my tv show backlog of missed episodes.

"I have some thoughts about this and I'm not exactly sure how to communicate them without it just being complaining, but I'm going to try.

Let's start with this: I'm not looking for a place to be a customer. I'm not opposed to being a customer but that's not my primary goal. I'm looking for a social experience. I've been to every one of the venues mentioned above and while I have had staff ask me if I needed any help finding something to buy, I've never been invited to any of the events hosted there. Yeah, I'm calling the shops out on this. The reason why they have these events is so that I'll meet people to play games with, and so then I will buy games to play, it's in their interest to convert casual shoppers into event attendees. 

Still, I've attempted to go to a few, (and this goes for meetups too) and it typically plays out that the people there that already know each other carry on, and while I don't expect them to do all the work of bringing me into the group, I usually end up feeling really awkward about the whole thing and it's kinda not fun so I don't go back. This could just be me; It takes me a while to warm up to people, and even longer when it's lots of people. But at the same time, the new person might be meeting 10 new people at once while the group is only meeting one. I still think though that nerdy geeky groups though in general are full of socially awkward people that aren't very good at the 'host' role. We collectively could be better about that.

I do like the convention type things. They're great when I can get friends I already know to go with me. Going by myself... Not so much, mainly for the same reasons mentioned above; creating those moments were the person that's by themselves and an existing group will engage is tricky. Again, this might be me though, like a social anxiety thing.

Lastly my biggest problem is that the things I am most passionate about are software and gaming. Software dev is mostly sit at a PC by yourself and code and debug, and since I don't like pvp video games, I play a lot of single player. My favorite things just don't lend well to group settings.

"Thank you for your support. I am sorry to hear about your wife’s experiences. This is the hardest thing a woman can go through. My wife made up her mind that this is no longer about her but the women that come after her. 

After leaving the meeting yesterday one of our concerns is that since the event happened in the Publix parking lot there should be some video of the incident or at least showing her car there. They never asked why kind of car she was in. The major said that during the 2 months of no contact the detective made a record of going to the Publix and that “they did not have cameras in the parking lot.” We called that Publix and they confirmed the do in fact have some cameras facing the parking lot. So now we have the police department falsifying records on her case.

We will continue to fight so that the women that come after my wife get the Justice that they deserve.

Edit: and this is the hardest thing a husband can go through as well. We becoming secondary victims. I have heard the story of the event so many times I have a very clear”video” playing in my head of what happened.

Gaming meetup (local venue) - @ a bar/food spot
Skeet/Range shooting -??? (a spot in Fayetteville)
Restaurant Dining/Bar - Contemporary/Italian/African
Car Meet - (Doesn't need to be fancy like C&O style)
   - C&O = Caffeine and Octane, biggest car show in SE
Cards/Movies/Event spots - E.g Dave&Busters/Main Event
PPV Events - MMA or Boxing at ""Buffalo Wild Wings"" or similar

"You are correct. DAs should go after bad cops. No disagreement at all. The problem is when they bow to the mob and go after cops who were just doing their jobs. Fortunately, juries often acquit these officers, but some are wrongfully convicted and that’s a travesty of justice when *anyone* is wrongly convicted for a crime they did not commit.

On a side note, it’s funny how “You don’t agree with me so your opinion doesn’t matter.” Sorry, but that’s not how a free country works. By your logic, I can just declare your opinion invalid for whatever reason I personally deem to justify doing so. But I won’t. Because your opinion does matter but that doesn’t mean it is above being question when offered in a public forum. Of course your just deem that as trolling to try to avoid defending your views it seems.

"While I won't ask someone to disclose details, I think we have seen enough claims of ""aggressive"" police in recent years that were shown to be overblown or unfounded upon further examination, that I simply cannot take such an assertion as warranted without additional information. There is just too much anti-police rhetoric these days to simply believe claims of harassment. I am sure it happens, but we have clearly seen it does not happen as often as some claim. I see that someone says to take it to the DA. While I had some issues with Danny Porter, I think it will speak volumes about where Gwinnett has slid to if the DA now spends time going after police rather than those who commit crimes. This of course presumes mimicry of the pattern of politicized prosecutions of police officers that have become too common across the country. The future of Gwinnett just keeps getting bleaker.

Thank you for the input! I do go out in Atlanta a good bit (I work in the heart of downtown) but a lot of times I come back up 85 after work and the idea of going right back down to go out just pains me. I definitely understand that what I’m going to get in ATL is much different than in Gwinnett. One nice thing is the club / edm / lounge scene isn’t really my thing. I am more of a sit outside listen to live music and mingle with friends so from the sounds of it Gwinnett should have me covered with some good spots,t2_ay5owv84,buyhat,0,1646800731.0,0,t1_hzxnltu,hzxnltu,False,buyhat,t3_t7ha3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/t7ha3s/nightlife_for_recent_college_grads/,Nightlife for recent college grads,/r/Gwinnett/comments/t7ha3s/nightlife_for_recent_college_grads/hzxnltu/,2,r/Gwinnett,0,2

"So in my experience, I've always used Breeze and not GCT. The value to me for breeze is about going from Northside to southside, considering traffic. For example, it is not worth it for me to drive my car into downtown going to the airport when marta would drop me str8 in for $5.00 round trip (sans cost of card). For reference, a similar uber/lyft on the cheap side would be b/w $40-50 and I'll still be stuck in traffic, hence defeating the purpose of not using my own POV. Now value to you should be gauged from the value of your time spent in traffic e.g if going through GCT vs Breeze will net you $1.50 like you stated, but GCTs route would take 30mins longer for the same ride, are you really saving money when you consider the time value of money?!

Because starting a business cost money. And partnerships relieve some of the responsibility/liability off of one person. Not all entrepreneurs make massive amounts of money hence why they would go into the partnership so collectively something can be built together. There are a TON of people who cook in their house and sell food - they would be considered “entrepreneurs”. They aspire to own a food truck or a restaurant but don’t have the funds to do so.

"Hello! This is my first time posting here. 

To make a long story short, these are not my pooches, they are my mother’s. My mom and sister used to live here in GA, but they ran into some really difficult circumstances and had to return to our home country, Argentina. They unfortunately had to leave behind their two loves, Ozzy (big boy) and Suzy (little girl) here with my mother’s partner. He unfortunately cannot house them any longer due to a change in living arrangements, and we currently only have about 4 days until we lose them to the shelter system forever ):

I am sure it is a long shot, but I am wondering if there is anyone in the Gwinnett area (maybe even South Carolina or Alabama?) would be able to house them either both at the same time, or even separately. My mom’s biggest fear is just losing them forever ): 

Unfortunately, I already have 4 of my own dogs and rabbits and guinea pigs and… I can’t house them unfortunately ): 

They are VERY VERY sweet dogs that just like to sleep all day. They are potty trained and neutered as well. We would also be providing compensation for their food and supplies. 

PLEASE if anyone is interested please contact me!! Or even if you have any information, or maybe somewhere better I can post this that would be great!

"As far as gutters go, we have been using Ned Stevens to clean them 5 times a year. No guard installed. We figure we don’t want the expense of a guard that can still clog and render gutters useless. For less than the cost of guard installation we can pay for a year of gutter cleaning services. Even with most guards you’d still need to clean the crust out, and at least wasps and hornets aren’t building nests in our gutters.

For trees, I like A.KA.

You might be able to confirm by looking up zoning overlay districts or dig into the [Gwinnett Count 2040 Plan](https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/web/gwinnett/Departments/PlanningandDevelopment/Gwinnett2040UnifiedPlan), but the docs I quickly reviewed suggest the applicant's project is in-line with the county's direction.

That being said, if you've never tried to engage the county on a rezoning battle, it can be informative, engaging and even entertaining. You'll get to meet neighbors in your area you didn't know before, meet your representatives, the developer, folks from the planning department and all kinds of nice people. You'll learn about setbacks, zoning types, development districts, geological surveys and a whole host of other minutiae. You'll probably average donating 2-6 hours of your time per week for 5-12 months. You'll learn your way around 75 Langley Drive, open hearings, closed hearings and more. You'll feel like you've really engaged your community and helped make it a better place for everyone. And frankly, you'll end up being a much better informed citizen in general so IMO it is not a waste of time.

But in the end, RZC2022-0006 will be approved and they'll build a gas station on the southeast corner and some one story retail on the northeast corner.",t2_z8sf7,robot_ankles,0,1645040904.0,0,t1_hx7p4l9,hx7p4l9,False,WittyLawfulness1642,t3_sttu4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/sttu4u/gwinnett_zoning_change_that_will_affect_our/,Gwinnett zoning change that will affect our health and safety,/r/Gwinnett/comments/sttu4u/gwinnett_zoning_change_that_will_affect_our/hx7p4l9/,2,r/Gwinnett,0,2

"Snellville is Gwinnett County district 3.  Your representative is Jasper Watkins III.  In the recent past he has held town hall meetings at Snellville Town Hall.  If you call him or the town hall, they might be able to help you learn how to leave a comment or make a presentation during the next board meeting or town hall or whatever.  If the exact location is just outside Snellville to the north or northeast, there is a chance you are talking about district 2 or 4.  Even so, reaching Jasper or town hall is your best bet to finding the routes to present your case.

You and your crew: be polite, calm, thankful.  

Bring facts and numbers.  How many feet from the subdivision?  How many residents in X radius?  Cite studies and agencies regarding the health impact.  Cite numbers of infections or deaths or whatever from the study.  Look for historical data from nearby.  Look for historical home prices before and after similar changes.

"We had something similar occur near the Five Forks library a few years back. The people who lived near the affected parcel got together to oppose the zoning change.

* They posted on Facebook, Nextdoor, etc. to make others aware of the change. I don't live near that parcel, but I drive by it all the time. Also I make use of the library and the park near there. So my wife and I ended up joining the cause.
* They contacted their county commissioner and shared their concerns.
* There will be at least one public hearing related to the zoning change. Be there. Bring your friends. Bring your neighbors. Bring their friends. Ask your commissioner if they can attend. Respectfully share your concerns. Additional issues to consider are traffic, crime, noise and light pollution. I'm sure there are others.

The zoning change that we opposed ended up being denied by the county. There is hope. But you need to organize and let yourselves be heard.",t2_h72om,gothcopter,0,1645017894.0,0,t1_hx648ub,hx648ub,True,WittyLawfulness1642,t3_sttu4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/sttu4u/gwinnett_zoning_change_that_will_affect_our/,Gwinnett zoning change that will affect our health and safety,/r/Gwinnett/comments/sttu4u/gwinnett_zoning_change_that_will_affect_our/hx648ub/,4,r/Gwinnett,0,4
"Having done this fight a couple of times now, I will tell you you have two shots at this. Firstly the rezoning request will go to the Planning commission for evaluation. They will have a public meeting once a month where the developer (or their lawyer) will speak and explain what it is they plan to do with the property and how it fits into the future development plan. Then they will let those opposed to it make their case as to why they don’t want the change to happen. Be advised here, the speaking time is allotted to 10 minutes for ALL of the against speakers total. Then the proponent gets the remainder of his time to rebut those negative responses. Once all that happens the commissioners will vote on whether to recommend approval or not. 

After the Planning Commission votes, it will be sent to the full Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners for final approval. The process is repeated again, debate is had again, and the Commissioner for your region will make a motion and they will vote to make it official. 

The best way to fight this is to organize. Talk to your neighbors, get a petition started, and bring up your concerns directly with the Planning Commission BEFORE the public hearing. The more noise you make about it the more sympathetic they will be. Email your district commissioner for the planning commission, in fact email all of them so they aren’t learning of the issue for the first time at the public hearing. Talk to the developer. Explain your concerns to them and listen to their arguments. You can use those arguments in your pitch to the committee and have your responses ready. 

On the day of the public hearing get several of your neighbors to show up with you. Be prepared for a long night. The hearing starts at 7pm but they have dozens of cases to get to so depending on where you are in the list it may be midnight or later before your case gets heard. The last time I did this we didn’t speak until 1am. Have your petitions on hand to remind the commission (you should have already emailed them to their staff). Designate a single speaker for your group so you don’t repeat yourselves, explain your concerns and urge the commission to deny the zoning change. Try to stay on topic and don’t get into feelings or emotional concerns. Fixate on the details, the buffer zones proposed, the entrances and exits, the suitability of the area to be developed. Be open about what you would like to have in the area should it remain zoned residential. At the worst, ask for restrictions to be put in place on what type of commercial property can be built there. 

After the Planning Commission votes, you’ll get to do it all again with the actual County Commission. Phone calls to the Commissioners work best, multiple times and to every Commissioner if possible. Be polite, be reasonable and ask for their help. They are people too, and not rubber stamps. If you can move them, it will put the developer on the defensive foot when proposing the change. 

Best advice I can give is don’t wait. The developer has already spoken to the Planning commission and their staff, they know the law and what can and can’t be done. If the first time the commission hears from the opposition is the day they are voting, chances aren’t good things will swing your way.

"Looks like small vacation homes with the potential to commute to Atlanta. Probably not bad at all.

The area is closer to Lithonia and Conyers, than Snelleville. The area of Gwinnett south of US 78 is the one main area that seems to have demographically similar to white flight, as Dekalb County experienced decades ago. Most areas further north in Gwinnett are more mixed, more hispanic, or more Asian. 

Most answers you get about Snelleville vs. Norris Lake, will probably be a bit different. It's a big suburban city with many big box stores and it is big shopping/activity destination area for people that live in Southern and eastern Gwinnett. Also, a whole lot of chain restaurants. 

Norris Lake is more off the beaten path. The Centerville area is where you'd likely go for groceries and quick take out food runs.

I suspect this is partly why the area has remained a bit more stagnant. 

If you're interested, I would also check out the Water's Edge neighborhood a short distance west. It is just inside Dekalb Co. on N Deshong Rd, which some people won't like the schools as much. It is actually easier to get to US78/Stone Mountain Freeway in terms of commuting. The homes are much larger and newer.

"The problem is our dependency goes beyond a limited change, it is more about where people can find housing in relation to jobs and businesses.

If we lived in a more walk-able society, the large mall wouldn't exist, housing would be far denser, but commercial spaces would also be smaller in that they could only sell to people who could access their business within a walk. A shopping mall needs a market area of 200,000\~800,000 people (depending on incomes), so it is built to be accessible to that large market area.

A small strip mall on Cruse Rd with 3 or 4 store fronts would have a smaller retail market area. Only 5,000\~10,000 people would need to live within it's market area at best. It will depend on parking and cars, but this is where locating businesses at intersections only along the road (with crosswalks) and including sidewalks. It starts to become feasible that maybe 5% of their retail market could walk there.

&#x200B;

Sidewalks... this might be a more compelling case for you. Go to your commissioner and send a note to the director of transportation. There is usually a small amount of money budgeted into SPLOST plans for sidewalk gap construction projects. You have a compelling case.

That apartment complex being built next to your neighborhood would normally need to build a sidewalk fronting the road of any new development. I think they were able to not do that, because the county owns a wider than normal right of way along Sugarloaf parkway.

I would make a case this would be a good fill in the gap sidewalk project so your neighborhood can access existing facilities. This would be a long-range thing. The bad thing is there are a list of many locations throughout Gwinnett for the same purpose. They usually give an advantage to areas near schools, libraries, town centers, senior centers, parks, etc...

This was their rezoning application of those apartments if you're curious: [https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/static/departments/planning/pdf/2019\_activity/rzm2019-00015.pdf](https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/static/departments/planning/pdf/2019_activity/rzm2019-00015.pdf)

"I find this subject is fascinating. My fast good habits have changed a great deal in the last few years.

There has been much disappointment. Some places are severely understaffed. Some cut back their hours. I went to a Burger King the other night and from what I could tell there was only 1 employee. The whole process of ordering and waiting on food took forever. You can't blame the 1 guy that is stuck working there along either.

&#x200B;

 Other fast food places have stayed staffed, but they are overly busy/backed up. Most of the Zaxby's in any direction around me always has a full drive thru, but they haven't found any methods for speeding up the process. Some have closed dining rooms, other's don't. Many restaurants of the same brand also have inconsistent order-ahead pick up practices, so it can be harder to learn the process (ie. one uses drive thru, another table inside the door, another is behind the counter, etc..)

Chik-fil-a has learned efficiency. The traffic in and out of one can be a bit daunting. They have more staff and heave learned how to get more orders per staff.

What I find so interesting is with so many restaurants only operating at partial capacity still, especially mid-week, it's fast food places with drive thrus that have the upper hand advantage at making money.

"I feel like this is pandora's box. There are more issues at play here than the county choosing to build a crosswalk and the county is not directly at fault as property owners have rights and making many of the developments construction choices, which were largely made in the '90s.

I'm very confused on what your expectations are exactly and what you think is missing and where.

First and most importantly, the county has put signalized crosswalks on all major county roads around Sugarloaf Mills. They exist at 8 different points around the property along Duluth Hwy, Sugarloaf Pkwy, and N. Brown that surround the property. These exist on all sides around the property. It is accessible.

The loop road within the development's (mall) property is owned and maintained by the mall itself. If you think there needs to be crosswalk signals there, you need to talk to the property owner.

There are really no residential neighborhoods in adequate walking distances, except one newish apartment complex, Sugarloaf Summit. The mall built a protected sidewalk and upgraded crosswalk with island center at the narrowest point on the loop road and closest walk between the apartments and mall. The apartment complex built a fence. If this happens to be your situation, you need to talk to the apartment complex to address an accessible gate. The issue isn't the county or the mall, but the apartment complex's management/owner.

&#x200B;

If you live in the low-density single family homes north of Sugarloaf Pkwy the problem here really comes down to the original developers and consumers (by some small extension you). Those neighborhoods were built to be auto-centric themselves and the access points do not match that of the mall. I don't believe there is any realistic expectations for the county to do anything else here. The problem is the type of development you chose to move into, if this is your location, it is auto-centric in nature.

In this case, the properties north of Sugarloaf really need to be redeveloped into a non-autocentric standard with a higher land-use impact before any more money or disruption points to traffic would be built. The issue at play is the complete urban design of the area, which the low-density residential neighborhoods are partially responsible for. 

The neighborhoods to the south have entrances on N Brown Rd or Atkinson Rd, both of which have signalized crosswalks. There are no neighborhoods to the west due to a freeway and commercial development.",t2_a1usihz4,cwdawg15,0,1644603260.0,0,t1_hwj9wn2,hwj9wn2,True,KhmerAssassin,t3_sq4hs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/sq4hs1/serious_question_can_a_someone_like_myself_talk/,Serious question: Can a someone like myself talk to Gwinnet county about road crossings and signalized crosswalks?,/r/Gwinnett/comments/sq4hs1/serious_question_can_a_someone_like_myself_talk/hwj9wn2/,6,r/Gwinnett,0,6

"oh boy, seems like I rustled someone's jimmies today. 

Let's break this down then. 

* ***""If you have a complaint in your area then get on the Gwinnett County web page, contact Code Enforcement, call you local precinct, ask for a COAP or get off your hind end and help yourself and your community. You had a hell of a nerve asking for something on social media when I was trying to offer a hand to a fellow looking for information to decide to relocate to a neighborhood; very rude in my opinion.""***

For your information, I have already reported this to police. I presented an officer with evidence of a license plate number, a make and model of the vehicle, and the idiot was dumb enough to throw their mail in the pile of trash that had FIVE different envelopes all to the same mailing address. You know what I was told by gwinnett PD? ""well we cant do anything about it. Even if we go over there to their home and ask them, all they have to say is ""that wasn't me"" and that's about all we can do."" 

Great, thanks gwinnett PD. Real Helpful.

&#x200B;

* ***""You inserted your needs into someone else's conversation for your own concerns.""***

First of all, you think I'm THAT bored with my life to care about the trash can city of SNELLVILLE? LMAO and with that out of the way. This isn't a personal issue, the very representative's of gwinnett has said issues such as these increases crime within the area since it gives off the vibe of ""no one cares about this area"". The asian restaurant right next to the goodwill i used to manage at was robbed at gunpoint and had one of their employees tazed. Don't believe me? Here's the sources but I doubt you're actually going to look at them.

Gwinnett rep talking about the issue- [https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/trash-keeps-piling-up-gwinnett-dollar-stores-leaders-demand-stores-do-better/DQLWDCJBIRG7RNB3TPN3HFB4LE/](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/trash-keeps-piling-up-gwinnett-dollar-stores-leaders-demand-stores-do-better/DQLWDCJBIRG7RNB3TPN3HFB4LE/) \- P.S. yes, that is the parking lot of the goodwill and family dollar on centerville hwy.

* ***""Don't think I am who I say I am? Well then launch your own investigation and prove me wrong. I was just trying to avoid any more inquiries like this from people that would use this as a way to air their personal problems with the state of their immediate area.""***

Then why go on a public platform boldly stating ""i've been with gwinnett PD for 22 years"" LOL HUH? If you don't want any inquiries to a trash/high crime rate area, why are you saying youre a cop then. If you are a part of the Gwinnett PD, I am now questioning how they look for new candidates then. 

&#x200B;

* ***""I realised that after you thoughtless inquiry. I'd love to be charged with ""impersonating an officer"" that would be rich!""***

LMAO are you okay?

*  ***""I realised that trying to be nice I'd opened up my self to selfish people like you and would have to deal with a bunch of personal pet peeves so I took that part out. Sorry, I'm just not real ""social media"" savvy, I really like to help people, sometimes that backfires.""***

Seems like based on your responses, you seem more selfish than me. I brought up actual issues with the area as a warning for the OP and you back pedaled and edited out the part of you saying you're a cop instead of owning up to it. If you really want to help people then maybe actually look into these issues and address them for the OP then instead of telling him how the HOA throws BBQ's....officer. 

&#x200B;

* ***""Just for my personal edification; what does ""ayo"" mean....... Thanks.""***

This basically just confirms to me that you're a boomer and that's ok. ""Ayo"" is just an expression for something on the lines of like ""yo dude"" or ""hey you"".

"I won’t comment on pay for specific jobs. That can vary widely and there are better platforms to figure that out.

The Median Household Incomes in the area is generally in the upper $60k’s and likely recently broken into the lower $70s. That is where most get by in the area. I’d say about half work in-county. Others commute into in town Atlanta, Dekalb Co, or North Fulton County.

I would recommend getting on indeed, monster, etc… and search for job postings in the area. Some employers are starting to post wages, if not some of these websites are good about showing project salaries based on data. I’ve also heard many people complain that Atlanta hiring agents are hostile towards applicants from out of state. We have such a high number transplants here, with many more interested evading higher cost areas, they seem spend more with people already here or in the process of transitioning to here already to weed out the many who are merely interested. (Just a heads up). I do think wages are rising and employers are more desperate. Many lower wage places, like fast food places, are drastically understaffed and in some cases have cut back on their hours. The reason you see more salaries in job postings is part of demand for labor employers have. 5 years back you didn’t see salaries posted often, unless it was a specialized position.

Also, Gwinnett Co. is by no means homogenous in just about everyway. It’s nearly a million people and we have our fair share or poorer areas, middle of the road areas, and many areas that are more upper middle income. It’s one of the most racially diverse counties in the country. There are some areas that are black majority, some that are white majority, some that are Hispanic (mostly Mexican-American) majority, and Asian majority, then we have many more areas that are mix in-between. Incomes mix a good bit too. There are some very wealthy Estate areas along the Chattahoochee River, Chateau Elan is a fairly affluent area, there are some sizable golf course communities.  Then we also have some ‘60s era aging suburbs that are more primarily considered cheaper immigrant communities. There are areas that are primarily dominated by empty nesters from the boom years in the ‘90s. There are areas that are newer and the neighborhoods are overflowing with kids.

Gwinnett is a fairly large county and actually caters to many different people and their needs. Well managed schools, parks, and a fairly good economy have kept it as a destination for many mid-career professionals, while perhaps scaring away many of the region’s yuppies.  So I am confident you can find a place for yourselves here affordably, but part of the question is if you will afford the type of area you pictured yourself looking for.

If you’re working inside Gwinnett, there are cheaper options in southern Hall County and out towards Winder, Ga/Barrow County. Just don’t expect to commute into Atlanta from those places. It will get more redneck-ish though.

Generally, Housing has been considered to be fairly cheap here in the past. Prices go up with size and build materials, but generally you thought money went directly into what you got back from it in the physical structure. However, the Atlanta area has not been immune from the Housing inflation that is affecting most major urban areas across the US. It now feels like your paying for availability/location more. Homes move fast and they are often being sold for $100k-$200k more than what they were 5 years ago.

More troublesome is there has been a large local-government/NIMBY backlash over building new apartments and against the increased building of townhomes in the area. Townhomes started becoming more common around 2015 and many local residents are getting better at organizing around any new zoning hearings. This has kept builders constrained from building what the market demands making the situation worse. Even if you won’t take a townhome, someone else competing for a house buying would. It’s a market interference.

Rent has gone up, but is more manageable the East and West coast cities for sure and more manageable than buying, in the short run.",t2_a1usihz4,cwdawg15,0,1644347021.0,0,t1_hw4ad98,hw4ad98,True,Frank_Black_Swan,t3_smyoa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/smyoa4/wages_in_gwinnett/,Wages in Gwinnett?,/r/Gwinnett/comments/smyoa4/wages_in_gwinnett/hw4ad98/,3,r/Gwinnett,0,3

Yeah. We have definitely noticed the housing increase since we initially thought of moving.

"I completely agree with your comment. We have been down 2 times as my wife's sister lives in Duluth. We thought about buying with the proceeds from our condo, but we changed our minds as I can only continue my job for a little bit as it's a project gig.

My concern is my wife gets paid extremely well for what she does even for Seattle but we are afraid we both are likely to be taking a substantial haircut and just not sure how affordable life is in Gwinnett with the housing market blowing up like it is.

"I'd have to agree with the people that said to bring your car.  The public transportation in the area is not very convenient and won't get you to a lot of places.  You didn't mention exactly where you'd be going, if you would be commuting for work, or just looking to get around some while you are here, but I would say there is a lot to see and do around ATL and further out.  If you are going to be here for three months, you'll be able to see and do a ton more if you have your car with you.  Run up to the North GA mountains to hike to a waterfall?  Not without a car.  Go downtown ATL for museums, clubs, restaurants, sightseeing, etc?  Maybe possible with public transportation, but certainly not convenient.  Even if you took the Gwinnett bus to the Marta station, and took Marta downtown, it's still difficult to get around in-town.  Marta is great if you live near one station and work right next to another one, but that's super limited.  I rode Marta for a while on my daily commute when I didn't have a car.  Even then, when it was possible based on where I lived and worked, it was a huge pain.

"You need a car to live in Gwinnett. MARTA doesn't run into this county. There are only a few bus routes and it's even more limited on Sundays AND even more limited than that on the fancy side of Duluth. Gwinnett won't allow MARTA to run in the county because it might allow a black person in. So instead you have to transfer between GCTA and MARTA down in Atlanta just to go a few miles east or west. You could definitely get by in any counties MARTA serves without a car. In Gwinnett you'll be miserable without one.

"Welcome!

Bring your car. It will be the safest and most flexible option. Gwinnett has spent the last 50 years developing an automotive centric society.

There is an emerging recognition that bicycles have been invented, but they're rarely used for transportation by people who intend to remain alive. Bike lanes are the purview of those west coast, tree hugging, freedom hating, good for nothing liberals. /jk

I see buses around Gwinnett, but it's not clear if they go anywhere useful. I suspect their primary goal is to provide park-and-ride service to people commuting towards Atlanta and hope to interchange with MARTA (Atlanta's public transportation system).

Hopefully, bike friendliness and public transportation options will continue to evolve.

"Well most people here are pretty trashy (i've worked here for 6 years in the service industry and I plan on making this my last). Snellville police doesnt even go to the 30039 part of snellville, that part relies on county police so crime is pretty rough around the area and people constantly dumping their trash on business properties or public areas. See the goodwill on centerville hwy with the family dollar. People legit piling furniture or garbage there everyday when there's a goodwill they can just give to them.

I do agree with the county rep saying that we shouldnt soley hold the lower employees accounatble but corporate too since they ignore the issue. However, not addressing that the community needs to stop illegally piling their trash on people's buisiness enables the trash cans of this area to keep doing it.
