Also, home ownership is not for everyone because there are people that are perfectly content renting and spending their money in a way they see better fit.. who are you to tell people how to live their lives.

"“Everyone should get their firsts before anyone has seconds” - but for housing. Less exploitation is still exploitation. Extreme analogy: the person who commits forty murders is worse than the person who commits one murder, but they’re still both murderers. 

Being a mom and pop landlord is unethical. Hoarding more housing than you need while people go without housing is unethical - this creates artificial scarcity and drives up housing costs. Having your mortgage paid by somebody else by doing nothing but holding a deed does not positively contribute to society. But again, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism.

I maintain that it is unethical to profit off of anything necessary for survival - basic food, water, shelter, education, healthcare. But that’s the way the system is set up, and letting your morals get in the way of your money here will only hinder you.

"Yes it is, at least in California.  And it's unethical (i mean, exploiting housing needs for profit is unethical, but there is no ethical consumption under capitalism so 乁(ツ)ㄏ )

Remember, paying $1400/mo for rent means you're paying $18,600 a year for housing.  $1800/mo means $21,600 per year.  For the former to be under a third of your income, you've gotta be pulling in $50,400 - that's $24.23/hr assuming full time work.  Not everyone makes that kind of money.

For the latter, that becomes $64,800 -- $31.15/hr.  Who makes that in the high desert?  You'd literally need two people working full time at minimum wage (and let's be real, minimum wage jobs are hardly ever full time anymore) to break that, and anyone up here who's better off than that already owns a house by this point.

From someone who has been impacted by this land I would say be kind to yourself, be gentle on days that you feel low, drink an overnight herbal infusion, nourish your body with foods that give you energy and not that heaviness.  Highly suggest a humidifier in your home, essential oil diffuser is very supportive as well and house plants that clean the air.

Take a look at the AB1482 also known as the Tennant Protection Act.  Generally rents cannot be raised more than 5% plus inflation (capped at 10%).  If you do not like the current tennants then look up the inflation calculations and hit them with the max.

"I am a landlord with two houses. When I get a good tenant (because I have had bad ones who damaged my houses, etc) I don't raise the rent.

If I really needed to raise it, I wouldn't go $400 in one whack. That is a lot for someone's budget.

Or you raise it, they decide to move then you get to play tenant roulette again...hope you don't get someone who will rip you off.

Or they stay but now they are salty. If they were taking care of the property, now maybe not so much. They figure you don't care about them so they don't care about you anymore.

Just things to think about. I have had the same tenant in one house for 4 years....same price. I think I might raise it $50 just cuz things have gone up...my insurance, my taxes. I would let him know that is the only reason why.

Big Apple (they have three shops in the area)

K & N in Apple Valley

Firestone (VV off of Bear Valley near the 15)

Just try to keep this rule of thumb in mind as you shop around: if you want the job done cheap and fast, the work won’t be good. If you want it done fast and good, it’s going to be expensive, and if you want it cheap and good, it’s going to take a while longer.

Also, always remember to try and negotiate on labor if you’re having a bunch of work done all at once. Most mechanics are reasonable and will knock an hour or two off if your bringing them plenty of work.

"Same here. I have Severe allergies and asthma. I currently have very bad asthma on 5 different medications. I lived in Pasadena my entire life and only had asthma attacks every few months. I have them at least 4 times a month here sometimes 15. My health comes first so I must move soon. It’s the dust and low humidity. The wind brings it up. Its almost guaranteed. What has helped me greatly is many air purifiers, you can get them at Walmart and target, a couple humidifiers, and allergy medication 24hr like loratadine. Have the windows closed and air out when necessary?  A swamp cooler must be fully serviced and clean. Change the pads every 3 months and dry out the pads before you shut off the unit. Avoid strong cleaners any refreshens, perfumes, and laundry detergent. I use non scented and natural products.  I am more sensitive to them since moving up here due to low Tolerance. Fabric softener kills me since I moved here. Whenever its windy I always wear my kn95 mask. Even to take out the trash. Don’t forget to change furnace filter as well. Some times my alergies got so bad I get fluid in my ear and i get dizzy and feel like i have a severe medical condtion. I always get checked to be safe.

"My brother and I moved out to Victorville just last year. I've lived many places and was used to heading down to Santa Monica Blvd in Hollywood or Pine Street in Long Beach to window shop or have a bite to eat. Even in a smaller city like South Pasadena, I could just head over to Colorado Blvd if I was bored. 

Victorville doesn't really offer any of that. Frankly, it can get boring and yet I'm happy as can be. I thought the change in lifestyle would have been jarring but I've adapted quite well. It helps that my brother and his family are only a few blocks away. Also, our realtor liked it so much she moved out of her La Mirada home of 20 years to live out here. I was gobsmacked.

It totally depends on what your looking for. My aunt who's been looking for a home to retire in would never ever move here. No further than Alta Loma she says.  Same goes for other friends and family I've talked to. I remember when I was younger, the IE and Victorville would be the butt of my jokes. Never in a million years would I have picked Victorville to live in and yet here I am. 

I like my neighborhood, I like my neighbors, and I like the weather (I know, weird.) My sister in law has told me that she likes the school they enrolled my niece in and both my niece and sister in law have already made a few friends. So far they're happy with their decision to move up here as am I.

The internet in the desert can be bad due to location. I pay the same price my friends pay in LA for internet, but ours speed is 50 times slower. Often internet goes out or down with storms.

Driving in Victorville is ruthless, all the road rage of typical Californias mixed with every other car being armed and alot of scumbags out there.

So just mind your own on the road, check crime mapping (it's a website called that).

"Hiking, bird watching, horseback riding and various other equestrian sports.

There's a market at the Apple Valley Inn this weekend. There's a couple of breweries and a few coffee roasters. Rock hunters and geological clubs. There's snow and all the snowy activities nearby in Wrightwood.
Fishing and boating in Silverwood Lake.
Various farmer's markets.

Am animal sanctuary with big cats in Phelan. A wolf sanctuary in Lucerne, and going that way to Big Bear the Big Bear Zoo.

Way out in Barstow there's the drive in movies. Failing that, there's the various regular theaters.


The biggest issue is transportation. Nothing is nearby to anything else. The Victor Valley area is economically depressed and so a lot of people commute down the hill.

"My main warning is to be aware of King of the Hammers and plan accordingly. Beware the anti-STR people, if they see you camping on the land they might try to report you to the county (if you're in an unincorporated area). Johnson and Lucerne Valleys are also nice and still a little more remote while having access.

It's also, stunningly, cheaper to remove the protected plants and be dinged instead of getting proper permits. I'm not advocating for that. Know that Joshua trees put out shallow roots over a very large area, so if you find a plot that you like please give that some consideration when placing the structure.

you seem to be confused on the definition of a suburb (an outlying area of a larger city characterized by mostly single-family residential density)

nationally, 22% of the urban population is below the poverty line on average, compared to 9% in the suburbs. poverty rate has nothing to do with that https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Suburban-Poverty-in-the-United-States.pdf",t2_ftdvd,fakeprewarbook,0,1644326710.0,0,t1_hw2uglw,hw2uglw,False,FrankM111,t3_sn7yjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/sn7yjg/questions_about_property_in_the_jtyucca_valley/,Questions about property in the JT/Yucca Valley area,/r/highdesert/comments/sn7yjg/questions_about_property_in_the_jtyucca_valley/hw2uglw/,0,r/highdesert,0,0
All I can say is don’t act like some entitled city person who wants to change the area to become just another city. I second what the post above said about permits etc. the dude who is having his pig fire and parking his rv is not where I’d want to be. Besides stuff left in the desert gets broken into. You do need to check utilities. Water is an issue in CA. And drilling a well in a remote area is a crap shoot. And very expensive. Another issue in the so cal deserts are cartels squatting on land and putting in illegal grows.,t2_birjlkeg,Excellent-Example-89,0,1644311756.0,0,t1_hw28x5k,hw28x5k,True,FrankM111,t3_sn7yjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/sn7yjg/questions_about_property_in_the_jtyucca_valley/,Questions about property in the JT/Yucca Valley area,/r/highdesert/comments/sn7yjg/questions_about_property_in_the_jtyucca_valley/hw28x5k/,5,r/highdesert,0,5
"Everything I've seen suggests to buy a lot with a structure already on it if you can, and with power and water already existing as well. But there are a lot of great areas with plots that don't have those. A well cost $25-$35k and power costs around $10k per pole last I heard. 

Permits take a long time, 6 months to a year. If you have a vacant lot you're allowed to camp on it but only for a few days per month I believe. Legally you can not setup camp or park a motorhome and stay as long as you please, though plenty of people seem to. Once you have a permit for a structure I believe you can then stay on the property as you please. 

Most people do keep the native desert plants though some people drag their property and destroy the native plants and eco system, they don't grow back anytime soon. You can not build within a certain distance of a Joshua Tree and they require a permit to move them if you go that route. 

In the summer it can be regularly be 110-115° in Twentynine Palms and 95-100° in Pioneertown due to the elevation differences.

"My realtors ne is Rob ******* and I just purchase a 5 acre parcel in Johnson Valley, near Landers and another 2.5 acre parcel in Lucerne Valley. I paid $20k cash for the 5 acres and planning department said I could build up to 4 houses on it. It is zoned as RC (recreational conservation), and I can use it for agriculture, livestock, campground etc. The land is flat with bushes and clean, no sketchy stuff out there. My parcel has no JTrees, but they are nearby and there is only 20 or so minutes to Yucca Valley. I dropped a 5th wheel there a couple weeks ago and built a pig cooking pit and a fire ring. Johnson Valley is a dedicated OHV (off highway vehicle) reserve which is great because I have a Jeep and most of my friends do too. We cooked a pig and had a blazing pallet bonfire and the stars were bright on the night that the property recorded. We even had a little stream of offroaders stop by to warm up by the fire and say hello before continuing their desert exploration. It was the 1st weekend of King of The Hammers and was a blast. Google King of the Hammers if you haven't heard of it. I think this is desirable if you like that lifestyle because it's close to the 247 and the reserve will limit a lot of available building space in the future, so when people eventually want to develop the area, the pickings will be slimmer than other areas and you can pick the spot that will be the best investment for you. DM me if you would like my realtors info. He was great, lives in the area and was almost too informative and wanted to explain every caution possible on a vacant land purchase, which showed me that he's a thorough professional and was definitely not a lazy realtor.

"Victorville doesn't have any skyscrapers, but it has a skyline. I see it every night from my house in Phelan a little higher up on the mountain. Victorville shimmers at night. It shines in beautiful silver and gold and sparkles like stars in the sky. On one side is what I call the battleship - or the cement plant which looks more like a battleship in the water than you would expect; there is a big cluster of lights in the middle that shine brighter than anything else in town which I'm pretty sure is the shopping center at Bear Valley and the 15. Stoplights all over town blink the three colors at me. And right through the middle of it and extending out into the horizon is a visible scar of headlights and taillights on the 15. Finally, this is all topped off with the blinking red lights at the top of Bell Mountain on the North side of town. This place is amazing and beautiful and amazingly beautiful.",t2_jeodgc0q,The-Brandelorian,0,1644172054.0,0,t1_hvua6tr,hvua6tr,True,seaboigium,t3_s9q9qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/s9q9qt/if_victorville_had_a_skyline_where_would_the/,If Victorville had a skyline?

"I have some respect for LA drivers. Compared to almost anywhere else, they drive fast and with confidence. You *have* to, or you'll never make a left turn or change lanes. But for all the millions of cars on the road in Los Angeles (NOT the suburbs/exurbs), it works surprisingly well most of the time.

But out here in the desert, I am convinced LA used to make its worst drivers go out to the desert, like they did with paroled sex creeps. I have seen shocking things. I watched a minivan driven by an airman, with his whole family inside, slowly drive directly into the Edwards gate at Rosamond. I looked for the Texas plate but it was California.

"Replace ""teenager"" with ""entitled, over-aggressive, homicidal psycho"" and you'll be right.

In fairness to people in this part of the country... California's population is about 39 million, and over half of those 39 million people live in Southern California, and I do understand the frustration with congestion here. In Los Angeles, in 2012, Caltrans kicked off a huge project to widen I-405, the busiest Interstate in the country. And they did - and they did a great job, too - but that just meant more cars in the backup during rush hour.

People who live on this side of the High Desert will tell you how much fun I-15 is coming northbound towards Vegas on Thursday or Friday afternoon, and coming back south on Sunday afternoon, too.

And I figure that LA doesn't have a higher PERCENTAGE of screaming assholes behind the wheel. I figure it's similar to any large American city. But with four million people in LA, 10 in LA County, about two and a quarter million here in San Bernardino County, and three million in each of the other counties in the LA metro, the absolute numbers are obviously going to be much higher than any other place.

"I lived in apple valley next to Victorville for 3 years. You will spend so much money on gas if you go down the hill by long beach for school. Its pretty boring here compared to major cities. I had to drive to school everyday and  the traffic in the moring and weekends did it for me. You can drive a small car to save gas bit it is not recommended because there are many car accident related deaths mainly head on collisions involving sedans. many people own trucks and suvs and minivans. crime is not too bad but some areas i would avoid. I lived in pasadena 15 years and 10 in West covina and it was a major change. My brother and i spend each 380 to 600 a month each on gas. If i would of known that i would have just got a house by rancho Cucamonga or even fontana. Another thing is we spend a lot of money on is utilities. It made more scene to live here many years ago when it was cheap but house's are more expensive. My neighbor bought there house for 199,000 and my house was bought for 498,000.

"Here are the thoughts of a Gen-X'er (I'm 52 years old) and 18-year Victor Valley resident:

Pros:

This really is a unique place. It's not like any other place I've lived or visited, ever.

There's beauty to be found here if you look for it. I live in the northwest corner of the Desert Knolls subdivision of Apple Valley - right near the intersection of Highway 18 and Apple Valley Road. Desert Knolls is a quiet, boring place - in this case, boring is a GOOD thing! - and from my back yard, I have a drop-dead gorgeous view of the San Bernardino Mountains (about 20 miles to my south; the San Gabriels are on the other side of the 15. The Cajon Pass runs right between those two mountain ranges).

I love road trips, and this area is central to a lot of stuff: 45 minutes from Big Bear, 45 minutes in the other direction from Wrightwood,  an hour away from the other mountain communities, Redlands (my favorite IE city) and most of the San Gabriel Valley, 80 minutes to LAX and downtown LA, 90 minutes to the LA County beaches, Hollywood and Palm Springs, two hours to the Orange County beaches, two and a half hours to downtown San Diego and the Las Vegas Strip, five and a half hours to Phoenix (yeah, that's important to me - my grandson and two of my daughters live there!) and seven-ish hours to San Francisco.

75 minutes to Disneyland from here; 90 minutes to Universal and Warner Bros; about an hour and 45 minutes to Magic Mountain.

Housing is much cheaper here than just about anywhere else in SoCal. In fact, it's probably the least expensive region of California that isn't completely remote. That said, the insane housing market is just as insane here as it is in other places, so you WILL pay over market value for a house. Rents are also high, as a result, but again, rents here are much lower than elsewhere in the Los Angeles metro (the $2000-2500 that gets you a decent apartment in LA gets you a *big* house here).

You may have heard about Jerry Brown's high-speed rail boondoggle that has been plagued with delays and cost overruns. You may NOT have heard about the privately-owned Vegas-to-LA rail line that is hopefully going to break ground this spring. [It's going to be built by Brightline](https://www.gobrightline.com/brightline-west), a South Florida company that is currently operating commuter rail all over that area (and I think they just extended their service up to Orlando). Brightline ACTUALLY HAS HSR UP AND RUNNING IN FLORIDA (I can't stress this enough) and it's not taxpayer-funded.

The first leg will run from Vegas to Apple Valley (near Town Hall and the Target Plaza). I'm excited about being able to make the Vegas run in an hour instead of two and a half hours, but I'm more excited about the plan to eventually connect the line to Metrolink in Cucamonga. I love driving, even in LA (which probably means I'm insane)... but it'll be nice to travel from here to Union Station, and beyond, without having to drive!

Cons:

As other people have mentioned, there's not a whole lot to do here.

If you don't like big empty patches of desert, you probably shouldn't live here, LOL.

I'm an Apple Valley bigot, personally. At this point, I wouldn't live anywhere else in the HD. Most places in Victorville are either in the middle of nowhere, or are full of tract homes so close to each other that you could reach out the window and touch the house next door. Adelanto's like that too, and there's a lot of crime there -- including crimes committed by a few members of City Council (Adelanto overtook Victorville as the HD's most corrupt city several years ago; Victorville actually seems to have fixed its corruption issues).

Apple Valley and Hesperia have better housing options.

There's crime here, there's homelessness, but those problems exist everywhere. Comparatively speaking, in fact, LA's homeless problem is far worse than what we have here.  


Fun facts:

San Bernardino County's physically the largest county in the US. 20,100 square miles. But north of the mountains, it's almost completely empty.

Our population's about 2.2 million, which, if we were in any other part of the country, would be huge, but since we're in Southern California...   


Our population is smaller than any other county in the LA metro, and only one county in all of SoCal has fewer people (Imperial County has a population of less than 200,000 - they're in no-man's land between San Diego County and Mohave County, Arizona). That fact always blows my mind, and I like to share it with other people because I think it blows their minds too...",t2_3si65kfj,stevesobol,0,1642279810.0,0,t1_hst92ku,hst92ku,True,MrLeroy6904,t3_s49hjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/s49hjh/possible_move_to_victorville/,Possible move to Victorville,/r/highdesert/comments/s49hjh/possible_move_to_victorville/hst92ku/,6,r/highdesert,0,6

"Drugs and off-roading lol.

I live in Apple Valley, used to live in Victorville, so I can't really speak about current VV crime levels but def listen to everyone about Adelanto.

If you're looking at new construction you'll probably be living in a nicer area but there's very little to do here. Get a good gas mileage car and budget 2 hours for drive time (1hr there and back) for going up and down the pass.

We bought here because it was cheap. Son was just born and we couldn't afford daycare but we could afford this place on one paycheck. After almost 10 years here, I'm in the same boat as the other posters. Lot of equity, I'm moving.

However, this is a good place to get a start in CA if you're intent on staying in the state. You're only an hour away from a lot of stuff and only 1-1:30 more into LA.

"Most of the posters here summed it up quite well. I myself moved out of the Victor Valley area back in 2012 to eastern NM after having lived there since '87(age 3 to 29). If you're devoted to your studies and can find a way to do it remotely without having to pay any rent, then you're gold. That ""down the hill"" commute begins to not only eat away at your bank account due to fuel costs, but the numerous car dealerships in the area stay busy quite easily due to the Pass wearing down one's vehicle after not too long.

Overall, the desert would be somewhat of a better place to live if it had some better public transit options. Last I checked, the VVTA buses usually ran on the hour between each stop, not between 9pm and 6am at night, and Sunday not at all(again, might've changed, but not too sure). There's been back and forth arguments between different parties to try and get a Metrolink extension to the area. And as of reading of the Brightline West projects, it looks like there may even be Victorville-to-Rancho Cucamonga rail-line coming in 2024. Not going to hold my breath. But at the same time the company does have a successful line running in Florida. So commuter rail going up and down the hill may finally be a thing. 

Again, unless you're interested in driving everywhere, home is probably going to be the best option. Stick to the studies and then keep thinking about the next plan from there.",t2_10vi1w,bentstrider83,0,1642240462.0,0,t1_hsqy8wx,hsqy8wx,True,MrLeroy6904,t3_s49hjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/s49hjh/possible_move_to_victorville/,Possible move to Victorville,/r/highdesert/comments/s49hjh/possible_move_to_victorville/hsqy8wx/,6,r/highdesert,0,6

"If you like open space and nature, Pinon Hills to Valyermo is so beautiful and has such great access to national forest and wildland preserves. But that's really for older, settled people. If I was 18, I'd make a real effort to stay in town. Even Long Beach is a real fun place compared to these High Desert exurbs. 

Outside of very specific things -- real estate, aerospace/defense, renewable energy, tourism work because the high desert is very popular with campers and other tourists -- there's really nothing going on. There's no culture, and it's not like Joshua Tree and Yucca Valley where there's a small scene for artists and musicians and such. Maybe, with the way real estate and the general gentrification of every part of California is now going, there's the possibility of something interesting happening even in Palmdale or Lancaster.

If you do wind up in the desert, find the weird people who know what to make of the place, who have put some time into understanding the environment.",t2_kqfa4co,OpenLinez,0,1642222875.0,0,t1_hsq876c,hsq876c,False,MrLeroy6904,t3_s49hjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/s49hjh/possible_move_to_victorville/,Possible move to Victorville,/r/highdesert/comments/s49hjh/possible_move_to_victorville/hsq876c/,10,r/highdesert,0,10

"I’m 21, basically lived here my whole life. If you don’t have a car or money, you’re gonna be stuck and bored out of your mind living up here. Nothing is in walking distance. Usually my friends and I drive down the hill to do anything interesting. You get used to driving at least an hour to have some fun lol. We have a decent enough mall for shopping. Pretty much where every high school kid hangs out. Like others said, if you’re not into off-roading, ain’t much to do up here. We do have a track in Apple Valley(Apple Valley Speedway). They hold a lot of drift events there, if you’re into that. 

For local starter jobs, it’s mainly just regular stores and food places. We do have a few warehouses: Walmart distribution center, Big Lots DC, Church and Dwight, and Keurig. Also might be an Amazon warehouse getting built, not sure. Most people commute down the hill for work.

It’s definitely a safer area than Long Beach, but be careful, because there’s definitely still a good amount of crime. Stay away from Adelanto off highway 395, a bit sketchy over there lmao.

CSUSB is a really solid university from what I hear. I never attended, so I can’t comment on it really lol. I did 2 years at our community college(Victor Valley College). Really solid college, good amount of programs.

So here we are getting high talking about food and he goes and says, ""How you ever tried human?"".

I stumbled with my response a little and asked him, ""can you even ask me that? Hell no I haven't! Have you? Is that really a thing?"". Tell me why he just smiled and covered his face with a ski mask. I had a sudden urge to leave.. So I took off.. Thing that really flipped me out is, this other guy around town that everyone hardly pays mind to has been saying for the past month (at the time) that he, is at war with cannibals that live out in in desert.

"If you're going for a more ""Fantastical"" route, you could just follow or do what other cities with major rivers did with theirs.

For example, maybe closer to the river, their would be upper middle-class people living their with some fancy restaurants. For example, in Victorville there is a small ""gated"" community in Spring Valley Lake, in my opinion, shows where the majority of the upper middle-class people live. 

I think since the High Desert (cities like Victorville, Apple Valley, Adelanto, etc.) are so close to other major cities like Las Angeles, and Las Vegas and San Bernadino, I think we would get much more tourism. Right now, some people stop by Victorville on their way to LA and Las Vegas to refuel, get some quick food, etc; however, if the river run above ground, the area would be greener, attracting people to stop by longer, exploring the city, and then going back to their journey.

We have or used to have a working military base  and I think mostly likely we would have still had the military base, with actual soldiers/troops training with aircraft (I'm not sure how true this could be because I am not sure what it takes for a base to be a base if that makes sense). If the base was still abandoned and partially transformed to South California Logisitics Airport, I think the airport would have become much bigger or a bigger deal because the area would be a nice stop by, an alternative to LA (you probably would have less traffic to deal with if you used this airport but maybe more driving if Victorville wasn't your destination.)",t2_4w7qkdbk,juanito0787,0,1638349339.0,0,t1_hmryqfj,hmryqfj,True,seaboigium,t3_qogpde,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/qogpde/what_do_you_think_the_high_desert_would_look_like/,What do you think the High Desert would look like if the Mojave River naturally ran above ground?,/r/highdesert/comments/qogpde/what_do_you_think_the_high_desert_would_look_like/hmryqfj/,1,r/highdesert,0,1

"My story is this..


I think 1990 or 91. Back in the 80's there was a lot of UFO talk and sightings etcetera. My buddy and I were about 17 and basically all there was to do there was smoke weed and chill out. We'd go to various places to chill under the desert sky and listen to Led Zeppelin or Rush. Never did we cause any trouble.. We had the groundbreaking idea of mounting a camera on the dash and film ourselves a-la Wayne's World but our show would be called ""Weed Hunt!"". Just us talking shit while stoned and driving around looking for a dime or whatever we could score. 


So we score in Hesperia and take a drive up to the dam at Silverwood Lake. After an hour (who really knows 😁) we were pretty baked and listening to 10 Years Gone and a light whizzed by *really fast* behind the car. I'm in my inner monolog and thinking ""aw man, WTF was that"" so after what seemed like a minute or so, I turn to my stoney buddy and said very nonchalant ""hey man, did you just see something?"".... 


Him: ""was it red?"" ME: ""yeah"" Him: ""a fast red light"" 


Me: ""YEAH""


Both buzzes blown, we NOPED outta there. There were no headlights. It wasn't a car. I don't know WTF it was but it was a red orb like light that flew past the back of his car.

"My first recommendation to you is to never eat at Peggy Sue's again. I know multiple people that have worked there (one was a cook) and they have told me about how filthy the kitchen and food prep areas are. Not to mention that they treat their employees like absolute garbage.

As for Vegas, the buffet at M Resort is amazing. Definitely recommend giving it a try. I stay away from the strip pretty much altogether when I go. M Resort, Green Valley Ranch, Red Rock Resort- all very nice places and very fun. I will hit up downtown once in a while but not too often. There are some decent places to eat and hangout there.

I had heard about this restaurant called Herbs and Rye for quite some time and I finally experienced it about 2 months ago. It's a steakhouse (they serve plenty of other food items also) with a dope ass bar that serves a lot of prohibition era style drinks. Highly recommend going there next time you're in Vegas.

"Not gonna lie, I had to google geocaching lol. Sounds like a fun hobby. Is there a website where people post interesting spots to search or find their buried treasure? 

This reminds me of the time I went out hiking with my brother. We went wondering through the desert with the purpose of exploring and to reach a rock formation on the other side of a big valley from our house. While mid way to our destination a kid about 15yrs old pops out of no-where and asks if we are cops. To which we replied, ""No just a couple of hikers.""

"I am a 'home grown' desert rat, born and raised here.  I used to hike all over this desert, I have this mental navigation in my head and just know where I am at and how far my 'base camp' is.  For well over a decade I would hike this desert alone (Antelope Valley btw), from Leona Valley to Mojave and besides the typical critters (barring snakes, hardly saw them) and skeletons, I didn't really ever see anything out of the ordinary.  But two incidents caused me to stop hiking completely.

Incident 1: I was hiking through a familiar area through some of the rocky hills with my very good girl dog.  I had her off leash and let her roam and sniff around as I went, she always came when called or would catch up to me.  I noticed though that she stopped her sniffing and was looking up at something, this was unusual so I looked up and saw a man sitting on a ledge on the hill above us.  He watched us and started saying something, but the vibe I got was not a good one.  I called my dog and she didn't immediately come and when I glanced at her she looked like she wanted to eat the guy.  I knew then that we had to GTFO and when I called her again she raced to me, I put her on her leash to keep her close and immediately went home.  I decided I would carry a taser with me from then on.

Incident 2: I was hiking again with my dog, more North from where the first incident happened.  We were taking our time, I stopped when she stopped to sniff and would I toss sticks for her to fetch.  We started up this hill that I hadn't gone up before, there was a very light breeze which helped with the heat.  As we went along I began to get this feeling that we needed to turn around.  I stopped and looked around, slowly and a full 360 degrees I scanned around me, but I didn't see anything plus my pup was still happily sniffing around like normal.  I brushed the feeling away and continued forward at a more leisurely pace, scanning around me as I did.  I couldn't completely shake the feeling and the more we climbed up this hill the worse it got, to the point that my heart was starting to pound and every ounce of me screamed to turn and walk away.  Finally just before hitting a few big rocks I turned and walked very quickly away; my dog dashed ahead of me and something told me to just run after her, so I did.  We made it to the bottom of the hill and I slowed to a walk again.  I turned around to look back up the hill just in time to see a man in a white shirt stand up from behind the rocks I was just approaching and turn to walk up to the top of the hill away from me.  I picked up the pace again and got home in record time.  I told my husband I was not going to hike ever again, that last time scared me more than enough.  I often wondered why my doggy girl hadn't picked up on the guy earlier and I realized that the breeze was blowing to where he was down wind of us and she hadn't caught his scent.  I think he may have realized that.

My good doggy girl is gone now and I am older and not as daring as I used to be.  Though I have better means of defense now if I were to go hiking, I still rarely hike and never hike out of sight of my house or neighborhood.

"Not sure if this is the kind of ""crazy"" you're looking for, but I'll tell you anyways.


A few summers ago my (teenage) daughter and I were out doing something, idr. Normally I don't like being out after dark, as that's when all the freaks come out, but for whatever reason we were. So we decide to stop by Del Taco before heading home. We're in the drive thru, at the speaker, ordering our food. I hear a noise in the street/parking lot behind us. I look in my side mirror, but can't really see, so then I make the mistake of looking over my shoulder.

This homeless guy is barreling right towards my completely open window, screaming something about wanting to ""fuck me up!""


Not only do the windows in that's car go up and down in what feels like slow motion, but I'd bet good money he would've broken My window(s) to try to get to me.


Thank God no one was in line in front of us, cause I fucking gunned it out of there as fast as I fucking could. 


Felt terrible for the workers, cause for all they knew, I was just being a cunt and took off for no reason.


Ended up driving all the way over to a different del taco, and I didn't go back to that one for like a year. I *still* won't go to it without my husband with me. The homeless like to hang out right across the street, and also right behind mcd.



Here's another desert story for ya. Probably 12-15 years ago, we put up 2 big metal (well, they're probably aluminum or something,) sheds in our backyard. My husband, being the half-asser that he is, didn't secure them to the concrete pad in any way. 

So one day I'm home alone. I'm *just* about to step into the shower when I hear the loudest sound in the world. I throw a towel around me, and run to look out our back window. A dust devil had come through, picked up *both* sheds, and carried one over our 6' fence and threw it into the neighbors backyard. The other shed was upside down in our yard. Thank God it didn't land on any people, animals, or property, that could've been **so** fucking bad!

The shed that stayed in our yard wasn't in too bad of shape, and we were able to put it back in place, but the other one was too fucked up to be salvaged.

I have pictures of all that, somewhere. Idk if I had a smartphone yet. If anyone's interested, I'll see if I can find them.


(Remaining shed *still* isn't anchored to anything btw 🙄)


Those are the 2 off the top of my head. I'll edit and update if I can think of any more good ones. There's always crazy shit going on around here!",t2_9jypza4x,Black_Eyed_PeePees,0,1636897906.0,0,t1_hkl5q8x,hkl5q8x,True,K-Bear8758,t3_qtjixa,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/qtjixa/what_is_your_crazy_desert_story/,What is your crazy desert story?,/r/highdesert/comments/qtjixa/what_is_your_crazy_desert_story/hkl5q8x/,8,r/highdesert,0,8
"None of mine are super special, but there’s one that sticks out to me. I was out exploring (read: doing desert rat shit) with my best friend and her sister my senior year of high school. There was an old abandoned church that had burned down years ago—I honestly can’t tell you where, unfortunately, I’m awful at navigating and I had no idea where we were at the time (my friend’s sister was the one driving )—but we stopped there, got out and walked around. Took a few pictures. You know, normal pretentious high schooler stuff. 

Anyways, we’ve climbed down to the area where a bunch of rubble from the fire is, and I look down and notice an intact glass bottle with something in it. I’m 17 and stupid, so I pick it up. It’s sealed shut, has some sort of fluid in it and two dead, perfectly preserved white mice just floating around inside of it.

I put it right the fuck back where I found it and left it alone after that. I showed my friend and her sister, of course, but they didn’t touch it either. It’s funny, because I knew not to mess with that stuff, but a year later or so that same friend and I were back in town, visiting with another friend and her boyfriend, and he ended up telling us stories about how bad shit would happen to him and his coworkers when they moved stuff like that that they found at their work. (He worked in a cemetery at the time.) 

I want to say that night we went home after that, but instead we went out the burned remains of an old asylum after because we heard it might be haunted. Didn’t see any ghosts, but we did see a shoddily drawn pentagram, and the property owner’s car chase us off. (In our defense, we didn’t know it was private  property. It honestly might not be, but that makes the car that chased us down creepier, so I try not to think about it, lol.)",t2_9zvhfgmb,lesbiantolstoy,0,1636884699.0,0,t1_hkklhcu,hkklhcu,True,K-Bear8758,t3_qtjixa,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/qtjixa/what_is_your_crazy_desert_story/,What is your crazy desert story?,/r/highdesert/comments/qtjixa/what_is_your_crazy_desert_story/hkklhcu/,5,r/highdesert,0,5
"I have one! We call it The Ghost Father Incident.

To preface: My dad is dead. He offed himself when I was a kid, but no autopsy was done and the local police were so thrilled to have him finally dead it is likely that a bunch of due diligence was skipped. Whatever, I’m over it BUT there has always been a smidgen of speculation that it was faked. And he did try and kill me and my siblings a few times - I mention all this because it sets this sh*t up.

Spent a fair amount of time at a local high desert saloon, friends outside of work with some of the bartenders. One day I get a call. “Uh, Mimeyourmanners, your dad was just in the saloon.”

Holy what? I was immediately terrified. Voldemort was coming back to finish the job.

I explained to my friend that my father was dead but there was an element of mystery to it and a reasonable amount of danger. When he described the man, the age/height/eyes/demeanor matched what my father would have been. Apparently the dude had blabbed that he was from out of town, that he was looking for his long lost child Mimeyourmanners, that his child had a job that is very rare in this area which I have, and he heard I was here.

The saloon agreed to call me if he ever came in again. He did. I got a call, went down to the bar, and watched the dude from a couple seats away for a while. He did look like my dad, or what I would imagine my dad to be 20 years later.

Flanked by a marine and watched closely by most of the bar staff, I approached and began talking to him. Asked about his family, sure enough he mentioned my name and occupation, but it was clear I wasn’t the one he was looking for. But he WAS looking.

Once I had confirmation it wasn’t my boogeyman, I noped out of there so fast. The bar staff was ready to take this dude down if I gave any signal to do so, and that’s the sort of community protection you cannot buy. I’m sure it exists many places, but the Cowboy mentality of the high desert is special.",t2_683t3hs6,MimeTheGap,0,1636877893.0,0,t1_hkkci41,hkkci41,True,K-Bear8758,t3_qtjixa,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/qtjixa/what_is_your_crazy_desert_story/,What is your crazy desert story?,/r/highdesert/comments/qtjixa/what_is_your_crazy_desert_story/hkkci41/,15,r/highdesert,0,15

"So.. when arrowhead water first came into existence whenever the heck that was.. sometime in the 80's if I remember it right... We orange county kids/young adults were just trippin'. Water in a bottle? What a joke.. just go to the river and get some. But then the controversies started because Arrowhead water comes from the strawberry river. The people who own Arrowhead bought the rights to get a certain small percentage of their water for their monopoly company. Then they were finding poisoned typed substances that ""cause cancer"" in the water and that was a huge deal but they pushed it under the rug. I remember us as young adults laughing anytime anyone mentioned Arrowhead water as if they had a death wish. To this DAY the company that handles Arrowhead water (they are not even in America, they are in Sweden or something now) has been taking a greater percentage then allowed of water out of the strawberry river.. or should I say stealing our water. It is items like this that ""We The People"" should be pissed about.. not all this lame ass political stuff that the rich just love to watch us beat each other up about because it distracts from all the bullshit they are doing while we are not looking!

"It was, and it still is if you know where to look. My grandmother bought a homestead property up here in 1960. Back then, there was only one stoplight on bear valley road.

"Pretty interesting alternative scenario. Definitely more density everywhere. It would have more infrastructural networks. Not so much single desert roads but spread out suburbia.

More seems to be the word I'm thinking repeatedly here. The area/region would need major air travel hubs. If it's river-based, look to classical urban plans which often follow rivers.

The gist of this is that 2 senators want Brightline to build three overpasses on the 15 freeway to accommodate local wildlife. Brightline has already agreed to improve 600+ culverts that go underneath the train and 15 Fwy for animal travel. The train is a zero-emission train that will reduce carbon dioxide and traffic on the 15 Fwy.

"Publishing is publishing.   Just like I can't just publish copyrighted works in this post even though I am not making money on it.  But like I said go ahead if you want.  People get in trouble all the time for posting stuff on social media and not understanding the ramifications so don't let my sober advice impede your poor judgement. 

&#x200B;

And just for fun I looked into the legality of this and it is not a crime to post a video of kids outdoors but it can open you up to a civil lawsuit if it is damaging to the minor, for instance it causes them harm, perhaps like if they get bullied at school, or an adult harasses them over the content of the video.   So any problems that come from the video are the responsibility of the person who published it.  Even if the photo/video is downloaded and used in a harmful way like it gets posted around town or it ends up on a pedo site.

"The episode made the opposite impression on me. It appeared to me that Dennis was being harassed by a large part of the neighbourhood, instigated principally by Angela, after she did not appreciate her neighbour's choice to remain friends with Rusty (incidentally, her ex-boyfriend), after the case against him was dismissed for lack of evidence.

I cannot fathom why a mother would not focus on her own daughter, life and family, such as spending time with them, rather than meddling in her neighbour's choice of friends. The easiest way to keep a child safe is by spending time with them and supervising them with acquaintances, including boyfriends and ex-boyfriends, rather than troublemaking in the neighbourhood.

I see Dennis' building of the fence as an attempt to distance himself, and would have expected Angela to respond more positively, if she was so afraid of and bothered by her neighbour as she expressed. My impression was that she continued to seek opportunities to engage with him and further the conflict. I also fail to understand what it was about the cameras installed that offended her, if her concerns were for the welfare of her child, as she expressed.

Dennis was attacked by a neighbour on one occasion arising from the conflict with Angela. He was threatened frequently by her friends, as well as her new boyfriend.

I cannot imagine what it would be like to be bullied by an entire neighbourhood.

My impression of the conflict, after viewing the episode, concurs with the ruling of the court case, which was not guilty. I am ashamed to see how many neighbours participated in harassing this man and fuelling the fire, which ultimately led to lost lives. If people would be a little more civilized and human, mind their own business and let others live in peace, this would have all been avoided.",t2_dlojyyso,Emergency-Buddy-8582,0,1635392378.0,0,t1_hic7dpq,hic7dpq,True,DoctorBleed,t3_8wmnjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/8wmnjn/the_dennis_flechtner_homicide_case_phelan/,"The Dennis Flechtner Homicide Case (Phelan, California)",/r/highdesert/comments/8wmnjn/the_dennis_flechtner_homicide_case_phelan/hic7dpq/,1,r/highdesert,0,1
