"That was the impression I was under as well. 

I’ve got a friend who’s wanted me to stay with him for a long time, but I’m really stubborn. After about 6+ years of many “close calls” with escaping poverty, my friend convinced me to just split rent with him and save money the way I have been. His family likes me well enough, and some of the locals know me as well. I’d still feel like a fish out of water.

It’s different than where I was raised, that’s for sure. Gated communities, no 24/7 anythings, and like you said — people just raising their families and trying to provide a safe and peaceful environment for their children. It’s not a bustling and “happening” tourist trap.

"Hiking, there are tons of great trails in or near TO
The Janss Market place has a Dave and Busters and a regal movie theater
The Thousand Oaks mall is nice and has a AMC
Thousand Oaks Blvd has the Civic Arts Plaza (which hosts musical and theater shows)
Also on TO Blvd is the gardens of the world and I’d recommend Tarantula Hill Brewing To go and hang out with friends

Thousand Oaks has very nice weather so maybe getting into tennis, soccer, frisbee golf or what not
Lots of nice parks to eat lunch at or study at

The stagecoach in host some fun little events
During Halloween the Reign of Terror haunted houses are popular
The underwood farm is nice but you’d need a car to get to it
Eggs and things is a must to try once for breakfast 

Hope you enjoy Thousand Oaks and try In and Out when you get here it’s good and reasonably priced


Edit: also if you have a car or have friends that do then Hollywood is about an hour away with lots to do, universal studios, six flags, Knotts berry farm and Disneyland are also great but are an hour or more away from Thousand Oaks.

If it bothers you that you still have non-first class mail (aka junk/marketing mail) still being delivered to an old address.

Write a letter to each old address (include preprinted labels - Avery 8161 works great) asking them to forward any mail they may receive for you. They will need to mark out any barcodes and place the items in an USPS blue collection box so they won’t have to provide additional postage.

"I also suggest using your informed delivery account to reduce/eliminate your unwanted USPS mail - past resident, non-first class mail (aka junk mail), etc.

Examples of Non-first class mail - marketing/junk, presorted STD, presorted standard stamp, “or current resident”, EDDM/ECRWSS/ECRWSH, charity, political, non-profit

Register your address with USPS informed delivery - this service emails you daily the USPS mail/packages to be delivered (including past resident mail) and use this service to email removal request to each unwanted sender.

Google the return address - normally a companies email is found in their privacy policy. If unable to locate an email - use their websites “contact us” or “live agent”options.

“Please remove my name/address from your USPS mailing/marketing list.”

“I am receiving past resident mail and I would like this to STOP! Please remove this individual from your USPS mailing/marketing list.”

NOTE: If the mailer has the wording “or current resident” - guess what - you ARE the current resident. This is just a marketing tactic - always a current resident - the sender doesn’t have to update their mailing list. If you don’t want this mailer - remove the name/address from the senders mailing list. When you remove one name be prepared to receive the same mailer in another past resident name. Just keep removing names until the mailer stops. My record is 15 names!

"Some of my favs:

- Marmalade Cafe in Westlake Village: Food is pretty good. They occasionally have seasonals that rock (they had a pineapple upside down cake pancake that was fantastic). I also like the french toast and the chorizo and eggs. Bonus for the koi pond out back and well priced kid menu ($7 including drink)

- Eggs and Things: Good food, but the line to get in is gnarly. I'd say we drive past it 80% of the time because we don't want to wait. Biscuits and gravy are great. Also love their Florentine omelette and macadamia nut french toast.

- Le Petite Cafe in the Ventura Harbor: croissant french toast is legendary. Strong coffee, good place to relax too.

- Cactus Patch in Moorpark: haven't been there since a bit before COVID, but remember liking it being off the beaten track and having a 'yesteryear' sort of vibe.

- Chocolatine in Thousand Oaks: more of a coffee and pastry place then a full restaurant, but what they offer is pretty great.

- Crown and Anchor in Thousand Oaks: British pub with British food. Also haven't been here since the the first shutdown, but now am thinking I'm going to propose it for this weekend.

Fake it till you make it.

Just start giving yourself simple challenges: Go to a park and try various things: ""Smile at someone"". ""Say 'Hi' to someone"". Try to interact with the person dropping off your food by waving or saying hi. Join some meetup groups. Many are online, you can join with your camera off. Give yourself rewards for going out of your comfort zone. Graph it on your calendar, try to keep your streak going.

"I apologize for making a flippant joke rather than directly criticizing your naivete at not thinking people like this could be local. I've seen dudes with 14/88 tattoos or other symbols of the like. Not to mention some of the allusions made on some of the signs of the whackjobs that set up camp on the Lynn overpass for so long. Then there's always the overlap between Trumpers (which we have plenty of) or Rob McCoy fans and white nationalists. 

Also, try reading that article again, you seem to be glossing over the fine points. *One* guy was wearing a shirt of a ""white supremacist group in Southern California that operates mainly out of Orange County."" There's a difference between ""mainly"" and ""primarily"" - perhaps we witnessed the first action of the new local chapter? The sheriff's Capt. quoted in the article said ""We’re looking into trying to ID who these people are and where they’re based out of.” That direct quote says they don't yet know where they were based out of - how could the story say they were from the OC if the sheriff's department are still looking into where they are based out of. Best case scenario is that they feel this is a sympathetic area to recruit from, which is just as bad.

"I don't know if there is a specific law against shooting coyotes but I suspect you run the risk of being charged with unlawful discharge of a firearm as well as illegally carrying a firearm unless you have a CCW.  Though given the average distance at which I see most coyotes I doubt many ppl can accurately shoot a pistol that far. 

I have seen more and more coyotes in TO and Moorpark.

I've never used pepper spray on one, I suppose it would work. Be prepared to look into when you are legally allowed to do so. I bet animal rights folks would press you to prove you and your dog were in actual immediate danger instead of just scared of a coyote looking at you on a hillside.  

Coyotes attacks on adults are pretty damn rare. 

 I like to hike and bike at night  and have run into lots of them over the years. Yelling and lighting them up with a big flashlight always does the trick for me. Coyotes generally prefer smaller prey. 

Worst case scenario wrap a shirt or jacket around your hand. When the coyote attacks shove the shirt as far down its throat as possible and beat the shit out of it with your big flashlight.

"westlake

pros: good music program, sports (esp. girls tennis), nice campus, new stem building, high rate of ppl going to ""prestigious"" universities or higher education in general, the Academy for stem stuff like video game design and coding

cons: lots of rich kids but they generally aren't insufferable, cheating problem was really bad. my class from last year was the worst known cheaters the school ever faced lol. the academic pressure is really high since everyone is really smart and u feel like u have to fit in

thousand oaks

pros: ethos business program, amgen lab, less rich kid vibe than the other schools (more down to earth)

cons: drugs lol but i mean its kinda typical for all high schools just a little worse, older campus

oak park

pros: lots of tech and funding, nice new campus, band is small but getting better

cons: smaller school, way more clique feeling. the same friend group tends to stay in power all thru middle and high school. you can't take APs until sophomore year so ur kid might be behind other kids from other schools if they're the type to take those classes. also rich kid vibe

"From the petition page:

In September 2020, Rebecca Grossman while drunk driving 65 mph in a 45 mph zone hit and killed two children: Mark (11) and Jacob (8) Iskander while the two boys were on a walk with their infant siblings and parents. Westlake Village is a quiet suburb outside of Los Angeles. This family was on a quiet walk in their neighborhood when Rebecca Grossman, a ""socialite"" from Hidden Hills, who was street racing with former MLB pitcher Scott Erickson hit the two boys. Their mother attempted to save all her children but could only pull her two infants away and had to watch her two older boys die in front of her. Rebecca Grossman than kept driving with one of the boys dragging on the hood of her car for 100 ft. Rebecca then drove another 0.25 miles before her engine gave out. Police found and arrested her, but she has since been let out on a $2 million bail. Rebecca Grossman has now pled not guilty but missed 4+ court hearings in the course of the last year. The judge, Shellie Samuels has cited her ""disapproval"" but says that her ""hands are tied.""  Her next scheduled hearing is scheduled for January 7th. Let's push to spread awareness about this case and put Rebecca Grossman behind bars. Justice for the Mark and Jacob Iskander.",t2_10m4qh,alldaychris,0,1641406504.0,0,t1_hrduqyx,hrduqyx,True,alldaychris,t3_rwt6q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/thousandoaks/comments/rwt6q4/petition_to_put_drunk_driver_rebecca_grossman/,Petition to put drunk driver Rebecca Grossman behind bars,/r/thousandoaks/comments/rwt6q4/petition_to_put_drunk_driver_rebecca_grossman/hrduqyx/,16,r/thousandoaks,0,16

"PJs is a great dive bar with cheap food, cheap beer, and sometimes functional pool tables.

Sunset Terrace is extra trashy if you're into that kind of thing. Very bad pool tables. Younger crowd.

Oak & Iron is a cocktail bar where you can pay LA prices for drinks. If you want that kind of experience here, it's the place to go for it. Excellent cocktails.

Crown & Anchor has some decent British pub food and sometimes has good live music. Older crowd but fun.

Tarantula Hill has great beer, good food, and tons of children running around. Millennial crowd.

Dave & Buster's actually has some decent bar specials and can be pretty fun at night.

Not exactly night life, but Cisco's is the place to go to catch the Sunday game and have liquid (or solid) brunch.

If you really love craft beer, Bottle & Pint in Newbury Park beats just about anything else in TO. Wades Wines in Westlake Village is a better option if you have people that are more into wine, but they have a great beer cellar menu as well. The honey pretzel twists are addictive.

P&L Burgers for breakfast burritos to help with the hangover.

If you're willing to go slightly outside of TO, The Stonehaus is in Westlake Village and is a very nice place to hang out. Lots of beautiful outdoor space.

"Also, keep your children out of the creeks and streams in Thousand Oaks and surrounding areas. Study watershed maps, this includes ""armorized"" and channeled streams. Stay out!

We have an inordinate amount of pediatric cancers and a breast cancer cluster. We also have thyroid cancers in children.
There were also multiple nuclear accidents in an experimental reactor at SSFL and it did not have a containment vessel. A documentary was released a few weeks ago titled ""In the Dark of the Valley"". It has good information and portrays what we have know for decades.
Also, Thousand Oaks has a homeless problem. City tries to hide it, but we have residents (people from T.O. )'now living in arroyos and open space.

"Things Thousand Oaks California residents might find themselves doing:

1. Schedule appointments with pediatric oncology for 3 yr. old with retinal blastoma (more common in this area than one might think)

2. Help friend in Agoura with scheduling drivers to chemo treatments for squalmous cel cancer in muscle tissue. Anomaly

3. Shop for post surgery bras (mastectomy) this region along the county line is a breast cancer cluster established by state epidemiologist .  We have many ""specialty "" bra shops to choose from

4. Make appointments at wig shops for post chemo fittings- again, we have many specialty wig shops to choose from.

5.  Remind friends and others to keep kids out of creeks and streams because there is no containment at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory SSFL.  Toxins have been weeping in our watershed for decades. Rocket scientists aren't all that ""smart"" they don't know how to clean up the messes they make. 

6.  Recommend new documentary ""In the Dark of the Valley"" to people who are unaware that we live adjacent to toxic weep and fallout from multiple nuclear accidents in a non contained experimental sodium reactor.  This documentary does a good job of showing what many of us have known for decades.  Santa Susana Field Laboratory is still weeping toxins and off site contamination is not controlled 


7.  Attend YET ANOTHER meeting held by the Department of Defense and ATDSR and listen to them hem and haw for a couple more decades about how they cannot clean up weeping field laboratory

8.  Refill thyroid scrips.  Can't live without them after 2 thyroidectomy surgeries and radiation ablation due to thyroid cancer. 

9.  Attend yet another funeral for a childhood friend that grew up in the Knolls.  All four ""kids"" passed in their late 40's from unusual cancers and no family history. 

10.  Recollect, recollect, recollect all the cancer cases you have heard of over the decades and funerals you have attended.  Where did they work? Where did they play?  In the 1980s we knew of 3 families on the same block (backed up to creek) where 3 boys from 3 different families got retinal blastomas.  Ain't that something?  There was never any cleanup or remediation in the creeks near Talley Corp. in Newbury Park (another Superfund site in Conejo Valley)

11.  Again, remind young parents to keep kids out of creeks and streams.  Simi Arroyo, Calleaguas and Malibu Creek watersheds all run off Santa Susana Field Laboratory with no containment.  Keep kids safe.  Keep them out of creeks and streams

12.  Continue to puzzle over the fact that you played and swam in La Barranca with all the teens in the 80s and two of your male friends had testicular cancer in their twenties.  How odd is that?  How many more were there?  La Barranca is in Lynn Ranch.  Was Rockwell International also dumping into our playground?  Testicular cancer in 20 year olds in the 80s? Seriously... what did they do to us?

13.  Ponder how these ""secrets"" kept by all working for aerospace made a social cancer in this city.  Covering up doesn't make radiation, radio nucleides, cadmium, benzene, and other toxins ""disappear "" fifty year classifications were lifted 3 years ago.  Why won't these ""rocket scientists "" come forward and help us understand what they were doing so we can clean up?  How do they live with themselves?

14.  Cry from anger and frustration and for the suffering and lies

15.  Continue to remind young parents to keep children out of the creeks and streams.  Maybe we can prevent more pediatric cancers although wildfire and wind also cause off site contamination.  The SSFL needs to be cleaned up... keep leaning on them, the old timers who know the truth are dying and that's what they are waiting for. 

There's more.... there is much much more",t2_cihgtm5x,Batmanmijo,0,1639260580.0,0,t1_ho67zwl,ho67zwl,True,unquietwiki,t3_1vfahx,https://www.reddit.com/r/thousandoaks/comments/1vfahx/fortyseven_things_to_do_in_thousand_oaks/,"""Forty-Seven Things to Do In Thousand Oaks""",/r/thousandoaks/comments/1vfahx/fortyseven_things_to_do_in_thousand_oaks/ho67zwl/,1,r/thousandoaks,0,1
"Here's 14 things you can do in Thousand Oaks

1. -Go to chemotherapy for breast cancer

2. -Take your child to cancer center at Kaiser Woodland Hills because of retinal blastoma

3.- help friend shop for post mastectomy bras (we have a few stores that specialize)

4- meet with pediatric ophthalmologist to learn about eye prosthetic for 3 yr old

5.- attend yet another Dept of Defense /ATDSR public meeting telling us how they don't know how to clean up toxins leaking into our watershed from Santa Susana Field Laboratory 

6. - pray for neighbor's young son with non Hodkin's lymphoma 

7.- Check for Black Friday specials
 on wigs for cancer patients

8. - remind people to keep their children out of creeks and streams

9.- re-watch documentary: ""In the Dark of the Valley""

10.-Call BS on any and all ""rocket scientists"". Aerospace engineers aren't all that smart.  None of them know how to clean up the messes they make.  Fifty year classifications are off.  So are the gloves.  There is a ""reason"" this region is ""underdeveloped "" and it is not out of the goodness of peoples hearts and a ""love"" for nature.  It is because back in the 1950s and after the nuclear accidents at SSFL,  the Army Corps of Engineers enforced a ""buffer zone"" around the SSFL Santa Susana Field Laboratory.  Our ""ring of green"" is hot hot hot in some areas

11.- complete wildfire weed abatement

12. - check firehose pool pump in prep for wildfire

13. - trim trees and clean gutters so embers cannot start fires in eaves

14.- remove much of beloved landscape while ""hardening"" for next wildfire and to ease water bills which have sky rocketed due to drought and over development 

15. Take a tums before trying to drive anywhere on 101 on Saturdays because the MAGA, anti-vax, anti-mask people demonstrate every Saturday and lock up freeway.  They are organized through local Calvary evangelical church

"Also, keep your children out of the creeks and streams in Thousand Oaks and surrounding areas. Study watershed maps, this includes ""armorized"" and channeled streams. Stay out! The Simi Arroyo, Calleaguas, and Malibu Creek Watersheds run off the Santa Susana Field Laboratory SSFL which is a superfund site that they do not know how to contain or clean up.
We have an inordinate amount of pediatric cancers and a breast cancer cluster. We also have thyroid cancers in children.
There were also multiple nuclear accidents in an experimental reactor at SSFL and it did not have a containment vessel. A documentary was released a few weeks ago titled ""In the Dark of the Valley"". It has good information and portrays what we have know for decades.
Also, Thousand Oaks has a homeless problem. City tries to hide it, but we have residents (people from T.O. )'now living in arroyos and open space. Cook fires start wildfires every wind event and egress and evacuation from wildfire events is not organized. High density development on T.O. Blvd. already causes traffic issues and blocks emergency response on the ""thoroughfare"" additional development is being packed in without evacuation plans.

"Instructor will test your knowledge of turn signals, brake lights, emergency lights and windshield wipers, and possibly wheel turns and headlights prior to leaving. You'll seatbelt in and get going around the curve in the back, exiting to the right onto Avenida de Los Arboles. Usually they'll have you go down the street a bit and make a protected left at a light or a u-turn at a light, and then make a right onto Kensington and another right onto Chaucer (or some similar neighborhood road) where the instructor will ask you to perform a U-turn, a 3-point turn, and a parking job next to the sidewalk. Remember to use blinker lights for every turn and stop for any signs or pedestrians, you don't get points if you hit anyone. You'll then re-enter de Los Arboles heading West, crossing lanes to the furthest left lane, where you make an unprotected left turn back into the parking lot for the DMV, where you'll pull into the spot you started from and await your results. Be careful of the unprotected left, as the oncoming traffic towards you is coming right off the freeway and is pretty constant. Definitely be careful not to hit the curb on the way in or out, or even better not to hit the tree like one of my friends did. Watch your speed (slower is better than over) and don't forget your turn signals, and you'll be fine.

Or talk to your instructor about something random like a dog being walked, it helped my instructor pass me when I \*definitely didn't\* make the unprotected left during a red light.

"Couple of thoughts: --- FOOD (I'll stay away from mentioning big chains because they are easy enough to find) ---

* Himalayan off of TO blvd - great Nepalese/indian food. Probably my favorite eatery in the area.
* Ranch Hand BBQ - I'm not a bbq guy but this place does it for me. Great staff, quick serving times, tasty food. Its currently my family's 'go to' when we are eating out. I love the jalapeno BBQ sauce they have. Plus side is that area has a ton of food options so if you are meeting up with some picky eaters there should be at least one place they will be ok with.
* Los Dos Amigos off of TO blvd - excellent food and great place for relaxing.
* Establos meat market on TO blvd - it's a market, but they also serve fantastic food. Al pastor quesadilla is my go to there.
* Little Calf Creamery - excellent ice cream and good home cooked food.
* Dog Haus - Hipster hot dogs. Nuff said.
* Rhineland Deli - great deli
* Social Monk - noodles and stuff. Good quity, good shopping center and outdoor seats.
* Judy's Doughnuts - my favorite doughnuts in the area by far.
* Side street cafe - great breakfast spot in the middle of the industrial area. It can get crowded, but not nearly as bad as eggs n things does.

\--- THINGS TO DO ---

* Hiking - there are a lot of good trails in the area. I don't mountain bike, but I've seen a lot of bikers out there too. The main areas are probably Wildwood, the conejo valley botanical garden, & the open space off of Potrero. That said there are a bunch of small trails spread out that can be a nice escape.
* Gardens of the world - nice free stroll through gardens. Good spot for a picnic.
* DEFY- Indoor trampoline and ninja warrior type courses. I haven't actually done it myself but my kids are there all the time & I see people of all ages having fun there.
* Stone Haus - sort of an outside bar/winery. Nice gathering spot.
* CLU - Local university that has various events. Shakespeare festival in the park is pretty great when they have it. Events have been fewer in COVID times, but you can keep an eye on their events calendar
* Beaches - not in Thousand Oaks but not a bad drive. Zuma gets crowded, but if you follow the 1 north there are a bunch of small beaches off the side of the road that are often times empty. We drive that road alot and it's not uncommon to spot dolphins and other marine life on the quieter beaches.
* Ventura Harbor Village - again not in Thousand Oaks, but not a bad drive. Some good restaurants (Le petit cafe's croissant french toast is crazy good & I've never had bad dish from the Harbor Cove Cafe), shops, and a beach to chill on. Good way to spend a day.
* Camarillo Outlets are there if shopping is your thing.
* Take a train to Santa Barbara - I havent done this since the pandemic, but popping up on the train in the AM and coming back in the PM is a nice trip too.

"When I lived in Ventura, I used AT&T for internet.  I had the 1GB fiber plan, which gave me 1GB download and 1GB upload.  Then I moved to Thousand Oaks, and AT&T doesn't offer fiber out here.

"Got it! Unfortunately, I don't have any lesson plans, but it sounds like your son is on the right path! I wouldn't worry about him forgetting concepts, I've been programming for over 15 years on large-scale projects, and I often reference Stack Overflow for answers.  At some level, it's easier to know what to search for to get an answer than it is to try to retain the information.  The essentials (if statements, loops, printing text, etc.) will all come naturally, and then it's just a matter of learning the syntax for the language he enjoys writing code in the most.

I wish I had some formal course I could promote, but I don't.

"Some random ideas:

* A few years ago, [https://www.newco.foundation/](https://www.newco.foundation/) was teaching classes at night at a high school in Camarillo.  The links seem to be broken now, but you should contact them and ask about the status.
* There is a local Makerspace ( [https://cvmake.org/](https://cvmake.org/) ) that just might offer courses. (I've done some Arduino classes before, and someone else has done a few Game Development nights.) If there is enough interest, we may do other programming classes.

For general programming resources, see also [CoderDojo, Code Combat, Exercism and FreeCodeCamp](https://cvmake.org/learn/). (And I'm sure numerous subreddits). I'm self taught, so I think ""learning how to learn"" is much more important than classes. (As is motivation.  Parents want their kids to learn programming, but programming requires tens of thousands of hours of learning arcane things. Kids often aren't into that. Get them motivated, and they will research programming just like they research the lore in their favorite video game.)",t2_fptex,BraveNewCurrency,0,1626646646.0,0,t1_h5omj8p,h5omj8p,True,[deleted],t3_okitcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/thousandoaks/comments/okitcs/computer_coding_classes/,Computer Coding Classes,/r/thousandoaks/comments/okitcs/computer_coding_classes/h5omj8p/,1,r/thousandoaks,0,1

">I've never been to California, likely will visit soon.

California is the size of about 5 regular states. There are major differences up and down the coast (NorCal, SoCal, OC) and from the beach to the mountains to the inland desert.

T.O. is in Conejo Valley. The next valley over is Camarillo or Calabassas, and even they have very different vibes.

&#x200B;

>Can you tell me some general info about the area?

Because there is no ""real"" downtown, there isn't much of anything in walking distance. It's mostly strip malls (like most of California), with a few interesting places (""the Lakes""). It's not young and hip (no nightlife), but there is a great vibe because we have such an interesting mix of people. Everything from Engineers and Hollywood types to all walks of life.  


>smog

Even though it's all cars, I swear, about 10% of the cars here are Teslas, and another 20% are Priuses. No smog (check the air quality sites).

Some things to watch for:

* We did shut down schools for 2 weeks because of fires in 2018. But other than that, I can only think 1 or 2 other days where the smoke has been bad in the last \~10 years.
* There are earthquakes (nothing significant -- check the earthquake maps)
* mudslides (have closed the 101 a few miles north once)
* Rotating power outages (Not just because they don't have electricity, but because they are worried about sagging power lines starting fires. Get a Tesla Powerwall + Solar, only a few hundred bucks a month.) 
* Coyotes (occasionally see them, never heard about problems)
* Snakes (I have seen a few non-poisonous ones, but people do stumble on rattlesnakes. If you are near the vast open spaces, install a snake fence / mesh.) 

But other places have tornadoes or hurricanes or scorpions. And they don't have the massive open spaces that are a joy to hike in. Like another person said, it's hot here -- but not humid, so you don't really notice it. And in 20m you can be in Malibu, or \~1h to LA.",t2_fptex,BraveNewCurrency,0,1624750941.0,0,t1_h35ppas,h35ppas,True,Legal-Concentrate902,t3_o6raes,https://www.reddit.com/r/thousandoaks/comments/o6raes/considering_moving_to_the_area/,Considering moving to the area,/r/thousandoaks/comments/o6raes/considering_moving_to_the_area/h35ppas/,2,r/thousandoaks,0,2

Per this [site](https://www.conejovalleyguy.com/taxes/), Ventura County's sale tax rate is 7.25% and property tax rate of 1.0400%. Compared to LA County's 9.5% sales tax and 1.1063% property tax rate. While not much of a difference, your property tax in TO will be slightly lower.  Both are seen as gems in SoCal with some of the lowest crime in the country. TO routinely ranks as one of the safest cities over 100k in the nation. Both are great areas overall.",t2_5oiea,lefondler,0,1623994032.0,0,t1_h26g069,h26g069,True,[deleted],t3_o25osj,https://www.reddit.com/r/thousandoaks/comments/o25osj/is_agoura_hills_considered_more_affluent_than/,Is Agoura Hills considered more affluent than Thousand Oaks?,/r/thousandoaks/comments/o25osj/is_agoura_hills_considered_more_affluent_than/h26g069/,10,r/thousandoaks,0,10
"Perhaps, if only because Agoura is both smaller and more newly developed then TO.  In the early 80's, I think TO was pretty well established as a city, whereas Agoura was this isolated little place only accessible by the freeway.

"As nationwide nonprofit organization, Vitalant exists to help ensure a safe, dependable blood supply for all the communities we serve. Blood banking today is complex. Vitalant is licensed and inspected by the US Food and Drug Administration in much the same way as a pharmaceutical manufacturer. We provide nearly 2.5 million transfusible blood components a year to patients in approximately 1000 hospitals in 28 states.   
  
It takes considerable resources to collect, process, test, ship, and manage this lifesaving resource. We greatly appreciate the donors who join us in helping patients. It would not be possible without their generosity.   
  
We owe it to the patients who receive those transfusions to have the most expert, capable people overseeing this vital work. We believe salaries should be both competitive and appropriate to the scope and nature of our work, and we do compete with for-profit corporations for excellent employees.   
  
So how do we determine salaries? Each year, Vitalant’s human resources department reviews compensation studies of similar positions in similar size organizations, both inside and outside of health care. We also regularly retain independent outside compensation consultants to review the compensation and benefits of our key executives to ensure they are appropriate as well as competitive.    
  
Additionally, we have a review system of checks and balances that works like this: we have an independent board of trustees representing the communities and hospitals we serve. The board has a compensation committee that reviews and approves our salary programs. The board determines the salary of our president and top executives.

"I wouldn't go past the 101 @ 405 freeway towards LA, life will be much easier staying on the Thousand Oaks side of the 405.

I agree with the other person on Sherman Oaks. Anywhere in the SF Valley around there is kinda nice; Woodland Hills as well. Mostly depends on your budget.

Staying close to the freeway is a good idea only because going block to block can eat up to 20 minutes to only go 2 miles, or less. You're probably used to similar in Chicago I'd imagine.

Since you'll be driving to Thousand Oaks for work, it will be mostly a reverse commute because everyone will be going down to LA for work while you're heading up to Thousand Oaks.

"Can confirm u/behymen's comments. I lived in both Sherman Oaks/Studio City and drove to Thousand Oaks (Hampshire Road) for 3 years.

From Studio City, if you're on the road by 6:45, it's around 30-35 minutes. 45-60m if you leave after 7 then back down to 35-45m after 9:30. It's probably worst between 7:30 and 8:30. 60m during that range, possibly more if there's an accident. I'd say this happens once every week or two.

Living in Sherman Oaks will shave roughly 15-30m off your daily commute (round trip) and while it will put you further from downtown LA, it puts you close to the 405 which gives you faster access to the West Side (Santa Monica, Venice, UCLA, Malibu, beaches in general). Your drive to LA will increase but unless you're going down there A LOT, I'd probably go with Sherman Oaks.
