"Here's recent sightings:
https://newportwhales.com/whalecount.html

It's gray whale season, which means we have lots of whales out there in the water as the gray whales make the northbound leg of their annual migration. Gray whales are not thrilling to watch typically. Like they won't ever jump, and rarely even show their tails. Sometimes they stick their head out of the water to navigate by sight (called spyhopping) which is pretty cool. But if you are okay with a less show-offy whale, the gray whale migration is an important and epic annual event and you're at a perfect time for it.

The humpbacks, blues, fins, and minkes won't be here until the summer.

Dolphins are year round, though I think the Pacific White-Sided have left for the year (theyre only around in winter).

I'm pretty sure all the whale watching companies in newport are more or less the same, or at least they all share kind of the same booking software. You don't choose the boat ahead of time anyway, so I wouldn't even worry about the exact company.

One BIG tip though is do not pay full price! They 100% of the time have a discounted fare. It's not prominently on the website if you just navigate to the main page though. They're trying to get that tourism money. But here's the link to the discount page:
https://newportwhales.com/newport_beach_whale_watch_offer.html

It's literally like 50% off compared to the advertised rate. Note that the $13 or $12 or whatever the current discount is, is not the whole amount you'll pay. THere's like idk $5 more for some docking fees or whatever tacked on. Plus a lot of people tip on their way out.

"\- rent a bike and ride through the back bay (upper newport bay) which is a protected nature reserve. [https://www.newportbeachca.gov/how-do-i-/view/things-to-do/back-bay-loop-trail](https://www.newportbeachca.gov/how-do-i-/view/things-to-do/back-bay-loop-trail)

\- ride a bike from newport (on the board walk) to huntington beach (requires you go onto the pacific coast hwy briefly). stop at pacific city, a mall overlooking the ocean, and have lunch or coffee. 

\- walk from/to balboa island to / from  the newport peninsula and take the old newport ferry across the bay

\- hang out in the (rejuvenated) lido village. check out blue bottle coffee, herst coffee, crew coffee, rye goods. bear flag is a famous local fish place, as is the crab cooker nearby. there is also a bear flag at pacific city. fable and spirit is one of the best restaurants around and i'm told their cocktails are great. pizzeria mozza can also be counted on for great food and drink (this is an outpost of the famous LA mothership). 

\- staying near lido village would be in a way ideal, since you could walk to a lot of places. lido house is new and expensive, but very nice. i think they'll loan you a bike, as i've seen people riding them with their logo. balboa island is quaint and atmospheric. corona del mar village is also very walkable, and reflects a more full-time residential sensibility. i don't think there are any hotels nearby, but there may be airbnb options. easy to walk to balboa island and take the ferry across to the peninsula. 

\- ride or walk south from corona del mar village through the crystal cove state park (which is on a cliff basically above craggy beaches), arriving first at crystal cove whose history is interesting. there are vintage bungalows there that are rented out by the state a la yosemite but very hard to get into. last minute bookings are maybe worth the attention. [https://crystalcove.org/beachcottages/reserve-now/](https://crystalcove.org/beachcottages/reserve-now/). in crystal cove itself, there is a decent restaurant on the beach called the beachcomber. they have a bar too. 

further south from crystal cove is a mall with a trader joes, an aston martin dealer, some restaurants and yet another bear flag fish co. the sit down restaurants there like javier's and the mastros are kind of places to be seen. around there inland and further south of there there are trailheads and access to the el moro campgrounds. 

\- go check out laguna beach (main beach area and heisler park are pretty and have great views). many other views and a great walk along the beaches going south.

"don't think you'll offend anyone, but also don't think you'll get much advice here. 

My real input is to just be yourself. I've found around here that no one cares much as long you're a good person with no malicious intent. And in terms of ""Americanized"" I mean what's more American these days than having an ethnic background that isn't just being white?

My input for what you're actually looking for is to hit up some local surf clothing shops or head to fashion island. Don't buy anything too flashy. Get some cool brands, but nothing that screams Im buying this for the brand. Since moving here its clear that trying less is more. Get some casual ass clothes. Plain T-shirts in different somewhat muted and light colors, and whatever bottoms you want. Black jeans, board shorts, hiking shorts/pants. Grab a pair of white sneakers, flips flops/berks and casual boots. 

If being a popular influencer is your goal then follow any SoCal account on TikTok/Instagram and figure out what about them intrigues you or the people in the comments. Do what they do. I would really encourage you to immerse yourself in whatever it is you are trying to emulate or want to understand. Spend a few nights at local bars, join a volleyball league, surf lesson, join a hiking group, etc.

"Hey there I’m replying because I just did the same thing - but relocated to Boston from Newport. I posted on Reddit and people were generous to respond with tons of info.. so I will pay it forward:

1.  Newport Peninsula - long sandy beaches, lots of young professionals, dive bars, restaurants, and high-end dining. Nothing better than riding you bike down the boardwalk on a nice day. If you look for spots here try to look at 38th to 65th street (sequentially north). 20th to 38th is called the war zone because it tends to get rowdy with college houses and weekly rental properties. There are some gems tho and many people looking for short term roommates with already furnished apartments. The downsides.. commute to Newport center can vary from 12 min to 45 min depending on traffic. The parking is tough in the summer months - you will be very lucky to find a place that includes parking. 

2. East side Costa Mesa - try to look for any place within walking distance to 17th street and the back bay. It has come a long way in the last 10 years so it can be more expensive than the peninsula (even tho it’s further from the beach). Commute to NC will be 10-15 min most the year. Lots of bars and restaurants, grocery stores, gyms, etc. - more resources than peninsula. 

3. West Side Costa Mesa - cheaper. Goin through gentrification but still has another decade before it is totally refined. Some streets are better than others it’s hard to say a specific location but 19th has a lot of bars and restaurants that have opened in the last 10 years. 19th is typically the least ideal area to live. 

4. CDM - solid choice and super close to NC. It’s gonna cost you so look for rooomates. Anywhere in the flower streets is great or near the Irvine/Newport border. This is more upscale and privileged area to live, so many fancy cars and huge homes etc. lots of bars and restaurants right off pch but not like “going out” bars that would be easy to meet people. You’ll find that on the peninsula and 17th Street. If you’re trying to get your student loans paid you go to quiet women. 

5. Irvine apartment complexes - these buildings are everywhere on jamboree near NC. If you like high rise apartments with all the amenities this is your closest option. You may find it challenging to meet people and will always have to drive or Uber to decent night life spots. Typically 15-30 min from beach. 

Your price seems reasonable if you are okay with studio or roommates. May be lucky to find 1 br but market is hot.

"Warzone lol - people are dumb, they call it that because the peninsula has bars and young people and it can be loud and lively at night.

Let’s check our expectations there though: it’s not Mardi Gras every night, if you’ve lived in a college town you’re prepared for the peninsula. The nightlife noise is not a big deal at all.

I lived down there for six years while officing at Newport Center (working in finance) after graduating with my bachelors. I can’t recommend it enough for you.

Getting around on a road bike is rough - the streets to Newport Center have like 50mph speed limits and bike lanes are tiny and it’s just not an area made with biking in mind. Plus you’ll show up to work sweaty and the locker / shower amenities aren’t great… trust me, I tried it.

Peninsula + electric bike would be ideal.

"Orange County has relatively little public transportation, outside of a few bus lines (OCBus) and a few train lines that connect LA to all of Southern California. If you have a car or can have one loaned/rented to you this summer, I would do that.

With that said Fashion Island has grocery stores/anything you want & need, as long as you sublet in that complex you should be fine to walk everywhere you need to go. I would look on Craigslist/google “newport beach sublet” for a place to live, and make sure to only sublet in Fashion Island (especially not UC-Irvine) if you’re not going to have a car.

"Yea nice is relative.  The “war zone” area of the peninsula has better deals (think 30th street+) but they aren’t especially nice and you’ll be surrounded by college kids or rowdy guys working in sales (lol, but it’s true).

Closer to Hoague you’ll get some better deals with tue building adjacent to Hoague on scholl plaza having some steals.  Some of the mega developments by Irvine Co prob have some deals and are well maintained.  I think park Newport is maybe around that range.

Also closer to the our lady Queen of angels church off of Jamboree has a lot of buildings that are affordable and probably within that range.  Really beautiful area too.

Last one: check Newport heights.

Definitely try out those apps though! That way you can put them up for sale ‘in the Newport Beach area’. 

I think also you can put your work up on Amazon. I’m not sure if there’s a fee, but I do know you can be an ‘independent seller’ on there.

Thanks for the quick response and suggestions.  I'll have to check out the local Facebook and Nextdoor groups.  I didn't think of those avenues.

"If you’re looking for mostly locals, you could try nextdoor, facebook, things like that! Reddit is a good place to start, I’ve gotten 3 art pieces from redditors. 

Also, Newport has a lot of small independent stores/boutiques, I think if you ask around, you may even be able to get your work put in stores! I’m thinking specifically places like the shops on Balboa Island/Peninsula, SOCO, places like that. You may also try getting a booth at swap meets or farmers markets— there you can connect with other small business owners who may be willing to stock your work. (ETA: or just sell it on your own!)

"[Crack Shack](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-crack-shack-costa-mesa-costa-mesa-2) is a killer chicken spot in Eastside Costa Mesa (on 17th and Orange) that has a very family friendly vibe. It's on the way into Newport Beach.

[Bear Flag](https://www.yelp.com/biz/bear-flag-fish-newport-beach-2) is a must - tuna poke fish tacos and your choice of fish burrito are my favs. Use the tommy sauce. Walk across the street to Lido Village and explore the wildly expensive shopping too lol.

[Mutt Lynch's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mutt-lynchs-newport-beach) is our best beach bar, with a ton of character and surprisingly good food (the Southwest Egg Rolls... so good). Totally fine to bring kids in during the day.

[Buddha's Favorite](https://www.yelp.com/biz/buddhas-favorite-newport-beach) is my go-to sushi spot, right on the water nearby Lido Village - get reservations.

Any part of the beach between 40th and the Newport pier is good; the closer you get to the pier, the closer you are to retail amenities but also the busier it will be. Street parking with meters and without is the typical way to park. I think grabbing sandwiches from [Session's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sessions-west-coast-deli-newport-beach) and heading out onto the sand is a classic Newport afternoon.

I'm a devoted fan of [Ho Sum Bistro](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ho-sum-bistro-newport-beach) and their combo salad in particular - it's a local favorite, not particularly traditional Asian food (they call it ""Californiental"").

[Mama D's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mama-ds-italian-kitchen-newport-beach) is about the loveliest service around - a very family experience, yummy and filling Italian food.

Renting a Duffy boat is a supremely cool way to experience Newport Beach - highly recommend it if you have the time and feel comfortable piloting a small electric boat (super easy).

"Unfortunately, that is just all of southern California right now, we locked in a 3 bedroom for $3200 2 years ago, and it's only $3400 now.  Same unit was above $5k last I checked.

We still had parties and pre-games and neighbors never complained or said they heard us.  And the street parking and own parking stall is almost worth it's weight in gold compared to other complexes like Park Newport.  Units aren't the fanciest but if there is any problem, maintenance will fix that day, and the AC is a god send.  They are also replacing the carpets with linoleum wood in most units, so you could luck out and get one of those.

"Port streets growing up was probably the largest group of kids that had friendships from elementary into high school and beyond, though it is VERY keeping up with the joneses and there is no privacy.  There used to be (might still be) an email network where every little fringe activity I.e. little Johnny was seen with Susie, is reported.  It’s definitely safe though, and lots of areas of recreation.  One of my closest friends is a real estate agent and port streets always fly off the shelf. 

My family rented a house in  harbor view hills after a house fire and I liked the neighborhood, felt like mini-port streets, and right above cdm village which is great walking distance and beach right there. 

I grew up on the ridge, so first neighborhoods when you take San Joaquin drive up the hill past spy glass. They were all tract homes, so yes cookie cutter, and most did not have a view, but a decent backyard which is rare here.  If you go up higher up the hill, pelican and that area, it’s a different story. You should have an incredible view, but it’s pricey. There are some communities up there that are tract, but just depends on where you look.  

You won’t hear the planes in port streets, cdm, or newport coast, and there’s also the John Wayne noise ordinance, so no planes after 10pm, and on take off they reduce engines for noise, I currently live in Newport near the 73 and airport and it’s not bad at all. 

All things considered, depending on price point, you can’t really go wrong with the neighborhoods discussed.  East side Costa Mesa is also a very, very hot area right now, and is not at all cookie cutter (for the most part) and has 17th st.

"Super helpful. Thank you. 

My wife (who grew up in Aliso/Laguna Niguel) loves the look and feel of the port street. I see the charm - the greenbelt is always full of kids. The port street houses that are croppigmng up exponentially are a bit Cape Cod mcMansiony for my taste, but it is a charming neighborhood.

I like the CDM Harbor View Hills neighborhood, but I think we are priced out of there currently with the insane price jumps. It feels a bit more grounded and tasteful.

I guess my worry is that the NC neighborhoods are sterile, cookie cutter, and empty (literally more than figuratively). I take it from your comments the isnt the case.

We are accustomed to snootiness (prior lives in Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica), so we can handle that. Otherwise, I really like the appeal of quiet, somewhat secluded, and having a view.

Mainly though, I just want to not hear airplanes taking off.",t2_9myvv,fofolala,0,1627605232.0,0,t1_h70wpjz,h70wpjz,False,fofolala,t3_ou7xq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/newportbeach/comments/ou7xq8/beside_newport_coast_being_basically_all_gated/,"Beside Newport Coast being basically all gated, how is it different from Newport Beach proper?",/r/newportbeach/comments/ou7xq8/beside_newport_coast_being_basically_all_gated/h70wpjz/,1,r/newportbeach,0,1
"Newport coast is basically all family. When the shopping center was put in around 2000, the area exploded and housing was snatched up. Newport Coast is way quieter and sits atop the hill, but Newport Beach proper has all of the neighborhoods I.e. CdM, Eastbluff, etc. it’s really all about preference and where you can find a good deal. All schools are phenomenal, but Newport Coast you might see some more snooty folks than other areas, essentially “new money” type of atmosphere.  I lived in Newport Coast my entire childhood and then moved down the hill in my teen years in Newport Beach proper.  Loved both areas, as a kid, growing up in a gated neighborhood with young families meant I had kids my age I could make lifelong friends with.  Older neighborhoods are quieter but don’t offer much for children.

"Newport Beach Peninsula area is the best combo of price and location in OC.  Great area, really fun, right on the water, you can find some good deals.  That said the quality of the apartments are all over the place but skew negative.  People are willing to pay up for the location at the expense apartment quality (many of them look like crack dens).  Also very fratty if that’s the vibe you’re looking for.  But you can find some great deals and being on the water is pretty amazing.

I’m at Villas Fashion Island (Irvine co apartments).  Really upscale, lots of natural light, massive windows, etc. Well maintained and finishing and amenities are among the best in oc.  Has like 5 pools , a gym, parking, and close to Whole Foods.  Might be stretching your budget (I think $3500 for a 1 bed 1 bath is the cheapest unit here, but usually not available) but would recommend you check it out!

"Rent is crazy right now, unless you find somewhere that is privately owned, you might be hard pressed to find a month to month or sub 1 year lease.

I live in an Irvine Company complex in Newport Beach and love everything about it.  Amazing facilities, lots of parking, incredible maintenance, and most importantly AC.  I would highly recommend an Irvine Company complex, they are throughout Orange County.

If you are working on 17th St, you could also do Peninsula, which I know some do 9 month leases, and clear you out at the summer for 3 months.  It's right down the street from 17th st, and also an incredible place for a 23 year old to be, thats where all of the bars are and where you will find yourself most weekends.

I would check out craigslist as well, but real estate right now, including rent, is the insane.  Ive lived here all my life sans college, and since being back, it's unreal.

"Balboa Saloon is a great dive bar, have a patio open to now.  Make your way down the peninsula on bikes, it's worth stopping into Blackie's, Mutts if the line isn't astronomical, Cassidy's burger and beers during the afternoon.  If you want a fun bar right next to Balboa Pier, Cruisers is really fun and they have a big patio open as well as the round bar inside, great day drinking spot.  NY style pizza is right next to the ferry and the fun zone, nothing fancy but have giant slices that were always a hit in the summers.  If you wanna do a nicer dinner with your friends, Shorebird is nice and on the harbor and wont break the bank but a nicer atmosphere than the bars. Tupelo Junction is also an awesome hidden little gem, also a little bit nicer atmosphere and than the bars, and sit down place.

Everything is walking distance, but highly recommend bikes, can take the boardwalk all the way down to where you need to go, it stops right where the bars pretty much stop.

"Parking situation is always tough but if you park early and don’t move your car til after sunset you should be alright. 

There’s no surf at the balboa pier only shorbreak for skimboarders but if you go down to the wedge or next to the wedge is called cylinders and it’s mostly body boarders. Or next to the Newport pier is called blackies and usually has fun small waves all day. Only surfboards are blackballed you can body board or body surf anywhere anytime 😊 
 
So many good restaurants on the peninsula try them all depending what your in the mood for. Walking distance from the pier you have great mex for tacos and Mint Leaf Thai. I’d recommend trying Helmsman as well but it’s by the Newport pier. Classic dive bar is Blackies by the sea but youl see lots of other cool bars. I love dori deli right by the Newport pier. Always a chill vibe with lots of locals. 
 
I recommend renting electric bikes or even regular bikes depending on your budget so you don’t have to worry about parking and can get everywhere to surf and eat easily.",t2_9k70w3ty,Shreddreds,0,1620173192.0,0,t1_gwytgyi,gwytgyi,True,[deleted],t3_n51320,https://www.reddit.com/r/newportbeach/comments/n51320/stuff_around_balboa_pier_area/,Stuff around Balboa Pier Area,/r/newportbeach/comments/n51320/stuff_around_balboa_pier_area/gwytgyi/,3,r/newportbeach,0,3

"When I'm talking about ""diversity"", I'm talking about diversity in all aspects. Things like race, ethnicity, religious preference, social class, national point of origin, and political beliefs (and the variety present among these categories within a city's citizens).

To say I'm only talking about one's skin color would be immensely discrediting what I posted above earlier. I'm not denying that Newport Beach is a diverse city. Like I said, when you compare it to other parts of the country it definitely stands out in many regards.

But the point I was making in my comments was in *comparing* Newport Beach to Irvine. I'm not saying Newport Beach lacks diversity. I'm saying that **Newport Beach contains less diversity than Irvine**. That's it.

"Oh and one last thing:

* Politically, Newport is pretty hard conservative/republican. Irvine is more mixed but tilts stronger to the left.
* Religiously, Newport is extremely Christian. They vary in denominations, but overall it's just Christianity. Irvine on the other hand has everything. I had friends that were Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Morman.

This isn't to say everyone in these cities are this way. Just from my perspective, this is how it felt/looked.

Irvine people definitely feel much more welcoming to those of different religions and personal practices though.

"Glad to hear it helped! Keep in mind this is all coming from one perspective and I'm completely biased from my own experience ;)

To hit on your three points

1. Completely valid! My old neighbor has been commuting from Irvine to NB every day for 20+ years and still does to this day. Though I believe he leaves pretty early in the morning so he misses the freeway traffic. Definitely gets pretty bad between 8 and 10AM, and horrid between 5-7PM. Would be something I'm sure would be nice to avoid lol

2. Another valid point! The beach lifestyle is super fun, and damn is it beautiful there. The coastal air is unbeatable as well. Though I will say, many people in Irvine have highly active beach lives! Once you live in SoCal for awhile, a 20 min drive feels like nothing. Summers back in high school I'd be going to the beach 2-3 times a week. (There's even an isolated bike trail that goes from the tip of Irvine all the way to CDM. Look up the Irvine Mountains to Sea Trail) Also, Irvine is close enough to the beach that it pretty much always remains cool. It only truly gets bad during the 2-3 heatwaves that can pop up during the summer. But the weather overall stays pretty temperate and crisp year-round, especially November-May.

3. I totally see your concern. I do believe statistically that Asians are Irvine's majority ethnicity now. Though if you do want your child to be exposed to different cultures and grow up in a well-rounded area, I'm going to fully not recommend Newport Beach. After going to school there for 9 years and then start High School in Irvine, I personally sort of experienced a culture shock. Newport Beach is really really white. Like... really white. Irvine on the other hand has EVERYTHING. When I attended Woodbridge HS, I'd roughly estimate the student population as this: Asian 35%, Caucasian/European: 30%, Arab/Indian/Hispanic: 30%, African-American/Other: 5% (this could totally be wrong, but is what it felt like to me)

Irvine definitely has pockets that are much more of an Asian bubble, **ESPECIALLY in those newer neighborhoods**. But the older parts of the city are extremely diverse. Literally one of my favorite parts of growing up there. (And this translates to food. The best food is in Irvine hehe)

You will still see some hardcore Asian culture though. Many of my friends had the stereotypical Tiger Moms and summers spent in SAT/ACT prep classes. In one of my AP English classes, we even read parts of *Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother* hahahaha

But I will say it doesn't translate all that much to the culture of the kids/students. Irvine kids sorta develop their own culture for being such a diverse crowd + living in the bubble that is Irvine. We all sorta experience the same pressures of being/becoming successful, but you'll get that in any city that's known for its school system. In my experience, it was more collaborative than competitive. We always had each other's backs. Though I myself am 100% white and sometimes would notice some of my Asian friends having a bit more competitiveness amongst themselves.

Again though, this was pressure stemming from their parents. Simply communicating with your children about how they're feeling with school and finding that balance with them will help them immensely.

All in all, if you want to live and raise your child in a diverse and cultured community, Irvine wins that battle every time. No question about it.

Oooo and NAC! The letters stand for Newport Aquatic Center. It's a boathouse that if you purchase a membership you get access to things like kayaks, paddleboards, canoes, and rowing shells you can take out into the back bay and balboa area. They also have a gym (though it's pretty small), showers, a recreation room, and clubs/classes for adults and kids! I actually joined their high school rowing program and rowed competitively for two years (even when I went to school in Irvine, I still couldn't leave Newport lol). Almost went to college doing that. NAC is one of the top high school rowing programs in the nation. Really fun place and awesome community there!

"Hey! Thanks so much for this response. It was incredibly helpful. You hit a lot of points I've been contemplating. The main reasons I was leaning towards NB over Irvine are mainly three. 1. My new job is actually in NB so it would be a shorter commute, 2. My wife and I love the beach and coastal weather in general, and 3. This one may be controversial but I am an asian-american and I have often heard that Irvine is a huge asian bubble. I would like my child to be cultured and well-rounded and i worry about that. I also want him to have an amazing education with good opportunities and I have also heard Irvine schools are amazing for that which is why I am torn.

"Grew up in Irvine, but went to a private school in Newport for nearly half my life so practically lived there. I have friends who lived all throughout Newport, and Dover Shores definitely was the standout.

In terms of letting your kids have a social life, the port streets suffer from suburbanization quite intensely so you're gonna need to be driving them EVERYWHERE till they get a license. Same goes for east bluffs. This means it's gonna be harder to give them the healthy tastes of independence that's so important to receive as you grow up.

Dover Shores has the NAC right down the street, some great shops and restaurants biking/skateboarding distance away, and still a short distance to the beach.

I will say though, definitely look into the culture of NB if you haven't already. It's a VERY different experience being raised in Newport Beach than it is in Irvine. If I were a parent I would feel much more comfortable raising my kids in Irvine over NB (not in terms of safety, but in terms of what values the cities naturally feed into those raised there). Of course, I'm biased, but I do feel like I've lived in both cities simultaneously and have a good grasp of what each area has to offer.

Irvine of course isn't perfect, and I'm not too sure what your reasons were for favoring NB over it, but if you were looking at the newer parts of the city I don't blame you. New Irvine (Portola, Great Park, some parts of Northwood) is awful (pretty much everything northeast of the 5 freeway). These areas suffer from the suburbanization I mentioned the port streets had, but waaaaaaay worse. The newer you get, the more of a ghost town it becomes. 0 culture, 0 community.

HOWEVER, older Irvine is freaking fantastic. I grew up in Woodbridge (went to high school here, but K-8 in NB) and loved every single inch of it. The community is super active, and there's tons of stuff to do for all ages up through high school. The same holds true for the University HS and Irvine HS areas. Irvine is also super safe and in my opinion, has much much much better schools than Newport. I feel so incredibly blessed to have been able to have the childhood I did there and seriously recommend giving it another look if you didn't go through those areas.

"one can quibble about one school over another (although I would note that Anderson, which you have to live in the Port Streets to attend, is definitely among the best), but I don't think there is any question but that the port streets are the most family-oriented of all NB neighborhoods.  The HOA is the only one I am aware of, for example, that allows basketball hoops on the streets, and you will see more squads of kids playing on the streets than other neighborhoods.  The neighborhood was designed with very few through streets, so that with the exception of the loop street, there is very little car traffic (and zero cut-through traffic).   At a few minutes before 8am, the green park belt is packed with kids walking and riding their bikes and scooters to school from home, which is pretty unique to the Port Streets.  The vast majority of the kids participate in the neighborhood swim teams (which in turn are feeders for Junior Guards, competitive collegiate programs, etc, if your kids take to it).  

True, the original houses were built in the 60s/70s but about half have been replaced by now so there are newer choices if you prefer (and can afford the price tags!). 

If you are looking for more diversity, Port Streets may not be your thing.

Newport mesa (mariners and kaiser's districting zones) is by far the best areas for families.

He told me he got a drink from the bartender away from his group and the bartender spiked his drink. He felt really dizzy. Then some girl tried to sell him.

Finally he asked her to please leave him alone and she SLAPPED HIS CROWN LOOSE! It was a Hispanic or Tan white girl with brown hair.

Dear Friends:
Being a family-run business we have to quickly adapt to the changes life brings to us. Due to these changes, we’ve made the decision to take some time off to reorganize. As of  Monday September 28th, the Picante Martin’s you all know and love will be closing permanently on Balboa island. While we’re excited about the opportunities that await us in the future, it is with sadness that we say good-bye for now. The past 22 years have been marked by both challenges and triumphs, and we will cherish the many friendships we've made along the way. We’ll always be grateful for the opportunity to provide the best service and Mexican food to our locals and visitors alike. Although we won’t be on the island, we hope to be serving the Newport Beach community in a different capacity and under the same name of Picante Martin’s when the time is right. Stay tuned for updates to come, check our Facebook and Yelp pages. Again, we thank you for the many positive memories we’ve had with you all on Balboa Island. Our family looks forward to serving your family in the near future.

P.S. We'd love it if you came to visit us one more time on the island! You probably have lots of questions, but we don't have solid answers yet. But rest assured you'll be the first to know of our return. Please keep questions at a minimum to our staff members, thanks! 
Sincerely,

Picante Martin’s Mexican Restaurant Family",t2_10x8k2qq,pickled_ricks,0,1601353345.0,0,t1_g71309t,g71309t,False,Spacey_Tracey,t3_j1ni0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/newportbeach/comments/j1ni0d/billys_at_the_beach_secret_mai_tai_mix_recipe/,Billy’s at the Beach Secret Mai Tai Mix Recipe,/r/newportbeach/comments/j1ni0d/billys_at_the_beach_secret_mai_tai_mix_recipe/g71309t/,3,r/newportbeach,0,3

"Yes. This was just emailed to all the parents. 

Dear Newport-Mesa staff and parents,

On July 14, 2020 the Newport-Mesa Unified School District Board of Education approved a 3-Level Plan for Re-opening the 2020-21 school year. The Board previously approved a Parent Choice - Virtual Learning 100% option for the 2020-2021 school year. 

3-Level Plan for Re-Opening Schools (Eng and Spanish)

3-Level Plan for Re-opening Schools for the 2020-21 School Year

The District will be prepared to shift between the following learning models throughout the school year. The District will determine the level for all students, based on state, county and local health department guidance, orders and/or local conditions at the time. Alternatively, parents have the choice of a 100% Virtual Learning School option instead.

Level 1 -100%  In-person 

Used if the State of California moves to Stage 4 and Orange County and local conditions support instruction without the need for social distancing.

Level 2 - Elementary (TK-6) - Full Day “Max 16” Model* 

Students on campus all day (except Wednesdays)
In-person classroom instruction up to maximum capacity (16)* with social distancing - half day (morning or afternoon)
On-campus extended learning - half day (morning or afternoon); with parent opt-out option
Wednesdays - half day morning - all students/half day afternoon - teacher professional development 
Inclement weather/air quality day - In-person classroom - half day only. No on-campus extended learning offered
Students receiving Special Education (Special Day Classes) services will be full days except Wednesday half day
*Maximum capacity may vary slightly due to classroom size.

Secondary (7-12) - To be determined

While district staff was prepared to present the Level 2 instructional model for secondary students, it is being revised and anticipated to be presented to the Board of Education at a special board meeting tentatively set for Tuesday, July 21. Being a special meeting (not regularly scheduled) an agenda for this meeting will be posted on the District Agenda Webpage at least one day prior to the meeting.
School bus transportation will be limited for elementary and secondary schools. Available space will prioritize students with special needs. Other criteria for limited space will be determined by need and distance. Face coverings will be required for all passengers.

 Level 3 - 100% Distance Learning 

Used if a Stay-at-Home order is issued by state, county or local health officials.

NMUSD will prepare for all three levels and confirmation of the level for the start of the school year will be determined approximately two weeks prior to the first day of the school on August 24 (August 12 for Early College High School). Reopening will be based on state, county and local health department guidance and/or orders and local conditions at the time.

Parents/guardians will be provided with additional information on the approved models above and the parent Choice Virtual Learning option. 

100% Virtual Learning Option

Within the next week or two, all parents will receive an Intent to Participate notice to indicate their preference to have their student in the parent Choice Virtual Learning 100% or the 3-level plan described above. This information is critical for district staff and principals to prepare schedules and staffing for the start of the school year. 

 Further details of reopening guidelines will be provided throughout the summer and at the August 4, 2020 Board Meeting.

We are thinking about moving to Newport Beach once I am finished with this project. And this may be a weird place to ask in this subreddit but I will try.

I have an elementary aged daughter and we are thinking of going the private school route (like Carden Hall). What are your opinions on the school systems there? And have they announced how they are going to re-open eventually (via online or smaller class sizes for spacing, etc)??

How does closing a beach make sense? I can’t wrap my mind around this one. When I go to the beach I always keep like 20 feet away from another group. People have always socially distanced at the beach. You need to reduce the number of people on the beach? Close the parking lots not the beach. Now they say you can use the beach for active recreation but not sunbathing. What!? How is sunbathing more virus spreading than jogging or walking?

"Went to CDM and it was pretty fun. There’s of course a bunch of spoiled teens driving range rovers everywhere, but overall it was a good experience as far as high school goes. Newport is a pretty good place to be a teenager.

Although COVID has gotten in the way of these things, there’s usually a lot of places to go: the beach, peninsula, balboa, or some rich kid’s pool house. It’s a pretty stereotypical high school experience but not necessarily in a bad way. 

I will say though that after high school it’s kind of a bummer. Most everyone goes away to school and doesn’t come back because it’s so expensive to live there, especially in your 20s. So unless you go to OCC there’s hardly anyone between the age of 18-25 there.

From my experience at least, bars have some young people, but most people are 25+. So my advice is to enjoy it while you can, but I’d definitely recommend going to college outside of Orange County. Aside from Fullerton and Chapman there’s not much of a young adult demographic.",t2_146ifm,watchyourback9,0,1589439870.0,0,t1_fqky6yo,fqky6yo,True,freyrino,t3_gj9p4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/newportbeach/comments/gj9p4i/whats_it_like_to_live_in_newport/,Whats it like to live in Newport?,/r/newportbeach/comments/gj9p4i/whats_it_like_to_live_in_newport/fqky6yo/,2,r/newportbeach,0,2
"By calling it “pretty clean” and “pretty nice” it shows that you truly grew up here.

It’s beyond nice and more along the lines of pristine lol, literally the city standards and ordinances keep the area in tip top shape. Plenty to do! Known for being a town of wealthy people!

"Learn how to drive! Even if you don't get to drive around your own car, make sure you get your license. 

Life as an OC teen is great (from my recollection...) most schools are big enough that you will find some friends to click with as people break into smaller cliques. Most people are pretty nice. There was no bullying or hazing at my school like you hear about on the news. Just people that are into what they are into. 

If you like movies there are tons of theaters and you can see stuff from all around the world. Same with food choices- lots of international cuisine and of course In N Out. 

If you like outdoors stuff you can surf, swim and hike pretty often. Plenty of sports too. We had lacrosse, water polo, golf and tennis at my school beyond all the standard stuff. 

If you have other interests like music, video games, politics, religion, science, theater, art, etc, there are always groups of people you can find that share your interests.

That said, the bars and clubs around here seem pretty strict about anyone under age and will clip your fake if they sense anything suspicious and especially if you look young. No one I really knew went to bars under the age of 18 because its alot easier to spot a 16 year old around 21+ than where you are from where its 18+. You will stand out alot more.

"My answer to my own question is a hard yes. There are many benefits to roundabouts that America has unfortunately not appreciated:

· They are statistically proven to be much safer, for example Washington State found that replacing intersections with roundabouts led to a 37% drop in collisions, 40% in pedestrian collisions, and a 90% (NINETY PERCENT!!!) drop in fatality collisions. It is safer because it is also a relatively low speed inside the roundabout, around 20 miles an hour, and always at an angle unlike traffic lights where head-on collisions are frequent.

Source for statistics: (https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Safety/roundabouts/benefits.htm)

· They are also statistically proven to be faster and are very good at easing congestion. In a city like Irvine where congestion is a growing problem, roundabouts are a great way to cope with increasing traffic.

·They are easier on the city budget, because a roundabout is a one-time installation of concrete and paint whereas setting up a traffic signal requires traffic lights, annual electricity costs, and more.

·More aesthetically pleasing.

I realize there might be ambivalence to roundabouts because they are unfamiliar but that's no reason to say no to them. Most countries in the world use this as their intersection of choice already, and there's no reason why America shouldn't be any different.",t2_2socwm4r,yusefudattebayo,0,1588462634.0,0,t1_fpb5o12,fpb5o12,True,[deleted],t3_gcgd1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/newportbeach/comments/gcgd1e/would_you_want_more_roundabouts_in_newport_beach/,Would you want more roundabouts in Newport Beach?,/r/newportbeach/comments/gcgd1e/would_you_want_more_roundabouts_in_newport_beach/fpb5o12/,3,r/newportbeach,0,3
