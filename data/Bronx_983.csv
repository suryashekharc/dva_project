"Bronx families impacted by the devastating fire almost two months ago that claimed the lives of 17 residents will continue to receive meal assistance thanks to a new partnership, Mayor Eric Adams announced Saturday.

Culturally-sensitive meals have been delivered to those affected by the Jan. 9 blaze through the work of World Central Kitchen and The Hoodspitality Group; the latter taking over until the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City and the NYS Latino Restaurant, Bar & Lounge Association were ready.

Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson secured the help of The Hoodspitality Group until the new city partnership could be established after the World Central Kitchen pivoted focus to helping Ukrainian refugees, the mayor's office explained.

""Knowing that you don‚Äôt have to worry about where your next meal is going to come from can make your entire day, and these New Yorkers can trust that their city has their backs. New York stands ready to give impacted families all the support they need,"" Adams said in a statement.

All 17 victims of the fire, many from The Gambia, died of smoke inhalation. Authorities say a malfunctioning electric space heater started the blaze, and a door left open allowed smoke to spread throughout the building.",t2_jl0fv75c,BronxIsNow,0,1646618781.0,0,t1_hzni0d1,hzni0d1,True,BronxIsNow,t3_t8egkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/bronx/comments/t8egkb/nyc_extends_meal_delivery_services_for_victims_of/,NYC Extends Meal Delivery Services for Victims of Bronx Apartment Fire,/r/bronx/comments/t8egkb/nyc_extends_meal_delivery_services_for_victims_of/hzni0d1/,2,r/bronx,0,2
"Police say they arrested a man in East Harlem for a racial assault on his neighbor, and the instigating incident could be at least his fourth in the building.

Marlon Carr allegedly made racist remarks and punched an Asian resident in his building Sunday morning following a dispute, according to details provided by police.

The arrest brought at least three other alleged incidents to light.

The building's manager said that Carr spit on him and harassed him in January. Two other residents also said Carr used bigoted language and harassed them.

&#x200B;

  
A New York City foster mother and her husband are facing a litany of sex trafficking charges after authorities alleged they forced a series of young women into prostitution - including two girls who had been placed in the woman's care.  


&#x200B;

  
Sharice and Kareem Mitchell allegedly trafficked eight women between 2018 and this month, forcing them into sex acts in cars and hotels throughout the city.  


&#x200B;

  
‚ÄúSex traffickers target the most vulnerable New Yorkers, including ‚Äì far too often ‚Äì young New Yorkers in the child welfare system,‚Äù Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs alleged, instead of providing a safe home, this husband and wife forced eight young women to engage in prostitution.""  


&#x200B;

  
Prosecutors allege Sharice Mitchell lied on her application to be a foster parent, indicating her sex offender husband didn't live with her, when in fact he did. (Kareem Mitchell was convicted in 2008 on federal charges of transporting a minor for prostitution.)  


&#x200B;

  
""Two of the eight survivors were women who had been placed in (her) care as young adults,"" the Manhattan DA's office said.

&#x200B;

"There are programs to help home owners with an increase of property taxes due to public investment, there isn't protection for renters. We aren't looking to displace either. When Bloomberg's calculation of an AMI included all boroughs, the Bronx was the worst hit with rent increases that weren't reflective of the areas AMI. Rent stabilization is being stripped by knowledgeable and crafty landlords as people move out and those apartments stay vacant for over a year, and the unit becomes destabilized, eventually causing the building to lose its stabilization status.

While the issue of pollution is citywide, and BQE has a dedicated group seeking changes to it (Schumer did meet with them last year!) the Cross Bronx was selected as it addresses the below grade portions. Where the grade changes, elevated and at-grade portions, it gets trickier. And we never claimed that the CBE is the main driver of asthma, we realize there are many contributing factors, but it surely is a factor, and one that can be addressed through capping/decking. 

We are Bronx based, and solely deal with issues in our borough. There are plenty of CBOs throughout NYC working on solutions in their respective boroughs. Tip of the hat to them all - this is grueling work! 

The Bruckner is another challenge, and there is a firm working on a green solution to at least help mitigate pollution on the lower level.

"Around the Table: Stories of the Foods We Love
June 4‚ÄìSeptember 11, 2022
The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) invites artists living and working in the Bronx to submit proposals for designs to be featured on tables to be displayed publicly throughout the Garden grounds for visitor use during an upcoming exhibition entitled Around the Table, on view from June 4‚ÄìSeptember 11, 2022.
Around the Table will focus on the cultural, horticultural, scientific, and historical significance of food and edible plants. Food is at the center of life‚Äôs most important events and cultural practices. When we gather together for a meal, the dishes we share tell a story‚Äîand we share a bit of ourselves. From global dietary staples such as rice, beans, squash, and corn to the regional spice and flavor provided by peppers, greens, and more, plants are at the base of all food traditions. Around the Table will examine the social and cultural importance of plants and food to our identity and interactions through an indoor-outdoor display of plants, art, and scientific stories. As a centerpiece of the exhibition, visitors will be invited to gather at artist-designed tables set throughout our 250 acres that tell the stories of the foods we love.",t2_jl0fv75c,BronxIsNow,0,1644634015.0,0,t1_hwlehqh,hwlehqh,True,Biophiliaplantaholic,t3_sjgv9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/bronx/comments/sjgv9c/nybg_call_for_bronx_artists_to_design_tables_for/,NYBG call for Bronx artists to design tables for this years exhibit ‚ÄúAround the Table: Stories of the Foods We Love‚Äù,/r/bronx/comments/sjgv9c/nybg_call_for_bronx_artists_to_design_tables_for/hwlehqh/,2,r/bronx,0,2

"I've lived near Parkchester for 47 years. There have always been white folks here. A market rate building is coming to Tremont and White Plains Rd, it has been in the works for years now. That investment is due to the upcoming Van Nest/Parkchester Metro North station. There is also a push to have landmark the Parkchester buildings which will surely raise property values, and rents, as they are not rent stabilized. We have been working on a campaign to #CapTheCrossBronx and seeking ways to ensure that policies are put in place to NOT displace those living along the CBE once it is transformed. The lower corridor in Mott Haven has seen the most gentrification, rents are between 3k - 4k, clearly not for geared for Bronxites who currently reside in that area, as it is the poorest Congressional district.

"The Bronx Botanical Garden has a The Master Composter Certificate Program as part of the NYC Compost Project (part of DSNY) if you have time to complete it. I know someone that took part of the program and ended up working with grow NYC afterwards.

https://www.nybg.org/gardens/bronx-green-up/nyc-compost-project/

The project also has a lot of other composting programs and information, like food scrap drop off sites.

Depending on where you live, grow NYC also has some compost drop off sites in the West Bronx (definitely not enough though). I use them where I live and find it very useful since they also pair with a local community garden that hands out free veggies.
https://www.grownyc.org/compost

That said, try to connect with a local community garden in your area as they may do composting too.

"Partly due to zoning as many of these areas are zoned for Industrial business even though they've become more residential. Probably also due to shop owners that don't want to relocate their business or are waiting for a buyout from a developer or the city.

The Jerome Avenue area has one of the largest concentrations of automotive businesses in the city, rivaling the former ‚ÄúIron Triangle‚Äù in Willets Point, Queens. Former because the problem was solved in Queens.

Jerome Ave also has some of the highest asthma rates because of the amount of auto shops, gas stations, and traffic that passes through there but has several schools, churches, bustops / subway stops along that route.

There was a recent rezoning change for Jerome Ave to reduce auto shops in the area and incentivize them to move closer to their customers (e.g, New Jersey, Westchester, etc.). But like I mentioned above, shop owners are reluctant to move and none have taken part of the $1.5 million dollar grant the city has set aside for relocation. I suspect it's because they want developers to pay them more to move which hurts the community. The research shows emissions are higher near these types of businesses and that the health impacts are not just for asthma but for an increase in pre-mature births and certain types of childhood cancers.

Some advocacy groups are looking to highlight this (i.e. the environmental justice impacts) next year since most residents in the parts of the Bronx close to Manhattan don't own a car but there are a high number of auto body shops in those communities.",t2_smvrt,nomindbody,0,1640921436.0,0,t1_hqmyciv,hqmyciv,True,TeamDTC,t3_rs8w4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/bronx/comments/rs8w4r/why_are_there_so_many_auto_shops_in_the_bronx/,Why are there so many auto shops in the Bronx?,/r/bronx/comments/rs8w4r/why_are_there_so_many_auto_shops_in_the_bronx/hqmyciv/,7,r/bronx,0,7

"**[The Bronx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx)** 
 
 >The Bronx () is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Bronx County, in the U.S. state of New York. It is south of Westchester County; north and east of the New York City borough of Manhattan, across the Harlem River; and north of the New York City borough of Queens, across the East River. The Bronx has a land area of 42 square miles (109 km2) and a population of 1,472,654 in the 2020 census. If each borough were ranked as a city, the Bronx would rank as the ninth-most-populous in the U.S. Of the five boroughs, it has the fourth-largest area, fourth-highest population, and third-highest population density.

"Just some backstory.  
So, I work at one company of many in the [Hunts Point Market ](https://huntspointproducemkt.com) in the South Bronx, NY.  And I have a produce route myself.  
I shot this video real fast while walking between my truck and the store where I purchase a lot of my stuff.  
This is relatively slow compared to the previous day (Sunday night for Monday of thanksgiving week) where we can do almost double this amount of volume.  This video was shot at about 1 am on a Tuesday morning before thanksgiving. 
If you live around NYC, there is a good chance that some of your produce on your table has come through this market.   The trucks from here go as far north as Albany, NY, and Boston, MA daily and as far south as Maryland and west as Harrisburg Pennsylvania on the regular.
