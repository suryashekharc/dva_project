"Del Amo parking lot has two, maybe 3, free chargers outside of Macy's. Same with the Whole Foods in Torrance. I think there's a couple at the shopping center down by 190th in front of HomeGoods. Also, the Starbucks just before the Galleria Mall has a free charger. There's a couple free ones in Hermosa at the supermarket at the top of pier and a couple over by the Lazy Acres Market, also in Hermosa. There's also two free chargers at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in Pedro. 

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure I'm forgetting a few. They're all level two chargers so they take a little bit to do significant charging, but will definitely top you off on little day to day errands",t2_82qwl,ThatCreep,0,1647813428.0,0,t1_i1gfi1t,i1gfi1t,True,nelli135,t3_tits0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBayLA/comments/tits0r/free_charging_station_for_tesla/,Free Charging Station For Tesla,/r/SouthBayLA/comments/tits0r/free_charging_station_for_tesla/i1gfi1t/,14,r/SouthBayLA,0,14

"I wasn't the one downvoting you. I was playing The Outer Worlds.

Now I am though. I like how your surprised your bad take is getting downvoted by over a dozen people.

Also, you're acting like theft doesn't automatically become a felony at a certain value threshhold.

And that's another thing, it's BETTER that they are using e-bikes and not normal bikes because normal bike theft usually is these ""non-violent crimes of opportunity"" that you are glorifying for some insane reason.

People stealing e-bikes could be professional thieves. Like the people who hit my ex-girlfriend's house. I will admit, in order to get you half mast today, that I prefer cops go after professional thieves over homeless thieves. Like the people who managed to lift my dad's truck without ever starting it and the people who went through my ex's house and got everything of value and left all the lame shit lesser thieves might take.

And no, let's not call it lazy police work compared to setting up speed traps and parking tickets. Believe me, the beach cities police gets MUCH lazier. And I will always prefer them do theft stings over actual lazy work such as ""non-violent"" traffic citations.

It's pretty simple. Don't steal shit. Full stop. Blows my mind a single word has to be spoken on the matter.

">Giving folks a permanent criminal record over a bike is a step too far, imho.

Ehhh, a lot of people I've worked with use electric (or otherwise expensive) bikes to get to work.  Getting it stolen would be a huge blow to their lives so in that regard, I think the punishment should be severe.  If it were a victimless crime, I'd be with you, but this ain't that.

It doesn't seem like a bait bike sting op would be overly expensive or resource intensive for Hermosa cops to conduct - you only really need a couple bikes and a couple cops.  The optics and headlines are intentional - if thieves get the impression that Hermosa is a risky place to steal shit from, they'll hopefully fuck off to a different city.  It probably wouldn't necessarily decrease the crime rate in general, but it seems like a good way to decrease it in Hermosa specifically.

"Because you can avoid being caught by not stealing the bike. And don't try to twist the logic in 'crime is inevitable because of income inequality' I'm fuckin holding my head above water in this fuckin city as it tries to drown me in debt and push me into homelessness and not ONCE have I thought about theft as the solution.

The millisecond theft becomes the solution to you, you have fucked up. And you void all respect from other citizens, INCLUDING LOWER CLASS CITIZENS AROUND YOU.

Because, I'll say it again, wealthy people don't give a shit. They'll just replace what's stolen. So who does theft affect the MOST? Me, who had my bike stolen as a kid and had to use my skateboard to get everywhere. My dad, who had his truck stolen and because of finances it was agreed that he would drive my moms car and I would 'sell' my mom my car for a low price. Again, screwing me over in the long run.

"Quick Google Search - SummerWood & Elegante look more like apts. If you have kids, not much place to play unless you walk to a Park. Both have parks within a block or so. SummerWind is more like Condo. Shared walls but attached garage, and a more home-style living, not apt. High School wise, we have 4, and South, West, Torrance, and North are probably the preferred ranking. I'm curious what the price difference is between Wind vs Wood & Elegante.

Annie Chui at the Derm institute in Redondo is a competent dermatologist. She was able to get my wife’s acne all clear fairly quickly. I don’t say she’s great tho because she’s very much into selling a lot of expensive treatments and products in addition to normal dermatology stuff.

"Yeah, Torrance is very, very different from DTLA.

Given that most people get around LA County by car anyway, being close to a lot of stuff is nice. The other thing that I believe prevents more young people from living in Torrance is the fact that it has a lot of larger, single-family homes which are both too large and too expensive for young, single people.

"NIMBY's what a silly remark. Instead of blindly supporting developers, think along the lines of impact on an area where people live or transit. For example the approval of the massive complex on Lomita Blvd and Crenshaw. That tremendous sized project will lclog the living hell out of an already very busy intersection. The developer will walk away having done little or nothing to improve traffic flow or congestion to the area. Remember developers have a number one goal ... minimize costs not profits first. Part of that formula is an avoidance of any major infrastructure requirements. 200 units are a lot of people and automobiles, just to start with. There is no problem holding developers to a high standard. Remember once gone they will not be living there .... ever. Thus unless major malfeasance or code violations they will never be back.

It’s really only easy to find them if you are following one truck or looking at the schedule for a known location, like a brewery. They are pretty rare in the wild. Food carts even more so. I know of zero food carts. 

Recommendation: if you can’t find a truck, get takeout anywhere on PCH in Redondo, drive a few blocks west, sit on the esplanade wall, and enjoy. Lots of good stuff on PCH between, say, garnet and prospect. Especially if you have an older person that doesn’t walk too well, or it’s cold, and you want to eat in the car . You can park with a view of the ocean down at Torrance beach and there are also a few spots with an ocean view in the Redondo pier garage, top level, just south of kincaids. And a short walk to a fresh churro there, too. Or maybe some oysters. The birria taco place near old Tony’s is worth trying too.",t2_k90yl,arrr_carlson,0,1645678216.0,0,t1_hy77qmo,hy77qmo,True,keenonkyrgyzstan,t3_szy58j,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBayLA/comments/szy58j/where_to_find_food_trucks_in_the_south_bay/,Where to find food trucks in the South Bay?,/r/SouthBayLA/comments/szy58j/where_to_find_food_trucks_in_the_south_bay/hy77qmo/,7,r/SouthBayLA,0,7

"Pch is a bit further away from Sharkeez, if it was that main plaza area, at night it gets busy and with the bars and general beach area night life, people can get rowdy rushing to cross, as well as drivers trying to get around it or looking to park. To me it definitely doesn't sound like the full story, and not knowing your daughter or her friends' age, but seems they might be keeping somethings in order to avoid trouble, from my own experience growing up that was the only times I would hide things from my parents. Really though the police report might clear most things up but considering the driver was let go doesn't sound like they had any strong evidence to keep them.

"That is a good point. I know that with the masters swimming workouts, the way it works is that there are several lanes for people to choose to work out in, where the lanes are split based off your swimming speed. Depending on the day, workouts can work on things like endurance to technique, which is good for those who have done lap swimming in the past, and just want a community to workout with. Note that for the clubs I’ve mentioned, their workouts are in the very early mornings. It’s tough to get in the water that early, but it will definitely keep you more awake and alert through the day than your morning coffee or tea. 

That being said, if you are in the camp of having taken swim classes in the past, but would feel less comfortable with swimming in open water with currents or rip tides, then you may want to look into classes instead. I know that the Torrance Plunge has classes you can find below:

https://www.torranceca.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/70803/637728459807839953

Another good place would be your local YMCA, or to go to the city of Manhattan Beach site to see what adult classes are offered.

"[“Even though the Measure is a great piece of policy, once it passes there is still a great deal of work to be done. For instance, the City Government needs to implement the Measure. Most importantly for the City Council, they can and should develop, and place on the ballot an effective tax regime for cannabis businesses. For that task, the City Council has our full support.  To demonstrate, in March 2020, we helped the City of El Monte pass Measure PC, a cannabis tax to provide funding to public safety, parks, recreation, and youth programs, with over 71 percent of the vote. And in November 2020, we helped the City of Pomona pass Measure PO to protect high quality cannabis regulations similar to, but not quite as stringent as The Redondo Beach Cannabis Regulation & Public Safety Measure against watered down regulations backed by others in the cannabis industry. We look forward to achieving something similar in Redondo Beach and working with the City Council to do so.”](https://easyreadernews.com/sandbox-clearing-the-smoke/)",t2_97duk1yx,Sadishist,0,1644919404.0,0,t1_hx0ogbk,hx0ogbk,False,Sadishist,t3_ss7kz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBayLA/comments/ss7kz6/hermosa_beach_cannabis_petition_sign_our_petition/,Hermosa Beach - Cannabis Petition - Sign Our Petition To Bring Cannabis To Hermosa Beach,/r/SouthBayLA/comments/ss7kz6/hermosa_beach_cannabis_petition_sign_our_petition/hx0ogbk/,1,r/SouthBayLA,0,1

"Insane is right. Everything I list in this price range sells for 20% more. Everything my clients buy in this price range requires that same kind of offer. 

You gotta just suck it up and understand that the only thing about this market that will substantively change is the interest rates. PRICES WILL CONTINUE TO GO UP and some people will have missed the boat and priced out of x,y,z neighborhood forever... or until a crash years in the future.

There are just too many millennials getting married and having kids... competing with boomers who are downsizing. These people ""have to"" buy. 

I bought a house in Hollywood Riviera 15% over asking price last year.... and almost any similar home going up for sale climbs in price over the last one. I feel like I have made 25% equity and I have not even owned the house 9 months! Same thing with all my Buyers over the last few years. EQUITY!

Unfortunately, people rarely respond or take up any of the offers to meet up.

I'm a pretty quiet guy, but am really friendly once acquainted. I live in Manhattan and work in Redondo, I'd love to meet up sometime and hang out!

"Not really…. $500,000 in 1990 was about a million dollars today. A substantial down payment of 20% is only $100,000. Pops worked at Northrop and Raytheon, so that $100k figure really isn’t that unattainable after a few years salaried. Grab a 30 year mortgage, pay it like it’s a 15 year, and then they just watched the thing skyrocket. 

So if it was worth $1 million in today’s money when they bought it, it’s now worth over $4 million 26 years later. 

They were dirt fucking poor, but thanks for projecting that on them and making wild assumptions? It was just possible to put yourself through private university working a minimum wage job back then (LMU, manager at McDonald’s; paid their own tuition and left with 0 debt)

"I can vouch for Smackfest beach volleyball lessons being a great way to meet people. I did 3 rounds of it, met people all the way from recent grads to 40s, but if I was to make a rough estimate I'd say average 27 on a bell curve skewing younger. Bill (the owner) does a great job ensuring everyone is included, and everyone is pretty much going through the same thing as you and are shy on the first day. Go at your own pace but ideally try and get some numbers over the course of the lessons to start a group chat for setting up games outside of class, and go from there. At least that's what I did, met a ton of great people! Like everything you'll get out of it what you make if it. Oh and everyone goes to the bar together after, so make sure to bring your ID!

Feel free to DM me, but I don't check reddit much so don't be offended if it takes a while for me to respond :)

We lucked out that part of my wife’s relocation package included a realtor that would show us different places and advise what would be best.

There will always be someone living above you or below you in the Southbay unless you own or rent your own home.

My recommendation... look for standalone structures or smaller buildings like triplexes. If something like a triplex or duplex, if the unit is on the ground floor, make sure no one lives above you. For these smaller buildings, I've noticed many of them do not have listings online, so drive around and take notes of any for rent signs you see.

"Yes, I can. The people you see living in tents under the freeway are at the very rock bottom; they are there largely because of mental illness and substance addiction issues. These are not people who just can’t *afford* housing—even if they had the money for it, they wouldn’t be spending it on housing. Making housing more affordable would not solve the pervasive mental health and drug issues that are keeping these people on the streets. 

The people who simply can’t afford housing but are healthy, and willing and able to work are doing other things to survive. They are are taking on longer commutes to be able to live in an area they can afford. They are living in their cars and showering at the gym. They’re sleeping in shelters while they get back on their feet. Those are the people that affordable housing would benefit. They are NOT putting up a tent and keeping all of their possessions in a shopping cart.

It’s not that housing prices and the sort of homelessness where people are living in tents under the freeway aren’t problems, they’re just not directly related to each other. Affordable housing may help solve some issues relating to some people who currently identify as homeless, but it’s not going to do a thing to reduce the number of people living on the streets in tents.

"My wife and I used Atlas Van Lines when we moved here from Chicago, and they were a great full service mover. It really took a huge load off our shoulders not having to worry about packing or unpacking. They did a really good job protecting our stuff. It’s definitely not the cheapest way to move, but it is probably the easiest.

One things about Atlas is that it’s basically a franchise, so you’ll deal with two different offices: one in Michigan and the second one in Torrance/LA. However, I didn’t have any issues with that. Most of your dealings will be with the Michigan office. Anyway, I highly recommend them or a company like them based on my experience. Good luck!

Oh yeah, one thing I’ll mention is that if you have TVs without the original boxes, you should probably just sell them in Michigan and buy new ones if you don’t want to move it yourself. Atlas insisted on having a box and actually constructed on since we didn’t have ours. I think a 75” TV added like $500 to the cost of the move. Given how fast TVs depreciate, it probably doesn’t make sense to pay to have a box constructed for it to be moved.",t2_858u7,gotamd,0,1644058156.0,0,t1_hvoo71w,hvoo71w,True,roxter1988,t3_sks5cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBayLA/comments/sks5cs/moving_from_michigan_to_torrance/,Moving from Michigan to Torrance,/r/SouthBayLA/comments/sks5cs/moving_from_michigan_to_torrance/hvoo71w/,3,r/SouthBayLA,0,3

In terms of Taiwanese bakeries, I personally prefer JJ bakery over 85C.

For Japanese bakeries, I like Croissants du Tokyo inside the big Tokyo Central on Artesia.

There aren't a lot of Korean bakeries in the area (RIP Redondo Paris Baguette) but I can't help but grab a few items from Tous les Jours whenever I'm in H-Mart, they're pretty solid IMO. I like their blueberry yogurt mousse cake.

There's a lot of Filipino bakeries in Carson but my experience is limited to Red Ribbon so I can't say for sure which is the best there.",t2_2czd5ssc,_cheeseball,0,1643918278.0,0,t1_hvgpnqx,hvgpnqx,True,bigfatmuscles,t3_sjre39,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBayLA/comments/sjre39/best_asian_bakery/,Best Asian bakery?,/r/SouthBayLA/comments/sjre39/best_asian_bakery/hvgpnqx/,28,r/SouthBayLA,0,28

https://www.dailybreeze.com/2021/10/15/torrance-could-cut-5-from-city-departments-if-2022-sales-tax-doesnt-pass

The city has started sending mailers highlighting all of the things that will happen if the measure doesn't pass. The mailers highlight things like increased ambulance response times, unmaintained roads with potholes, closing libraries, etc:

https://www.torranceca.gov/government/city-departments/finance/maintain-essential-city-services

One of the things the city is threatening is fewer police officers for the Torrance PD.

WHAT ONE THING HAS TO DO WITH THE OTHER: The ""fewer police officers"" portion of the plea is a very poor justification considering the current and relatively recent track record of Torrance police.

The Torrance PD killed Christopher DeAndre Mitchell:

Torrance police officers exchanged racist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic texts, which resulted in dismissal of 85 criminal cases and puts nearly 1,400 in jeopardy.  Also, the state AG is investigating the department for those texts:
