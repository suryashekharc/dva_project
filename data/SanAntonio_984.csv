"I used to date the Director of Community Services for a large Texas city.  I'm not sure of SA laws but I assume they are similar.  Noise is almost impossible to enforce.  The law was 85 DB measured with a NIST calibrated device.  It had to be measured A weighted and averaged.  Then it had to be consistent over a defined period of time (5 minutes).  Low bass sound was the real complaint and A weighting does not measure below 500 hz. Music and theatre bass is 10-50 hz. Higher frequency sound is easily trapped and muted.  A 20 hz sound wave is about 55 feet long and practically impossible to trap.  That's why you hear the bass and not the lyrics blocks away. 

Basically unless you pled guilty to the fine you would get off every time.  They eventually had the health department out for days on end trying to catch a few high profile noise violators. Made the news several times.   Was all a wasted effort.",t2_91lam93x,sohaltang40,0,1648266005.0,0,t1_i25j9ku,i25j9ku,True,AuDBallingIt,t3_toezhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/toezhl/do_hoas_do_anything_about_noise/,do HOAs do anything about noise?,/r/sanantonio/comments/toezhl/do_hoas_do_anything_about_noise/i25j9ku/,1,r/sanantonio,0,1

The Flambeau parade as well as the Battle of Flowers are best enjoyed from a chair in a dedicated area, but you can just bring your own snd walk the parade route until you find a spot. Do this WELL ahead of start time! Like at least two hours! 

Also, buying the tickets isn‚Äôt so bad, they are usually under $10 each, and all the groups of seats are fundraisers for different groups around town, lots of churches, scout troops, veterans groups, etc. so the money goes to a good cause of your choice.

"When I looked up this claim, I found sources saying that there was disagreement at the time between the revolutionaries over whether it was about returning to the Mexican constitution of 1824 (which I presume is the constitution you‚Äôre talking about) or gaining independence. 

Regardless, the two situations are so different that they‚Äôre practically incomparable in this context. 

But the Ukrainians didn‚Äôt just declare independence and the Russians aren‚Äôt just maintaining what is already their territory. This is not a fight for independence, it‚Äôs the resistance of a foreign invasion.

Also, the Ukrainians‚Äô reasons for fighting aren‚Äôt as morally complex or muddled as the revolutionaries‚Äô were. The fighting between Russia and Ukraine has nothing to do with taxes and tariffs, immigration policy, or slavery, all of which were important issues for the Texan revolution. Like I said before, Ukraine is fighting back an invading and conquering force. (This is not to say that the Ukraine situation isn‚Äôt complicated at all, but specifically the reasons that Ukrainians are fighting aren‚Äôt.)

"Im a member here and will likely cancel soon. It is not a lifting gym. Its full of 18 year old sarm goblins. There are frequently no collars anywhere in the gym. Weights are not reracked ever. 

Its a crapshoot if the gym will have hot water. The boards in the sauna are not fastened to the floor. The locker room smells like butt all the time. Last week one of the showers had a softball sized lump of pubic hair in it. 

My biggest complaint is they shut down 4/8 squat racks for an exercise class during the busiest time of the day. Most of the people who participate in the class are gym employees. This is also where all the collars go.

"I lived there from 2008 until early 2021. Inside 410 can be sketch, especially the further in you go. The Lackland Terrace neighborhood is at the intersection and is made of homes from when Lackland was being built. It's a generational mix living there now and you can tell the older and younger families apart pretty easily.  Going South towards 90 tends to get nasty once you reach the Military/90 intersection. The Westward Townhomes (2600 Westward) are known in the area for their extremely high crime. The strip that La Corona night club is in was recently redone and presents itself well, quite a contrast from the rest of the neighborhood.

On the North side of Marbach you have a mix of homes built from the 60's to the late 90's. San Antonio Event Center was a major thing that had monthly gun shows. Now it's a used furniture store. Habitat Home Center is there as well and is a regular stop for us. Golden Wok moved nearby from their old location where Hong Kong Harbor is to next to IHOP. The Door Christian Fellowship just opened their own mini mega church in the area as well. The neighborhood largely backs up against 151 and Tom Slick Park. SWRI staff and alumni can tell you more about that.

John Jay High School, home of the Ref Tacklers, also makes Marbach home. It's also known for producing the most teen pregnancies. Apparently they have a good STEM program but I'd never let my kids go there. Going further down takes you to Military Drive. You'll find Walgreens, DQ,, La Fiesta and various other places and restaurants around here. Marbach Manor is also in the area and was redone about 16 years ago. It's better than it was but still not very recommended.

If that happens thousands of times over worldwide, that's a big deal. So no it won't bring back anyone's loved ones but to say that it won't help or is pointless is simply false.

"I can absolutely understand that frustration. There's plenty here at home that is wrong and unjust. We have so many crises in this country they can become hard to keep up with. Homelessness, lack of health care, lack of living wage, voter suppression..the list goes on and on. I'm frustrated with those things too. However those are conversations and battles that are completely separate from this. Right now there are children with bombs rained down on them. Civilians being deliberately murdered, and an entire country's freedom at stake. I'm not advocating sending troops, although I can't say I'd be against it at a certain point. What I am advocating is awareness. If we lend a helping hand be it by sending weapons so these people can defend themselves or by humanitarian efforts it's the right thing to do in my eyes. 

You're absolutely right, we have problems at home that need to be addressed, but just being tired of getting involved with other countries problems isn't going to fix them. You can't win every battle, things can't change overnight. I'd suggest finding out what you're really passionate about and finding out what you can do to help. Focus your energy there.

"Barely related I know, but it's interesting that these test tracks used to be all over and now they no longer exist.

The equivalent high speed test track in Tokyo was called the Yatabe Test Track and it was open to the public in later years, where it was a major gathering spot for the legendary street racing team ""The Midnight Club"" because of it's high banked corners where you could test cars above 100mph for long period (30+ minutes was not possible even for a lot high end cars at the time). They would use it to test out custom aerodynamics, high speed suspensions, and a lot of custom oil cooling, since factory cars would overheat or handle badly when doing long distance highway racing for hours at a time.

Southwest research (SwRI) has a similar track you can see from culebra road. I used to work there about 10 years ago and they would periodically post the high mileage cars for sale.
