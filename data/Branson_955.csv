"It was agreed upon by anyone who signs up. We don’t take every single order that is given to us. We can *decline* orders as much as we want until we find an order that is worth our time. Which I why I said on my original post that people might experience extended wait times on an order that includes very little to no tip. 

You are billed more because once the delivery is over 10 miles, they add an extra 50¢ to a dollar on the base pay. 

There has been a lot of backlash against DoorDash for their lack of base pay, including with the higher gas prices. We aren’t begging for tips, but logically tipping culture is already dumb as it is. Just like how you tip a waiter or waitress when they barely make $5/hour sometimes around here. I make enough if I accept a good delivery.

"$2.50 per delivery. Average time per delivery is 20 to 30 minutes. So you agreed to $5 per hour in your own vehicle as a courier. Sounds like poor job choice and even poorer financial decisions.  

And if you only get $2.50 per delivery why are we billed more for delivery that is further from home. As per the door dash website further deliveries and more desirable deliveries pay more since the base rate is higher.   https://dasher.doordash.com/en-us/pay

There website even says tips are optional. 

Sounds like your getting screwed out of your pay and need to change jobs or renegotiate your pay per delivery. And not beg for tips.

No we are not. DoorDash only pays us $2.50 per delivery. Tips are what help us make ANY money. Especially if your house or hotel or apartment is farther away from the restaurant you want delivered.

"Let's go with No.

Now I will explain why.

If it was free delivery with purchase of food. Like pizza used to be. Then that was an employee for a company doing company delivery in their personal vehicle and they only get there hourly rate as an employee with no compensation for fuel or wear and tear* (2 brothers and ex-wife were delivery drivers for the Hut) so a small tip is suggested since they also make the food box and deliver it.

Doordash, Uber, and Lift all have a charge for the delivery service. This charge is anywhere from $6 to $25. This is the payment for delivery of an item. Same as FedEx, UPS or USPS. You don't tip them since the fee to deliver is their payment.  Dashers using ther personal vehicle is a business decision they make when they start as they are couriers for a business.  

Tldr: No, they are self employed couriers who are paid with the fee charge for delivery.",t2_7sijwtl3,Twiz-CM,0,1647299563.0,0,t1_i0ohx5j,i0ohx5j,True,LoganJn,t3_tdq5h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bransonmo/comments/tdq5h7/just_an_fyi_tip_your_doordashers/,"Just an FYI, TIP YOUR DOORDASHERS",/r/bransonmo/comments/tdq5h7/just_an_fyi_tip_your_doordashers/i0ohx5j/,-4,r/bransonmo,0,-4

"Years ago I worked at a place that was time share adjacent for a month. Each sales person - men and women - had their own patter, particular methods, verbal and physical tricks to close a deal. One of the biggest tricks I saw was getting people to figure up their vacation expenses, including travel, and compare that number to time share if you spread it out over years. Completely manipulative.

I remember one guy who told me a gimmick he used that actually worked one time. He had the buyer worn down but wouldn’t finish. So he put his hand across the table for a handshake. Didn’t say a word for over 5 minutes. Responded to any question with a look toward his hand. Sure enough, the guy eventually just shook his hand and closed the deal.

Timeshare is objectively a financial rip off. Any benefits of exclusivity that may have existed decades ago with time share are long gone. But I have met people who love their time share. And far more people feel trapped in their time share and constantly regret the decision. There are multiple law offices in town dedicated to helping people find legal options for getting rid of their time share.",t2_x6ad4,WrittenByNick,0,1646499812.0,0,t1_hzgy0ix,hzgy0ix,False,Samantha_316,t3_t6tngh,https://www.reddit.com/r/bransonmo/comments/t6tngh/is_save_on_branson_legit_worth_it_to_go_through/,Is “Save on Branson” legit?

"It is legit, you will save some money. But pretty much every ticket discount in town is a front to get you on a time share pitch. The heavy discounts are on particular shows, and you will have to sit through a hard core sales pitch for generally 90-120 minutes. It is not fun, and no matter how much you know you won’t buy… I’ve seen it happen again and again. They are pros, good at selling and ruthless.

Some people love their time share once they buy in. Most people realize later that it’s a waste of money, a significant ongoing cost, the things they were promised don’t materialize. If you truly did want the “ownership experience” of timeshare, buy one on the secondary market. There are literally thousands of people that can’t give away their timeshare because of the ongoing annual maintenance fees. You are required to pay whether you use it or not, and they can and will go up.

Otherwise look for individual coupons for the shows you want to see.

"Here is my list, it may or may not fit your preferences....

Aquarium at the boardwalk, I think this is super fun for younger kids because you can do it in a couple hours

Wonders of Wildlife museum and aquarium inside the Bass Pro shops in Springfield Missouri which is an hour north.  Don't do this and the aquarium at the boardwalk as they're very similar.  this one takes more time and works if they have a longer attention span 

WonderWorks... it reminds me of the museum in St Louis 

we had a lot of fun at beyond the lens, there's a lot of digital stuff with that one but all of our kids have cell phones also a random section on serial killers which might be inappropriate for younger kids

 Mini golf is huge for whatever reason in Branson, there's indoor if the weather's bad and there is outdoor if the weather is nice 

silver Dollar City

Sight and sound theater is super popular... and that's doing the Jesus production this year

Shopping at Tanger or the landing 

Arcades ....around here there's a couple at the landing, Branson Meadows 1984 kind of a retro vibe, the track

So without that connection, it’s unlikely the project will ever get completed, IMO, at least not until growth (which has slowed significantly) makes it necessary.

The KY3 article above indicates that the state owns the right-of-way. The Taney County GIS might expose that, but if you look on satellite view, it’s pretty obvious that it would basically follow the course of Fall Creek down to Taneycomo and then likely cross the lake and meet up with the 165 right-of-way back to 65.

There was even talk of extending the city limits themselves to adopt in those who were effectively 'in Branson' using it's services, but not participating in the city's taxes.

"Not an expert, but if you’re in the county (Taney) and not inside city limits you can generally do whatever you want. For better or worse. I built an extension on my home and the county required a general work permit to know what I was doing to the existing structure for tax purposes. That’s it. No inspections at all. Inside Branson city limits is a different story.

The downside to zero oversight - your neighbors can do whatever they want, too. There’s a little distance, but next neighbor Over 
has multiple vehicles in the front yard - some running, some not. They run a sewer drain directly out into the woods , no septic. In theory I could call the Department of Natural Resources on them, but I don’t know if they would do anything about it.

"Pretty great trip overall. I'm going to list the things that we did and places we ended up going to eat in case others come across and are asking the same. 

We arrived Friday night and drove straight to Papa Grand's Pizza Buffet. That whole area was pretty cool and has a lot to do. The pizza buffet was very similar to a Cici's buffet, but with better pizza and better quality options across the board. I enjoyed the food and the low cost, but my wife thought the pizza was bland. We are from Louisiana so we are used to lots of flavor.

We drove to our hotel (Branson Tower) and unpacked. I would definitely recommend the hotel. It mostly far exceeded our expectations. I found a great price ($197 total for 3 nights) and didn't expect much. The hotel was decently nice and clean, the rooms were clean, the pool house was nice and warm considering how cold it was at night, and most of the staff were welcoming. There was one lady that was doing the breakfast Saturday and Sunday and working the front desk Monday that was rude and had a very careless look on her face at all times. The breakfast was mediocre, which was expected from a cheaper hotel.

Saturday, we did a lot of riding around and sight seeing. We drove all around Table Rock lake, to the dam, thru the Big Cedar Lodge area, and to SDC just to check it out since it was closed. This led us to the Talking Rocks Cavern, which we were going to just check out and MAYBE buy a ticket. We were letting our 2 year old play outside and the guy came out to tell us that there was a tour about to head in if we were buying a ticket. We bought our tickets and headed in only to realize that it wasn't just a cave that we were going to walk in for a few minutes and walk out. It is actually a door inside the shop that opens up straight to the cavern, which goes pretty far down underneath. So I had to pack my 2 year old in my arms and backpack on my back all down those tight stairs and squeeze thru those tight places they have all the way down and back up. But the tour was amazing and definitely worth the money and I would highly recommend it to anyone. You will probably get a little wet and it can be a workout if your packing a kid or packing heavy. There's also tons of activities to do on the property.

Afterwards, we decided to drive to the Landing and check it out since my pregnant wife was starving to death. She ate at Oscar's Famous Ribs and said it was some of the best BBQ she's ever had. We went and checked out Dicks 5 & 10, which had some really cheap shirts and hats we bought. They have tons of really awesome stuff to spend all your money on. Afterwards, we walked down to the Landing and walked up and down there for a little bit. We were tired and went back to the hotel to swim for the rest of the evening.

Sunday morning, we slept in a little bit. We decided to do the Top of the Rock tour. This is definitely a must-do, as everyone else says. It can get a little pricey ($80 for us both) but you get some spectacular views plus access to the museum. I'm not really big into museums, but WOW the Ancient Ozarks Natural History Museum is amazing. It's HUGE and has so many native American artifacts and so much history in there. I would have never thought I would go to that but I'm so glad we did. I would have never paid separately for it, so I'm thankful it is included in the ticket. This all took up most of the day, so afterwards we went to eat at Botanos Premier Mexican restaurant. The food here was pretty good.

Overall, it was a great weekend getaway and a good trip. Sucks that 75% of everything is closed due to off-season, but we knew that when we decided to take the trip. Thank you all for providing suggestions and advice. I wish we would have had a few more days and been there during open season to check more stuff out, but we will be back one day.",t2_xbkgi,justinf72,0,1643734049.0,0,t1_hv5hvez,hv5hvez,True,justinf72,t3_se4igq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bransonmo/comments/se4igq/best_attractionsshowsmom_and_pop_restaurants_for/,Best attractions/shows/mom and pop restaurants for this weekend,/r/bransonmo/comments/se4igq/best_attractionsshowsmom_and_pop_restaurants_for/hv5hvez/,1,r/bransonmo,0,1

Billy Bobs is often the first place we hit when we get to Branson...great burgers, excellent onion rings and the shakes are beyond yummy!  Their fried pies are also amazing!

Definitely wander around the Landing and visit Dicks 5 & 10, even if you are not big shoppers!  Plenty of sights and sounds to keep a toddler busy and entertained down there.  We went to the Titanic Museum a few years back because my husband was interested and we both enjoyed it immensely.",t2_4alsal1p,Manic_Murderino,0,1643375116.0,0,t1_huksnnu,huksnnu,True,justinf72,t3_se4igq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bransonmo/comments/se4igq/best_attractionsshowsmom_and_pop_restaurants_for/,Best attractions/shows/mom and pop restaurants for this weekend,/r/bransonmo/comments/se4igq/best_attractionsshowsmom_and_pop_restaurants_for/huksnnu/,4,r/bransonmo,0,4

"I don't think I've been in January/February before, but I know around Christmas time, there's a lot of places closed.  I'd guess it's pretty quiet this time of year.

I've heard Farmhouse is good, everyone loves Billy Bobs, but honestly, I wasn't terribly impressed.  Not a ton of flavor - now, the shakes? Yeah, you need one of those.  Florentina's is a great italian place.  We love it there, hit that up most visits.  Hurts Donut is fun if you haven't been there before and aren't on any type of diet.  I liked LandShark restaurant in the landing, but the people I was with weren't too impressed.  We tried to get in Paula Dean's and Guy's on the landing, but had no luck.  Line was too long.  Honestly, with littles, we haven't done a ton of restaurant eating the last couple years so I'm drawing a blank.  Grand Country Inn has a great breakfast buffet - I've heard lunch and dinner aren't as good.  They have these little waffles with melted butter and syrup that are to die for!

The Aquarium is pretty fun, our kids love that.  Wonderworks is another place that's pretty fun too.  Both are a little on the pricey side though.  I know the hatchery is only open certain days, not sure if it's open on the weekend, may want to research that before trying to do that.  I've done Titanic with just my wife and it's very neat, not sure how fun it would be with a 2 year old though.

The Landing is a fun place to go walk around.  There's a fountain going on in the middle of it.  Bass Pro is fun to walk around with the big fish tank for the kids to see.  On the almost opposite end of the landing is Andy B's bowling alley (with restaurant and arcade) and across from that is a huge arcade.  If your kid is a Paw Patrol fan, there's a Paw Patrol game that our kids love playing.

We haven't ventured to any of the shows with our littles yet.  Not sure if SDC is open or not right now either.",t2_32lycl36,pdelassus,0,1643315328.0,0,t1_huhjmtp,huhjmtp,True,justinf72,t3_se4igq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bransonmo/comments/se4igq/best_attractionsshowsmom_and_pop_restaurants_for/,Best attractions/shows/mom and pop restaurants for this weekend,/r/bransonmo/comments/se4igq/best_attractionsshowsmom_and_pop_restaurants_for/huhjmtp/,7,r/bransonmo,0,7
"Are you wanting to stick to riding IN Branson?  There's not much gravel available there...as it's all paved and riding on the roads can be tricky with the tourist traffic that time of year.  There is a lakeside mixed-use path by Table Rock Dam and several MTB trails at Table Rock State park.  I wouldn't ride my gravel bike on the MTB trails.

If you're looking for a day of gravel, I'd suggest the Glade Top National Forest Scenic Byway which is about an hour east of Branson.  It's 23-miles one way in isolated US forestland with just a few homes so little chance of dog troubles.

Alternatively, you could hit up the Frisco Highline Trail that runs from Springfield to Bolivar.  It's a 35-mile rail trail that has a lot of old bridges and is close enough to towns for refueling as needed.",t2_3zbao,Cold417,0,1643248688.0,0,t1_hudrf43,hudrf43,True,Hopkinspd,t3_sdmipo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bransonmo/comments/sdmipo/cycling_in_branson_area/,Cycling in Branson Area,/r/bransonmo/comments/sdmipo/cycling_in_branson_area/hudrf43/,4,r/bransonmo,0,4

"Internet outside of general small cities and towns in the area will be hit or miss.

All of your outdoor activities are widely available here. Busiek State Forest is well known for outdoor shooting. Plenty of dirt bike options as well, and great trails all around.

Depending on how far you go down into NW Arkansas, the Rogers / Bentonville area is considerably nicer and more expensive, depending on your budget and goals. Southwest Missouri is a bit notorious for not having traditional neighborhoods or good vs bad areas outside of cities and towns.

"Our 4 year old loved it. The rides, lights, and just getting to be outside. Our 2 year old has yet to go but loves being outside as well. The lights and parade alone are incredible. We rented a scooter for my mom. (Lots of walking and hills.) 2 and under are free. If you can go on Thursday, which is the least busy day, you can by a ticket at a price cutter store for $50.

Most shows in Branson let 2 and under in free. Some even let 12 and under in free. We love the Branson Belle, Hamners, Dolly's Stampede and The Haygoods. Wonderworks is hours of fun and a great price. The train is fun for kids as well and the Landing has Santa. You can drive through the lights at several places at a great price. We take the kids out and let them sit in laps to look at drive though light displays. Even if you don't go to the stampede you can take the girls by to see the horses.

"Between January 7th & March 1st all the shopping stores at Tanger & Landing, and most touristy shopping places you mentioned are open (but with almost no tourists in town). Hotels normally have their lowest prices of the year.

That said, it's so slow that a number of hotels actually close during the offseason so while you will get a good deal on a room in town it may not be as good a deal as you might expect since the ones that are staying open are compensated by the lower amount of competition. 

As long as you are not interested in shows or attractions, touristy activities which do almost universally close during the winter--that's your best bet.  

If you prefer not to come in the dead of winter or do still want to partake in some touristy activities, April is good--any time after spring break & before schools start letting out. That is the 2nd slowest time of year.  3rd slowest would have been the last half of September/First half of October. After schools open but before the fall crowds really kick in.

"Hello fellow upload fiend!

So I work in video production, live in Branson area, and regularly upload several gigs worth of files at a time. Bad news: anywhere outside of the immediate town is going to be rough for Internet options. I’m 15 miles out from work and my only option is Centurylink DSL at 20 down / 1.5 up. Yes you read that correctly, 1.5 up. It’s brutal. I have to go to the office for any significant uploads, where Suddenlink cable Internet gets 20 up. I believe they have higher tier plans that get 35 up for residential, and 50 for commercial. 

But what you really want is Centurylink fiber in town, 940 symmetrical up and down. I don’t have personal experience with it, and I’m not sure of the coverage map. If you need significant upload speeds, that’s your best option by far. While I curse Centurylink as a company, all would be forgiven if I had 940 up. 

Since I’m out in the boonies with no options, I’ve been on the waiting list for Starlink from SpaceX. There are no other satellite Internet providers I would even consider, and while Starlink won’t give me crazy upload speeds (20 I think is about average) it is miles ahead of where I am now. 20 up is usable for most of my stuff, and I’d only need to go to the office once or twice a week at that point.",t2_x6ad4,WrittenByNick,0,1635645435.0,0,t1_hiptd13,hiptd13,True,RualStorge,t3_qj2gbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bransonmo/comments/qj2gbo/seeking_info_on_internet_providers_areas_near/,Seeking Info on Internet Providers / Areas Near Branson MO,/r/bransonmo/comments/qj2gbo/seeking_info_on_internet_providers_areas_near/hiptd13/,1,r/bransonmo,0,1

"Thank you :) that's what I was seeing in a lot of what I could find. For typical home use 20 Mbps is probably more than like 95% of people need.

Sadly my job I end up uploading a lot of really big files regularly (we're talking multiple GB of files a day is something that happens every few months, several hundred MB per day pretty much daily)

So for example I'm at 1Gbps down and up where I am now. (A tech hub) I don't actually need that fast (though it's REALLY nice) I'd probably want 100 Mbps up or more ideally. Around 50 Mbps would be around the point it'd be detrimental to my ability to work. (Before fiber showed up here I had a similar cable connection to what you do, I think it was like 350/35 and that got rough at times, admittedly partly because our local cable provider is a hot mess)

"Springfield/Hollister/Nixa/Ozark are all close by and have better services than locally, all within an hour's commute, more housing available, and better paying jobs that are year round. Branson is a tourist town so everything is high here. Suddenlink is the only cable/internet provider in the area, but you can also opt for satellite service through Direct TV/Dish, or someone I am unaware of. Been here 31 years and it's always the same thing. Come mid-December through mid-March, everything pretty much closes due to the ice we can get, and without having the best roads (we're in the Ozarks, it's all curves and hills - even the cows have 2 legs longer for grazing - LOL) I would say to attempt north of town. South is okay, just more rural. North is going towards civilization. There's places on Hwy 65 going both directions that don't even have cell service yet.  
Stay away from areas like Merriam Woods/Rockaway Beach, as they're rampant with meth, heroin, and other drugs. Plus the roads to get there are treacherous any day. There's always bad wrecks on the way and worse when it so much as rains.   
If you're on fb, there's groups like Branson Buzz, etc, that have more helpful information from people all over.   
Honestly, I'd take Ozark/Saddlebrooke over Branson if it's a job that's willing to relocate y'all. If you have to be in the area, I'd choose something off Branson Hills, or Branson North subdivisions.

Fun Spot is like an arcade, if I remember right. Think there's a pizza place with it, so it might be too young for y'all?  There is also an indoor mini golf at Grand Country, across the parking lot.   
The Boardwalk Aquarium is new. Haven't been yet, but they only do online sales (or did?) and there was a special for all their properties at a good discount. I also think there's still the attraction next to Walmart on 76, behind Taco Bell, with sharks (I think?).  
The Landing has Andy B's, if you're up for bowling, food, and more. Lots of folks love it. Haven't been, can't bowl - LOL!  
There's an 80's arcade somewhere in town, an indoor trampoline park, indoor obstacle course (across from Legends), the cave down off Hwy 13 should be open in the rain, but you might call first (the one at SDC often closes due to flooding, but not sure about Talking Rocks?).   
Escape Room type stuff, too!! The one I'm thinking of is out in Branson Meadows. There's others, I've heard.  
Oh, crap - isn't there something down with Big Cedar?? I want to say there's something out there, too.   
 \- don't forget in Hollister (1 exit south on 65) there's a museum at the College of the Ozarks - the food at Keeter Center is spectacular (reservations needed but not terribly expensive for lunch), they also were doing tours.  
In Springfield (about 35 minutes north on 65) there's the Bass Pro Shop Wonders of Wildlife (don't do this AND the Aquarium, it'd be redundant, I think). There's also a drive-thru cave, if you want to make a day of it.  
Branson is known for shows... if that's your thing - murder mystery shows, tribute shows, country shows, rock shows, bluegrass, gospel, karaoke...

"Alcohol isn’t an issue - honestly, might be preferred. We’ll be doing dinner, rehearsal, then drinks after. I’ve heard of it, and will check it out. 

So funny, Downing Street is the only one I know and I’m familiar with! I just reached out to them . 

Booking is what I’m concerned about as well, hence looking into it so early. 

We love Mexican! That sounds like a great option.

No particular vibe or type of food, just something fairly casual, quick, and it’s great if it’s more budget friendly than Devil’s Pool.

"Keeter Center at College of the Ozarks is good food, handle groups well. They do not have or allow alcohol if that’s a dealbreaker!

There’s a place called Downing Street Pourhouse in Hollister, remarkably good food for the area. May not be rehearsal dinner menu items, depending on your tastes. I’m not sure if they have a space for 25 inside, but they do have a really nice patio area. 

Both are only 15 minutes from BC. I think your biggest struggle will be getting restaurant space booked for that weekend, will be packed in the area. 

Cantina Laredo Mexican restaurant at the Branson landing is only a few minutes further down the highway. They have room and patio available for groups.

"I went to the Walmart on Branson Hills 4 days ago, and the line to check out wrapped all the way to the back of the store, took a right, and then extended the full length of the back wall. I took my basket to the front, handed it to an associate, and drove across the street to Target where I purchased everything I needed in about 10 minutes.

Paid staff know how to briskly process a checkout when the lines are long. Shoppers on the other hand, will fumble and dally with the mechanism, waving for help from the very limited supply of yellow vested employees, and will make a 5 minute checkout take 15 minutes.

It is a wholly disastrous improvement for which I have found no benefit as a consumer, and for which Target has acquired a new weekly customer.

"It's by the entrance to the Opera House, I can't remember the name of it, but I'll look while out there today.   
Also check their website to see if they have any ""tasting passport"" type stuff going on. They have had one for the bluegrass and barbecue festival, which ends Monday. It was $30 and you get 5 sample portions of different foods from different restaurants (a total of 5 for the $30).  
Don't attempt to push a wheelchair up ""heart attack hill"" which - as you enter is on the left, and as you exit, on the right. There's a central path with a circular ramp that will help you avoid the bigger hills.  
Local Flavor, Flaming Margaritas, Rowdy's Cheesesteak, Heroes (across from Clay Cooper's Theater) are all good food and reasonably priced, newer places along Hwy 76. If you can make a reservation, try College of the Ozarks' restaurant (Dobbin's Dining Room at Keeter Center) - a little pricey, but TASTY and all the kids who attend the college are working it, everything is grown/produced on campus. The kids work for their tuition, so when they graduate, they're debt free.   
My favorite barbecue is still Danna's and I love the pulled pork loaded baked potato. It's down Hwy 165 (there's one in Branson West, if you do go to SDC).

"  We rode the Branson Ferris Wheel our last trip there. It was cool. I had my SO, sis, niece, 4 year old child and 3 year old grrat-niece. It's super slow and doesn't stop for you to get on/off but it was a really awesome view. We rode it during the day and could see for MILES. 
  We usually like eating at the Grand Country Buffet and Pasghetti's. There's a diner called Jackie B. Goode's Uptown Cafe and Dinner Theater. They make the best cherry limeades I've ever had. 
  SDC will be pretty difficult to navigate with a wheelchair. The park is literally built in the Ozark mountains so some of the hills are REALLY steep. Either bring your own electric one or rent one. Be sure to download the SDC app so you can see which places to avoid in a wheelchair. It shows a green wheelchair picture for paths that are wheelchair accessible and a red wheelchair for paths that are not. Oh, while you're there, if you're a beef jerky fan like my SO, check out the shop that sells all kinds of jerky. They have alligator, kangaroo (tasty), bison, ostrich, etc. They even have duck sticks. I don't remember the name of the shop but I'm sure any of the employee's can direct you there.

"Seeing show in Branson is a lot like betting. You're essentially risking your $30 or whatever the ticket price is per person. I say that because no matter what other people may say about them, their taste will be different from yours. I come from New York and have had a life time fill of Broadway plays. So I find almost all the shows to be less than fulfilling while my  Arkansas neighbors rave about just how entertaining she finds them. So unless you have a couple hundred bucks to spend on a trip to NYC to see a show on Broadway, this is the only game in town. BTW I feel the same way about every show I've seen off Broadway in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, even Myrtle Beach. Once you see the big time, nothing else compares.

"The Paddlewheel on the Landing has live music.  If the weather is nice, the music is on the patio right on the lake which is really cool!  

The Mellow Mushroom on the Landing has specialty pizzas and fun drinks.  Close by is NV Nails - they take walkins and it is hands (and feet!) down the cleanest and most friendly nail salon.  After you walk the Landing you can treat yourselves to a relaxing mani-pedi at a very reasonable price.  It's a great way to treat yourselves.  

If the Landing is too crowded - and it will be - you can scoot over to Hollister and check out The Pour House for pub style food and drinks.  They have the best steaks, I'm told.  

You can also get a coffee and browse some excellent art at Vintage Paris in Hollister.  Funky and off the beaten path, Vintage Paris is a real hidden gem.  

You should also check out the Keeter Center at College of the Ozarks.  Dining may require a reservation so call ahead. Totally worth it for dinner or brunch.  We go several times a year.  If you can't get in to dine, you can still browse the gift shop for handcrafted items from students and be sure to check out the Ralph Foster Museum and book store for local historical flavor.

Some good places to eat are Downing Street pour house, Thai Thai, Carly’s healthy cuisine, dres kitchen food truck.

"Hi there. Well, you will want to go to silver dollar city, but something I’m fairly sure you will find is you should be fine eating indoors as there are many places with indoor dining, etc. Just take your mask everywhere for stores that require it, but we live in MO and this is usually an off season time and there won’t be as many people. Either way, our state handles the protocols well in my opinion. Many places do have outdoor heaters, but again, it’s a slower season. Do you not feel comfortable eating indoors? They all take protocols. Anyways, you could take a day trip and go to bass pro in Springfield, plus there is a new thing..wonders of wildlife national museum and aquarium...my dad said it’s amazing. Anyways, they fish all year round here. Once you get there, your best bet would be to ask locals of the best places to eat.

"I’ve lived in Branson for 13 years, I’m from Southern California. It seems like you are getting a bunch of people that don’t like Branson responding so I’ll respond as a millennial dad with a small family, who enjoys Branson. 

It’s a small town with big town amenities. 

Parking lots are never full when you go grocery shopping. 

It’s quiet and peaceful (where I live anyway.)

I can go fishing any day cause I live 5 minutes from the lake and the landing. 

The landing is really fun to go on like a Tuesday when there are no tourists in town. 

Lots of great stuff to do as a family.

There are bunch of family friendly shows which is unique. 

I can go for a walk without feeling like I’m going to get mugged 

Anywhere you live around here you are like less than 30 mins from a lake or a river. 

The forest and the ozark mountains are gorgeous. 

1.5 hours south by the buffalo river in jasper,AR we have some of the best places to go camping IMO in the country. It is so beautiful in the Ozark mountains. 

Lake taneycomo is so pretty early in the morning and table rock lake is extremely fun during the summer even if you don’t have a boat. 

The fishing is great. 

I’ve lived in LA, Phoenix, and Las Vegas and I think Branson is the most beautiful and safest place I’ve lived.

"Look let's not split hairs my brother was sent to Branson for rehab we originally were from Minnesota this was around eight years ago. I myself had a family going and moved here in the hopes of finding a good job and cleaning up for them, I'm a chef so lots of jobs wasn't easy but my skills were recognized and I moved up the got better housing was pretty damn happy. made some real good friends and my first mentor seriously love all of them. even if had some of my best  friends come down for fresh start, landscape is gorgeous, after a few years I made the oddly millennial transition to becoming a resident by changing my phone number and getting one with the area code of Branson, how I never noticed the area code was 417 I don't know, but anyway   that was one of the nicknames the people in my crew had for meth bout freaked my shit out, once an addict always an addict, but I had been clean so no problem just keep doing what you doin, all seemed fine I worked alot because it's a restaurant in a tourist area, I had noticed my 14 year old step daughter being reclusive but I assumed teenager stuff, I mean I tried to talk but not heard enough it would seem. We moved to our current house things were running smoothly for the most part and I was feeling pretty good about myself I had beaten the drugs and worked myself up from nothin to running a kitchen, hell I even got the pickup I wanted(yeah I'm redneck), people I met and became friends with were amazing and diverse, I bbq with my buddy louisiana, buddy from Jamaica stops by to smoke up , couple of Porta Ricans stop by with a chicken that looks like it was alive hours ago, the Mexicans nextdoor bring over some beer that is a picture of a weekend gathering at my house. Back to the story basically about two years ago my truck had a serious front end issue so I went to my brothers house, he had become a mechanic in the years since rehab so hell yeah I took advantage of that lol.. well he had a fat sack of fire(meth), I was angry at first but I figured what's the harm, we got lit and rebuilt the front end of my truck played video games like a couple of kids, annoyed his wife, in general it felt innocent and when it was over I had no desire to make it a habit. The problem was my brother had been using heavily and continued to afterwards, I spent as much time as had with him to counsel him with this, it's kinda an embarrassing subject so he made progress with cleaning up, well his problem was his friends, he ended up in jail twice short stays, after the second time he got out and came to the restaurant I cooked him a burger and sat and talked with him, he was doing great, getting a divorce so he asked if he could crash at my pad for the weekend and just hang.. I got so excited I immediately got the biggest bag o good weed and went home. I had one day left before my weekend I was at work by seven a.m. my boss  was acting weird but he is weird dude, chefs we are strange people, so whatever around ten in the in morning he says he needs to talk and leads me to area around back I see my family, yeah so I'm skip over this shit... My brother had been knocked from his motorcycle because he didn't stop he had gotten high whatever any the pigs hit him with their car and he fell of broke his leg tumbled down a steep embankment right in to the icy waters of lake taneycomo where the cops proceeded to stand there for forty five minutes while he begged for help and finally drowned in seven feet of water... So this is based on the radio records I had to take legal action aquire. I proceeded to sink to the bottom of a bottle for a bout a year when I came up for air my step daughter proceeded to tell me about her life.. I'm gonna try to keep this short this is getting emotional af on this end she was molested by an older woman when she was thirteen years old and raped by a teenage boy shortly after, was given methamphetamine by some fucking old tweeker pedophile who was trying to God knows what thank God I bought her a really nice knife but all of this was happening while I was at work and thought she just wanted space when we moved she still was spending most of her time away getting various drugs from people around me including my before previously unmentioned youngest brother whome just recently tried to molest her we have talking for a while so I found out immediately.. the only thing that I'm happy about is she loves me and said I was who even noticed anything was wrong which why she was avoiding me... But if you want to move to Branson don't trust anyone I'm now relapsed in an attempt to understand the scene and it's alot more than just a little bit the drug related crimes you hear about are the people whom aren't capable of functional behavior so be wary, Branson gave me a little but took almost everything, but you see a show and go shopping, or maybe ride a ride, or you could try some meth there's more to this story if you wanna know ask peace",t2_742nf3i8,wordsaredangerous,0,1609352503.0,0,t1_ghis937,ghis937,True,yakabis,t3_km7ibq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bransonmo/comments/km7ibq/should_we_move_branson/,Should we move Branson?,/r/bransonmo/comments/km7ibq/should_we_move_branson/ghis937/,2,r/bransonmo,0,2
"I’ve lived here most of my life while childhood was fairly good and filled with blissfully blinding ignorance, my teenage years found me very quickly and easily introduced to the world of drugs and small crime. While I always did my best to abstain from these activities, many of my friends dropped like flies one after another succumbing to drug related charges and multiple visits to rehab. You can find quiet acts of kindness in the communities but they are always overshadowed by the loud and ignorant acts of hate. It’s a place where people believe pro American and anti mask are one in the same and where you might commonly see rebel flags hanging from a porches. All entertainment is severely overpriced as it was created to lure in tourists who don’t know any better. Finding work is hard as most jobs are seasonal and people get laid off in the winter. It’s not uncommon to see a crack head or two walking around the cheap motels. I’ve witnessed a couple drug deals myself. If you have money and can afford stuff like going out on the lake or the fine dining then it get a bit better but is still ruled by the over righteous fake Christians who use there religion as an excuse for there ignorance.

"I’ll agree with this sentiment. There are some nice neighborhoods, and even more pretty sketchy ones. Much like any other town I suppose but the income gap is pretty wide in Branson. Very much a feast or famine kind of town. 

A major consideration I’d throw out there is if you have a plan for a job. The town all but shuts down January-March or April and will be difficult to find work. Most work out here is seasonal.
