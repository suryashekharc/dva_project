"> I want to see their selection as well.

I'm nearest the one in Woodland Hills, but have visited 2 of the others a few times. Selection varies a little bit by location, but seems to be pretty consistent.

In my anecdotal experience, the selection is largely comparable to what you'd find at a Ralphs/Vons/Pavilions, with a light smattering of ""365 Branded"" items from the Whole Foods stores.

There's a ""pretty good"" selection of pre-made foods on a day to day basis, but while none of it has been ""bad"", I find that a lot of it tastes very processed/""factory made"", which is probably to be expected.

Prices are about average, but can run a *little* high on some items; sales help but aren't amazing. I still buy most of my grocery stuff elsewhere since a lot of it is cheaper at other stores.

If I'm being honest, I haven't found much of anything to compel me to shop there regularly. The one ""big advantage"" is that most or all of them act as drop-zones for Amazon shipments, so you can both pickup and return items through them.

The ""Promenade 2035"" pitch has been *years* in the making. Westfield started trying to get the ball rolling as far back as the mid-90s and the plan has evolved numerous times, partly to include the renovation/expansion at Topanga and the construction of The Village.

The Promenade lot is (was?) supposed to be the 3rd piece in the puzzle, and the property was ""supposed to be"" rebuilt to include shopping, hotel, and business space, and an amphitheater. [They've even got a website about it](https://promenade2035.com/).

"this hits home. Last week near Orange Coast College, 2 guys drove into an apartment complex and stole 2 catalytic converters; one of them was mine. While in the middle of sawing off a 3rd, the security guard caught them, wrote down their license plate, and pulled the 2 CCs out of their trunk.

Luckily, I got mine back, and it was welded back on (plus oxygen sensor repaired) for $250. The part itself was $1800 new, so I was super lucky to get it back- papa bless the guard. 

There was a witness who said they took it off literally 5 minutes before I started my car. These guys do this shit fast. For the record, the 3rd car and my car are both Accords, which are among the most stolen cars due to their ubiquity.

"The time frame suggestion is great advice.  I'd go one step further and ask them to write in phased completion dates with escalating penalties for missing those dates.  I'd tell the contractor he can insert whatever dates he likes, so that he can pad them to his comfort level.  Provisions for delays due to no fault of the contractor, e.g. the countertops you chose, the order of which was placed in a reasonable time frame, and yet are back ordered and won't be in for 3 weeks, can be written into the contract and excused with proper documentation.

Contractors who can't, or won't do this, are not confident in their ability to deliver and you probably don't want to use them in the first place.

Edit: Note I would not use this provision as an opportunity to get a discount on construction.   I'd typically only use it for gross negligence.  It's just a tool you have to enforce a contract should things go sideways.

"They are Cree, if that is what you are wondering about. Super helpful too. Love this place. Really great selection of gems and one of the best organized collections of any gemstore I’ve been too. Random detail, but if you go you will see. Not a large store but I can easily spend over an hour in there (I also go mostly for the gems).

EDIT: Have not been here since before the pandemic. Out of curiosity due to the above comment, I checked out their Yelp reviews. Holy shit. As someone with a severely compromised immune system due to a serious illness, I am deeply disappointed at what’s been going on their during the pandemic (falsified room reporting to allow their in store customer max to be 3 times what it should be, no masks, super rude treatment of regular customers asking normal COVID-related questions - all of this during the peak of the LA surge too). This actually changes my view on the shop entirely. A shop that sells items that assist a person’s spirituality would be one of the last places I would expect to completely disregard the physical health of their customers. But it’s the owners and employees responses when customers voiced concerns that did it for me. Shows their true energy all along. They put profit over honesty, health, and the customers that trusted them for years. And all of their products just soaking up that negative energy…

Sorry, long edit. Excuse my rant. Hope you find a better shop. If so, I would love it if you could message me the name.",t2_4v2kdjtm,BodhiTree1133,0,1646390286.0,0,t1_hzavce9,hzavce9,False,UnderwaterPianos,t3_sq4whz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFV/comments/sq4whz/native_american_shops/,Native American shops?,/r/SFV/comments/sq4whz/native_american_shops/hzavce9/,1,r/SFV,0,1

And I’m pretty sure if you become a rewards member (free), you either get a discount everytime or get points towards future discounts. Since they have wine from places that are not as famous for being wine regions, it tends to be less expensive for better quality (than a discounted bottle from a well-known wine region, for example).

"Old Topanga Canyon. Starting past Mulholland (towards PCH). Never any traffic, lots of scenery changes along the route, places to pull off in the mountains. Just feel like you are worlds away from LA, even more so than on “regular” Topanga Cyn. Some of the drive is up high with mountain views, but then you go through this awesome little “forest.” Trees are big enough to canopy over the road for long continuous stretches. There’s a creek running alongside the road. And then this amazing boulder…massive monolithic feeling boulder right next to the road. Hard to describe, but you will know what I mean when you see it. It seems out of place right there next to the road (it looks like the ones you see on top of mountains from a distance). 

Old Topanga merges with “new” Topanga at the shopping center/restaurant area. But just before there is one of my favorite restaurants, Inn of the Seventh Ray. Food is amazing, but the outdoor seating is why I go. All different levels, above the creek, mostly shaded with huge trees. Fabulous book/gem/meditation supply store at the restaurant too. 

Anyway, you meet PCH south of Malibu, almost at the Palisades, if you were looking to stay south of Malibu. Hope wherever you end up (or ended up, seeing as you posted 2 weeks ago), you had some fun and got some cool footage.

"Born (late 80s) and raised near Valley Circle/Roscoe. My entire side of our cul-de-sac has someone in their household with a serious illness that has been linked to the site.

A neighbor a few streets over said they started investigating things when multiple neighbors ran into each other at Children’s Hospital where they were all taking their young children for treatment for some super rare cancer. That’s around the time the whistleblower came out in the 90s about the meltdown, and shooting the radioactive barrels as “clean-up,” etc. 

I think after the 90s things were not AS bad, but that’s super relative, considering there was one of the largest nuclear meltdowns there. NBC did a pretty great investigative piece on SSFL years back. It’s a good rabbit hole to go down if you are ready to move lol.

"In West Hills a few weeks ago, a guy stole a motorcycle and crashed going almost 140 down Roscoe (crashed at Fallbrook intersection). Instantly died. He was being “followed” but not “pursued” by LAPD air support, which prompted a whole discussion on Citizen as to why etc. 

Apparently, if LAPD feel the threat to public safety during a chase exceeds the benefit of catching whoever they are chasing, they have to back off. There are certain criteria too that mean they won’t engage in a vehicle pursuit - for example someone on motorcycle. Probably for the very reason exemplified a few weeks ago (motorcycles can more easily reach high speeds in the city, can go places cars can’t and where pedestrians are, etc). And I think even the helicopter is technically just “observing” rather than aggressively pursuing. But if you have seen the footage leading up/from that accident (POV from heli), the motorcyclist does not seem to know any of that. At one point he looks up at the helicopter (right around Valley Circle/Roscoe), clearly panics and accelerates from around 60 to over 130 before he passes Orchutt Ranch. 

Anyway, wonder if the had to back off the pursuit you are talking about for such a reason (threat to public safety). Although I imagine not apprehending criminals is an equally if not greater threat to public safety…Still, after learning all that the other day, made me understand why pursuits just randomly end sometimes.",t2_4v2kdjtm,BodhiTree1133,0,1646384046.0,0,t1_hzanuu2,hzanuu2,False,lurker_bee,t3_t5ubnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFV/comments/t5ubnv/man_shot_to_death_another_pistolwhipped_in_encino/,"Man shot to death, another pistol-whipped in Encino home invasion robbery",/r/SFV/comments/t5ubnv/man_shot_to_death_another_pistolwhipped_in_encino/hzanuu2/,1,r/SFV,0,1

"The problem with old mall pics is that nobody was going around snapping photos of the mall.  Sure, there are lots of vintage mall pics online but finding a particular mall is difficult.  I grew up in Ventura, our mall had a burger joint named Cozy Nook.  I can't find a single photo or any info about it at all.

There are flights from LAX to Phoenix, and then Phoenix to Flagstaff. By the time you factor in the drive to the airport, arriving 2 hours early, the flights, and the layover, you're probably about the pushing the same amount of time as driving.

"Yes. I have driven across the country, specifically going through Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, California... many, many times. You are gonna be on I-40 forever, which for me was absolutely boring, like driving straight forever. Being you arent going from LA to Nebraska or LA to Florida(yikes, that one is literally driving on I-40 for eternity), it won't be too boring because you'll reach Grand Canyon pretty quickly....you'll just have like 4 hours or so of driving a boring route. I have really bad elevation sickness, I can't remember exactly which part of Arizona it happens...it was something like 7,000 feet. I stopped at an Indian reservation gift shop, nearly about to pass out and nauseous. The shop manager was laughing and said I look better than most people who stop there when they get sick, then explained the best way to fight it was to get out of the elevation, which was 300 more miles for the next significant drop. He gave me some protection tooth(maybe he made it up to make me feel like I could continue). Anywho, nauseous, panting, I high tailed it out, driving 100 miles an hour. I started to feel better and made it. I used to be fine driving this route, but my body has changed over the decades of driving it. Meanwhile, take some stops along the way. My issue was I would literally drive straight and only stop at gas stations when needed.

"I've done the drive three times. You definitely need another driver to do tag-team driving.

Even if you start the trip early, with pit stops you might get there late. Make sure your hotel front desk is open late, or let them know you are arriving late so staff will be waiting. I once arrived so late, and had to get the attention of the staff waiting in the back room.

I think it takes 7.5 hours to make the drive with the minimum number of stops.

Also consider taking the train over. The next time we might try that, but I don't know if car rentals are available.

Also plan go check out Sedona while you're there (if you're going to the south rim).

"Fill up first when you leave, then fill up again after you cross the Arizona/California border.

Gas is way cheaper in Arizona than in California. Gas prices in Needles, CA will be pushing $6 a gallon, but the third off-ramp 10 miles past the Arizona/California border has major gas stations (travel centers) priced around $3.50 a gallon. 

Then, on your way back, fill up at the same cheap station before crossing back into California, and laugh at the insanely overpriced gas as you drive through Needles. 

The 40 freeway is a desolate stretch, and the gas stations in Needles seem to rely on people panicking and filling up, then they see how much cheaper gas is in Arizona. Don't panic when you see gas prices in Needles. Just keep going into Arizona, then gas up.

That figure ranked us as the 22nd most dense neighborhood in all of LA at that time. The next Valley neighborhood to rank in that list was North Hollywood, in 53rd place with ~13,000 people per sq mile. I really think the question of densest and second densest really lies between these two neighborhoods

Those figures were from 20 years ago. From what I can see, Panorama City hasn't changed a whole lot. Maybe a few more apartment buildings and an extra few thousand people added, pushing our density up a bit. But from what I see with North Hollywood, there have been a ton of developments, especially around the NoHo Arts District area. New projects and multi story apartments and the like. These two neighborhoods obviously rose in densities, but even with the indubitably bigger change in density that North Hollywood experienced, they have a lot of ground to cover from 53rd place so I'm not sure they've overtaken us. If the NoHo Arts District were its own neighborhood, I have no doubt that place would be the most dense neighborhood in the Valley by a longshot

"you have to break the breeding cycles the new ones that bite around the ankles are the ones to focus on here. they can migrate in from a few houses/apts away so looking for people with green/algaed pools on google earth and talking to vector control helps they are super nice people but they'll mostly just tell you the same thing ( sometimes its just someone who can't afford or is able to look after the pool so being neighbourly to help them out too helps everyone)

remove all standing water, they need less than a capful to breed and the eggs can be dormant for years.

mosquito seasons aren't as much of thing as longer term 50F+ weather is, once the weather is warmer they'll appear.
mosquito 'bits' are a safe cheap treatment for areas where water is , its a bacteria that attacks the breeding cycles and is safe around people/pets you just spread it around where you might get water or areas where standing water is going to be. 

it works well when it gets to the right places, any nooks, crannies and crevices where water can get too spread them around. there are larger dunks you can put in pools and bird feeders.

leaking taps, indoor and outdoor, leaking sprinkler systems are all issues.

black traps aren't as effective for the aedes , citronella etc are also debatable . traps that release a small co2 stream are the most effective.

they are weak fliers so they tend to stick closer to the ground and attack when you disturb them on leaves etc, thats why they primarily bite ankles so treat in low areas too. 

citronella / tiki torches somewhat work but its more about them being irritating smoke wise and that just means you're sucking in a lot of nasty stuff too. since they're lower to the ground the smoke tends to rise up and away anyway.

cover up and use sprays to stop them biting as much. i've found it varies

thermacells seem to work ok for a small area, mosquito nets for outdoors as long as they're sealed up.

you can build traps too, a big fan with a mesh over it and some spray can pick up a lot of them especially if its close to where you are sitting.  they can't really fly against wind so if you're outside sitting use fans they can't over come it.

treating and removing water for them to breed is really the best way to deal with them

we also put up deliberate traps that are long tubes with a bit of water at the bottom and a small hole for them to get in, theres a mix of salt and bti to kill off larvae and some yeast to help as an attractant. i don't find lurex or octinol really works on these mosquitos",t2_pgtkf,charliex2,0,1644518446.0,0,t1_hweg9js,hweg9js,False,itslino,t3_soqa8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFV/comments/soqa8y/anyone_enjoying_winter/,Anyone enjoying Winter?,/r/SFV/comments/soqa8y/anyone_enjoying_winter/hweg9js/,5,r/SFV,0,5

"I typically don’t remove posts unless they’re spam/repost or one of the earthquake threads, and I usually only remove harassing comments or misinformation.

There are other mods who are actually much more active than me at modding, and do about 95% of the backend work. I typically do front-end stuff like customizing the sub appearance, making guides and megathreads, and adding flair to make older posts easier to find.

The main problem about removed posts is that the sub has a policy requiring a majority of moderators have to agree to have the post restored. I disagree with this policy and advocated that removed content should be allowed to be restored if even just one moderator thinks it’s relevant, but the other mods didn’t think so.

I know a lot of people seem to think I’m in control of /r/LosAngeles but it really is a group of people, and I don’t agree with everything that happens there.
