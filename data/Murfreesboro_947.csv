People like you have no idea how capitalism works, and you’d rather just ramble of liberal talking points without even asking yourself hey how would this effect other people?

If you would do even just 2 seconds of googling you’d find out that TN has a tax surplus right now so they are trying to remove a few taxes like groceries, and gas to help the average family that lives here. Other than that there is nothing else the gov can do

"As I read it, I think it's a dumbfuck bill.  And the reason for me (Setting aside the obvious loss in revenue) is that the presumption is baffling.  The math that they're using is just:  


""If we assume...we can assume...""   


It's back of the napkin math, and something this financially significant deserves some further investigation - like a financial audit or something to verify if their presumptions are even REMOTELY accurate.    


As a user of D8 and HHC myself, I use it to regulate social anxiety, as well as to help with chronic back pain from years of morbid obesity before losing weight.  It has helped immensely with both - but I'm a responsible grown human adult...I'm not going to get high and drive, or operate machinery, or even do more than basic math.  Hell, I don't even make dinner decisions because I'll order one of everything!  


But I don't think it will ban the hemp-derived cannabinoids as much as it is just a stupid and punitive bill that would allow the incarceration of anyone caught selling or possessing non-compliant D8, D9, HHC, and any other future compounds or products that are not as commercially viable today.  So while I think it's stupid as a bill, and I'm not going to stop buying, irrespective of the law, I don't think it's the world ender that the lawmakers think it is.  They just see the space as a wild west of non-compliant products, but (for example) the guys at Hometown Hero who assay every batch and provide documentation - I don't worry much about legal compliance.    


To clarify though - I'm neither a lawyer, a chemist, or even very smart.  So...I could be dead-ass wrong, and I'd love to get an attorney who is familiar with Farm Act 2018 and this bill and let me know if I'm off-base.",t2_c9mbv,tycowboy,0,1648170616.0,0,t1_i20amky,i20amky,False,IknowIamBreathingIn,t3_tn0ccc,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/,New TN Bill to Outlaw Delta-8 THC,/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/i20amky/,2,r/murfreesboro,0,2

"“• This legislation will include certain hemp products within the definition of marijuana, effectively prohibiting the sale or possession of hemp products that have a THC concentration of more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis, regardless of whether such THC is derived of the delta-8 cannabinoids or otherwise.”

As I read it, this would simply make the rules in TN consistent with those in the Farm Bill which has the same 0.3% dry weight (mass) rules.

As far as vapes, flower, etc…it would seem to me that they have mass (grams) so they would just have to comply with the same 0.3% rules, which it seems to

"Did you read the specific Amendment linked below? I'm just curious to make sure we are reading the same thing because the link below makes it seem like nobody will be able to sell psychoactive D8 based on the .3 percent being established for all THCs. Therefore, only the gummies you mentioned above would be compliant, not vape, flower or any of the other products that require more than .3 percent D8 for it to be active by weight. Let me know your thoughts.

"So the Farm Bill 2018 says that the delineation of a hemp derived product versus marijuana (marihuana) is that hemp products may contain no more than 0.3% THC by mass (grams).

So…cool, that’s the rule, no problem:  just put more THC into even bigger edibles, it’s still compliant.

Let’s consider gummies for example:

If you want a 25mg Delta8 THC gummy, then you’d need to have (25mg/0.003) an 8.33g gummy by mass.  And that’s super easy to achieve.  Want to be safe?  Cool, make it a 15g gummy.  

Want to get semi-baked and do 100g of Delta8 THC, cool, make the edible bigger.

By anchoring the amount of THC permitted by a fixed value (mass), the Farm Bill basically incentivized sellers to just offer bigger edibles to accommodate ever bigger doses.  The Farm Bill doesn’t restrict how much (or what types) of THC, HHC, etc can be consumed…only how much non-psychoactive “stuff” has to go into the total mass of the product (99.97% of the total grams).

It SEEMS like this won’t actually prevent sellers who aren’t selling crap products or products with uncertain doses from selling in TN, it would just make it illegal to violate the Farm Bill standards, but under State law instead of Federal.",t2_c9mbv,tycowboy,0,1648168663.0,0,t1_i2069ou,i2069ou,False,IknowIamBreathingIn,t3_tn0ccc,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/,New TN Bill to Outlaw Delta-8 THC,/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/i2069ou/,3,r/murfreesboro,0,3

Hi Fellow Tennesseeans,

I'm posting this link to raise awareness about Representative William Lamberth's new amendment to Bill HB-1927 that will effectively outlaw Delta-8 THC and other legal cannabinoids derived from legal hemp. Please remember, this bill is attempting to criminalize Delta-8 THC and other cannabinoids that are legal under both State and Federal Law.

This bill will:

Decrease State Revenue – Net Impact - $4,840,900/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

Increase State Expenditures - $2,900 Incarceration

Decrease Local Revenue – Net Impact - $1,975,400/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

This is a very poorly thought out bill that will negatively impact sales revenue in the state, will increase incarceration and expenses thereof and will decrease local tax revenue. This will hurt many local businesses and hemp farmers operating legally under state and federal law and will result in more Tennesseans getting incarcerated and becoming felons in possession of a FEDERALLY LEGAL compound.Please my fellow Tennesseans, do what you can to raise awareness about this and help stop this bill in it's tracks. 

Representative Chris Hurt is pushing through Bill HB-1690 that seeks to regulate Delta-8 THC and create sales tax revenue in the state. This is a better approach and I hope that the bill to regulate vs outlaw takes precedent this year.Both of these bills are going through the process now, so please do what you can to contact local reps, local businesses who legally sell Delta-8 THC and anybody who benefits from this legal medicine to try their best and fight back.Much love Tennessee.

This will hurt many local businesses and hemp farmers operating legally under state and federal law and will result in more Tennesseans getting incarcerated and becoming felons in possession of a Federally legal compound.

I ask you to please do the right thing and vote No on criminalizing a Federally legal compound that will result in reduced state tax revenue and increased incarceration and costs associated.

Thank you xx.",t2_hx7o5wwr,IknowIamBreathingIn,0,1648152077.0,0,t1_i1z2gzs,i1z2gzs,True,IknowIamBreathingIn,t3_tn0ccc,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/,New TN Bill to Outlaw Delta-8 THC,/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/i1z2gzs/,12,r/murfreesboro,0,12

"2 things. 

First the burden of proof that the store was closed because a union was formed would be on the Plaintiff. Any retail store, particularly one in the food service sector, can demonstrate a loss anytime they want to. 

Second the NLRB is the agency that would be involved. As an administrative body they cannot infer or prosecute anything as a criminal act, so the phrase “illegal” doesn’t really attach. Also, the NLRB absolutely cannot take any action against any business that has closed.

Lastly in the recent decision overturning Specialty Healthcare, the NLRB issued a finding in PCC Structures (365 NLRB no. 160 (2017) that gives employers much more say in bargaining unit determinations. In fact, it places nearly all the weight on the employer. 

In closing, The Supreme Court overturned Murphy Oil in the Epic Systems case.

I go to Costco. It’s 8 dollars but they offer under carriage wash and tire wax as standard. I don’t believe any of the 5-8 dollar basic washes in town do that. It’s great for when the roads are salted. That’s my go to once a month.  When I want a quality wash I go to Smith Brothers. Dont bother with the basic wash here. It’s reasonably priced. Expect to pay $25 plus tip for a decent wash. Your car will be hand dried and vacuumed by a squad of workers. Those are the only two spots I go to. All the monthly places are the same imo.

" I prefer llumar tint over 3m ( it's a personal preference but it just is a slightly newer and better film especially their nano ceramic lineup ).

It just hasn't held up really well ( granted it's been on longer ).
Also statics wise and lab wise if you start looking at total solar heat rejection. Llumar.  Has the slight advantage vs other films at the same percentage.

"Growing up I lived not too far from a chicken farm; the mornings that the bus would drive slowly by it was disturbingly stinky. Then one year my father bought a couple of tons of chicken manure to fertilize the garden... holy geez, a giant pile of that stuff sitting under the sun...The whole family agreed he was *never* allowed to do that again. 

We had five small birds. Their droppings were scattered all over a sizeable back yard, not concentrated. We kept the coop clean and they were well cared for. I can honestly say there is no smell detectable by a neighbor. And I can honestly say that if we did build an enclosure for them, it would certainly have concentrated their droppings and caused a smell, not prevented it. The ordinance didn't apply here like that. There were not chicken droppings all over our or people's cars, property, etc. The dogs being walked up and down our streets leave piles of shit in our and our neighbors lawns. 

We were not running a chicken farm, we had pets.

"Someone down voted your comment. Since moving to Tennessee I have been carrying a handgun. The state I came from ""allowed"" you to apply for a pistol purchase permit after you got a firearms ID card after fingerprinting and extensive background checks. And several hundred dollars in fees. Then you had to keep said pistol in your home. No carry of any sort. So while waiting for her permit a woman was hacked to death in her own driveway by a former boyfriend who she had a restraining order against. That slip of paper did not protect her. A 9mm might have. But even if she had a gun, she could not have carried it legally. Here is a link.

But I so appreciate your kind comment!!! I will absolutely keep that metality when I have my degree and am able to qualify for more industry jobs.

"Good evening my fellow Murfreesboro friends! It has been WAY too long since I’ve been able to do this & I apologize for that. I am a local business owner and this past year has not been my best financially. I have been fortunate enough to maintain doing these things in person, but I have not had the extra to offer online as I typically get quite a bit of help requests. I am looking for pay for anyones water bill who is past due. I choose this one because the average water bill is $50 - $120 and this will allow me to help quite a bit families if needed. I am going to leave some rules down below that I kindly ask be followed. These are in place to ensure I am able to help those who truly need it. It feels good to be back! 

1. Water bills ONLY. I can not pay or offer help on rent, electric, cable, internet, etc. I am so sorry. 😞 
2. Direct message for help, do not comment. This allows you to stay anonymous. There is NO shame at asking for help, but there is also no reason for it to be public. This is between us & no one else.
3. This is my anonymous account. I will stay anonymous & you can too. I do NOT need your name, address, number, or any of that matter. I only need your customer number & account number.
4. Please only accounts that are past due. When I go to pay the bill, I can see if it is past due or not. You would be surprised how many water bills stay in the negative. As much as I would love to help every single person, let’s help those who need it the most first. 🙏🏼 

I’ll leave you guys with two of my favorite verses & quotes. God bless you guys. “Do good for others and do good business”. - Me (AR) 😉 

Hebrew’s 13:16
And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.

William R Hewlett

"My career moved us to TN. We moved to Murfreesboro in 2007. We are originally from Cleveland, Ohio, and we lived in Cincinnati. The best part was a couple of my dearest friends already lived there, and I knew others from my company. You need to know that TN is ranked nationally somewhere between 40 and 44th in public education. My daughter was a junior and she had been exposed to a more advanced educational curriculum. We were told by everyone that we had moved to the “best” school district, but because she was more advanced, the school’s counselor told her she did not have to take any additional mathematic classes her junior or her senior year. That was absolutely unacceptable, we insisted they enroll her in the AP calculus classes, which she breezed through. We had her enroll in other outside programs to make sure she was competitive for “the real world” as she prepared for college. 
The joke I have with my dear friend is, “ why didn’t you tell me I was moving to the tornadoes’ vacation camp grounds! We experienced damage from 3 tornadoes while living in Murfreesboro. One of them took off our roof, and we had to lived across town for about four months. I visibly saw that tornado from maybe about 2000 feet… well I grew up with lake effect snow in Cleveland, and let’s just say I will take one snow blizzard to go over a tornado anytime! On that same note…driving, OMG, since I am use to driving in snow or rain, it becomes very obvious that, I will say some Tennessean’s are not, but the speed limit is 70 mph, that has always baffled me. My oldest daughter had to go through some rigorous driving classes and requirements before she was able to get her drivers license in Ohio. She drives very well and she knows how to maneuver a car well. The child who got her driver’s license here in TN, did not have to go through half of what her sister did. She got her license and she could not maneuver a car well. My husband and I had to spend much more time with her. Overall traffic is a problem in Nashville because of the growth here. We did not find Murfreesboro to be a diverse community in 2007.  We actually have felt uncomfortable in some situations, and we were surprised at some very inappropriate comments made in our company. We did love our church there, but we moved in 2011 and built a new home outside of Nashville, in Hermitage. The community is more diverse and we are 15 minutes from the airport and 20 minutes from downtown Nashville, we are sort of in a rural area, but not far from the city at all . I can’t comment on the the schools since both my daughters have graduated college and are now navigating “adulting”, as they would say. However, since being in Hermitage we have experienced 2 more tornadoes, I guess that just comes with living in TN. I will say this, since we left Murfreesboro, the city has really grown, and right now it is cheaper to build a new home in Murfreesboro than it is to build a new home in Hermitage. I know this, because my husband’s brother and his family are moving here from New Hampshire and we have been helping them look for a house. The housing market is absolutely outrageous now!

"Murfreesboro is a great area to live if you never have to leave the town and can get all your errands done within a short distance to avoid traffic.  In my opinion it is cleaner and safer than surrounding communities such as Smyrna and La Vergne.

Commuting to Nashville will add at minimum 2 hours to your work day and about 20 years off your life due to stress of driving 24 daily.  24 is the absolute worst interstate in Nashville with tons of road rage and is not for the faint of heart.

The Blackman Area is great!  Good schools, close to shopping and restaurants, and close to both 24 and 840.  It’s also on the other side of town from the College so fairly quiet with a ton of families.

If you plan to purchase a home, Murfreesboro is a flood zone so do your due diligence and try to find a spot that isn’t known for flooding or needing to carry flood insurance

As for Tornadoes, the strong winds can do a lot of damage without a tornado so look for a spot that doesn’t have large trees that could fall on your house/cars and have a plan in place when you move here for where you and your family will hunker down in the event a tornado comes through the area.  I.E a room inside the house with no windows that isn’t an exterior wall of the house if you can.  That being said I’ve lived in this area my whole life and don’t stress tornadoes but they do deserve respect and knowledge on how to stay as safe as possible which is no different than learning the Do’s and Don’ts of the Ocean

All that said Murfreesboro is quite lovely with a ton of free local activities to do in the summer with the family, a great farmers market, nice theatre, bowling, pool halls, new restaurants cropping up regularly etc",t2_qswn80q,a11_the_things,0,1645130003.0,0,t1_hxcsw7o,hxcsw7o,True,random-person-enters,t3_suvr6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/suvr6n/thoughtsadvice_on_potential_move_to_murfreesboro/,Thoughts/advice on potential move to Murfreesboro TN or surrounding towns outside of Nashville.,/r/murfreesboro/comments/suvr6n/thoughtsadvice_on_potential_move_to_murfreesboro/hxcsw7o/,7,r/murfreesboro,0,7
I commuted from Murfreesboro to Nashville throughout school and I can honestly say I never want to do that again and it was emotionally exhausting.

"Oh, what a loaded question. 

Do you know the type of congregation you're looking for? Any specific things you need (or don't need) in a church? There are SO many options in Murfreesboro, and what constitutes as ""good"" to some would be terrible for others depending on their beliefs and personal life.

My partner and I currently attend First United Methodist on Thompson Ln and really enjoy it. They're fairly moderate, mid-sized congregation, and everyone is very friendly and welcoming. They offer both a traditional worship and modern services each week, and the pastors are more than willing to chat with you about pretty much anything. Most of all, they're fairly accepting of our unique family (we're a same-sex couple and I have kids from a previous marriage), which is hard to find in a lot of the churches in this area.

I also really like the pastors at First Presbyterian on N. Spring, and I've heard good things about City Church (I think it's on Church St).

Again, though, these recommendations are definitely not going to be a great fit if you're looking for a conservative, southern Baptist church, so it really depends on what you're looking for.",t2_g5wmaxud,mglosswriter,0,1645126876.0,0,t1_hxckp7u,hxckp7u,True,[deleted],t3_suudp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/suudp2/church/,Church,/r/murfreesboro/comments/suudp2/church/hxckp7u/,0,r/murfreesboro,0,0
"If you're looking for suburban living with a 30-60 minute commute to Nashville: Murfreesboro, Spring Hill, Mt. Juliet, Franklin, Hendersonville, Smyrna, Gallatin. All of these are fairly sizable towns, most are good school districts. 

If you'd like something a bit more rural but still close to cities listed above: Rockvale, Eagleville, Christiana, Ashland City, Columbia, Dickson, Lebanon.

Personally, I love Murfreesboro. Moved here in 2006 for college and, like most others, never left. I prefer the Blackman side of town, but you also can't go wrong with any part of town that's not close to the college campus.

Lived in Murfreesboro my whole life. Got married and husband moved here from Antioch (Nashville suburb). We love it, never plan on leaving. (I’m a 24yo female looking to start a family soon so this is all from my perspective)


Pros of Murfreesboro;
Affordable
Good schools
Lots to do 
In driving distance of many cool travel destinations 
Nice people
Convenient for shopping and medical 
Has a great college 
As a female I feel safe during the day in most areas 

Cons:
Getting more expensive to buy houses
Can be unsafe in some specific areas 
College town, so lots of bad drivers and young students getting into trouble (in some locations) 

There are tons of great areas in Murfreesboro to live. Most are safe and nice. 

DO NOT buy in these areas:
-Anything close to downtown (the further out of the city , generally safer)
-Anything by the mall 
-Anything near Patterson park 
-anything by church street (close to downtown)
-anything near a college apartment complex",t2_am8sdync,Sad-Feedback-3970,0,1645126059.0,0,t1_hxciim5,hxciim5,True,random-person-enters,t3_suvr6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/suvr6n/thoughtsadvice_on_potential_move_to_murfreesboro/,Thoughts/advice on potential move to Murfreesboro TN or surrounding towns outside of Nashville.,/r/murfreesboro/comments/suvr6n/thoughtsadvice_on_potential_move_to_murfreesboro/hxciim5/,4,r/murfreesboro,0,4

Murfreesboro is bursting full to the seams due to an influx of Cali and various other states and the infrastructure hasn't caught up, IMO.
Chapel Hill actually isn't a bad choice if you work in Brentwood and that side of Nashville. The commute up I-24 is getting dodgy so I take back roads. Surprisingly, the extra time equals out to taking the interstate because of congestion.

We're in an area known as 'Dixie Alley' which breeds lots of late winter/early spring tornadoes, and many (if not most) of those strike in the wee hours of the morning when you can't even see them coming, and are usually dead asleep.

It's not uncommon this time of year to be awakened by winds, thunder and terrified pets and then sit up watching StormTracker on the news.

"This is really odd. I was a firefighter back in the 1980's and we studied boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions stemming from flame impingement on a pressure vessel. I'm assuming this was a one pound tank sitting too close to a camp fire, but they have safety features that should vent before they blow up. The science is fascinating, as the flames heat up the tank and the liquid inside it, the liquid starts to boil. But it can't boil for long because the building pressure stops it. Eventually the pressure ruptures the tank and the superheated super-pressured liquid instantly vaporizes into a cloud and since there is a ignition source right there you get a dramatic explosion and fireball and explosion.

"I worked in finance for 18 years. When I first started working there company policy was you had to have a credit score over a certain number to qualify for the loan. Over the last couple years we stopped looking at the score because the scores don’t make sense. We would have people that had paid everything on time but would have a medical collection, a lot of times people wouldn’t even know about the medical collection. Their score would be low even with a 100% payment history, then I would pull another person and they would have several collections and were in bankruptcy and would still have a high credit score. It made no sense. Now you can boost your score with an app. That shows what a joke the score is. The only thing I know to tell you to bring your score up is to get a credit card and pay the balance off every month and keep your other bills current. I know this doesn’t help but the problems you had 5 years ago will come off your credit report after 7 years. I still think with a score in the 600s you should be able to get an apartment.

"alcohol, benzos, and the pescription painkillers that yall just love to give out are more of a gateway drug than anything. I was in detox recently and most of the people in there were just normal ass run of the mill every day mfs, grandmothers, mothers, wives and husbands. And id say about 70 percent of them started with prescriptions like oxycodone and Xanax from their doctor who kept them on it for years, some of them moved on to harder shit but not all. The rest started with alcohol/ cigarettes or street pills but I see a shockingly low amount of empathy and understanding of this issue in you. Criminalizing the dealers and making the drugs illegal has never worked, you make the mistake of thinking thats even possible lol. One dealer falls and 10 more are hiding in the shadows, and others waiting to take his place. Drugs are a commodity, just like toothpaste, alcohol, and food. And addicts are all over where you least expect it. I appreciate your service in the healthcare field though and im sure youve done alot for it, but its important that people who arent addicts understand that its a disease and that the people addicted cant help it. I destroyed my life with that shit and am rebuilding, my first alcohol and percocet was given to me by my mother and I didnt understand what it was until I was taking 2x the dose they give to cancer patients and xanax. I overdosed and they kicked me out. Shit wasnt my choice, it was my mental illness and my environment. But as an Adult I control how I react to it so im on the road to being clean.
