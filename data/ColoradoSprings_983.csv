"I think your math assumes we have a 20% down payment- which would be $80k. Unfortunately we do not. We do have conventional financing.

We have $30k which is enough for a 5-7%, which is enough to get us a loan but we still have PMI and with a low percent down, $400k looks more like $2400 a month- prior to utilities. Not to mention most places require an appraisal gap right now which eats into our down payment significantly. 

I apologize, as I know we could absolutely get a loan for $400k and make it work but we feel like we would be house poor.

"[Check out the city urban trails system ](https://coloradosprings.gov/sites/default/files/parks_recreation_and_cultural_services/trails/urban_trail_map.pdf), tier 1 and 2 trails are probably your best bet.

Allyrails is very hit it miss because the data is crowdsourced. I recommend COTrex, a site/app put out by the state that uses data provided by local management agencies- so the information is more accurate.

North Greenway Trail to New Santa Fe Trail isn't bad, although some of the trail is closed/being repaired right now. Foothills and Palmer Mesa Trail are nice Westside trails with good scenery.

"I actually worked at the Austin Bluffs store for about a year. You should know that anything that isn‚Äôt in nearly new condition never makes it to the sales floor. The rest of it gets dumped in bins and hauled to the outlet in Castle Rock. If something doesn‚Äôt sell in 2 and a half weeks, it‚Äôs also taken off the floor and sent to the outlet. And if it doesn‚Äôt get picked up by someone at the outlet? Straight to the landfill. As a rule of thumb, don‚Äôt donate anything stained, ripped, stretched out/worn too often, or ‚Äúout of style‚Äù if you actually want the donations to reach people.

It‚Äôll be especially hard for the toys and stuff if there‚Äôs a lot of them, there‚Äôs such a tiny section available so most of the stuff that even might be good quality being donated might not even get to be sold. The books at least might stand a pretty good chance, same with the shoes and cookware (though the cookware might be tossed if there‚Äôs significant signs of wear). 

If nothing else, try to at least donate to multiple different locations so the stuff is more likely to actually get put on the floor. But there are *way* better places you can donate to.

Edit: reread the post, seems you‚Äôve already donated‚Äî if none of it was particularly worn or in bad condition, maybe it won‚Äôt be so bad.

"""Not to shit on transplants"" - *shits on transplants*

It's not totally new at all, you either A - started paying attention, or B - changed what area of town you frequent. We live in a geographically large city. I used to frequently see what you describe 10 years ago, and now I rarely see it.

But let's be objective and look at data. from 2010-2019 in Colorado Springs, there was a 17.2% increase in population with a correlated 17.9% increase in crashes. Effectively keeping a constant level of 'bad drivers'. The reason for not looking at beyond 2019, is because crashes went way down since the pandemic. Even 2021 saw fewer crashes than 2010 despite the population growth.

I have worked in lots of restaurants and I will tell you right now the fast food restaurants are almost always cleaned infinitely better than family owned small businesses. You‚Äôll see a lot of spillage on the floor of fast food places because the workers make an insane amount of food and there‚Äôs no point in sweeping unless you have time. Family places often have way less workers and it‚Äôs usually people who‚Äôve been there for a while and they get comfortable. Fast food places are usually run by big corporations too who like to give you a lot of busy cleaning work at the end of your shift and often have logs you have to fill out to check temps to make sure food is stored properly. Just some insight from my 15 years working in restaurants.

"I'm mostly trying to get a vibe for what actually living there is like. Using your eyeballs only gets you so far and they're always going to spin you a fairy tale when they're selling. They'd promise you the moon with a handshake as long as it wasn't enforceable in the lease, haha. 

I guess wrt specifics, I'm wondering about maintenance for sure. An old building looks cute but is going to have more issues. If maintenance isn't responsive and repairs aren't quick, that could be a real issue -- especially if it involves a leak or the heat going out, like you mentioned. 

I'd also like to know about the temperature fluctuations throughout the year. It doesn't have AC, which is normal in Colorado, but with the old building and big windows I assume it can get pretty hot. I'm wondering if people have found effective ways to mitigate that, such as blackout curtains. I'm also worried about leaching heat in the winter. Is this an issue? 

The culture of the building would also be good to know. It is near campus which means there's likely to be a student population, as you've confirmed (the reserved leases are interesting to know!) and I'm wondering if that results in people being boisterous or generally inconsiderate. My friend doesn't own a car so parking isn't too much of an issue, though I suppose that leaves me to wonder what public transit is like in the area. 

Lastly, I'd love to get a general vibe regarding management in general. Every single review is singing their praises by name which makes me immediately doubt every single review. Knowing the vibe once you've actually signed a contract is pretty important IMO, and I'd like to help my friend dodge any bullets if possible.

I am not sure that necessarily mean they have installed extra fiber to accommodate more growth. That is unless you have some inside info that states this? 

The articles mention Ting is helping with the cost of building out the infrastructure. Which kind of implies the current infrastructure is not suitable for future needs. That is, unless they are using something like multiplexers to make the most of what is currently installed.
