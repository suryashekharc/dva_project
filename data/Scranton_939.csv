"Something like 50% of Prep students receive financial aid. The median Scranton taxpaying family, based on financial data related to free/reduced lunches provided by the district, would pay next to nothing for their kid to attend Prep.

Tuition for 4 years would be roughly $60k total if you paid full price. Still a good deal for high achievers. Why?  


1. Prep has extra college credit arrangements with the University of Scranton on top of AP credits. Without doing crazy dual enrollment stuff, a top-tier Prep student could start at the U as an academic sophomore more easily than someone from a neighboring high school, and a massive merit scholarship would accompany this. Great way to start your journey to medical school.
2. Much better penetration into tier 2/tier 3 schools (think the tiers above most flagship state schools).
3. Significantly better social, extra-curricular, and athletic development. We can get into anecdotes now: I went to a Nova-esque school. While I was there, a high-ranking graduate from an NEPA public school showed up.

">Prep doesn't have good Ivy League numbers and I'll wager that even per capita SHS sends more to Ivy league schools than Prep.

The metrics that used to be cited by SSD fans had to do with AP exam scores and national merit (semi)finalists. The top end of Scranton's AP exam results and PSAT scores still probably greatly exceed the outsider's expectations, especially considering how many kids will end up being first-generation college students. However, whenever Prep gets a crazy matriculation of smart 8th-graders from public school districts, the college outcomes shift significantly in Prep's favor. To me, this suggests that Prep is an overwhelmingly better choice for the arbitrary smart 8th-grader, though I acknowledge that there are still plenty of morons with mediocre outcomes.

My senior year, though, it wasn't even close. Prep sent 8 kids to Ivy League schools and a sizable second tier of kids to 3/4-full scholarships at the U or to Nova-esque schools. Scranton had a few acceptances, but didn't send anyone to an Ivy League school. They had a few great U kids at near or full scholarship, but the Nova tier was practically empty.

Also worth mentioning that Scranton's guidance department is completely overwhelmed whereas at Abington and Prep they can actually help kids strategize. For example, you get marginal acceptances turned into sure things via a comprehensive understanding of the early decision process. And you also get way better penetration at highly selective private schools (even D3 schools) because people understand how to work the athletics angle.",t2_4oanh,EnigmaMind,0,1647811886.0,0,t1_i1gbvhu,i1gbvhu,False,SanFranhattan,t3_timpvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/timpvk/best_neighborhoods_in_scranton_to_raise_a_family/,Best neighborhoods in Scranton to raise a family,/r/Scranton/comments/timpvk/best_neighborhoods_in_scranton_to_raise_a_family/i1gbvhu/,1,r/Scranton,0,1

"I am not born and raised in NEPA, but as a transplant I can tell you something that may prove valuable: the people with good jobs who move to the area for those jobs often move to better locations once they get a lay of the land. For example, my husband and I bought in a specific township because it was the least awful house available at our price range at the time. After about two and a half years, we understood the area better, the people better, the local politics better, and so when we could we moved to an area that we deemed better (just three miles away from where we initially bought). His colleagues and bosses, when they could afford to themselves, had all chosen to move to Pittston or Mountain Top or Clarks Summit. It‚Äôs just one of those things where, if you are privileged enough to leave for areas that make better sense to you, unfortunately, you do. 

I say this because I really like the Scranton and Wilkes-Barre area, so I take umbrage when people talk shit about it. And we have encountered SO. MANY. PEOPLE. WHO. HATE. IT. HERE.

"Look man, your post was just wrong. You put up a wall of text to try to cover your shit, but every fucking paragraph starts off with me being ""technically"" correct. Every jurisdiction you mentioned has more part time cops than full time ones (some by a large margin), and most of them would move to Scranton to be a member of that force, if they could. Smart to not mention fire personnel, because who needs fire expertise when uncle Joey and his used fire equipment saving my kids.  He is not who I want at my house saving my life. Uncle Joey probably set the fucking fire to begin with.

The crime thing is also stupid. I'm not kidding. I have never locked my doors in Scranton after I left my parent's home decades ago. I've never been the victim of property crime or violent crime. With some time away for school and other various reasons, I've been living here for almost a half century. Yes, parts of West Side and South Side are hot spots, but it's not ""wandering crime"" I've never heard such a thing. You're in more danger of getting hit by a car crossing the street downtown than you do being a victim of violent crime outside those hot spots. 

Prep doesn't have good Ivy League numbers and I'll wager that even per capita SHS sends more to Ivy league schools than Prep. Not that Prep **couldn't**,  but don't forget Prep is basically a feeder school for U of S and St. Joe's. The bulk of the grads end up at one of them typically, occasionally Villanova or something, a handful maybe to Cornell or something if the kid is really exceptional.  Look at the per capita numbers for all the schools in the region and SHS is going to be competitive with Ivy League grads, and I have a hunch they're probably on top. Your school experience in the SSD is going to vary widely based on what school you're in. That is the real issue at SSD and the reason why I think they're about 3-4 years away from being pretty rock solid.

Your real estate statement is just false man. I don't know what to tell you, but home prices here are through the roof and unless you're in some super coveted market (Clarks Green or Harmony Hills) home value increases are comprable to the boroughs.

"Every thread in this sub has some guy (could be the same one)  saying ""don't move to the city because taxes, crime, schools, etc"".

Look, here's the thing. When you live in Scranton you have a professional fire and police department, not 5 part timers and a chief, or a bunch of volunteer firefighters. When it comes policing and emergency rescue, I don't want a part timer in charge of my health and safety.

Scranton schools are in below average state right now, but my personal belief is they will improve pretty steadily over the coming years, I know a little about the district and its been much better, even in the recent past, and I think it will be again in relatively short order. I'm still pretty sure Scranton High still sends more kids to ivy league colleges than any other high school in the county. Also Scranton has a bigger budget and more resources than most other districts.

Crime is concentrated in sections of West Side and South Side, you'll have no trouble finding locations that are crime free in Scranton. I have lived in Scranton for most of my life, the only reason I started locking my doors this year is because my dog figured out how to turn the knob and get our of the house. My parent's home was burgled one time in the early 1980s, we know the guy who did it, he went to jail for 10 years for a string of burglaries around that time.  Most neighborhoods in Scranton have below average crime. 

Quite the contrary to the city decaying, the city is on the way back, covid really put a hitch in the progress, but Scranton has much improved over the course of the past two decades. Scranton reached its nadir sometime around the late 90s. Since then progress has been slow but mostly steadily upwards. Downtown Scranton is light years ahead of the Clarks Summit strip malls or the clap board yonko bars in Dickson City or Throop.  Is it Manhattan? No. But it's a lot closer to Manhattan than the strip mall bar in Chinchilla or frankly anywhere else in NEPA.

Scranton's real estate market is literally the highest it has ever been, that's true of most other regions in the area and the country, to say that your real estate value will decline is just a fucking lie.

So, basically, yes you'll pay more in taxes for a competent, functional, and mostly friendly police and fire department (and public works). I wouldn't worry too much about the schools long term, and Scranton is definitely more vibrant than any other community in the area.",t2_9bah9,JR-Dubs,0,1647795241.0,0,t1_i1f831w,i1f831w,False,SanFranhattan,t3_timpvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/timpvk/best_neighborhoods_in_scranton_to_raise_a_family/,Best neighborhoods in Scranton to raise a family,/r/Scranton/comments/timpvk/best_neighborhoods_in_scranton_to_raise_a_family/i1f831w/,16,r/Scranton,0,16

"What many said already is 100% true. I am biased towards living in Scranton as I was raised in the city (hill section) but I also split my time between Scranton and NYC for work so I get a bit of the best of both worlds. 

If I was new to the area with a family, I would definitely consider places like Clarks Summit, Waverly, etc. so I had access to Scranton, without its taxes. 

The #1 thing I get SO frustrated with is when people say there is nothing to do in this area. As I said above, I spend a lot of time in NYC, literally the largest city in the country, and I keep just as busy in Scranton as I do in Manhattan.

To name a few..

* Plenty of festivals, theatres, art galleries, museums/historic sites, etc. 
* There are like 4 nice coffee shops within walking distance of my apartment - and a ton more downtown. 
* Touring shows like the Broadway Theatre League, bigger and small musical acts, etc.
* professional sports (baseball, hockey, etc) 
* a well-sized mountain for skiing/snowboarding/tubing, water parks
* ample access to hiking trails for all experince levels 
* there are big box stores and local shops including high end, vintage, locally made stuff, etc. 
* Restaurants & bars across the city include diverse options like sushi, Mediterranean, Thai, Brazilian, American fusion, Italian, French, farm to table, vegan, etc, etc
* Easy day trip access to national parks, other skiing mountains + small charming towns and large cities. 
* Local farmers markets, multiple ones in different locales nearly each week. 
* Nearly every part of the city / area has multiple yoga studios, gyms and other types of more unique physical activities (pole dancing classes, acrobatics, axe throwing, water sports, etc) 
* I work in an arts-centered job so I am CONSTANTLY being bombarded with emails about clubs, workshops, programs, etc. for children, youth, and seniors involving arts, music, theatre, gardening, + I am sure there are just as many (if not more) for sports, tech, etc.

"Are you moving to Scranton specifically? Or the general area?  And what type of neighborhood are you looking to live in?   I ask because transition from ""downtown city Scranton"" to Suburbs to ""basically rural farms and/or forest"" can happen really quite quickly.  Clarks Summit/Abington is probably the nicest/best schools, but (maybe obviously), also the most expensive.  Also, living outside the Scranton city limits I am pretty sure will do wonders for your tax rate.

Compared to NC, be ready for fucked up weather.  We just got 5"" of Snow last weekend, and then Monday was like 60 degrees.

The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area is kinda funky in that while we have some of everything, we're a pretty close drive to those same things but better.

* If you like doing outdoor things (camping, hiking, fishing etc) we have plenty of stuff around, but a couple hours away are the NY Finger Lakes, World's End State Park, among others.
* If you like city stuff, Scranton and Wilkes-barre can give a bit of that, but only a couple hours drive are NY/Philly for day-trip city things.

"So, this is partially correct.  It's probably not the ""worst neighborhood"" in Scranton, it is a mishmash of zoning with overlapping commercial, residential, and industrial areas.

It is incorrect that it has the most sexual offenders, I do not know that there's data on where convicted felons live (unless they're under probation or parole), but the entire 18509 zip code which includes Pine Brook, Green Ridge and part of Dunmore has less sex offenders than South Side and West Side (18505 and 18504 respectively), although the section of Pine Brook 913 Sanderson is located in will be absent all Megan's Law offenders due to the presence of John Adams elementary school which is about a block and a half away.  This address is nowhere near the homeless shelter and also not near the soup kitchen, I don't feel like you're gonna have a lot of problems with transients or other strangers.  The ""No Trespassing"" signs are almost certianly due to the proximity of the playground directly behind the residence as well as the location of Sweeny's Beach on the river, both of which have become more popular recently, I'm sure to the chagrin of the local residents, people often cut through people's yards to get to these places (happened to me when I lived in North Scranton near Weston Park).  

I'm not trying to candy coat the neighborhood though, it's pretty rough, not a lot of care or concern going into the street or the fronts of the properties and that's always a concern for anyone looking to purchase.  If you purchase this as an owner-occupant I feel like you're gonna have a lot of work on the side trying to revitalize the neighborhood.  That said, there's already a lot of revitalization going on in that general area, the Lace Works is only a stone's throw away and 5 years ago that was a hulking, disintegrating mess.

So I would not purchase this property just based on that (I'm busy enough), but if you love community building there's a lot of stuff you could do there for sure.",t2_9bah9,JR-Dubs,0,1646752303.0,0,t1_hzufdgl,hzufdgl,False,SanFranhattan,t3_t8wv15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/t8wv15/pine_brook_neighborhood_how_loud_and_how_often_do/,Pine Brook Neighborhood - How loud and how often do the trains run?,/r/Scranton/comments/t8wv15/pine_brook_neighborhood_how_loud_and_how_often_do/hzufdgl/,2,r/Scranton,0,2
"This is a good question, my guidance is that housing density is only one aspect of it. For example, the block I grew up on had several triplexes, yet every single one was owner-occupied. Today, 0 of those 5 (ish) buildings are owner occupied, and the quality of tenant has declined. This dramatically changed the character of the immediate neighborhood.

There are plenty of streets in neighborhoods that I've labeled ""bad"" in previous posts, where you have contingents of genuine working-class folks, not unemployed Section 8 tenants with unlimited children and ATVs. It's just really hard to identify good blocks versus bad blocks without monitoring the street every day.

If there's ""value"" in any section of a neighborhood, it's usually in sections that abut different types of zoning like parks, highways, or industrial corridors.

For example: Bunker Hill. Straddles Dunmore, cut by the highway, even if every house was occupied by your worst enemy, how bad could it be? It's impossible to live here without a car, so transient crime is non-existent.

For $95k, this house is a decent value, though it probably needs new everything: [https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1022-Bunker-Hill-St-Scranton-PA-18510/9570020\_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1022-Bunker-Hill-St-Scranton-PA-18510/9570020_zpid/).  FYI the house across the street has an army of very loud dogs.

Just up the street, though, you have a ranch home with a nice view and big lot for $250k: [https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1000-Sadler-Ave-Scranton-PA-18510/9570756\_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1000-Sadler-Ave-Scranton-PA-18510/9570756_zpid/).

"Do not buy a home in the Pine Brook section of Scranton if your first line of inquiry is asking Reddit about the noise from trains.

The house you are looking at--[913 Sanderson](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/913-Sanderson-Ave-Scranton-PA-18509/9557206_zpid/)\--is priced so low for a reason. It was last sold for $5,000. Please don't be seduced by the low price of $104k or think that you've found a hidden gem because the listing has only been up for 3 hours. Whoever ends up buying this house is going to regret it.

This is the worst neighborhood in Scranton, and I don't think it's a remotely close contest. The reason you won't find many balanced opinions on the neighborhood is that it's excluded from any serious discussion.

To be fair, this is probably the ""nicest"" segment of the small neighborhood, but you can still plainly see on Google maps that:

1. You're in a weird zoning situation near industrial/commercial buildings
2. Nearly every house on the block appears to be multifamily
3. Street view shows one neighbor using car seats as porch furniture

Edit:

The neighborhood as a whole is awful. It is easily the most impoverished, has the most convicted felons and sexual predators (I actually checked for a school project many years ago) per capita, has the lowest rate of owner-occupied homes, and has the crappiest lots and urban planning *by far*. Notice how many homes on street view have private property/no trespassing signs. The largest homeless shelter in town is right on the border, and another soup kitchen/shelter is in the neighborhood.

Aside from the shmuck who is trying to flip this home, it is notable that real estate investors and developers have no appetite for this neighborhood. The only thing that's happened since I was a kid is that the edges are eroding and derelict buildings are turning into parking lots. Ideally, all residential zoning in this neighborhood should be eliminated and repurposed.",t2_4oanh,EnigmaMind,0,1646689394.0,0,t1_hzr9w7t,hzr9w7t,True,SanFranhattan,t3_t8wv15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/t8wv15/pine_brook_neighborhood_how_loud_and_how_often_do/,Pine Brook Neighborhood - How loud and how often do the trains run?,/r/Scranton/comments/t8wv15/pine_brook_neighborhood_how_loud_and_how_often_do/hzr9w7t/,28,r/Scranton,0,28

This is exactly what you're looking for, very flat riding too.

"I moved to Scranton about a year ago. I've said it before in this sub, but I really think this place suffers from an undeserved inferiority complex.  


I've lived all over this country and here's what you get for most of it: giant master-planned beehives with a Walmart on the outskirts. Endless urban sprawl. Or literal one-stoplight towns.   


Meanwhile, NEPA is one of the finest places the US has to offer as far as quality of life vs. affordability. There's beautiful nature all around. The people I've met are civically minded. They have real thoughts and opinions about what's going on in their cities and neighborhoods. Yes, there is some crumbling infrastructure, but at least people care enough to complain about it!   


But because of NEPA's inferiority complex (possibly brought on by a few generations of rust belt brain drain and economic stagnation), the people here have just decided this place sucks without a thought for how it actually compares to the rest of the country. Are some places better? Absolutely! But there are many places that are much, MUCH worse.

"I have family in Scranton so I grew up going there. There‚Äôs tons to do to a small town girl like me. You not only have Scranton but you are close to Dickson City and Wilkes-Barre. You have the Mohegan Sun casino and race track, and Mohegan Sun Arena within 15-20 mins away. Multiple malls and the shops at montage. Montage has skiing in the winter and concerts and water slide in the summer. Tons of breweries and wineries within an hours drive. Lots of bars, eateries, and restaurants. Maybe 40 minutes from Jim Thorpe which has Penns peak for year round concerts, white water rafting, bicycling trails, tree courses, train rides, and a beautiful town. You are less than 3 hours from NYC and Philly. Not far in any direction you have access to beautiful lakes and rivers where you can fish, boat, and kayak. You also have access to many fantastic tattoo shops and artists if you‚Äôre into that. Don‚Äôt forget to go to Old Forge for some of the most amazing pizza places.

 Its funny, when you drive local roads into New York state, the state line is obvious by the quality of the road, like stark difference.  Its worth mentioning that NYS pays about double the income tax Pennsylvania does. New Yorkers love to shit on Pennsylvania  but in the same breath envy the low taxes.

"Biggest shift is due to Baby Boomers retiring. Over the next 10 years, PA will see 0.5M in population decrease of working population, and increase of similar for 65+. This is before we talk about people moving out/in to PA.  Before the pandemic, there was an in-migration of retirees because PA is 1 of 3 states with an income tax that doesn't touch pensions.  It is 'retirement friendly', but it pushes out working families, who are the great majority of the taxpayers in PA, and supporting the seniors' healthcare costs.  See page 14 of the link below.

If you add new working families to the mix, you also have to consider that their kids will attend school, and drive costs up.  It's not as simple as 'adding working class families', because you'd need a LOT to makeup the Baby Boomer retirement.  We simply want enough to keep the in-migration of retires 'flat', and keep working families from moving out with high taxation.

In general PA residents are moving from the 'West' to the 'East'.  There's a map on page 21 which will give you a better idea.

"$16B every year is the cost to property owners (homeowners, businesses). It rises about $0.5B every year.  So, next year it might be $16.5B.  (It rises faster than inflation due to 'unfunded mandates' for things like pension obligations, cyber charter school costs, healthcare costs, etc.)

The State Income tax would be 3.07% (as it is today), but now added would be a 1.85% income tax collected locally (by school district). And, ""Income tax"" is expanded to include retirement income (not SS, not SS equivalents, not contributions to retirement.) PA is only 1 of 3 states left (with an income tax) that doesn't tax pensions in any way.

So, the effective income tax rate is 4.92%  (3.07% state, 1.85% local).

Then, there's the 2% local sales tax.  (Everything that today has 6% would get 2% local tax on top of it.  Food/Clothing would only get the 2%.) SNAP (Food stamps) purchases and WIC foods excluded.

Today, 31% of seniors have a pension. It decreases over time, because pensions (""Defined benefit plans"") are being replaced with 401ks/403bs/etc (""Defined Contribution plans"").  And, the median pension is nowhere near $100k.  (Median amounts are... Private pensions: $10k, Fed pension: $30k, PA pension: $26k).   So, the median amounts show that most seniors benefit, except for a few with 'Cadillac' pensions who might pay more.  Since a large portion live on Social Security (alone), they won't get any income tax. (Just a few hundred dollars of the sales tax.)  And, those with the newer 'defined contribution' plans can deduct their contribution amount (when it goes in, and comes out), or 15%, whichever is greater.

Our group (a property tax elimination advocacy group) created a calculator for individuals to try:  [https://www.NoProp.tax/calc](https://www.NoProp.tax/calc)

&#x200B;

And, you asked about Healthcare costs in the full state budget: 

[https://www.patreasury.gov/transparency/budget.php](https://www.patreasury.gov/transparency/budget.php)

And, don't forget to check out the 'Revenue' tab:

[https://www.patreasury.gov/transparency/revenue.php](https://www.patreasury.gov/transparency/revenue.php)

All of the costs in this \~$40B 'General Fund' are separate from the $16B collected every year from properties to fund schools.  (Only a *portion* of the General Fund is used for state-funding of schools. Federal makes up a small fraction.  Property taxes make up the largest piece of school funding.)

Too many rabbit holes to dive into here :) Happy to dive as deep as you want! Ask questions as you come across them.  


EDIT: I will add since you're looking at healthcare cost:  A very large portion ($4B+) of healthcare costs are for seniors, who essentially pay very little of the cost in their sales taxes today. The tab is mostly picked up by working families.",t2_bby05,rpertusio,0,1646180899.0,0,t1_hyzg321,hyzg321,False,thebueller,t3_t1vyce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/t1vyce/pennsylvania_lawmaker_introduces_property_tax/,"Pennsylvania lawmaker introduces property tax elimination plan that would hike retirement, sales levies",/r/Scranton/comments/t1vyce/pennsylvania_lawmaker_introduces_property_tax/hyzg321/,2,r/Scranton,0,2
"Thank you for the explanation. Is it 16 billion a year or 16 billion over ---- years. And what will the tax %be on the retirement income ? 13% on 20,000k is $2600. And 5% on 100,000 is 5k. So a smaller percentage sounds nice but the tax amount is more. So an  individual has worked 30-40 years to earn seems like a bigger slap in the face. 
What is the income level that will be taxed at? 

Either way we are getting taxed.

"I can! Even the state of CA (3x larger than PA) they brought in about $1B in legalized marijuana sales.  We need $16B to replace property taxes.

There's a larger story on why retirement tax is in there... the working families are \*shrinking\* in population.  Shoveling the entire tax on working families will make them leave. (The PA IFO has reported they were leaving before the pandemic, and we would expect it's going to pick up again.)

If we put all the taxation on the working class that's shrinking, it's fiscally irresponsible.  Then, just 1 recession away, we'd have the retirement tax, AND we'd have the property taxes back.

This plan has several protections for low-income.  Social Security (or equivalents) are exempt.  Contributions to retirement are exempt.  PA Income Tax Forgiveness (already existing) can help cover the low end of income taxes.

The majority of retirees/seniors will pay less under House Bill 13. Those on SS-only will have a windfall.

Please consider that retirement is \*already taxed\* in PA. After all, someone with a $2500 property tax pays it out of their $20,000 Social Security check. It's effectively a 13% Social Security tax.  (You could also do the same math with retirement income.)

Happy to answer any other questions!

"Retirement income (Social Security) would be exempt, as well as contributions to SS.

Sales tax is only 2% on food/clothing, and still exempts SNAP payments and WIC foods.

"Please don‚Äôt listen to the below comments. Statistically speaking, Scranton crime is worse than Wilkes area. You are more likely to encounter a violent crime in Scranton (1 in 64) than in WB (1 in 168). I have lived in Downtown Los Angeles, New York, Florida, and other places, oftentimes by myself, and now that my main residence is in NEPA, I can say wholeheartedly, it‚Äôs a great place to live for low cost of living and natural beauty, but do look at the stats for the area you are thinking of moving to more than listening to locals. Because bias really shows itself anecdotally here. 

There are areas adjacent to Scranton/WB that are amazing places to put down roots. Pittston, Clarks Summit, Kingston, Forty Fort, Mountain Top, Old Forge, even Moosic has its pockets. 

Before I moved to where I live now, I asked many, many locals about that area, and they painted a f**ked up picture about drug dealers encroaching from NY/NJ area. They spoke of welfare-queens (??????) and some other irrelevant crap that had nothing to do with what I was asking about. When I actually moved there, I realized their takes were borne of racism or were from bad faith actors. Still can‚Äôt fully wrap my head around their logic. I live in one of the nicest streets I‚Äôve ever lived in. It is one of my favorite places I‚Äôve lived on the East Coast. I live next to doctors and lawyers. I feel safer here than I ever did walking downtown Scranton with groups of friends when going bar-hopping. Cannot say enough things about how and why I‚Äôm so happy here. But I‚Äôm also very antisocial, and I have to fly my friends and family into town if I want social calls. Most people need more human interaction than what I prefer. I digress. 

Long story short, be prepared for some BS when moving to NEPA. I personally feel it‚Äôs worth it, but only you know what you can put up with.

"From NJ so not sure what's in the Scranton Times:

* PA: Tracks appear to be in place from Scranton to the Delaware Water Gap, not sure of condition but I believe there are some tourist trains running on parts of it. Some existing stations are slated to be rehabbed, some new stations will be built, and parking will be expanded at certain stations.
* NJ: Tracks need to be re-laid from around that aqueduct that goes over I-80 by Exit 4 (TA Travel Station/Columbia) all the way to Port Morris where the original cut-off starts though almost all of it is a straight line. There's a mile or two of track built at Port Morris and you can see the end of it [here in Stanhope](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.915541,-74.6891872,3a,21.2y,132.66h,88.53t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spFIutpOq577iZ61lIQAMVQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). The original Cut-Off tracks were removed by Conrail in 1984. That right-of-way was under private ownership but NJ owns it now.

Mentioned in this thread is the 'people have been talking about it for years' but that Amtrak map listed Scranton so that's the first concrete thing in many years towards the possibility of this happening.

On a personal note, I live at the shore and would love to see this project completed, it'd be cool to ride a modern reincarnation of the Phoebe Snow, but NJ Transit isn't designed for intra-system travel so unless you're on the line that goes to the Cut-Off it probably won't be worth it. I have a train station in my town, but it'll probably take me 4-5 hours each way to go from my town to Scranton yet I can drive it in 2h 45m. Not to mention the cost; the closest I can get is Port Jervis. That's 4 hours each way and costs $46.50 round trip plus I'd have to get picked up and that's another hour each way. To go to Scranton would probably be $60+ round trip and be double the time than driving.",t2_4axkr,Tooch10,0,1645372531.0,0,t1_hxpr1ln,hxpr1ln,True,ComfortablePattern15,t3_srmgnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/srmgnf/scranton_to_nyc_train_does_anyone_have_any_more/,Scranton to NYC train.

In the 1980s it seems like the fire went out, the nickname among beer party teenagers at that time was ""the Moon"". Dirt bikes, quads and 4x4s still go in there. There are mining maps that show what's underneath that land.

"the black coal waste is called ""culm"", its the fine coal, coal dust, slate, and other waste from mining coal that was separated out in the breaker  


the breaker is a large structure where they sorted, graded, and cleaned coal  


the red piles are culm ash, left over after a culm dump burns, often ignited by accident   


it can contaminate ground water but other than that poses little threat  


they haven't been removed because it is literally millions of tons of material that would need to be transported and has no real practical uses. Also moving the culm would most likely  cause more pollution than just leaving it alone, its pretty much a case of ""let sleeping dogs lie""",t2_65zyd4q0,mikes47jeep,0,1644725685.0,0,t1_hwqk3p8,hwqk3p8,True,Significant_Data_576,t3_sr6lo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/sr6lo6/can_anyone_identify_what_this_is_coal_waste_pile/,Can anyone identify what this is (coal waste pile?),/r/Scranton/comments/sr6lo6/can_anyone_identify_what_this_is_coal_waste_pile/hwqk3p8/,5,r/Scranton,0,5

"**[Coal breaker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_breaker)** 
 
 >A coal breaker is a coal processing plant which breaks coal into various useful sizes. Coal breakers also remove impurities from the coal (typically slate) and deposit them into a culm dump. The coal breaker is a forerunner of the modern coal preparation plant. Coal tipples typically were used at bituminous coal mines, where removing impurities was important but sorting by size was only a secondary, minor concern.

>The total amount of coal refuse in Pennsylvania is unknown. Based on the known amount on abandoned mine lands and estimates of the amount of coal refuse associated with historical mining operations, the amount is between 200 million and 8 billion cubic yards. It has been speculated that the amount of coal refuse is approximately 2 billion cubic yards split almost equally between the anthracite and bituminous coal regions.

"For those who can‚Äôt access the article:

The city wants to spruce up Biden Street with a $4 million streetscape overhaul.

The plan proposes revamping sidewalks, curbs, intersections, crosswalks, streetlights and stormwater infrastructure of the busy downtown road, all toward making the half-mile, six-block stretch of Biden Street between Jefferson and Mifflin avenues more pedestrian friendly and visually attractive.

The city has applied for a $2 million grant from the state Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program and would match it with $2,005,412 in federal American Rescue Plan dollars for a $4 million streetscape project.

The plan calls for:

‚ñ† Installing traffic-calming, raised and colored concrete intersections, and crosswalks at all intersections.

‚ñ† Installing retro-style ‚Äúperiod‚Äù streetlights, with electrical wiring routed underground, similar to what was done years ago in the 100 block of Penn Avenue.

‚ñ† Constructing/repairing sidewalks and curbs on both sides of the street, with disabled-accessible curb cut ramps at all corners.

‚ñ† Creating bike lanes with signs.

‚ñ† Planting trees with rain gardens.

‚ñ† Improving stormwater management by separating combined sewer/stormwater lines underground.

‚ñ† Resurfacing the road.

‚ñ† Installing a lighted entrance sign for the Biden Street gateway into the downtown from the Biden Expressway from Interstate 81.

The city in July changed the names of the Central Scranton Expressway and Spruce Street to President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Expressway and Biden Street, respectively, in honor of the city native.

If the city gets the grant, phases for designs, permitting and bidding/contracting would run from April 2022 through July 2023, followed by construction starting in August 2023. Work is expected to take 15 months to complete.

Tom Grudis of Tom Grudis Optical, 424 Biden St., who has had his business there since 1988, was not aware of the streetscape plan but said it all sounds good. He wishes it could start sooner.

‚ÄúGo right ahead,‚Äù Grudis said of the proposal. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the last time anything (major) really was done.‚Äù

Damian Biancarelli, owner of Guy‚Äôs Barber Shop, 626 Biden St., also was not aware of the plan and said it sounds good ‚Äúon paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey say, ‚ÄòYou eat with your eyes first.‚Äô By that rationale, yeah it sounds great ‚Äî no wires and lights and all this stuff,‚Äù Biancarelli said. ‚ÄúIf it makes it more inviting to live downtown, that helps the businesses, that‚Äôs great. But whenever government decides to do something, I‚Äôm always curious about it because I want to know what‚Äôs it going to cost, really, when it all comes down to it. How‚Äôs it going to affect me or anybody else that has a business downtown.‚Äù

The idea of 15 months of construction also gave Biancarelli some cause for concern.

The Biden Street plan dovetails with a separate, $3.5 million streetscape improvement plan for the 100 and 200 blocks of Wyoming Avenue, said Eileen Cipriani, executive director of the city‚Äôs Office of Economic and Community Development.

In December, the city approved seeking $2.5 million in state Multimodal Transportation Fund grant money toward a $3,575,625 streetscape upgrade for Wyoming Avenue, between Lackawanna Avenue and Linden Street. If successful in getting this grant, the city would use ARP funds for the balance of this project, or $1,072,687, according to that grant application.

Improving the streetscape of the 100 and 200 blocks of Wyoming Avenue would help ‚Äúentice businesses to (go into) empty storefronts that have lingered vacant, thus creating new businesses in the city and job opportunities for residents,‚Äù this grant application says.

The Wyoming Avenue project also would involve upgrading stormwater infrastructure, constructing sidewalks and curb cuts, installing period street lighting with wiring underground, green infrastructure, bicycle lanes and road paving, according to the application.

‚ÄúWe started talking about Wyoming Avenue and how wide it is and how to make it more pedestrian-friendly and attract businesses, and Biden Street intersects there in a nexus,‚Äù Cipriani said of the two grant applications.

In both cases, the ARP funds can be used for stormwater infrastructure upgrades, she said.

Both projects also would accomplish goals of a larger ‚ÄúActive Transportation Plan‚Äù for improved safety and accessibility throughout the city.",t2_5moe2jjt,scootsypi,0,1644505492.0,0,t1_hwdh554,hwdh554,True,scootsypi,t3_sp8kzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/sp8kzm/scranton_wants_to_spruce_up_biden_street/,Scranton wants to spruce up Biden Street,/r/Scranton/comments/sp8kzm/scranton_wants_to_spruce_up_biden_street/hwdh554/,14,r/Scranton,0,14

So it's the difference between inside and outside that determines how long your heat will have to run before the temperature is reached and it can shut off - and how quickly it has to come back on again because your house fell below the thermostat temperature.",t2_613xi,Jackpot777,0,1644002541.0,0,t1_hvlmii3,hvlmii3,False,Mcdreamy7,t3_ski5zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/ski5zp/ridiculously_high_gas_bill_during_the_winter_even/,Ridiculously high gas bill during the winter even when no one is home!

"If you‚Äôre using the electric heaters to balance out the heat in your house that makes sense. It‚Äôll be cheaper to run a heater in a room on low then to set the thermostat at a higher temp to compensate for the rest of the house. The true problem you have is one of a few things. The mad insulation and windows allowing cold in, the thermostat is most likely not in the center of the house, and lastly is the house is spread o it there should be more then one zone. By zone I mean separate thermostats throughout the house. So say it‚Äôs cold in your back room where you work all the time you can set the thermostat to a higher temp and lower the one in the front/ upstairs where you spend less time. In this market your best bet is to fix the house up the best you can because ripping down and rebuilding right now is astronomical.

As a carpenter who also does electrical work I will tell you the most expensive way to heat your house is using electric. Especially with PPL raising the rates in December. There‚Äôs a reason most houses in the area are heated off natural gas: it‚Äôs the cheapest to heat your home with. I think your gas bill was so high was because January was so cold. Also a lot of utilities pro rate your usage til they can get an accurate reading on your meter. If this month was high there‚Äôs a chance next month will be cheaper to make up for it.
