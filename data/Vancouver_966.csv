"I have been treated like this before by Seattle Washington people.  One time I was in Seattle on vacation and shopping.  What happened was I was told by people there to leave and to never come back to Seattle;  I was threatened to such a degree that I was threatened to the point that if I stayed in Seattle for another day I would be killed.  For some reason, the whole city locked me out; I tried to go to the Space Needle and employees there told me to leave.  On top of that when I came back to Oregon, where I live I was pursued by someone that police in Oregon had to arrest.  Since then I have never went back except for going through the Seattle airport where again I was confronted by people from Seattle.  At the time, I told them that it is an airport and therefore federal property so they couldn’t do anything about it.  Again, they tried to hurt me but they were confronted by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) authorities and they were told to leave the airport.

"I wish the school board recorded their meetings, because back in September, after a high school teacher displayed a pride flag in support of her students, the nasties of Ridgefield came out in force against her during the public comment portion of meetings, and one time it got within an inch of an outright brawl.  You’d probably think twice about how “nice” Ridgefield is after seeing that.  That’s a bit of a different topic though, and those people are loud, but definitely don’t make up the majority of Ridgefield. There *are* a few too many of them, though. 

Let’s take the school bond. I belong to several groups that support it, and time and time again, the reasons people don’t support it have to do with their disdain for newcomers. They’ll outright say “I don’t want to put a penny into new schools that we only need because of all the new developments. Make them pay.”

Of course, they don’t understand one bit about how these things actually work, they’re just ticked that outsiders are making them pay a few more dollars in property tax.

Especially if you don't have kids, or go to church, or hang out in bars.

Move out to the country a bit and it becomes more difficult.  My SO is really into gardening and farmers' markets.  She's found that community to be pretty closed and standoffish.

"I've lived all over the country.

I would say that people in Vancouver/Portland are less outgoing than the South or Midwest, but not in a rude way. Probably equally as outgoing as the NE and Mid-atlantic.

I will say that the PNW probably leads the country in passive aggression. For example, in Boston if you took someone's parking spot after they shoveled it, they will personally confront you and tell you to fuck off. Here people will leave timid notes if you're parked in front of their house, but wouldn't dare confront you about it.

I find in professional settings you have to sugar coat stuff a bit more here than the east coast. People do not appreciate others that are direct with criticism, and prefer more gentle guidance.

"Don't shoot the messenger just answering your question -

Progressives tend to want ranked choice voting as they can feel they are not ""throwing away"" their vote by voting for a more progressive candidate that has limited shot of winning.

But the opposite is true as well - In heavily R areas, this means that more people can vote for far-right candidates without any fear of throwing away their vote.

Thus ranked choice voting emboldens change, which if it's the change you're seeking, great! But if it's the change you're not seeking, it could further push areas to fringes of political beliefs.",t2_8duvo,16semesters,0,1648145308.0,0,t1_i1yl86y,i1yl86y,False,portland_speedball,t3_tmgn7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/tmgn7f/effort_to_bring_ranked_choice_voting_to_clark/,Effort to bring ranked choice voting to Clark County kicks off,/r/vancouverwa/comments/tmgn7f/effort_to_bring_ranked_choice_voting_to_clark/i1yl86y/,3,r/vancouverwa,0,3

"I’m Latina and from LA originally as well ☺️. My husband and I spent some time in Vancouver last month looking for homes and are going back next month. Everyone was pretty friendly and didn’t feel uncomfortable in any of the neighborhoods in Vancouver proper. We had a lot of great conversations with people we met during our stay which solidified our choice to move. Also the sunsets were some of the best we’ve ever experienced! We also went to Camas and that was okay as well. 

I’d say the only place I had an issue was in Battle Ground. While looking at homes I got a lot of unfriendly stares from the ‘FJB’ and Trump flag folks in the areas we were looking at.

"I just want to point out the housing pricing and all issues going on do not fall on the sellers.   Sellers are simply looking for the best sale price based on the market. 

The issue has been hedge funds and investment companies running prices up as they see real estate as safer bets than the stock market.   Stock market has been heading for a crash because the same hedge funds have over shorted the market and are working together to avoid closing their positions.   

Almost all of the financial issues, terrible politics and inflation can be traced back to a few large hedge fund and market makers like Citadel.  They are the largest political donors. 

So let’s be mad at the right people, and continue to demand living wages from our employers.

"I guess my main point is the taxes are a small amount of that burden overall and are the only thing that provide any actual *services* for people. If people were paying 90% taxes on $30,000 a year and getting nothing of value in return to boot, we'd be in anarchy, of course. Instead, people are paying more than half of their income for the privilege of paying for insecure housing without a social safety net and have somehow been programmed to think that the enemy is continuing to provide minimal support for education, fire and medical safety or any other societal benefit. That somehow, taxes are the enemy and if taxes went away, the roads would somehow be paved, the police, fire, and medical services would be continue to exist out of the goodness of their own hearts, housing and food would be cheap and plentiful, and mana would fall from the sky. 

Taxes don't fund enough of these services as it is. We should be demanding these services and also demanding controls on anything that endangers us as a society. A dangerous society is one where the individuals have no stake in it, a society that only demands and never gives, a society with no reason for loyalty , community, or obligation, and leaves us to fight amongst ourselves for the scraps that fall from the tables of parasitic middlemen.

"Taxes have risen overall, but I'm talking about the City of Ridgefield assessment, not all taxes, as that was what was on the proposal. Also, the rate of tax increases has paled in comparison to the increased valuation of real estate and other costs. Again, underinvestment in education will not solve the problems of rising monthly costs. It only further starves the future and will ultimately end up in another McCleary-like decision where these costs must be paid. 

Nothing is free and I'm very concerned for anyone who can't afford to live in our society. I'm very happy to pay taxes to support those who cannot support themselves in this way. All children are included amongst that population and a city that will not support basic needs of its population (fire, safety, education, infrastructure) will simply cease to function as a city. Rail about rising costs, but not at the very pillars of civilization. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty pessimistic that real estate will ever be generally affordable in my lifetime. Personally, I think things are going to have to break in a big way. The concentration of wealth and lack of any social control over property ownership is such that billionaires and investment firms could easily make us all company towns within a generation. My neighbor's rent increased 50% in 2 years and he can be given something like 3 weeks notice to vacate. I'm one of the senior homeowner's for blocks around and I've only lived here about 20 years.

">Let's put that into context. From the Ridgefield city government website: ""Property taxes for the City of Ridgefield are currently $0.7247/$1,000 of assessed value for 2022."" For a $150k home, that's a little over $100 a year. For a $400k home, that's just under $300 a year. That's going from about $9 a month to about $24 a month.


Your math is completely wrong. Like by magnitudes.

https://clark.wa.gov/treasurer/tax-rates

https://smartasset.com/taxes/washington-property-tax-calculator#xZoCcwY9kj

In the above example, property taxes went from roughly 125 a month to 400 a month. 275 extra a month might seem like a little to you, but that's a decent chunk of change for a lot of people who used to live in a sleepy farm town.

"Let's put that into context. From the Ridgefield city government website: ""Property taxes for the City of Ridgefield are currently $0.7247/$1,000 of assessed value for 2022."" For a $150k home, that's a little over $100 a year. For a $400k home, that's just under $300 a year. That's going from about $9 a month to about $24 a month. 

There is both a profound public interest and a constitutional obligation, as found in the McCleary Decision, to fund public education and these numbers are by no means unreasonable. The increase in taxes may be ""incredible"" if you look at a percentage or how it's changed alongside other increases in costs, like inflation. However, in real terms, these examples are not significant increases. 

I understand you are trying to put it into perspective of the people who are voting no on these increases and you're probably not far off in your assessment. The anti-tax sentiment in Washington, especially rural areas, is very strong. However, I prefer to call it anti-civilization, as the outcome is inevitably fewer and poorer services, failing infrastructure, and dying towns.

> At last night’s board meeting, I presented a list of likely changes starting in the 2022-2023 school year to the board of directors. Below is a summary of those changes, and you can also access the slideshow presentation online here. 
> 
> * Ridgefield school attendance zone shifts to balance enrollments at Union and South Ridge Elementary schools 
> 
> * You can view maps of the four proposed plans in this slideshow presentation 
> 
> * Converting extracurricular and elective spaces
> 
> * Wrestling room and Black Box Theater at Sunset Ridge/View Ridge converted to classroom space
> 
> * Room 311 (mini commons) at RHS converted to classroom space
> 
> * Some secondary teachers move to cart-based instruction
> 
> * Shift 5th grade back to elementary schools (starting with 2023-2024 school year) 
> 
> * Elementary sites are currently overcrowded, necessitating a scheduling shift AM/PM schedule
> 
> To be clear, these are not changes that we are eager to make. It is simply the reality we are facing as our already record enrollments continue to grow and our classroom capacities remain unchanged. If we cannot build additional classrooms, adjustments are required to alleviate overcrowding.

"If you have the option to work from home more than 50% of the time, it can be worth it to not pay income tax by living in Vancouver. 

If you can’t do that, explore the option of a flex schedule that allows you to leave Vancouver by ~6am, and leave the city by ~2:30 pm. 3pm in my experience is when the traffic really escalates, but if you can be at the front end of it, it’s not SO bad.

The traffic is awful, I’ve done that drive for years. If there’s an accident on or near either bridge, you can pretty much forget about getting to work that day. Traffic will be backed up throughout the city for hours after. This doesn’t happen TOO often, but it’s definitely a problem.

In winter months the drive feels worse because it’s dark when you sit in traffic on the way, and dark when you when sit in traffic on the way home.

Ultimately, it’s doable, but be prepared for that experience every. day. and definitely have audiobooks, podcasts, etc. that you really like banked up.

"Crazy story time!

I had the exact same thing happen to me. Both tires flat. Only I was up on some godforsaken road by Ape Cave.... yeah. No signal, it was getting dark. I was starting to freak out a bit when out of nowhere these folks driving THE EXACT SAME CAR AS ME pulled over and was like ""how can we help?!""

They let me borrow their spare, didn't ask me for anything, and helped me get them on before it got dark. They followed me back into town and only then did they tell me that they were from North Seattle. They willingly gave me their spare to borrow knowing that I lived no where near them. 

What's even crazier is that a week later when I went to bring the spare back to them, I was going to meet them in N. Seattle around the time they got home from their statewide adventure. Around Olympia I started to feel tired, so I grabbed the first exit I saw and there was a Starbucks right there. 

I texted them to ask when they were planning to be home, and they said they were running a little behind because they had to stop. I said me too, and that I needed caffeine so I stopped at Starbucks. They said ""Yeah same!""

Then I asked, ""which one are you at""

They said near Olympia. I asked which road. The road I was on. I asked if it was near the same cross streets, they said Yeah. 

I'll be damned if they weren't parked three cars away from me, getting Starbucks at the same exact time and place as me.

"We lived there too and it was not my worst  apartment experience

I mean other than apartment neighbours you can't choose. Lady kept dinging our car with her walker.

And we were in front of the garbage drop off but we still had to pay for the pickup every week when we would've rather just saved the money and done it ourselves LOL 

And my code never worked on the mail locker system, but it was brand new at the time.

And one time they were testing fire alarms and my husband and I worked night shifts so we were asleep and they barged into the apartment with their dirty shoes because we didn't hear them knocking. While we were sleeping and an alarm was going off. Can say that they got an eyefull  because my husband doesn't wear clothes to bed LOL 

Think there was also a thing where you didn't just pay your own water bill, you split the bill with the entire building? If I'm remembering the right apartment.

Hated the gate because it did nothing except delay you getting in and out. It stops no one if they really want to get in LOL did like the back exit the most.

Also no one knows how to fold their cardboard even though there's a super cool cardboard bin. But people out trash in it. And no one recycled properly ever just threw trash into whatever recycle bin they wanted.

"This is a thread I can service.  I'm fat and lack the ability to spend stacks of money compounded with a lack of time

Youskyme has weekday lunch specials until 2 - they are A, B, C and D - they are all great and so worth it that when I bought a house a million years ago, I bought it close enough to youskyme for that reason.  I prefer my teriyaki to come with steamed veggies instead of a pre-mix salad with a container of dressing like most places do.

MOD Pizza is affordable all day long but they are worth mentioning.

Chuck's often has a weekly rotating deli deal that's good (sometimes its a burger).

Most Chinese places have a cheap lunch special (Golden Palace in BG has an amazing like 7 dollar lunch that will give me a meal and a half).

King Kong Korean BBQ is 19.99 for all you can eat meats at lunch (smaller menu but just as filling) - this place is my favorite way to eat AYCE at a great price and get quality food. Ends at 3pm

As mentioned, Taco Bell's box is well worth it for filling you up for the money.

ANY fast food app is going to give you promotional offers.  At one point I was buying bacon cheeseburgers from BK and getting a kids meal for $1 (with any purchase)... so for 3 bucks I had 2 bacon cheeseburgers and a regular cheeseburger (or nugs), fries and a drink... oh and a toy.

Most places will look up how many ""shop hours"" the car maker, insurance, or both say a job should take, and most (reputable and insured) shops will charge that. If it takes less, they make the extra: if it takes longer, they eat the difference in labor. Sometimes they pay two people to do the job in half the time, but 2.5 hours times two people is still 5 hours of labor.

"You can either work with a realtor or schedule a meeting with a local builder. Our realtor was like 90% useless during the process but might be easier because they can schedule meetings for you. The builders around Clark County are New Tradition, Lennar, Pacific Lifestyle, Kingston etc.... There's 2 ways you can build. 1) you can buy land and have the builder build you home on the land. This option is more expensive obviously but you'll have more freedom in your options. 2.) Build in a community that's already being built. So they'll tell you which communities there building in and you can look at which lots are available and which Build plans will go on that lot.

* Slow fox has great food, and not just chili! Lunch can be had for under 15$ and is super high quality. Specials change daily to weekly and are some the best things that Chef Derek Saner, a Kentucky transplant to the area makes.
* Pho Haven has a great Banh Mi (In many different varieties!) for 6$
* A slice of Pizza at Hungry Sasquatch is pricey at around 7$, but is huge so one is usually a decent lunch
* Chicken Teriyaki comes with rice and salad for about 10$ at Ichi Teriyaki 27 near Esther Short. I like their spicy teriyaki the best!
* City Sandwich offers deli staple sandwiches for about 12$
* Nonavo has 3-4 options of personal sized (about 10 inches) for $10-13
* A pound of tasty buffalo wings at Shanahan's runs 12$ <--must be 21+ since its a bar
* A delicious Bacon Cheeseburger from Pauls with fries runs about 12$ A diner cheeseburger done right!!
* Weiner Wagon has hot dog staples included some seriously loaded hot dogs all for under 6$ Robin the owner is a community treasure!
* Hidden House market is a great scratch kitchen ran by two downtown residents who previously catered food for private jets. Most items are below 15$, menu changes weekly, and only open Thur-Sat but worth the trip!! Most food is New American, their facebook has up to date menus.
* Muchas Gracias is not glamorous, but for under $10 you can get a filling burrito fix downtown
* A torta from Little Conejo runs under 15$, also serving up Tortas is El Burrito Mujado in the former Sunrise Bagels space for under 12$.

"> Any grouping of 10 or more homes within clark county are required to have an HOA.

directly contradicts

>  There are always some exceptions

It's either every  or it is not.  And, as far as I am aware it is illegal to retroactively add an HOA to a neighborhood unless every homeowner agrees to it, so unless they never built neighborhoods with 10 or more houses in the past, I'm sure there are plenty of houses in neighborhoods that are not part of HOAs.  It's been 15 years since I bought my house, but I know for a fact that we were looking at houses in neighborhoods of more than 10 houses that were not part of HOAs.  So, unless they turned them all into HOAs in the past 15 years, they are out there.",t2_8e29z,BranWafr,0,1647929208.0,0,t1_i1mpfr8,i1mpfr8,False,CodePDX,t3_tjnjlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/tjnjlt/third_week_in_a_row_getting_beat_out_by_a_100k/,Third week in a row getting beat out by a $100k above asking price offer on a home.

For real. This guy acts like my two investment houses is a threat to the huge multinational firms investing in downtown already. If anything I’m helping the problem. I bought an absolute shit hole that has taken months to renovate in downtown. I used only local contractors and we’ve done a ton of work ourselves. We’ll use a hyper local property management company when we’re done.

"Looking at your post history I see that you have a brand new 2021 Subaru Forester maybe instead of complaining about housing prices you should probably save your money up and invest in something that doesn’t depreciate immediately once in your driveway. 

Investments- stocks, crypto, real estate, education.

"As of the most recent count there are a little under 15,000 houses available within the United States. Do you know where these houses are? They aren't here. They're most often located within cities or towns that aren't popular or growing, think of random homes in Nebraska, Oklahoma or Wyoming.


Be my guest, move there and tell me all about the opportunities about living in Topeka Kansas or Sheridan Wyoming while you live in a house.
