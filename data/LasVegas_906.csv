"Ellis Island Super 8 Motel is an OK place if you're looking to save $$$ on rooms, but (like most Super 8s), it's in a sketchy area, worse after-dark.     The LV Strip isn't a far walk, but it's not a safe, pleasant walk at night (which doesn't mean that people don't do it), and consider how hot it may be (day & night) during the time of your visit.  Uber/Lyft won't really like bidding on a ride between Ellis Island & let's say Bally's or MGM Grand on the Strip because the ride would be very short -- they'd rather bid on someone looking for a longer ride.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Tuscanny is a much nicer place, a little further from the Strip.   Larger/more spread-out, cleaner & this is subjective, but nicer clientele.  

&#x200B;

 Fremont Street Experience area is fun, but a totally different vibe than the LV Strip area.

"Before looking too down on these people, understand the United States economy/labor dichotomy is absolutely brutal. Wages are extremely low across the board and strong unions are basically a thing of the past. Remember, also, we don‚Äôt have universal healthcare, so even if someone has a good job and some money in the bank, it can take exactly one serious illness in the family or unforeseen accident or job loss to wholly and completely wipe everything they‚Äôve ever saved out at the snap of a finger. Last study over 60% of Americans didn‚Äôt have 1000 bucks in the bank. Add to that the fact that people with limited means with mental illnesses have very few options as far as care and housing and this is just what it is. Most of these people have absolutely no options or chance to break out of their situation.",t2_476v0rdg,Marsupialize,0,1648225187.0,0,t1_i22yimw,i22yimw,True,kotyzap,t3_tnmr33,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/tnmr33/the_biggest_shock_in_lv_for_me_as_a_european_why/,"The biggest shock in LV for me as a European - Why are there so many homeless people allowed to beg, smoke weed, and ""Chill & watch Netflix"" while begging on LV streets?

"No. Because that's individuous discrimination in violation of the law. There are public spaces everyone is entitled to access like streets, sidewalks, libraries, parks, etc. Any law that restricts access to these spaces must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest because these are traditionally free speech zones. The law must be facially and content neutral too. So on the strip for example, there are ordinances that prohibit people from putting bags, tables, obstructions on the sidewalk and from impeding the flow of traffic and to reduce the chances of terrorism. The law applies equally to everyone regardless of their politics or housing situation. With the flood channels, access is restricted to everyone equally. Accordingly anyone found there is a trespasser in violation of the law and there is probable cause to remove them and detain them. If you want to get people off the sidewalk then it has to be all people. No more military ROTC drives. No more firefighter boot collections. No more girl scout cookies. Even then the law would be unconstitutionally overbroad because there is a long standing tradition of sidewalks being a public space and removing homeless people from our sight is not a compelling interest in the way fighting terrorism and crowd safety are.",t2_ifh4bmot,duderanchjuvenilia,0,1648225182.0,0,t1_i22yi3u,i22yi3u,False,kotyzap,t3_tnmr33,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/tnmr33/the_biggest_shock_in_lv_for_me_as_a_european_why/,"The biggest shock in LV for me as a European - Why are there so many homeless people allowed to beg, smoke weed, and ""Chill & watch Netflix"" while begging on LV streets?

"Shipping cars in the US is kinda a nightmare to handle yourself. Highly suggest trying to work with the dealership to organize shipping if you‚Äôre that sold on the the truck and it‚Äôs new. If not be prepared to pay 1-2k depending on if you want open or closed shipping. 99% of the people you speak with will be the brokers, they have basically zero obligations to you, read any contract completely especially if you need the vehicle delivered by a certain date. Often they will have a 5 day to even 2 weeks I‚Äôve see for a ‚Äúpick up window‚Äù where they basically have you under contract that they are looking for your transport. All the brokers use the same listing platforms and they will all lie through their teeth to get you to lock down and get you to sign.

"Surprisingly, we see a lot of cars with MA plates here. Probably most other than CA. Hahaha as I‚Äôm typing this, the car in front of me has MA plates. Unreal. Something about moving or traveling cross country from corner to corner...

"The fuck?!

1) why would you not leave them with the park rangers? 

2) you passed a family that could potentially be looking for their keys, either before or after and didn't think to notify them or the rangers? 

3) are you expecting them to have a reddit profile and DM you? 

I get that this post was made with good intentions (returning the keys). 

But you just made things so hard for them 

If they were renting a car, I'm sure they had to pay an exhorbirant fine. If they are local they probably had to either toe their car or pay a crazy amount to taxi or wait for a friend to take them back. And now that the keys are in Vegas (my guess) pay to request another friend to take them back. 

If you didn't know what to do, you could have googled it as well, but in no way is this convenient for anyone. 

Best case would have been to leave the keys at the ranger station on the exit (either one, they have radios) or visitor center.",t2_15qluw,sam_sam_01,0,1648183475.0,0,t1_i210xmi,i210xmi,False,guapomole4reals,t3_tn8u1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/tn8u1k/lost_keys_in_valley_of_fire/,Lost Keys in Valley of Fire,/r/LasVegas/comments/tn8u1k/lost_keys_in_valley_of_fire/i210xmi/,4,r/LasVegas,0,4

"In my experience, as a former pool worker myself at the Aria, most pools have first-come-first-serve chairs located around the pool.  These typically won't fill up 100% so you'll always have a seat, it may just not be right on the water.

There is typically some reserved seating, anywhere from $15-25 USD, and then you have cabanas and daybeds.  Daybeds are normally just plusher, they don't come with extra amenities besides the space.  On the Strip, cabanas usually come with a fridge, a table and some chairs or a daybed, and your own server for things like food and drinks (these are best reserved if you have a party who would appreciate the extra service).  Of course, food and drinks are charged separately from the reservation price: they usually aren't included.

I wouldn't stress too hard about simply going down to the pool to find a seat, especially this early in the year!",t2_2y6sjm4a,SkylordParadise,0,1648145802.0,0,t1_i1ymh1c,i1ymh1c,True,dande09,t3_tmmzya,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/tmmzya/pool_question/,Pool question!,/r/LasVegas/comments/tmmzya/pool_question/i1ymh1c/,2,r/LasVegas,0,2

"CX from airport Level 0 to downtown. I use CX since it gets me to downtown and the strip quickly compared to the Deuce from the airport.

https://rtcws.rtcsnv.com/routepdf/cx.pdf

Take Deuce from downtown to Strip.

You can also take the free Downtown Loop bus to get to the Strat.

There are free trams between hotels at Treasure Island and Mirage. Bellagio to Aria and Excalibur to Luxor to Mandalay Bay.

Depending on where you are on the Strip, take CX back to the airport from Tropicana and Las Vegas Boulevard or Deuce to the South Strip Transfer Terminal and take bus 109 to the airport from Bay 18

"Realtor here. I would say take some time to find out where you want to live and buy. Right now you need to be more qualified to get a rental than to get a mortgage, especially with dogs. My lenders keep telling me that interest rates are going to skyrocket. From what I can see, so are prices. Buying is going to be a tricky process right now, and with the amount of competition, you're going to need a lot of money to outbid other buyers, but hey rentals have a lot of competition too. The difference is, your mortgage is going to be the same payment, whereas your rent is going to rise.

"For an out-of-towner unfamiliar with Vegas, the Strip is the only thing you see. On the street, it's just as dirty as Downtown, but celebrities and social media influencers aren't posting pictures of the street. They're at the clubs, in the suites, at the pools or in front of the landmarks.

The Vegas that people see in social & traditional media is glamour, parties, and luxury. And while you can have more fun for your money Downtown, it's never* going to be glamorous or luxurious or look sexy on social media.

The resorts on the Strip have all of that. The average person can't afford anything close - they're going to get a half-cleaned room with a view of the hotel's HVAC system, overpriced entry to a club that's standing-room only, and blow half a month's rent on booze.

But the appeal of the Strip is the same lie that Vegas has been telling people for decades - come here and you'll be a winner.

Downtown just can't compete - at least not to the many, many tourists who are booking a trip based solely on the experience they've been promised on social media.

All that being said, Downtown is way more fun - especially for people who don't want to drop thousands of dollars on a weekend trip.
