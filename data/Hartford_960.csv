"I think the “partial view” refers to if you were sitting at the very outer edge of 100 or 300 for example. You’ll be looking at the stage from an angle and have a “partial view” of the stage as a result (won’t see the full stage).

And from the Vivid Seats help section:

“Zone Seating” refers to tickets for seats that are guaranteed to be within the listed Section and/or Row or a better Section and/or Row. Zone Seating ticket listings are notated as such.

While sellers can guarantee a specific seating range at the time of listing, they are often unable to determine the specific Section and/or Row until they receive the tickets from the venue box office, team, or artist.

I believe I know the building you’re referring to. On that side it’s not too bad you will be fine walking around going towards downtown I believe bushnell park is right there as well.

"Within Hartford, you have some breweries, baseball games, a small food hall, small art venues, Puerto Rican restaurants, but honestly it's a bit limited if you're used to a mid-size or larger city with different districts to explore. There are some sort of interesting suburban towns you could walk around, like Old Wethersfield is kind of neat and West Hartford is a typical wealthy strip.

I would take the CT Rail to New Haven and hang out there. It's an $8 ticket I think, very easy train ride.  That city has more stuff.

From there maybe it is easier to explore some of the coastline areas, bike paths, and forested areas too, since there's a commuter rail network that would take you to some hiking/beach areas and the Farmington Canal Trail runs through New Haven (it doesn't go through Hartford, it runs kind of far to the west). 

If you're adventurous I recommend biking to Northampton MA from New Haven (or somewhere midway like Farmington). You might be able to hop the train from there too to get back to Hartford or New Haven.

From New Haven, you could also hop down to some of the other towns like Greenwich or up the coast if you wanted to explore more urban areas.",t2_5545psis,HartfordResident,0,1646979316.0,0,t1_i07krlw,i07krlw,True,nader0903,t3_tb2hji,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hartford/comments/tb2hji/what_to_do_in_hartford_for_a_long_weekend/,What to do in Hartford for a long weekend?,/r/Hartford/comments/tb2hji/what_to_do_in_hartford_for_a_long_weekend/i07krlw/,1,r/Hartford,0,1

Asylum Ave busses run every 20 to 25 minutes. The 72 will drop you off on Asylum and Elizabeth and then you have about a 5 minute walk to campus. The 72F will bring you nearly up to the doorstep of the school, but is less frequent.

Just get off the train and wait for the first bus in the corner of Asylum and High street, it'll be there within 10 minutes and you'll be on your way.

Your best bet to find a quick bus back to the train station is to walk to Farmington ave. But if you check the transit app when your leaving you might get lucky and snag a 72F right outside and not have to walk far.

I've lived right next to UConn Law for over 5 years and commute by bus downtown for work.

"So I cannot believe this has happened to us again, for the second time this year.

Very friendly but skinny and not neutered. I'm guessing he's about a year or so old, seems like a young adult. Anybody in CT know of a cat matching that description that could be missing?


Update for anyone interested: he does not have a microchip and the vet guesses he is probably a stray. They think he's pretty young but aren't sure of exact age without an exam.  I've also reached out to animal control in Hartford and shelters in surrounding towns and no one has contacted them about him, but a few said they'd post him on facebook, etc. We're going to set up a vet exam for him, and if we don't have any contacts from my posts or the local shelters in the next week or so, we'll be looking for a new home for him :) Let me know if you're interested in adoption!",t2_9q8sc,organizedchaos927,0,1644944237.0,0,t1_hx203wh,hx203wh,True,organizedchaos927,t3_st7iti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hartford/comments/st7iti/anyone_near_the_capitol_missing_a_cat/,Anyone near the Capitol missing a cat?,/r/Hartford/comments/st7iti/anyone_near_the_capitol_missing_a_cat/hx203wh/,2,r/Hartford,0,2

"I'd like to piggy back off of this - I live in 777 now and am actually moving out next week, only because I'm relocating to Seattle. If I was not relocating, I'd renew my lease for sure.

The building is secure - you need to fob in to get in any entrance. There's also a concierge during the day and security at night who know the residents well. There's also security outside on the weekend nights to assist if you have to get to or from your car at night. With that being said, you can go through the basement directly to the parking garage without stepping foot outside which is especially helpful in bad weather. 

While I can hear my neighbor during the day (she plays instruments) it's always very quiet at night, never had any issues.

The gym is kept very clean.

Never had issues with mail or packages being stolen.

The only complaint I'd have is the dog relief area isn't always kept clean (shame on the owners for not picking up after their dogs) but this won't affect you in any way if you don't have a dog.

"I live in 915 Main St.  Avoid living here if at all possible.

Like to know your neighbors?  You're going to know them super well considering how thin the walls are.  There used to be tenant who lived here who would play loud music with heavy bass until like 4am.  I like music.  I do not like the feeling of my pillow vibrating as I try to sleep.  It took the building 6 months to evict them for breaching their lease (it says in the lease that you can't disturb other tenants).

Like working gym equipment?  I've put a work order in to fix the rowing machine in the basement every 2 weeks for the past year and it hasn't been fixed yet.

Like air conditioning?  The central air and heat are controlled by the building.  You have a thermostat, but AC and heat are only available certain months of the year.  This fall, they turned off the AC when it was still 75 degrees outside.  The windows in the apartments are large, but only a small section at the bottom opens.  It was 88 degrees in my apartment for 2 weeks because even though it's 75 outside, the sun bakes through the giant windows and cooks you alive.

Like the homeless sleeping in your lobby?  That one speaks for itself.

I will be leaving the very instant my lease ends.  Do not move here, trust me.  I know the price is low - it's low for a reason.  You'd be better off spending a little more and living somewhere much nicer.

We literally just had our deadliest year in almost 20 years. And I never compared it to NYC or Chicago I shared REAL experiences right here in my city, my community, things I have witnessed or gone through myself. And I didn’t say not to come I gave them advice on how to be safe. The only thing you are right about is I’m afraid of my community because I have CHILDREN that I don’t want to die. I have children that I want to live for. My unborn son and my daughter could have been taken from me when the driver of the stolen car almost killed us. My community didn’t care about my life. And yes that scares me because a woman I know died cooking in her kitchen in her own home because of the recklessness of people who decided an argument over something trivial was worth more than a life. Bullets don’t have names. That scares me. It has nothing to do with race as you tried to frame it because I myself am not white and has everything to do with the facts and the yearning to feel safe.

I live in the north end (Albany Ave) and we hear gunshots constantly. A cop was trying to help a man in a parking lot across the street from my kids school and he shot at her with no warning for no reason. Turns out he had murdered a woman in her apartment the night before a block away from my house. A 3 year old was shot and killed in a drive by blocks away. It turned into a months long retaliation war. Just a few days ago a man was shot on my street and two more blocks away (related shootings) one died. My good friends brother and his friend were killed a block away. A 16 year old boy was shot and killed visiting the memorial site for his friend who was also shot and killed. The gas station I live next to has a bullet hole in their Pepsi cooler and has had to replace their door multiple times. Drug addicts are in abundance here. My daughter once went out to see what the weather was like to get ready for school and a naked man was running down the street. I almost died in a hit and run accident literally the next street down from my apartment because I was driving my daughter to her bus stop and a stolen car ran the red light and t boned me then took off. I was pregnant and had a child in the car. Some nights when I get home from work I can’t even get out of my car because someone is at my window harassing me. I’ve watched literal children almost get run over because cars run the red light while a crossing guard is crossing them to school. Visiting is ok. Don’t look anyone in the eye. Remain vigilant at all times. No headphones in. Don’t stop and talk to anyone. Be gone before night falls. And be especially careful crossing the street just because the walk light is on doesn’t mean they will stop. And as far as how it got this reputation in the first place? It earned it.

Oh and you are right ""people"" don't live in Hartford as long as you ignore the fact it is the third largest city in the state with over 100,000 people. But it is easy to forget that when you live in one of, if not the, most segregated state in the country and the non-""people"" who live in the city are overwhelming non-white. It is also easy to ignore the non-""people"" who live in the town in the state with the lowest median income in the state with the highest median income.

Oh more things:
Harriet Beecher Stowe house
Mark Twain house
You could get your pilot's license at the Brainard airport. 
Yard Goats have the best minor league baseball stadium in the country.

Moved to West Hartford six months ago from CA and it's a very nice area. If you're down for a short commute then look around the Blue Back square for apartments. You'll have a ton of walkable spots and the night life isn't clubs and bars but it's good restaurants and good beer and drinks.

Max Downtown is great.  They actually have one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Also expensive.

Someone mentioned Peppercorns, that's a good place too.  Dino is quite the character!  Parking can be complicated.

Salute is also good for Italian.  Just down the street from the Hilton.

"I was experiencing the same thing when I first moved back from FL. 

I tend to imagine that during winter, I am an amphibious animal (like a frog/toad) and I need to protect my skin by covering myself in a layer of goo (moisturizer.) Those kind of animals always need to be near water, they need humidifiers or timed water sprayers to keep them moist and hydrated. 

Being from down south, your skin may be going through a sort of shock since it’s not used to the cold air up here, which means you need to take extra care to keep it hydrated. 

When you get out of the shower, don’t immediately dry yourself with a towel. Take the time to moisturize your skin with a good medicated lotion or oil (like jojoba/ vitamin e oil) Allow your skin to air dry so your skin can absorb the moisture. 

If it’s really cold, you have to moisturize yourself before you expose your skin to the cold air outside. Shea butter and coconut oil works great for this because they create that layer and act as a barrier between your skin and the cold. Especially for your face. 

Don’t forget about your scalp either. Before you shampoo, do a 15 minute scalp treatment. Take an oil or other moisturizing product of your choosing and rub it throughout your hair and scalp, taking care to distribute it evenly. Allow it to sit on the scalp for 10-15 minutes and then take a shower like normal and wash it out. 

Because you’re constantly using all these oils, moisturizers, you may wanna wash your clothes a bit more often, as they can soil a bit more quickly.

"I shower 2-3 times per week, also get itchy dry skin in winter despite being a pasty girl from the north. 

Make sure whatever you use says ""moisturizing"", including on your face. You can also look up videos about using lotion, plastic bags, and socks gloves to do a deeper infusion overnight - greasy but worth it to solve an existing skin thing.

 Check your existing soaps for phlalates and parabens (or however tf you spell them) that can cause drying and switch out to something without those chemicals, and considering putting a basic filter on your showerhead. (These made a big difference for me.) 

Cover your skin before going out in cold weather, if not with fabric then with some kind of balm that the dry ass air can thieve from your skin instead of its actual moisture. This is necessary for my hands, nose, and lips or they will crack.

"I got married last June, not in Hartford but a neighboring town.  We had to bring our marriage license application to the town hall (the town you will be married in) with our supporting documents and then make an appointment to sign in person together.

It cost $150 for less than 20 minutes total.  If we wanted a longer more complicated ceremony I think it would have still cost the same but I believe each JOtP sets their own prices.

I think you need to get a permit through the City of Hartford events office if you want to do photos and/or your ceremony in city hall. If I remember correctly you can get the permit online or over the phone. 

The officiant signs the marriage license after the ceremony and then one of you returns it to city hall. 

A couple days later, you can  order copies of your marriage certificate from the vital records office online or in person. This is the document you use to prove your marital status going forward.

"You will not be provided an officiant, so you will have to arrange to show up at City Hall with a justice of the peace or whoever you want to provide that service. 

You go inside and submit the necessary paperwork and fees to the person at the desk in Vital Records. You then get a marriage license that is valid for 65 days after. 

I don’t believe City Hall provides you with space for this but I would call ahead and ask if maybe you could do it in one of the lobbies or something (since it’s cold.)

If not then you could always do it right outside the steps or underneath the “Stegosaurus” sculpture next to City Hall, or maybe Bushnell Park? 

After you exchange vows and do whatever ceremony you’re gonna do, your officiant will go back inside with the signed license and Vital Records will verify everything. Your officiant will come back out with your paperwork and after that you’re good to go.

"Yes, big difference - West Hartford the town shares a boarder with the city of Hartford. 

West Hartford is pretty well known to be safe, has a lot of people that make a good living and it now has become a moving destination for people in and out of the state. 

Depending on your budget you find a good rental within West Hartford, they maybe a little cheaper in areas of town where it’s closer to Hartford or Newington. 

Then there’s the “West End” neighborhood of Hartford, maybe that’s what you were getting confused - it’s closer to West Hartford.

It really depends on what you like or are looking for, some people will tell you West Hartford is the absolute best and some people will tell you it’s overrated, overpriced and full of snobby rich people.

"You'll have Downtown Hartford to yourself after 5 -- it closes down completely unless there's an event at the XL Center. And it's much worse since the pandemic started with so many fewer people working in the office buildings. Museums (including the Mark Twain house, CT Science Center, & Wadsworth Athaeneum) won't be open after 5 during the week. And many restaurants aren't open on Monday or Tuesday. Definitely check the times before you set out for any venue since you're not likely to happen to find someplace open just by wandering around. Downtown is not unsafe in the early evening, but you also don't want to be wandering aimlessly.

But here are some ideas:

Downtown dining options include Max Downtown, Trumbull Kitchen, & Salute are popular but more upscale restaurants. Agave Grill and Black-Eyed Sally's are more casual.

In Bushnell Park, free ice skating at the outdoor rink starts November 26 and is open until 8 pm. Skate rentals are also free.

Hartford Stage is the live theater venue downtown, and XL Center has hockey and basketball going on right now, from the UConn teams and the minor league Wolf Pack.

The Bushnell is Hartford's big performing arts venue (orchestra, ballet, theater, lectures), and Infinity Music Hall is another live music venue, with some restaurants nearby.

Link operates a rental electric scooter program in Hartford. You need their app ([https://www.link.city/hartford)](https://www.link.city/hartford).

If you have a car or can use uber/lyft:

Parkville Market is CT's first food hall and is open until at least 8 pm on weekdays (some days as late as midnight). Lots of places to choose from, young & energetic crowd.

Real Art Ways is near Parkville Market and is a center for the arts with documentary films, music performances, galleries.

There are a couple of breweries worth checking out: City Steam (right downtown), Hog River Brewing (close to Parkville Market), Thomas Hooker at Colt Gateway.

Cinestudio is an arthouse movie theater on the Trinity College campus.

In West Hartford, the area near Farmington Avenue & LaSalle Road has lots of restaurants and nightlife. Blue Back Square is also nearby with more dining and shopping.
