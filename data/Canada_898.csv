"So I work for a telematics company for one of the big auto manufacturers and I will say that it really doesn't matter what sort of car you have, or how its started.  Thieves are going to get in and they are going to steal your car.

Some advice from someone who helps recover these stolen vehicles.

1. Don't leave your keyfob near the vehicle when you're in the house.  If the key is within a certain range they can simply get in and drive off.  The best advice I've heard is to keep your keyfob on your nightstand because if you ever have someone break in, setting off the panic button on your fob to set off your car alarm is a great way to get them to GFTO.
2. Don't leave a spare key in the glove box.  We get SO many calls from people who have done this and got their vehicle stolen.
3. Don't ever leave your vehicle running if you started it with the key in range.  Once started, the vehicle no longer checks for the key until its shut off and then started again.  That means even if you take the key inside with you, someone can get into the vehicle and drive away and keep driving till it runs out of gas.  Starting your car remotely (ie to warm it up),  without the key in range is different, in most cases they can't take it out of park until its started with the key in range so that's ok.   ( also if you're going on a long trip ALWAYS make sure you have the key with you.  In most cases you won't be able to get it started to drive it if they key is not in range and it sucks being 100 miles from your key ).
4. Invest in a TILE tracking device.  Invest in a few, they're not that expensive.  Put one on your keyfob so if you lose it, you can find it, and hide one in your car as well.  That way if its stolen and they manage to disable the manufacturer's tracker, you can still find it in a lot of cases.
5. Sign up for whatever telematics service is available to your vehicle.  Ford has Ford Link, Chrysler is Uconnect I think, GM is Onstar.  Almost every auto company has this now.  Too often we get calls from people who's vehicle has been stolen and we can't help them because without that subscription we often won't have a connection to the vehicle to interact with it.  Also, you can't just pay to get it reconnected remotely.  In a lot of cases  the only way to connect to it is for someone to press the telematics button inside the vehicle, which you can't do if its been stolen.  ( you also can't do this if you've locked your keys in the car ).
6. When you sign up make sure you are aware of everything that's available, like can you get an sms notification if the theft alarm is triggered.  With some, you can even download a mobile ap that will alert you if your vehicle moves from a pre-determined location.
7. If your vehicle does get stolen, you need to get the police involved ASAP and call the telematics company for your car ASAP as well to make sure that they get on it quick.  Some more savvy thieves have been known to strip a car to the frame in like 30 minutes or less.
8. Don't buy a truck in Texas, or if you do, lock it up somewhere at all times where hopefully no one can get access to it because almost every truck that we deal with that's stolen in texas gets ripped down faster than law enforcement and telematics can get on it :(.
9. Don't lend your vehicle to sketchy people.  I can't count the number of calls we get from people who let someone use their vehicle and then got ghosted.  Police often won't treat these vehicles as stolen which means we can't help you recover it.
10. DO NOT TRY TO RECOVER THE VEHICLE YOURSELF.  I don't care how much of a macho dude you think you are, let law enforcement handle it.  You never know what you would be walking in to and your life is just not worth it.

That's a wall of text, but, especially if you've just bought a brand new vehicle, I really recommend you take a minute and read it.",t2_u1jp0,menellinde,0,1648281010.0,0,t1_i2641ou,i2641ou,False,sirharryflashman,t3_tni3hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/tni3hb/have_a_car_with_a_pushtostart_ignition_heres_how/,Have a car with a push-to-start ignition?

"I don't know started paying attention to politics when Harper was in power, but back then was pretty good, didn't have huge problems working full time as a security guard at night, and took full time school during the day, paid rent myself, I lost my job due to the recession though but managed to change careers within months. I think it was around 2014 to 2015 we needed change but with an election no party was going to say we needed to slow down the economy. Trudeau didn't change anything when he took power. Harper did what he did to prevent a recession and it worked really well, but Trudeau should've taken the opportunity to balance the budget and cut back on the stimulus, he did the opposite and now when we needed stimulus again we straight up had to print money. Harper wasn't the best PM, but his actions were the result of a recession, Trudeau had 5 years with a good economy and majority government his first term to get things back to normal but he stimulated instead of balancing the budget. Even USA has good reason to stimulate 2015-2020 because they were still recovering from the recession that hit them hard.

There is no way, they would find a skilled jobs in the industry unless they retrain and learn the language.

"I can attest to that, as I am one of them. My family and I immigrated to Canada from Bulgaria when I was very young in the early 2000’s when our country’s economy was in shambles. We did much better in Canada at the time and our standard of living was much better.

Fast forward to today and cost of living has gone through the roof with taxes being high and salaries not keeping up. I faced that brutal reality when I graduated and started working. I soon came to realise that I could not live independently as I could barely afford to rent and pay bills let alone buy my own place, and this working as a software developer. Finding a better paid job with the little experience I had back then seemed impossible, so I decided to start applying in Bulgaria. To my surprise, ALL of the employers got back to me and got several good offers.

So here I am back to where I came from. Despite being a much poorer country, I live much better in Bulgaria as I can sustain myself very comfortably.

Selon les règles de ce sous-répertoire, nous n'autorisons pas les commentaires négatifs sur tous les résidents d'une province, d'une ville ou d'une autre région géographique; il s'agit d'un exemple de intolérance qui n'est pas autorisé ici. https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/wiki/regles

Sure there are some quality of life improvements and more importantly for me Canadian views and beliefs align more closely with my own. That said over the past 6-10 months I've been thinking if it is really worth it. Being from a metropolitan part of india for me the general quality of life doesn't change much if i move back. Things don't really change much from the day to day perspective for me. If anything i don't have to struggle as much. 

I've been working in essential retail, healthcare and now banking for more than a year now. Yet i don't have healthcare despite paying for it in my taxes. I still have to buy private expensive healthcare which is more or less worthless.

(I am working towards it and might be able to finally apply in a few months, three years after staying in Canada and two years working full time).

I can say that for sure I would've been financially well off and would've held a job closer to what I wanted.

"I'm not aware of any study that's looked into that.

The only other data points I'm aware of are regarding the amount of people with more than one property. The numbers suggest around the 15% (for owners in major cities at least). 

The reason I bring this up is that the other issue with bringing up the majority household homeownership stat is it also implies that entire bloc of the population actually benefits and prefers the current situation. 

While those purely with investment properties of course will prefer the current situation but I don't feel it's as clear cut for everyone else as people might imply. For example a relatively common scenario is many people buy ""starters"" and upgrade later in life. If all home prices increase relatively at the same rate that group will basically still be still priced out of ever being to upgrade (say from a condo to a detached when they start a larger family).",t2_rpugh,arandomguy111,0,1648276603.0,0,t1_i25yya4,i25yya4,False,FancyNewMe,t3_tn7v3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/tn7v3g/where_is_canadians_rage_with_ottawa_over_housing/,Where is Canadians' rage with Ottawa over housing unaffordability?,/r/canada/comments/tn7v3g/where_is_canadians_rage_with_ottawa_over_housing/i25yya4/,1,r/canada,0,1

The protestors i agree had to go. They were doing illegal shit and had to be arrested or pushed out. I agree even though I am also a half heart conservative supporter.  I do not support the convoy or their message. Their message and the people were overall dumb. But… suspend the rights of everyone using the emergency act…. Think of the long term consequences of that. 

In something like 320 days now there will be a report, there will be court cases based largely off the findings of that report. So say you and everyone who support the use of the act get your way and it comes out saying it was all justified. There was an illegal assembly, the local police didn’t have the resources to arrest them. So they could have spent a few days of work deputizing cops from other jurisdictions and be done with it but suspending everyone’s rights and forcing banks to freeze assets was the correct response. That is what the report might say and you and everyone who support it will get to pat yourselves on the back. 

Okay then there are court cases and they say all was good too! That Trudeau was within his right to do that. Now there is precedent set. And say Trudeau isn’t a dictator at all, which I don’t think he is really but the long term ramifications are supporting future use of this.

"The government is making the good law abiding people pay more for rent by giving too much power to bad tenants. Making it difficult to kick squatters out will stop someone from renting out their basement or spare room for life. Because of how costly and harrowing of an experience it is. 

This decreases the already limited supply of rental units and causes an increase in rent (supply and demand) and also increased rents to cover the damages done by squatters or months of unpaid rent.

The law should make it fair. You don’t pay up? Two months and you’re out. No buts if or sob stories. If the government wants to bleed their hearts out then they can cover the costs of their rents.

"If my music gets limited to Canada only then I am eff'ed.


This in no way helps music artists.  It's just setup to create middle(wo)men to take from what should just be directly going to us the artist.


I have an online distributor that collects the money from the streaming services. I don't need anyone elses hands in there dictating what they should do with the money i've already earned.


It's absurd.


edit:  Imagine a Canadian youtube content creator -> And the gov comes along and says hey  YouTube you gotta pay us so that we can generate canadian content.



But the problem is that the Canadian content already exists, and the Canadians that made it get payouts. The content is Canadian already.



So a youtube content creator would have revenue taken from them(via youtube having to pay the gov)...  then given to the canadian gov...  for the gov to spend on whatever they want... probably grants to Bell and Rogers under the guise of making more canadian content.


So you just took from canadian artists who would have gotton the money directly but now it is taken away and redirected elsewhere.


So frustrating.



Also, I'd like to see the past ten years of bell and rogers contributions to canadian content. Anyone got that list?

"Seriously I don’t know why people even immigrate here anymore. Unless your situation is dire or your country has a terrible standard of living, you are unlikely to come out better coming to Canada.

And if you actually had the financial means to come here, you’re likely not doing that bad back home anyway. Coming here with the higher costs of living, housing, awful depressing winters, uprooting your life and leaving all your friends and family, stagnant wages, tough job market (better now but was awful for a long time), and the unspoken bias that people don’t like hiring foreigners (didn’t get your degree here), really isn’t worth it.

I’ve seen multiple real life examples of people spending lots of money coming here, doing a program, thinking they’re emigrate their whole family here and it’ll be all rainbows and sunshine here. Only to find out not only is that not true but they haven’t considered problems (culture, difficulty of integration, job market, housing costs, you might have 4 houses back home but you might be able to get 1 shitty one here if you sold them all).

">I take it you missed the exorbitant penalties for backing out of the agreements that Harper agreed to.

Except they'd be entirely unenforceable.

The contract was contingent on the Government of Canada approving the export permits. That's an analysis that's required to be done by law, and the factors to consider are laid out in law -- it's not something either party to the contract can guarantee, so while it could be a condition precedent to a term of the contract, or to the contract itself, it could not be an enforceable term in itself. If they had chosen to deny the export permits, the contract would have been frustrated, not breached, and no penalty could accrue.

And they could have denied the export permits. We know that because they were sued afterwards for granting them.

"While it is redistributive, most people would disagree that people who receive dividends from stocks are the most productive members of society, which is one of the major components of the economic impacts. Those who are losing jobs are on average lower income and less well educated and are less impacted, and those are people who are productive in society. 

I would also point out that the redistributive structure of the program is a result of wealthier individuals emitting more carbon, not because of their wealth - if someone is wealthy and emits little CO2 they will benefit as well.

Finally, the idea that we are not responsible for the damage we cause is a very unusual moral framework - just because other people litter doesn't make it ok for me to do so.

"Evidently I should have been clearer in my OP with all the downvotes its taken and still having responses like this come in on replies where I tried clarify... I wasn't referring to _this_ example specifically in my OP. I was saying the contract used in it is exactly what's being waved around by the fraudulent/scammy landlords who are just attempting to relist at a higher rent as well, and in those cases the protections they're trying to make you waive would have more recourse options, up to and including being able to remain in the unit if the landlord is found to be trying to just grift for higher rents. 

You should never waive your tenant protections without first seeking council, regardless of how much cash is being thrown at you. In this market $10k isn't going to amount to anything if your rent just jumped 2-3x. Because on the surface, unless they're already deep into renos like in this example, a tenant can easily be told renos need to be done, or the property is being sold, or a family member is moving in... only for it to be relisted on the market. Which _would_ be illegal and subject to the tenant board... unless you're foolish enough to sign a paper that literally disallows you from pursuing them in the event that they opt to keep it a rental, in the process shitting on your own tenant protections due to your own choice to be badgered into signing something against your own best interest.",t2_49edj,proggR,0,1648269761.0,0,t1_i25pmtm,i25pmtm,False,FancyNewMe,t3_to6weo,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/to6weo/mother_of_8_and_landlord_at_odds_over_whether/,Mother of 8 and landlord at odds over whether Hamilton apartment building's construction is demoviction,/r/canada/comments/to6weo/mother_of_8_and_landlord_at_odds_over_whether/i25pmtm/,1,r/canada,0,1

Canadas goal is to have 100 million people by 2100. That’s 60 million people in 80 years. Roughly 750k new residents per year. This will not be possible at the rate we are going. Federal government needs a country wide housing plan to develop extensively. The average people per home in Canada is 2.9ish. Thus 750k / 2.9 ~= 260k new units built per year.

I don't know about the rest of Canada but Manitoba is still sitting on federal money for COVID and Ontario pocketed the money to balance the budget. I agree that this is constitutionally not sound practice but when you have provinces not acting in the best interests (and in good faith) of their citizens/constituents WTF is the federal government supposed to do? The Manitoba surgery/diagnostic backlog is no joke. I know people in their 20s waiting months for cancer biopsies or screening. There is a huge difference in catching cancer in month 1 or 2 as opposed to month 5 or 6 ( and counting). For example liver cancer early stage survival rate is 35 percent and mid stage drops to 12.3 percent. Which odds do you like better for yourself or a loved one?

"It is understandable that you have this opinion becasue there is a lot of overlap between the people who are self absorbed and the people with the megaphones (that includes the hacks that are masquerading as journalists at Post Media).

If they don't do shit like this they will be replaced by someone who will. This is the sad state of the media landscape today.

Thankfully there are still actually journalists out there that actually report the news without inserting their own opinion into everything they write.

"Leaving is absolutely the same trend I observe.

I’m early 20’s about to finish undergrad. I don’t keep in touch with all of the people I know in high school, but I do have them on LinkedIn.

Business/Commerece majors: trying to go to US/UK for finance jobs.

Tech/CS majors: (me): everyone and their mom is going to the US for jobs that pay 3-6x the pay here, in places with 1.5-2x CoL (still worth it).

Liberal Arts majors: same as the business majors, targeting firms in the US by the time they near graduation.

The only people I see who consistently stay in Canada are premeds aiming for Canadian med schools or poli sci majors who want to run for office here.

Everyone else who chooses to stay is a minority of their peers with the same major.

It’s a positive feedback loop. The white collar economy in Canada doesn’t have as competitive pay, so the best talent leave. This reinforces a less than ideal industry in terms of finance and tech. The only people in this country who are really “climbing” the ladder are those who got in early in the housing market.

Feels like there’s no future or innovation here.

"""The LEAP manifesto isn't the NDP platform, and nobody has agreed to increased military spending yet. Nor has the NDP pledged to support increased O&G production, as far as I'm aware.""

Singh has openly called for a ban on fracking, wanted the LNG in Kitimat cancelled and wants fossil fuels phased out. That's directly contradictory to Trudeau buying the TMX pipeline and recently talking to European allies in regards to increasing fossil fuel production.

Increased military spending has never been an NDP priority that I'm aware of. 

Yet, these are exactly the policies that the NDP are now supporting by making a deal with the Liberals. 

""Whether you feel this was a good strategic move for the NDP has nothing to do with its democratic validity, which you have yet to meaningfully challenge beyond a bizarre claim that parties may not do anything not specifically called out in their platform.""

"The US is just a bunch of refineries competing for our product. It is discounted because it is heavy oil that is difficult to process and requires more processing to make the most use out of. It needs to be cracked (long hydrocarbons broken into shorter ones) for many uses as one example. Another is that it is typically high in sulphur and other contaminants. The US government doesn’t dictate the price at which Canadian oil is sold. It DOES influence the he transportation and such but the market decided the price given the framework.

We may be able to get other customers for our oil, some of which might like our heavy and contaminated oil more, but I suspect that the discount would remain to lighter grades.

As for refineries, refinery capacity in North America is already well supplied and building new refineries isn’t economic.

"I don’t care for the “Fraser institute isn’t that credible” because while there are reasons for any study to have holes, it implies that the Fraser institute is uniquely not credible, while, what, other institutes doing research saying the opposite are credible? Not likely. It’s not an easy thing to analyze, it’s actually incredibly hard, and even the critics of the claim that it costs Canadians 6,000$ per immigrant admit it costs us money, just much less at 450$ per immigrant. My guess it’s somewhere in the middle. And it’s verifiably true that our GDP per capita has been going down year over year for quite some time now.. and the cold hard facts are that we are on average becoming poorer. Immigrants may “grow the GDP” but that doesn’t benefit the Canadians here already if it’s not growing apace to population growth. And every european country’s governments have released policies showing that their immigrant communities are costing them a small fortune. I don’t think it’s that much different here in Canada. And finally, in regards to the population question... our population has to grow because of the government policies for massive public welfare systems created within the last 75 years. which ironically coincided with steadily increasing cost of living, and a steady reduction in fertility rates.
