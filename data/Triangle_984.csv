Ting is great at 1000 megs for $89, but if you can get a 200 or 300 meg promo plan with ATT or Spectrum for $45 or $55 a month, it‚Äôs worth considering. A 200 or 300 meg fiber connection will blow OP‚Äôs old 40 meg DSL connection out of the water.

"It really depends on exactly where your new home is located.  You might be able to get fiber from AT&T, CenturyLink, or Ting.  Otherwise it'll be Spectrum cable or DSL from CenturyLink or AT&T.  Google Fiber is also still expanding service in the Triangle area, but I don't know if the Holly Springs/Fuquay-Varina area is somewhere they're coming to.

If you don't have good landline options at your new home, but have 5G signal available from either T-Mobile or Verizon, one of those might be an option as well.  Both have 5G home internet with no data caps for $50/month, and it's my understanding they work quite well if you have a good signal.  As long as you have a good signal you should definitely get a lot better than 40Mbps with either one.  Verizon's price drops to $25/month if you also have cell phone service with them.

If you already know the address of your new home you can go to the websites of each of these companies, input your address, and see what's available - but if it's new construction you may need to call them.

Spectrum seems to be totally hit or miss in the area.  Some folks say they have great service and no problems with Spectrum, others have horrible service with Spectrum.  I've experienced both in the past with Spectrum.  In my neighborhood Facebook group I see people complain all the time about outages with Spectrum.

We have AT&T gigabit fiber at our current house, which has a Raleigh address but isn't in Raleigh (it's actually in between Garner and Fuquay) - and it's been the best, rock-solid internet connection I've ever had.  In the five years we've had it, it's only been out one time.  The actual service itself wasn't down, the AT&T-provided router died.  They overnighted a new one, and we were back in business the following day.  Other than that, not a single problem with it.

Our previous house had a Fuquay-Varina address, but was outside the city limits in Harnett County.  Spectrum didn't have lines out there, and our only option at the time was CenturyLink DSL.  We originally had 10Mbps, but I finally (after a lot of work) got them to come back out and do pair-bonding - which got us up to 25Mbps.  I just checked the address on the CenturyLink site, and looks like they're still only offering 10Mbps out there.

"Most people here love exaggerating the cost of living and are clearly giving the wrong advice..are you looking to move to an area based on the job opportunities? Or do you just want to move to a place because it‚Äôs cheap to live there? If you think that you want to move to the Biopharma industry and work in this field for the long haul, moving to NC, specifically RTP is a NO BRAINER compared to FL (and yeah people are blowing it out of proportion regarding rents here, i live in a gated community with an Amazon lockbox for packages, pool, gym etc and I pay 900$ a month for a 1BR. It‚Äôs not shady by any means and is bang in the middle of RTP in south durham, and you can find plenty of places like this for less than 1000$/ month).. There are tons of high paying jobs comparable to companies out in San Diego, with cost of living here at half comparatively and with a bio works, you can easily get your foot in the door as a manufacturing associate earning 20-25$/ hr. but if you want to move to a scientist or engineer role ultimately you will need a BS degree. But there are plenty and plenty of jobs that are not engineering that do not need a BS but just a bio works. Once you get like 4-5 years of floor experience as an associate with bio works, you can easily transition to roles off the floor like manufacturing specialists, QA/QC etc etc. also wages here for Biopharma are only getting more and more competitive and higher, especially with Amgen moving here very soon. I 100% recommend moving here since this area is one of the best on the east coast for making a career in this industry while earning high money and also living in a relatively cheap area compared to other Biopharma hotspots (right now the biggest Biopharma jobs are in California, Massachusetts and NC, and last I checked, homes are upwards of millions in Cali and Mass with 1BR apartments at 2500-3000$/month, and it‚Äôs half of that here with wages not being far off from what you get paid in those two states)",t2_jsbu9,progmetalfan,0,1648140695.0,0,t1_i1y9ccb,i1y9ccb,True,jiggalation,t3_tmaakg,https://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/tmaakg/bioworks_certificate/,Bioworks certificate,/r/triangle/comments/tmaakg/bioworks_certificate/i1y9ccb/,11,r/triangle,0,11

"I really like my meds management person. (You can pm if you want her name.) I saw two therapists there. The first was fine but was like ‚Äúyou are fine!‚Äù and didn‚Äôt get my issues. I‚Äôm like an A+ masker so I do seem fine on the surface - and he wasn‚Äôt understanding me explaining how I‚Äôm struggling. The second was offensively bad. Fucking seriously offensively bad. 

The first therapist sent me for their ‚Äúfull neuropsychiatric testing‚Äù which they said would take all day and be expensive without insurance (which thankfully I have). There was only a brief interview and then me taking a bunch of surveys. The examiner said it was over, and I was like, wait - you did no assessment for autism, which is why I came. So then she had me to 1 ‚Äútest‚Äù on a computer based solely on me guessing the emotions in pictures of people. It looked like an internet test. It was not AT ALL the process of testing I have heard described by many other people, including on places like r/AutismInWomen r/aspergirls and r/AutisticwithADHD. At the end, she diagnosed me with ‚Äúmild Aspergers‚Äù which is not even a diagnosis in DSM5. 

I have a new therapist now who is awesome. She isn‚Äôt an expert in autism, but she often works with ADHD people and she is open-minded. After our first meeting she did a bunch of reading on autism and ADHD as comorbidities and it‚Äôs been helpful.

"There are supply chain issues affecting the stores. Mainly that there aren‚Äôt enough truck drivers to get to product from manufacturers to the stores warehouses and then again from there to the stores. There‚Äôs also a HUGE labor shortage, I know with HT specifically b/c I work there, because the job sucks and even when they raised pay for the warehouse workers, people could find another good enough paying job to make the hard work and demands not worth the little bit of extra money. And then there‚Äôs the la k of employees at the store it self. Because HT won‚Äôt pay raise pay rates at the store level, they are struggling to staff stores. They can‚Äôt get enough workers to work overnight to stock shelves, they can‚Äôt get enough people to cover the customer needs in the departments, separate the deliveries that come in and get the product to the correct department,and also stock shelves. This might not as bad in the produce dept. because all they do is take their product from the delivery out to the floor. But in the deli, or meat dept. that has a lot more going on with demands of one-on-one customer service there aren‚Äôt enough people to do it all. Can‚Äôt get your rotisserie chicken for dinner?

"here is what i relate to on the ‚Äúunofficial checklist‚Äù 

for autism: sensory issues for all senses (frequencies, textures, eating, smell), feel like i need a script because i don‚Äôt flow in conversation, bad eye contact issues, trouble focusing since childhood, lost in thought, always had social issues, change my opinion or behavior around different people (not for validation, i just truly change my mind a lot), copying people on TV, repetitive phrases, OCD (tons of picking skin, scalp, lips), youthful voice, naive as a child, used to be very blunt and come off as rude until i learned to ‚Äúmask‚Äù, special interests but only for about 4 years at a time, natural talent for putting together music or playing it by ear (since i was little), trouble identifying sarcasm sometimes, always felt very self aware, repetition of phrases inside my head that don‚Äôt turn off, unreasonable anger when my stuff is moved or if i can‚Äôt understand something 

bpd: emotional outbursts when not getting attention, favorite people, craves validation, low self esteem, chronic feelings of emptiness, sensitivity to being ignored, unintentional manipulation, self sabotage 

overlapping: not fitting in, eccentric personality/humor, sees things in black and white, passionate for music and poetry/lyrics (sounds kinda itch my brain), masking, copying personalities, emotional outburst, feeling like an alien or disconnected, unsure of what to do in life, imagine ‚Äúearning‚Äù social points by saying the right things, fantasize about a possible friendship or relationship with a new person, either too insensitive and monotone or too excited and sensitive

my mom passed so have trouble knowing how i acted when i was super young, but i have had a good chunk of these issues since i was like in kindergarten. i‚Äôm convinced i have CPTSD/BPD in addition to maybe autism because my BPD symptoms didn‚Äôt really

">To determine when the pine pollen season will begin and when the trees will be producing the maximum amount of pollen one needs to estimate the number of degree-days above 55o Fahrenheit after February 1. To determine degree-days, add the positive differences between the daily high temperature and 55 degrees. When the total degree-days sum to approximately 300 degree-days we begin to see the pine tree releasing pollen. Once a sum total of 636 degree-days is reached, pollen production is at its peak. In the Raleigh area pine pollen production is just beginning, and if the weather pattern holds, it should reach peak production by mid-April.

"As someone who has lived all over and trained BJJ for the better part of 15 years, here is what I look for in a gym:

* trial class(es) regardless of rank.  I'm looking to try your gym for culture and instruction quality, not trying out the sport.

* good mix of ranks represented in classes at different days and times.  Ask around during class to see if that class is a good representation of the typical class.

* no one is trying to prove how big/bad/tough they are.  I'm looking for an environment where everyone improves, not where the coach sends their roughest upper belt against me to show me what's up. 

* everyone seems hurt or taped up like a mummy.  You can train hard without training stupid.  A few people banged up happens.  Half the gym injured is a problem. 

Avoid places where:

* the price or schedule is secret

* they expect you to buy branded gi/rash guard/other gear

* they don't allow gear that has specific patches or brands.  I'm sorry I'm dropping in for a class but I'm not buying a new gi because your gym isn't sponsored by Fuji and I happened to bring my suparaito with me.

* fees for belt tests - really, belt tests in general but the 2nd is more of a personal preference

* anything Gracie Barra.  Full stop.

* places where you struggle to find partners/get a cold shoulder when checking out the gym.  Someone should always make sure you are paired up and people should seek you out to welcome you.

"3 miles? Certainly close enough for me. We ended up staying here after grad school 10 years ago, and all of our rentals and our current home are within 3 miles of Duke.

We originally lived in Avalon East apartments, which was pretty affordable one bedroom apartment for my partner and me. We both had cars and there‚Äôs plenty of grocery stores and restaurants around. We eventually moved to an independent duplex in Old West Durham, which was infinitely more walkable, and Duke Bus Lines are readily available. (Also, 9th Street is nearby). Plenty of other grad students lived there too and nearby neighborhoods like Walltown, and whatever the area is east of Duke, but west of Downtown.

> The remedy for a winter pothole patching is what's called cold mix asphalt - is the only kind of repair material that's available in the wintertime. And it's really not the best tool for the job. Much better is what we can get during the summertime - the same kind of asphalt that roads are built out of. It's called hot mix asphalt, but it's not available and not even made in the winter months. So we use an admittedly suboptimal repair material that's basically oily, sticky gravel and sand mixture that's pretty solid but not completely set up.

"> Should they be embarrassed, or pretend it never happened?

Those aren't the only two options. Embarrassment is the understanding that you did wrong. You didn't choose your ancestors so you don't deserve to be embarrassed. Pretending it never happened isn't the right answer either. Acknowledging that you cannot pick your family, that you don't share the same values as your ancestry, that you understand they made a choice and you'd make a different one, and that the actions of your ancestor might need to be put right by you ... these are what you should do.

One of my ancestors was really in to cabbage rose patterns from wallpaper to present day furniture. I'm glad they passed a lot down to me, but the cabbage rose settee I could do without.

What part of North Carolina heritage does the battle flag of the Confederate army of Northern Virginia represent? Truly. What good and righteous cause has ever been represented by that flag?

Did you know it wasn't popularly flown until *after* the south lost the war? Like many confederate statues and symbols across the south, it was popular during reconstruction and the Jim Crow area. It was flown by white residents as a reminder to newly freed black residents that ""we may have lost, but you're still not equal"". 

[Did you know that it was also flown as a symbol of the Dixiecrats, ""a short-lived political party which defended racial segregation and opposed civil rights for African Americans.""?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_display_of_the_Confederate_battle_flag )

It may not feel like a symbol of hate *to you* because you've never been the target of that hate.

"Culture? On both sides of my family I can trace my lineage back to the 1600's in this country. On my fathers side, they were in the south the entire time and North Carolina since the early 1700's.

My great great grandfather was a literal piece of shit. Sure, he had a large farm but he wasn't exactly paying the people who worked it for him. He bet on the Confederacy because well, he thought owning people was just fine apparently. He got an exemption from fighting because his farm was needed to help fuel the war effort. His kids were too young to fight. Because that dumbass converted all of his money to confederate notes, he lost everything after the war and was forced to sell off a large chunk of his farm.

Some of those confederate notes were saved by my great grandfather for them to be passed down to the youngest as a cautionary warning. I now have have those NC confederate notes. He and my great great grandfather didn't exactly see eye to eye on everything and one of those things was slavery. Another was drinking because he also shunned his fathers whiskey distilling and made sure his kids didn't drink either.

My parents both grew up on tobacco farms. I grew up in a rural area on plenty of land that we grew vegetables on and planted loads of fruit bearing trees, shrubs and vines. I did everything typical of southern culture in my childhood except for high society shit like debutante balls or trashy shit like waving confederate flags.

You're trying to equate this battle flag with culture but I'm not buying it. Although plenty of my aunts and uncles were quite racist, they never considered themselves racist enough to be associated with that flag. They all thought having that around the house was a touch too far and too white trash to be around.

That flag is nothing more than a tool for racists to express their racism. This is coming from someone who is about as southern as you can get. Even my casually racist and very southern extended family considered the flag to be too racist for them.",t2_awdz1,Uisce-beatha,0,1647872808.0,0,t1_i1j7u2e,i1j7u2e,False,Far_Repeat_2129,t3_tiuqg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/tiuqg3/whats_with_the_confederate_flags_in_pittsboro/,What‚Äôs with the confederate flags in Pittsboro?,/r/triangle/comments/tiuqg3/whats_with_the_confederate_flags_in_pittsboro/i1j7u2e/,1,r/triangle,0,1

"Chatham Park is a mega-development taking place on the east side of town. Pittsboro has roughly 4,500 people living in it right now, but when they finish Chatham Park by 2040-45, the town‚Äôs population is gonna range from about 60,000 to 80,000. Looks pretty off the chain based on all the artist renderings on their website. 

It‚Äôs supposed to solve some of the greater Triangle‚Äôs housing issues, but from what I can understand, some in Pittsboro (NIMBYs) see its construction come at the cost of their ‚Äúsmall town‚Äù way of life. There‚Äôs positives and negatives to growth and change everywhere, but given how fast the Triangle‚Äôs growing, they have to build out or else this place is gonna become something like Denver, for example.

"I've built enough to not need a book or guide anymore. 
Can't remember what book I used to build my first one back in the 90s.
Check out the DIY book Area of Lowes/Home Depot for starters.
Also check out YouTube for a few ideas.

My recommendation is to rent a 2 man or a trailer auger for shooting the holes and use an old fashion hammer and nails for the rails and pickets. Nailguns are faster, but unless you have experience getting one set up right, you'll waste a lot of nails and blow throw quite a few boards before you get it right.

You'll need a wheelbarrow to mix the cement in, doing it in the hole never gets mixed right.

Also a fence post level will make post setting go faster

This area is also not at all undergrad heavy, lots of young and middle aged couples some with kids some not. It‚Äôs really a great (somewhat) under the radar town.

> Two critical profitability metrics for any company include gross profit and net income. Gross profit represents the income or profit remaining after the production costs have been subtracted from revenue. Revenue is the amount of income generated from the sale of a company's goods and services. Gross profit helps investors to determine how much profit a company earns from the production and sale of its goods and services. Gross profit is sometimes referred to as gross income.

> On the other hand, net income is the profit that remains after all expenses and costs have been subtracted from revenue. Net income or net profit helps investors determine a company's overall profitability, which reflects on how effectively a company has been managed.

"NC has had a troubled history of organized labor. Workers in a textile mill in Gastonia tried to organize in 1929 when their hours were expanded and wages cut. The employees went on strike. The mill owners threw the workers out of their homes (they belonged to the mill) and cut off their grocery store (the mill owned the store). 

The workers staged a march. The city leaders sent their police out with rifles, bayonets and back jacks attacking the marchers. Keep in mind, lot of these workers were women and children.  

The workers set up tents to live in. The police staged a night raid on the tent town and several were shot including the chief of police. Shot in the back and later died- maybe by one of the deputies, no one knows. One striker was shot dead. A dozen + strikers are charged with murder (with no evidence) 60 people in the tent village are arrested. Anti-strike vigilantes arrive in town and attack the workers kidnapping and badly beating several. Remember this is a time when the KKK is very active in all of the US, and NC of course. These workers were mostly white, which probably saved their lives. 

The unionizers try to stage another march. Union sympathizers on their way to the march (driving over from Bessemer City), were run off the road by the anti-union vigilantes and Ella Mae Wiggins was shot and killed. 

The union gave up, the strikers moved off to other jobs. The justice system didn't punish the anti-union vigilantes - probably because they were all KKK sympathizers or members.

"""growing majority""...

The problem is that ""living wage"" is a meaningless term. What does it mean?  Food, shelter, clothing?  Wifi? cell phone?  Transportation?  Should entertainment be part of that? Should that be a living wage for a single person, married couple, single parent with 1, 2 3 kids?  People draw the line in many different places because the phrase, purposefully, lacks clarity.  It is a phrase designed to never be pinned down by facts or figures.

Per the MIT Living Wage Calculator, in North Carolina, the living wage for a person with 0 kids is $14 an hour.  Is that good?  If so, most Starbucks provide wages plus tips plus benefits that cover it.

So, you can argue for living wage, but it really doesn't mean much because the term is so fluid it lacks clarity. Some line will always be drawn, and people will be left poor, outside the bubble.

"Not showing my math was a constant complaint from teachers growing up haha

The Feds ""official"" inflation that was just released was 7.9%, I use quotation marks because if you use the original equation before they changed it to massage the numbers in the 80s, inflation is closer to 12% 

Btw the rate of inflation is still going up, it hasn't even flattened out yet

If you took the minimum wage from 2000 and let it grow with inflation, it would easily be in the mid $20s in 2022 

In this kind of landscape, Starbucks reported a record profit MARGIN and total profit in 2021. Meaning their price increases directly increased the % they profited off each cup of coffee not just cover higher supplier costs.

"$12/hour is not ""pretty dang good."" $12/hour is $25k/year if you work full time. No one can survive off $25k/year alone in this part of the country unless someone else is paying their rent or they are living with family or in their car. Benefits are nice but my landlord doesn't accept benefits on the first of the month.

The apartment I rented 3 years ago for $800/month is now renting for $1600/month. Rent has doubled in 3 years. Add to that the increased costs of food, electricity, gas, etc. Everything costs more than it did 3 years ago. Everything is more expensive but wages *for workers* are stagnant. 

Corporate greed drives price increases. Corporations are turning profits. Starbucks, McDonald's, etc. have all turned profits while they are increasing their prices and paying their workers crap and treating them like crap. They'll feed you bullshit about how increasing wages will make your burger or latte more expensive but you are paying more regardless of what the workers are making while executives get millions. They'll feed you bullshit that there's a labor shortage and that's why service is slow while cutting hours at stores. There's no labor shortage, there's a wage shortage. Starbucks isn't making their money from their executives, they are making their millions from the employees in their shops making drinks and dealing with abusive, entitled customers. They deserve more money, better working conditions, and regular schedules. They deserve to be treated well, and so do you and every other worker. 

Unions work. Look it up if you don't believe me. Are they perfect? No, but nothing is. If unions didn't work then why would executives try so hard to stop them? If unions didn't have power, why would companies like sbux be so invested in stopping them? People have literally been killed for trying to unionize because the power of collective bargaining is real and the thought of regular folks coming together to stand up for themselves really messes with rich people in power.

I'm sorry you are so brainwashed with corporate propaganda that you think $12/hour is a good wage and that the economy will collapse if workers are paid what they are worth.

"All workers do deserve better wages as they havent compared to cost of living. But doubling low income wages in 3 years doesn't make for a stable economy.

My point is that people make it out like they are earning slave wages,which is not the case at all. They also get excellent benefits even among white collar professional job standards.

"We seem to have a downvote troll, going about and sinking this submission every time it gets posted. Furthermore, within 10 minutes of me posting this, not only had they downvoted it yet again, but they've also put up some fraudulent reports on this post.

Well, unfortunately for them, I don't like folks who try to dictate what our readers can and cannot see by manipulating reddit's voting system. I consider that sort of behavior to be underhanded and immoral, and worse, because they're trying to snuff out other people's voices. They're trying to silence folks who are fighting to protect their rights. For shame!

So kudos, now the post is pinned, where your downvotes and reports can't sink it.

"All good, I mostly lurk and only comment here and there on things I‚Äôm curious about or find logically inconsistent. I think part of the problem is people assume because someone is anti mandates (mask / vax) that that automatically equals you‚Äôre anti vax. It doesn‚Äôt! I‚Äôm biggest proponent of vaccine and I think everyone should get one but I‚Äôm confident enough in its ability to protect me it shouldn‚Äôt matter what other people decide.
