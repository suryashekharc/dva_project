">earn more money

I just wanted to revisit this comment to expose just how naively misinformed you are about the real state of affairs in Jersey and just how little you understand how bad the problem is. If only us plebeians could simply ""earn more money"", unfortunately even this genius proposal wouldn't even work. According to the latest report on housing, the price of housing is rising by about £1700 a week, the average weekly wage in Jersey is less than half that. In order for someone to earn enough money to be able to get onto the property ladder within 20 years they would have to be earning at least £100,000 a year (and that calculation is being generous). That would mean that anyone who wants to buy a house without daddy's money would need to be a CEO or a senior manager. Can you explain to me how that is economically rational or sustainable?

"Very creative idea!   
Concerning the 1781 French invasion, only a half of the invasion force landed in Jersey because of a storm that scattered their boats. Also the previous French invasion in 1779, another storm scattered their boats and 18 French sailors drowned and none reached Jersey.  
And Jèrriais is pronounced 'jer-ee-ay'. Definitely more than 2 people speak Jèrriais. According to the last census 1,900 people speak Jèrriais as their native language, with 2,800 second language speakers. French, along with Jèrriais, are still technically official languages in Jersey, though is very seldom used in official settings.  
Also it is still technically illegal for boys over the age of 14 to knit, because of the 'over-knitting' problem in Jersey. My family still holds the tradition to this day that men are not allowed to take up knitting past the age of 14 as a sort of joke reference to this law.   
Also I've never come across a green post box, ours are usually red. But I know they are certainly blue in Guernsey though.

"I know it’s terribly hard to watch a family member or a friend make bad decisions and spiral downwards but it’s a tricky situation made even worse if you’re not there to help them. You mentioned a disability - I would think that social services would be your first port of call. There is help available but the first step is reaching out and telling someone. There are also charitable institutions such as the Salvation Army and (for the homeless mainly) also the Grace trust. If your relative has served in the forces I know that the local British Legion can, and do, work wonders. 
Unless your relative is deemed to lack the mental capacity to look after themselves it’s impossible to take over their finances without their consent. 
I’ve seen a situation like this when I worked at a factory in Liverpool. The shop floor lads got paid once a fortnight and after work on pay day they would all go down to the pub. There was one guy, let’s call him Mike, who would attempt to spend every last penny in his pocket and would end up collapsing in a heap drunk out of his head by around 9pm. The lads had a cunning plan though and after a few pints they would go up to Mike and ask him to lend them some money - £50 here and £100 there. Mike (especially after a few pints) was generous to a fault and wouldn’t hesitate to give them whatever they asked for. By the time he passed out he would have given the lads around three quarters of his pay. They would call a taxi and bundle him into it to go home and sleep it off. Over the next couple of weeks the lads would return his money in dribs and drabs so he had something to live on until next pay day. Apparently this had been going on for years and Mike kept his head above water without realising it was his workmates who were managing his finances.",t2_4jyj7htj,jerseybean56,0,1645091834.0,0,t1_hxagmr7,hxagmr7,True,Jerri_man,t3_su8cny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jersey/comments/su8cny/low_incomebudget_management_services/,Low income/budget management services,/r/Jersey/comments/su8cny/low_incomebudget_management_services/hxagmr7/,2,r/Jersey,0,2

"FAO: u/pluto098 

Jersey’s issue is not worse than any other developed nation, you’re combining issues: property prices are high but I’m not sure how that is making end of life care worse or how that is related to children not being around [see previous frivolous Victorian Britain comment]. Your statements are not evidence based at all and because I'm super tired of it I've made a little chart just for you.
 
The trends are easy enough to spot, and contrary to your opinion population age ranges are all going up except 45-54. Which actually indicates that opposite what you’re trying to elude to, people between 45-54 are moving away and not the younger generations, fyi “boomers’ is that age range.
 
It also shows that the 55-64 age range has / is rapidly increasing, but given that this is happening across the western world, it’s an okay trend to have.
 
There are many reasons why children are not around to look after the elderly, but as you are, seemingly, only dealing in strictly anecdotal terms: I would wager there are just as many elderly people with family nearby who aren’t actively caring for them because…I don’t know (lazy, stupid, ignorant… honestly who cares why).

"I’m not sure where you’re moving, perhaps Victorian Britain? 

As mentioned by myself and others, this issue is not really unique to Jersey. I also don’t think it’s an unavoidable problem. Old age and end of life care is a world wide prospect, we have seen the mean age rising decade after decade. 

It happens everywhere, however sensible precautions can be taken to influence them, perhaps you should look into pension planning, medical insurance and life insurance. It might set you at ease. 

Also, each decade has been significantly better than the last, hence the increase in the mean age, and the altogether overall age range increase. Why? Because civilisation is progressing - we’re getting better at stuff: like staying alive. Quality of life is better today than it was yesterday. 

It seems reasonable to assume that healthcare and medical care will get better too, given that I don’t plan on needing end of life services for the next 60 years or so (and hopefully this will not change) then I would like to think the advances made will greatly outweigh the issues of today.

"Not only end of life care, but general long term care for the elderly who need it. If you have enough wealth, you will need to pay until a threshold is met.

Yes, we can all agree there is a shortage of housing, which is one of the reasons people are choosing to leave, but that’s not related to your point of old age care other in, specially, your personal case.

"To me, a lot of what you have said in the post and response is conjecture.

Downsizing *could* resolve many of the issues you’ve highlighted:

- release capital to the down-sizers for end of life care. *(Note; it’s not always the State’s obligation to supply everything, those with the means can and should pay for themselves)*

- release housing stock to younger families. Who can move from a smaller residence, to a bigger.

- it’s likely, due to land and legislative constraints that building up and in high population areas is more feasible than expanding out. We cannot keep building mid sized properties on fields, building more apartment blocks is an inevitable fact. Even if we closed to immigration, that would only reduce population expansion by roughly 50%. Building more apartments should, over time, lower small dwelling costs, or at least stabilise them. Not everyone needs a 3 bedroom house

- a fluid housing market generates tax, tax can be used for end of life care such as state care homes, training for nurses et cetera. Though, it could be argued that downsizing should be exempt from taxation under certain circumstances.

"If you’re renting a car / bike it doesn’t really matter, the island is small enough. 

The closer to town (St Helier) the cheaper. Someone already recommended Premier Inn, which is likely the cheapest option and offers the best travel options, all the buses run out centrally from the station. 

If you stay anywhere out of town it’s ideal to have transportation: bike, car, moped, sinclair C5. I assume you might, as the marathon starts at a sports centre in St Berlade. But, if you stay in one of the hotels by the bay, you will have a 20 minute walk (warm up run) to the start.

St Berlade’s is a very touristy beach which looks pretty, it’s very good for holiday makers. If you want to see the island it’s not the best location apart from looking amazing and having nice places to eat.

">I would assume for a significant % of those that move here, this equation of pros vs. cons is one that's front of mind and may impact the long-term liveability of Jersey.

Absolutely. I think people who move here because they have friends/family have it easier because a lot of the Jersey vibe is social. If you don't have groups of friends, there isn't much to do bar eat and drink in all the expensive, gentrified places. Keep in mind, the more you earn the more that the living costs are absorbed and the low tax kicks in, so it's still great for the highly paid and insanely good for the wealthy.

I can totally relate to your frustration - potatoes and fish shouldn’t be difficult to prepare well.

"Thanks, that's exactly what I'd heard too.

I tried Prime Fry the first week we got here, based on the reviews I'd heard (and the encouraging sign saying they'd been here since 1912... 109 years seems a good enough stretch to have figured out the fryer!)

The chips were actually okay (seemed like they were fried in tallow), but the fish was dire. Very 'wet' fish (like it was a frozen piece, or at least previously frozen maybe?). The batter was half an inch thick and tasted like fairground doughnuts. Not at all bubbly/crisp... like it was trying to be a corndog.

Entwistles I was really excited to try, and actually saved it until a family member came over as a treat (again, based on all the positive reviews I'd heard.) The place looked like the real deal inside. But the fish... grey, and opposite to Prime Fry, actually really dry. Similar deal on the batter... thick and 'chewy' almost. Not at all crisp.

The Kiosk... I can't even describe how bad they were. But they don't claim to be a chip shop and didn't have the same glowing reviews, so I knew it was a wildcard.

I realise I'm sounding like a fish primadonna. Honestly, I'm not. I'd welcome for even average fish and chips. These experiences weren't just bad... they were 'I feel sorry for the seagulls' bad.

"This is true to a large extent (and I can attest to that somewhat, having gone through the process of qualifying for Licensed condition and being lucky enough to be accepted.)

I think a bigger issue is that actually *getting* here and feeling it out for a bit, there's a real sense that day to day life doesn't match the reality of the marketing.

It's not just initial opportunity and acquiring accommodation (which, aside from the hoops necessary to jump through to qualify, is still bloody expensive by any measure).

It's the reality that the island doesn't work for a very large slice of people who - day to day - are the same people are those those on the bigger salaries rely on and interact with for basic services. And that's saying nothing about the condition and lifestyle of those people themselves.

Reality quickly sinks in that what you make up for in bigger salaries and lower taxes, you pay elsewhere. The rent/mortgage will be higher. Healthcare will cost more. You'll spend more in the supermarket... and far more on eating out. School fees will be higher. Everything from a haircut to hiring will be more.

But more so are the intangibles. The trivial little things that add up to a frustrating experience. Traffic is intense. Parking is more difficult. Eating out on a Monday or Tuesday shrinks options by half because many places are closed. Places that are open -- even chain restaurants like Pizza Express - you won't be able to get a table for days... and the bill will be higher. Contractors that you hire for simple tasks like painting a room or gardening are booked weeks/months in advance... and cost 3x more than their UK counterparts. Supermarket shelves are bare half the week, with a sign that the boat didn't make it in to port. A significant portion of the year is wet and grey, which only serves to illustrate how few indoor activities there are to do. The high street is uninspiring.

These kinds of issues are present at every economic rung, and those with higher salaries are not immune. It becomes a question of whether keeping slightly more of your money is worth the downside of isolation and the inconveniences it brings.

"Of course it is… lol..
One thing I am sure: if you put ANYONE to chose between having to wait (even for 5min) in the rain and cold and dark of the winter with their kids to leave them at school to then wait again for another bus to go to work-or picking up their car and drive wherever they want- guess what 99% of the people will chose?- it just makes sense!

Either to bury the head in the sand and leave it for just a perfect picture opportunity… or otherwise and support any means of trying to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement of Climate and sustainability.
And people will buy electric cars regardless if they have a good bus network or not as thinking anyone only need to travel in Jersey roads is just ludicrous.
To end this “conversation “ I must say that I don’t know which electric cars you have been driving but saying that they are inefficient, polluting and dangerous only reveals how much you don’t know about electric cars.

"Again, while a “better network of public transportation that is sustainable”could be part of the solution, I still believe that families will always prefer their means of transportation (private cars) than public transport (no matter how sustainable they may be- as seen by different countries around the world that already are using electric buses and expanded their public transport network).
It is unfortunate but that is a reality that not even the best public transport network in the world is able to sort out. So, if you really want to increase the reduction of pollution I don’t see any other way than to support people to not pollute as much (as seen by any other countries like the UK that prefer to face the reality of people not EVER giving up their cars)
Finally- yes- let’s open that can of worms: we live on a island and when the UK fulfils it’s target by 2035 not having any fossil cars around- how shameful for us and other cars not to follow suit?

"I’m talking about public transport, not off-island travel like planes and ferries. That’s a whole other can of worms.

True, at the moment the only public transport system we have are diesel buses. However, 1 diesel bus is much better for the environment than 15 or so diesel cars, and that’s assuming that we continue to rely solely on diesel buses and not build a tram or trolley bus system.

And true, at the moment families mostly prefer cars over buses. But that’s not because they hate all public transport and refuse to ride it, it’s because in its current state the bus system is more inconvenient, inflexible, and slower than driving most of the time. But if measures were taken such as making buses more frequent and reducing or abolishing fares and redesigning roads to prioritise buses the potential ridership growth would be massive.

But even if families don’t want to take the bus, there are still plenty of other potential public transport passengers.

">I'm especially interested in places that could be described as kitschy, unusual, weird, or anachronistic, as well as anything deeply local.

Pallot's Steam and General Motor Museum, there is no place like it if they have a special event on like Liberation day it meets all of the criteria. Its an eclectic collection with steam trains & tractors, classic cars, lorries, vans and tractors, farm equiptment, machine tools, and various small engines. They have a running steam train and a railway which goes around a field, not sure what there opening is like with covid though. If they have a special event on like Liberation Day they get some accordion players in and make Jersey Wonders.

Hamptonne Country Life museum is also quite good, its an old farm and they do living history stuff and there are farm animals. Its unfortunate you have just missed the cider festival!

"Near term, I doubt it. If one of the Islands does, it'll either be Guernsey or Alderney first.

A few reasons: 

• The government already provides medicinal cannabis to patients through GPs. Thereby in their eyes they've met a requirement - granted, it's low hanging fruit.

• Jersey tourism has worked very hard to cultivate a safe, foodie, family-friendly and culturally interesting paradise. 

• Demographically, Jersey, even for a first-world society is extremely affluent. Additionally, because of Jersey's size, it's also, if not impossible to silo one's self off from certain economic groups - the wealthiest can't help but rub shoulders with the lower classes. 

• The main problem for most people, is the immigration (or lack thereof) issue.
If you've ever been to Amsterdam on the weekends you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
Because of the relatively high wages and standard of living, we'd find ourselves in a quite possibly undesirable malady. People who want to come for a weekend of fun and debauchery would end up being enchanted by our little island, and probably staying - Great Britain is free travel area, and since Brexit, the Islands have only become more attractive to the British.
Crime would go up as would all other stresses on services - which would inevitably mean a large raise in taxes.

• Also, even though we are largely independent, the U.K Government would have something to say about such a 'radical' policy. Remember VAT and the fulfilment industry? Yeah, they wield an enourmous amount of power over the islands.

                                   《----------》

Guernsey is far more pragmatic and liberal than Jersey - remember the debate they had on euthanasia a few years back? So I reckon they'd go first.
However, if the U.K decides to entirely decriminalise first, then that would certainly change the optics in a much more beneficial way.

And one more caveat, cannabis is becoming a much more commercial enterprise now. Once they know they can package it and tax it legally, then maybe they'll push harder to legislate for it. It'll be twice/thrice the price of cigarettes, though! 

Hope this helps.

"No sure what point you’re making, other than that *drugs are bad* - fair statement, but as others have concluded this statement should also include tobacco and alcohol. But both sides of this simplistic arguement are tired, so let’s retire them. 

If we take Colorado as an example, we can immediately see better arguments for both for and against. 

- CON: drug driving has increased.

Though increases that are difficult to quantify, as drug-impaired driving statistics are not measured as throughly as drink-driving and the increase might be due to increased cannabis use. It would be an interesting percentile to measure over a longer period of time.

- PRO: tax take increase 

Yey! Who doesn’t want more tax.

- PRO: reduction in drug-related arrests. 

Less resource spent on cannabis policing, more resources spent on other policing… again a longer period of time would be needed to measure effectively. 

- CON: increase in cannabis-related hospitalisations.

It should be noted, that this might be linked to poor home controls on substances ie poor parenting.

"I said Jersey has little authority over the issue, not over fishing. We have full control over our waters. 

Jersey is part of the EU-UK TCA deal so that it can continue to enjoy tariff free trade with the EU. Because of this, the Jersey government is obliged to work with (read; do as told by) the UK regarding the mechanisms around issuing licenses, for example fishing data goes through France-UK-Jersey before review.

France are, and have, closed ports to Jersey fishermen landing catches, our fish economy cannot survive, in its current state, to accommodate this. In short we need access. Jersey has no ability to demand the French open ports to us, we can only rely on the TCA and therefore the UK-EU to do its job.

Ultimately Jersey has very little power between the two nations, we did not vote in the Brexit referendum but we are now obligated to deal with the fall out.

"I love Grand Vaux. I grew up and have worked around there.

It's a lovely walk.  Lovely woodland to explore and as you walk down the valley, there's streams, ponds and gardens with an old mill. There's a nice duck pond with wild chickens running around at the end of the valley as you get to the fork in the road at the end.
From that fork you can either go west or east (both Uphill).

Nice area. Not too far from town, but not in town, if that makes any sense.
There's a couple of primary schools in that area too, if you have little ones.

Shame the Harvest Barn has gone though. That was an awesome country pub! Too many good times in there 🤣

Oh, and Waitrose is on your doorstep.

It's difficult to fault Grand Vaux, it's part of my upbringing. It's like a little forgotten treasure on the doorstep of the big city. 

A wonderful, safe place to bring up kids. It's almost ethereal on a good day.

"Couple of things off the bat:

- U.K. changed the sovereign claims on the sea around Jersey, this has caused all but war with France over fishing rights. The bay of Granville treaty was scrapped and new licensing has / has not been issued. It’s on going. Jersey has little authority over the issue, and are in many ways a pawn of Brexit.

- EU nationals have had to apply for settlement status, although many a bean will cry “we’ve never been part of the EU” this is a simplistic view, Jersey has a work agreement with the U.K., and therefore any one with the right to work in the U.K. had a right to work in Jersey. This did open (and now close) the door to many EU Nationals. Many have gone home, or indeed not come, causing a shortage of work in tourism and agriculture. (The pandemic has intensified the problems, with retail now reporting worker shortages)

- Jersey no longer has access to cheap Labour for the potato picking season, this is a knock effect of the Brexit and the access to the EU workforce. It is considering issuing licenses to non-EU nations - namely African. 

- there is a general skills shortage across the island, likely exacerbated by Brexit. This is driving wages up, however, many positions are left unfilled, despite Brexit / pandemic the job market is incredibly fluid. 

- cost of living has been going up, any trade issues the U.K. have, have a knock on effect on jersey as most imports come from Britain, it’s common that French goods are first sent via Britain to Jersey (even though we’re only 1 hour on the boat from France).

"Well besides being my home and where my family lives; the beautiful nature scenes (esp the sunsets and beaches), our heritage and history being everywhere you look, not having to travel far to see friends and family, good quality local produce and it is relatively safe to live here.

If you ask anyone about Jersey (esp younger people), they can list just as many bad things as good things unfortunately. There is a whole lot I would change but I will name a few. The cost of housing and living is a big one, which has caused so many people to permanently move from the island. Jersey is the 'most expensive place in the world' after all. Because of the nature of being a small island, a lot of young people here feel that there is a lack of suitable jobs and entertainment. Our government is grossly incompetent, so nothing does get changed. Also, an awful lot of people here can be very selfish and self-centred. Many only focus on themselves and there is a declining attitude of communal passion, which is why a lot of the aforementioned problems don't get fixed in the first place.

"Thanks for responding and sharing your thoughts!

I’ll just mash up the pros and cons together for Canada. Nice to hear it’s a place of interest for you!

Canada has a lot of pros, our healthcare is world class and free at point of use, paid for by tax dollars. Pharmaceuticals, vision and dental care are not covered though and are expensive. Most white and blue collar jobs come with extended health benefits that partially cover things not covered by healthcare like chiropractic, Physiotherapy, glasses, drugs and dentistry. Cost of living varies all over the country, and is highest in Vancouver and Toronto, where the housing market looks a lot like Jersey’s. 

I live in Alberta, which is out west. Pros about living here are great employment opportunities (relative to the rest of Canada) and fairly high pay, plus a reasonable (not low, but ok) cost of living. Buying a stand alone detached house on a piece of land is within reach for a lot of people, but not everyone. Taxes are low and there is no HST or provincial taxes unlike anywhere else in Canada. Eating out is a bit expensive, groceries are reasonable. Unfortunate drawbacks are the right wing political situation, there is a reason people call this province “Texas North”. Other jurisdictions in Canada are marginally or far more progressive. On the other hand, the Rocky Mountains are amazing for winter sports, hiking and biking. We have some racism problems especially against our Indigenous community. It is generally very safe. 

Canada is geographically huge, it takes many hours to drive between cities and travel by plane is more expensive than within Europe for instance. Sometimes it’s cheaper to take an international flight (eg. Vancouver to China) than to travel domestically. For example, driving from Calgary to Vancouver takes 12-13 hours. A flight is 1.5 hours but will cost $300+ CAD unless you find something on sale with a less reliable airline (Flair air lol). Vancouver to Toronto would take several days to drive, I think ~40 hours of driving total and it’s fastest to drive through the US. A flight is about 5 hours, and $500-700 CAD. I think how far apart everything is here is a bit shocking for newcomers. Many of our medium size cities including mine have an urban sprawl problem, where you need your own car to get anywhere. There are buses but the routes are so infrequent and slow they are not ideal for use. We don’t have long distance commuter trains except for in outer Vancouver and the Toronto to Montreal corridor where a huge portion of Canada’s population lives.

People are generally friendly and nice, with some localized exceptions. Out east in Atlantic Canada I have found people to be exceptionally nice! I love it out there. 

Depending on your age, there might be a working holiday visa available for you if you wanted to come try Canada out for a bit. Or of course you may qualify for a permanent working visa depending on what you do for work. :)",t2_6jl0v1yq,foreverland-korcula,0,1632519763.0,0,t1_he55znx,he55znx,False,foreverland-korcula,t3_puravz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jersey/comments/puravz/what_do_you_like_about_living_on_jersey_what/,What do you like about living on Jersey?

"Pros for me: Very safe. Beaches are stunning and a short drive/ walk from most places. Really nice cliff path walks too and the beaches are great for water sports. Easy to get around everywhere. Good schools, friendly and helpful people. If you’re skilled in finance you will never be short of a job - many international firms set up over here. 

Cons: cost of living is getting crazy! House prices are insane. As a young person it’s really making me doubt my future here. Same with food, very expensive. Salaries/wages are higher than UK but not high enough to make things easy over here. Traffic for some reason seems a lot worse in recent years than it used to be, despite the pandemic resulting in some choosing to still work from home. You can get kind of bored here long term, can be a bit claustrophobic too. A bit of a pain to travel internationally as you usually have to go through the UK.

*‘There is no point investing in the next generation of Islanders if we get no return. We invest in the future but it is pointless if we cannot retain them and get them to come back to the Island and use those skills.’*

Suggesting that something as important as education is fruitless is only going to encourage those who seek to reduce education costs.

It’s absolutely vital we continue to invest in educating Jersey residents, even if we lose some to other jurisdictions.

"Hi there, that is no problem at all - I mainly deal with law firms in a moreso commercial manner rather than private, but the first firm that comes to mind for me is a local one called Ward Yates.

I have always found them to be exceedingly reasonable in fees, very professional and very helpful. I think they likely would be able to assist even for a private company matter and would certainly recommend them. 

They will likely need to identify you and your business partner by requesting certified copies of a photographic ID and recent proof of address, but I am sure would explain all of this if you send them a general enquiry.

I generally advise against a 50/50 split on shares as this can result in deadlock on certain decisions. You should certainly have a shareholders agreement which does not necessarily need to be complicated. It may just say what decisions require consent of all the shareholder (such as the issue of more shares).

"Hello I work in corporate finance in jersey - yes you own 50% of the shares, and have 50% of the votes providing they have the same voting rights as the other 50 shares that are in issue (highly likely) - this means you currently own 50% of the company. the remaining unissued shares will not count unless they are issued.

Check that your 50 shares are recorded on the register members as this is the point at which they are actually issued.

In terms of issuing further shares to anyone (unless its you) this will dilute your interest in the company. If another 50 shares were issued to someone else then you would own 33.33% of the company for example.

It's then up to the directors if they want to allot shares to other people, but your articles of association should give you the detail you need - are you on the board, and if so, is your business partner the only other director? If that is the case you would both jointly need to make the decision to allot and issue shares (although again do check your articles).

If you are not on the board, check your articles to see if they have an ""pre-emption right"" provisions. These essentially mean that where the company is going to offer shares (if it ever does) then it will have to offer these to the existing shareholders first, so that they can choose whether they will buy them or not.

Based on your share capital you may have elected for standard table articles (the template articles freely available on the Jersey law website) which do not have any pre-emption right clauses built in. 

I'm also fairly sure Jersey has no statutory pre-emption rights built into the law however I'm not a lawyer and so not certain on that point.

If you don't have the say as a director, you may want to consider arranging a shareholders meeting to change the articles to include these provisions (with the assistance of a local legal firm for the wording).",t2_g8v5q5h,PuppetPatrol,0,1630745119.0,0,t1_hbjrmu8,hbjrmu8,True,Federal_Wonder_6256,t3_phfc7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jersey/comments/phfc7a/share_capital_vs_number_of_shares_taken_when/,Share capital vs Number of shares taken when establishing a Jersey company,/r/Jersey/comments/phfc7a/share_capital_vs_number_of_shares_taken_when/hbjrmu8/,6,r/Jersey,0,6

"> What is the difference in quality and cost of rental housing for licensed individuals and those who just have registered status?

Registered here, about to leave Jersey.

Quality can differ greatly between registered flats. Don’t expect out of this world quality. Do however, expect out of this world costs. I paid almost £1400 per month on my first flat. No that is not exaggeration. The flat I’m living in is £1500 split with a flat mate.",t2_gaujx,CrocPB,0,1629684434.0,0,t1_h9zfi16,h9zfi16,True,foreverland-korcula,t3_p9nqaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jersey/comments/p9nqaj/shopping_and_bringing_down_cost_of_living/,Shopping and bringing down cost of living,/r/Jersey/comments/p9nqaj/shopping_and_bringing_down_cost_of_living/h9zfi16/,5,r/Jersey,0,5
"1. Not really. Cost you about £100 to take a car to France for a day. If you are over there anyway, sure, but I wouldn't go for that.
2. Single guy with stupid eating habits, so not really a good source.
3. Jersey pretty much tops the charts in accessibility to internet and has the highest average download speed in the world by a factor of two. Probably about £50 a month for 500mb, £80 for gigabit. Mandatory landline and maybe even a basic mobile contract add £20-40 based on what you need. Check out Jersey Telecoms and Sure.
4. If I'm not mistaken, licensed people can buy any house that isn't part of a scheme like social housing and assisted purchasing. So you can get what you can afford. I think this extends to renting too. Licensed is basically a conditional ""registered"" status, to my understanding.
5. There will be some restrictions, but I think it's possible.
6. I was always under the impression the down payment was 20%. Can't help beyond that.
7. Basically weekly bin men and I think fixing roads. They'll mostly waste the money trying to turn your roads into 20mph zones.
8. There used to be a law where VAT wasn't applied to items under £15 or something and it created online stores like [Play.com](https://Play.com). However, I think that loophole was shut down years ago. However if you arrive in the island, buy something and take it back to the UK, then you should pay VAT via customs. But you can always sneak it I suppose. Electronic goods like a phone is common.
9. There will be some situations in place. However, if you meet a set of circumstances, a case-by-case appeal can be made on [hardship grounds](https://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Benefits%20and%20financial%20support/P%20Residential%20and%20Employment%20Status%20Guidance%2020161205%20RB.pdf) to gain entitled residency. Unlikely from this case though, but mortgages will play a role. I'm no expert here, but I think there would be numerous workarounds. You would be forbidden to buy, but you've already bought. I don't think you'd have to sell unless it was financially required to survive. You could keep paying the mortgage, even if you have to rent it out and move into accommodation you are allowed to live in. You might even be able to continue living there without issue. I would ask estate agents and government departments.",t2_bn9an,snaynay,0,1629682358.0,0,t1_h9zbc0e,h9zbc0e,True,foreverland-korcula,t3_p9nqaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jersey/comments/p9nqaj/shopping_and_bringing_down_cost_of_living/,Shopping and bringing down cost of living,/r/Jersey/comments/p9nqaj/shopping_and_bringing_down_cost_of_living/h9zbc0e/,3,r/Jersey,0,3

"IMO the best beaches are in the east. St. Brelade’s (South-West) is probably the most touristy, with ice-cream shops, cafes, and also watersports such as kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. Ouaisne just round to the east is a bit quieter and nicer for swimming in my opinion. At low tide, you can walk between them on the sand, and there’s a path through the woods to go between them when they’re cut of by the tide.

St. Ouen’s bay across the whole of the west coast is the best for surfing. Plemont in the north-west is the best place to see puffins, and Greve de Lecq to the east is a smaller version of St. Brelade.

A lot of visitors like to hire cars or bring their own over on the ferry, but it’s not impossible to get around by bus, especially if you’re staying in somewhere like Gorey which gets a more frequent service. The longest journey by bus from Gorey would probably be around an hour to 90 minutes.

I’m terms of COVID stuff, Jersey has PCR tests on arrival and depending what tier country you’re coming from, you may have to isolate until your results come back (~24 hours) or be able to go wherever as soon as you arrive. Latest advice is available from gov.je/coronavirus.

In terms of non-beach things to do, Both Gorey and Elizabeth castles are very good. I’d also recommend the War Tunnels for some more modern history.

"Hey there I'm sure you're going to love it - lovely restaurants near/at harbours, tons and tons and tons of beaches to see etc it's a lovely place 

Re weather I'd say treat as England but maybe add 10% sunshine and warmth - having a little rain mack with you is a good shout 😀 

- tourist things: do go to Gorey and Elizabeth Castle as they're super cool - for kids I would say try the Amazing Maze (look it up its super cool!). Also go see Fort Regent as that's got some cool stuff 

- beaches I think you have to see are Greve de Lecq (one of the only beaches with little tide change) and its honestly stunning, as well as Plemont (very near but high tide is a no no) and possible St Brelades which has banana boating and stuff 

- gorey is beautiful, you won't be disappointed: 10-20 minute bus ride to town, and yeh probably about 45/an hour to the other side, but it's lovely up there and there's some shops and restaurants and great pubs etc

go for a coast walk up north...devils hole, le taq.....   beach walk and surfing at st ouens...castles pretty much everywhere, but an especially nice one in gorey and nice quiet beaches to the north of gorey too, st catherines for example...

&#x200B;

you can swim anywhere....just keep an eye on the tides because if you go for a swim in low tide and the tide comes in you'll be a mile out to sea just by staying still....

"The best beaches are all in the west of the island in my mind, which is painful to admit as I love in the east! St Ouen, Plemont, Portelet (great Pizza restaurant down on the beach, Portelet Bay Cafe) and St Brelades Bay (some good restaurants here as well) are all very nice.

Gorey has a bus every 15 minutes though and you'll be able to get onto a bus that goes West from the bus station in St Helier so that is doable.

You can walk from Gorey to St Catherine's Breakwater which is quite a nice walk, the first chunk is on the road but there's a nice path along the coast after a while.

September can quite often be the best month of the year weather wise here, mid 20s and sunny is quite common - but August has been awful so I'm really not sure if that is going to hold true.",t2_pqt87,Pandavia,0,1629555819.0,0,t1_h9sii9m,h9sii9m,True,Orionbelt0,t3_p8qoet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jersey/comments/p8qoet/questions_for_an_upcoming_holiday/,Questions for an upcoming holiday!,/r/Jersey/comments/p8qoet/questions_for_an_upcoming_holiday/h9sii9m/,3,r/Jersey,0,3
"The island is 9x5 miles, so nothing is particularly far away and you’re always pretty close to a beach. 

Weather wise it’s pretty similar to England - could be hot, could be chucking it down, could be both in the same day. 

If you’re staying in Gorey, there’s Mont Orgeuil Castle which is pretty much surrounded by beaches. 

[Jersey Heritage](https://www.jerseyheritage.org/) has info on all their sites you can go to if you’re into that sort of thing. 

Grev de Lecq is a good beach for views and swimming and it has a really nice cafe, but really you can swim off pretty much any beach here (though only some have lifeguards if that matters to you) depending on the tide, though St Helier’s beach isn’t the best as it tends to have a lot of sea lettuce. Green Island is also nice for swimming.

Try [Visit Jersey](https://www.jersey.com/) if you’re looking for stuff to do or good restaurants etc.

"Honestly, the tax breakdown you get at the end of the year is a bit shit, but I think it's about 26% gross. They break it down in weird ways.

You are supposed to pay 20% flat income tax. People earning below a threshold (no idea, but between 20K-30K) have some form of progressive tax brackets. However, there are deductibles and situations where your tax rates fluctuate based on last years earnings.

Points on Income Tax:

* Most people pay tax on their previous years earnings. When you file your tax return in 2021, for the 2020 year, your 2020 tax rates were for 2019 earnings. For a long time, first year earners (including new arrivals) would have 0% income tax for that financial year without a previous year to base it off. Their full first year could be 0% again if their first partial tax year earned less than £12,500 or whatever it was.
* I think the new system brings that up to current year. I don't know how that affects new starters. [Some details.](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/IncomeTax/Individuals/PayingTaxEarnings/Pages/PriorYearBasisTaxReformProposal.aspx)
* Due to all of this, increases or decreases in salary, bonuses, deductibles and whatever changes to your income, the States will determine if you have overpaid or underpaid and will adjust your tax rate to try balance the books. You might be on 10% or 26%. But equilibrium and stability will be 20%.
* You can negotiate tax rates or settle your outstanding tax and rebalance your rates.
* I don't know what Canada's tax return is like, but Jersey's is quite simple if you are a salaried person with typical means of income. Tax is automatically taken out of your pay, calculated and paid by your employer. The final return is merely just a check on your financials. It's different if you run a business or make money off things like property or investments or whatever. If you are being hired as a contractor, as your own liable business, then speak to Jersey's tax advisors.
* My friend had three kids, a non-working/dependant spouse, a mortgage, child support and school stuff and claimed he had an effective tax rate of 3% when he lived in Jersey just a few years ago. I don't have kids or a spouse, so I don't really know the details. Just if you are in that situation with your family, you might find your rate is even lower than expected. A tax man could help with real questions there.
* If you can find a way to make serious pennies, Jersey has an income tax cap of £125,000. If you can pay that in a year, that's it. So that's important in regards to culture, house prices, etc.
* Jersey's social tax (6%) pays for healthcare, welfare, pensions etc. The second you are liable to make use of it, you will be entitled to the NHS in the UK I believe. There is also private insurance available on top of public healthcare. The public health care here is pretty respectable.

As for property tax:

* None for property as in houses.
* None for property as in assets.
* We pay parish and occupiers rates. Consider them basically identical amounts. The land owner pays parish rates and the occupier pays occupier rates. A land owner living on his own land pays both (so their rate, twice). For a nice house that you own and live in, £500? That also goes to fund parish affairs and things like your weekly bin men (trash collectors?). [Here is some info](https://www.gov.je/Home/Parish/pages/rates.aspx).
* There is also no inheritance tax if you were to buy here and pass it on to your children; should this ever be a lifelong move. There is stamp duty, but it's low. [Here](https://www.viberts.com/areas-of-law/personal-law/stamp-duty-inherited-assets/). If your children are not born here, like yourself, any gained residency can be lost if they move away for a certain amount of time. They could inherit the home, but not be entitled to live in it themselves. Whether this old law will change in the coming decades is unknown.

As for capital gains:

* There is none, with exceptions for people considered professional or make money on various short term gains.
* All property income is taxed at 20% flat.
* Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if you buy a house, it's value rises, you sell the house, that is capital gains and not property income (like rent income). Bar stamp duties and fees, you net the profit. However, I think there is exemptions; eg flipping property, or if the property is not your primary residence, etc, etc. Generally speaking, if you can buy a property here and it raises in value, do not be worried about increasing property taxes or getting nuked on capital gains tax over the difference if you sell after a few years.

"The house market is absurd. I can't tell you want you can and can't afford, I can only say that historically Jersey's property values don't stop gaining and weather global recessions well and since 2016 have just been on a straight trajectory up. But a 1900sqft house and a big garden is very likely not going to happen.

Mortgage rates are low. Like really low. 0.5%-2%. It's why the house prices have gone nuts for the last few years. I can't say what they'd lend you, but your down payment probably wants to be substantial. But even if the mortgage is high and the payments are high, in a few years you'd be laughing...

For tax related things, you'll be on 20% tax, 6% social. GST is applied to most all things. Food is fairly expensive. Cost of living is high but taxes are very low.

"I'm not able to address all of your queries but I will try and help where I can:

- the cost of living is ridiculous. For me, it is the biggest draw back to living in Jersey. As a point of reference my salary is in the same bracket as your potential salary which you have indicated. The two biggest costs which you can't do anything about are food and housing. There are no cheap supermarkets. The food which we do have is levied with the 20% tax charged as Value Added Tax in the UK (conveniently disguised as transit costs) plus a further 5% which our Government levy as a consumption tax. Alcohol is expensive, there are no cheap bars and our archaic liquor licensing law prevents offers on alcohol in bars;

- housing is incredibly expensive. There is a particular shortage on three bedroom houses which has seen their value sky rocket in last 12 months. It is incredibly competitive to even buy one. By way of example a friend of mine recently telephoned an estate agent and asked to view a property which had been put onto open market and he was informed it had already received 17 offers and had been sold above asking price to a person who had not even viewed it. This is not an uncommon anecdote. Rental is expensive too. Two bedroom apartments are rented out between £1400-£1750 per month;

- yes we have a strict control on housing and employment. Each person has a status, Entitled, Licensed, Registered, Entitled for Work Only. It sounds like you would be Licensed as a result of your job. This means you can buy property in Jersey immediately upon arrival, however, should you leave or lose your job the Government would force you to sell your property. Also, whilst you could buy property, there are certain properties that would still only be available to Entitled persons. My understanding is that all new builds can only be purchased by Entitled persons;

- I don't believe there are any separate property listings. Unfortunately, you would have to slog it out with everybody else unless your prospective employer makes arrangements on your behalf in advance of your arrival;

- anecdotally I have heard the mortgage interest is low but I'm afraid I don't have first hand experience on lengths, costs, downpayments; 

- again, my understanding anecdotally is that child care costs are extortionate, however, I have no personal experience of this;

- your insurance arrangement will depend on the policy/company policy. I dont believe there is any particular local insight to share on this;

- the state pension is funded through a further tax or 'contribution' of 3% of your salary. This is matched by 3.5% employer contribution. The pensionable age in Jersey is 67; 

- taxes. 20% maximum rate of income tax. A further 1% is collected as your 'Long Term Care Contribution'. 3% social security contribution as explained above. 5% consumption tax or GST with no exemption for food or children's clothing. Parish rates on your property whether you rent or buy but the rating system is pretty reasonable in my view. You're probably looking at a couple of hundred pounds a year on this. No inheritance tax or capital gains tax; and

- yes I believe there are certain health specialists here however it is more common where specialist health care is required for a person to visit the UK for treatment. This isn't chargeable in the UK, it is part of Jersey's medical service offered to Islanders. We have a reciprocal health agreement with the UK should you require treatment whilst away/visiting the UK.


NB - Jersey has a number of private schools which are part subsidised by the Government which makes them more affordable. It also has some very expensive private preparatory schools. 

Having said all of this, Jersey really is a lovely place to live. It is beautiful and it is incredibly safe. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else however my opinion may not count for much as I am a native! There certainly are draw backs, the primary one being housing which, quite frankly, is in a state of crisis. Our Government isn't capable of addressing the matter and has shown no indication that it either understands the scale of problem nor that it has any idea of how to fix it.

"I don't know what bus route you have taken but the number 1 and 16 are usually made of people of older ages, or 20-40 years olds during rush hours. From my experience (as a 22 year old) bus travel is actually unpopular amongst young people exactly because of the bus ticket prices being at the price of what they are now and also this is a big reason why many young people I know use cars. even those who walk to work in St Helier still use a personal car for this reason. Additionally, it is the principal reason why bus travel is so popular for pensioners is because they are free for them, which takes thousands of cars off the road. The same easily applies to young people. It is more about social psychology than individual convenience that is what is important to regional planning, plenty European cities prove this. Being in the top 10 in the world (rough estimate) for cars per capita for such a small island is just ridiculous and unnecessary.  
   
I never said everyone should use buses, if it doesn't work for you then that is fine, but on a macro level; we should be looking to reduce motor use and carbon emissions. As I said, increased bus subsidies is just **one** example. There is bike lanes, TSP technology, bus lanes, road pedestrianisation, rural pavement infrastructure, green-lane expansion, motor law reform (the list really does go on) and Jersey can choose from any of these in any manner that suits us best. As long unnecessary motor travel (which I am sure does not apply to yourself) is mitigated, then carbon emissions will be reduced and congestion will be mitigated. Which will make things better for motors such as yourself and OP.",t2_43xowz9j,NorseNorman,0,1628507940.0,0,t1_h89vijh,h89vijh,False,HakuChikara83,t3_p0bt6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jersey/comments/p0bt6a/traffic/,Traffic,/r/Jersey/comments/p0bt6a/traffic/h89vijh/,1,r/Jersey,0,1
"I completely see the angle you're taking here but I'll be honest I don't see lower bus fees making a big difference here- buses are full of teenagers regardless of it being free (often swearing and playing music lol) and as a 32 year old with a steady job the price doesn't bother me either, it's just simply inconvenient 

If I want to get a bus home, and don't check the times, it's an hour on average office to front door which after a long day doesn't cut it - I've got to get to the bus station, wait, get off no where near my place and walk home.

Driving a car, even with traffic, it's a 20 minute journey for me at best and I get to choose when it happens. Honestly you'd have to pay me money to use the bus more 

That's a bit bleak and traffic aside I hate the additional carbon usage going into the atmosphere from all these one person cars out and about, but, I work long hours and have a pet and it just doesn't make sense for me to get in at 7/8pm having left the house at 8am to then have to worry about dinner etc

"Well, many cities in Europe have made massive initiatives to de-motorise, most famous being Amsterdam. Some more than others and each with their own methods (cycle lanes, road pedestrianisation, subsidised bus fees, etc etc) but each city, as well as Jersey, all share the attribute of limited space. It is just a matter of what works best for Jersey. For example, if our super creative and efficient government actually supported lowering bus fees (instead of voting such proposals down, like they did with free bus travel for under 21 year olds) to say £1 like in Prague or even 80p like in Budapest, you would see a massive decrease motor use across the island.

"I'm beginning to get concerned about this as well. I was living in the UK before the pandemic, have been vaccinated in jersey and intend to return to live in the UK soon.

From my research so far. The jersey vaccine passport paper appears to be holding up when travelling internationally as proof of vaccination...although your mileage may vary.

There is however no way of accessing countries internal vaccine passport schemes. If you visit France for example there is no way of getting access to the health pass and so you will not be able to enter most hospitality venues or use long distance trains.

For the UK, we have no way of accessing the NHS covid pass, we are treated as a foreign country and our vaccination status is not recognized. Currently this means you are at the whims of the venue/event requiring vaccination proof to accept your jersey certification...come end of September only the NHS covid pass will be accepted at nightclubs and large events.

The other issue which effects us is that if you need to travel from the UK to somewhere else and don't transit immediately back to jersey, then your vaccine certificate is not recognized for avoiding isolation. I'm going back to live in the UK...so guess I have to do a round trip to jersey every time I travel abroad just to avoid isolation.

"We do have quite a few bad drivers, yes. As other state, size of roads is a common issue and people buy big cars.

Another issue is discipline and understanding the roads. We get a lot of people who drive too slowly. Probably due to our simple roads, people don't pay as much attention to traffic flow correctly and get in the way and obstruct people all the time.

But the biggest place to spot them is the Avenue. People choose their lane because they like it, or it's the lane that eventually has the exit they want to use. People have no foresight to stick to the left lane and use the right lane correctly. I think this would wind people up who are used to motorways and bigger roads. I don't think there needs to be an overtaking/fast lane, but I do wish people would understand when they are blocking the road, causing a backup of traffic and forcing people to undertake cars, which is more dangerous.

One positive though is Jersey is quite courteous. They'll let you pull out and filter in and the likes easily. However, people will slow down and stop a queue of cars to let another one out in such a fashion that it's worse for everyone.

"Yes, we sont hide away for the flu but we also all get vaccinated for the flu, especially at school. Also, i am more likely to die of covid then in a car, considering a)i dont own a car lol and b)less people have died in a car crash in jersey, and probably the world, over the last year compared to covid. Being scared of cars and a pandemic are 2 totally different things and hence have different responses. By not getting in a car i am making my life a lot worse but by trying to help people with lowered immune systems, which there are multiple people in my year/school with, i am making everyone's lives safer. I know youth is on my side, but there is multiple people who dispite there youth will be badly. For example, one person who is in my year and had covid was really badly effected by it even though they are healthy and dont have a supressed immune system. Also, the fact that people have covid without symptoms means they are a lot more likely to spread it to people who will suffer badly with it without knowing. One top of that, most cases at the moment are in schools and as [gov.je](https://gov.je) displays, most people are symptomatic. I dont know about you but i would much rather not risk my friends who could be seriously ill from covid from getting it.

"I can understand all that, but ultimately we don't hide ourselves away and shut down society for flu and that is effectively what covid is/will become. 

It maybe sounds a little bit brutal but you're far more likely to die every single time you get in a car than you are from getting covid, especially at a young age. We're not scared of getting in the car, so why should we shut ourselves away if we've come into contact with someone who had covid?

I work in finance and have been offered a total package of around 80k a year, I wanted to know if realistically with prices on the island which I know can be high... If I would be able to rent a decent modern 2 bed apartment, afford to eat out at times and to be able to go home and visit families, go on regular holidays etc (I know this is limited with covid)

Ooftie you're doing well for yourself! Tbqh what is more interesting and important is if you have a recognised professional qualification, I think it might have to be linked to your job in finance. That way you can rent the nicer (and cheaper!!!!) properties close to the main parish.

Eating out I think you'll be fine, going back and seeing your folks is fine too. During the summer they do direct flights to Edinburgh (and Glasgow Int maybe?). But there are connections via London Gatwick, London Heathrow, and Birmingham. Also note that taxis max out to around £20-£30 one way from St Helier and it's 10 mins to the airport.

Regular holidays? Yeah you'll be fine too, you  just have to route through a London airport. There's not a lot of direct routes overseas from Jersey. You also have options to see the other Channel Islands and north western France.

"I ended up taking a job here in Dubai for more money.

In terms of you potentially buying property over there you'll have to ask someone who lives there, but I'm pretty sure there are restrictions on buying property if you don't have residential qualifications - i.e. are from Jersey. 

And I think that some places to rent also require this. It used to be that places to rent that didn't require qualifications cost more as a supply/demand thing.  

But quality of life in Jersey is pretty good. It can feel really small at times and it's not a cheap place to live - many say it's the cost of living in London without all the things London has to offer. 

But it's pretty, crime is low, there are some good restaurants - especially if you like seafood - and it's only a 45 minute flight to London or 90-minute flight to Glasgow, and it costs under 100 quid return so you're not too isolated. 

I remember living there as a teenager in the 90s and hearing that there are more pubs/bars per square mile than anywhere else but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

"In the 80s and 90s there was definitely a feeling that people who live out West were more ""beans"" and were more likely to have a stronger Jersey accent. 

But I'd say the bigger difference you'd notice when you were 14-18 years old was that of kids who lived in town and those who lived out west. 

The ones out west were more likely to be the surfer type who dressed in surf brands of clothing and hung out at the Watersplash, while those from town were more likely to be the ""raver"" types that went to DJ nights.

"I’d rather be an idiot than ignorant.

You ask for evidence, but dismiss it as opinion, when it suits you. Fact based arguments are often structured around articles written by professionals (in this case journalists). Although, I just linked the top three, go through Google and you can find lots of instances, or go the jersey statistics and read it for yourself.

The problem is, for you, not me, is that you cannot offer any evidence to suggest there is not whilst others can offer evidence for, and are doing so on this thread.

Instiutulaised racism is very much a problem, in Jersey, and world wide and the longer people deny it, the longer it will take to resolve.

Falling back on pedantry and derogative language, to me (opinion alert!) is sign of a weak argument; which as far as can see is “there is no systemic racism, because I said so because my experience doesn’t match the definition.”

"1) You can get to anywhere in 20 minutes and the driving is so polite and slow. Compared to where I live now, with eight-lane highways and loads of dangerous driving, with an average of one death per day on the roads, it makes me miss home. 

2) Because it's a small island you're never far from the things you need. I know people who remember living in parts of America where they'd drive an hour just to get a burger or two hours to go to the cinema. 

3) It's pretty safe and the serious crime-rate is comparatively low. At no point growing up in Jersey did I feel like there were no-go areas or that I was in danger of being mugged or attacked for going to the wrong part of the island. 

4) You take it for granted growing up there, but it is a beautiful place with lots of places to go and walk/cycle and a lot of greenery and good sea views.

"Actually the government do not control what is on police vans. For your information the government make the laws. The police enforce those laws. The police vans advertise issues which  according to statistics present a huge issue on the island (racism and hate crime being one of these)

Thé mere fact that you appear not to acknowledge that racism exists (based on your experience (opinion) rather than any type of fact) only serves to prove how people shut their eyes to this very concerning jersey issue.

Systemic racism lives within institution and society. Examples of this being through the following:

1. Housing discrimination - shown clearly by the two tiered system created for those resident and those persons who are not. 

2. Wealth gap - shown in jersey through the fact that those considered for higher payed jobs a great deal of the time have to be jersey residents or resident for over 5 years.
