"This happened in December. She was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor, can't remember the specific charge, and don't know the current status of the case. I have no idea if she kept her job. I knew her in a past life. Can confirm that she is bat shit  crazy. 
The victim is her daughter.  She has 3 children. The 8 or 9 yr old daughter she assaulted and twin toddler boys she has with the man filming the video.  The daughter had gone to NYC  with her father and his new partner, she is a person of color. Apparently mom saw photos on the girls phone and became enraged and it led to her vicious attack. The man filming, who in my eyes let it go too far, is her  current partner. He finally pushed her off the child yelled ""Alexa call 911"" and pushed the mother to the floor. She can be heard shouting to her daughter ""look what #### did to me! "". I was told she tried to have charges brought up on him.
She has worked as a caregiver and nurse with children and adults with intellectual and other mental disabilities for over 10 years. My hope is the she no longer be permitted to do so.
As for the daughter's status, I hope that she is living with her father in a safe and functional environment, getting the mental health care she needs. That child will be scarred for life as a result of the incident, and I'm sure that wasn't an isolated incident.  She may have been the victim of mental abuse living in that home.  As for the evil bitch, she can fucking burn in hell for all I care, but ideally she should face the legal and professional consequences for her actions, and get the mental help she needs.",t2_4dckb21r,CorporalAgarnsHat,0,1648253004.0,0,t1_i24thfl,i24thfl,True,Thanks_Shallot,t3_tnjv0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tnjv0a/disturbing_video_shows_a_nurse_assaulting_a_small/,Disturbing video shows a nurse assaulting a small child at Binghamton Psychiatric Center.,/r/Binghamton/comments/tnjv0a/disturbing_video_shows_a_nurse_assaulting_a_small/i24thfl/,7,r/Binghamton,0,7

"Yes, and he should win.

It just should have never gotten this far, both in terms of the incident itself and the ensuing legal battle. The best he stands to win is the original jury judgment, and as cool as it sounds to be the underdog in court, it's stressful and shitty to have years of your life go by having to think about this kind of crap. I've known people who contemplated suicide over lengthy legal fights, even (maybe especially) when they're 100% in the right. It absolutely bleeds the soul out of people to find out how hard it can be to get justice.

They should have just done the right thing and compensated him from the outset, and then learned a lesson from the costs.

"Antipsychotics have been used as an add-on for clinical depression for a while now. I'm surprised you weren't aware. Abilify was the first to be FDA-approved specifially for unipolar depression. There are several others, some available as a generic, some not. Most do carry the risk of weight gain. Latuda is not officially used for unipolar depression, but it can be prescribed off-label. It is weight-neutral and it worked great for a family member. Another thing to know is that antipsychotics take 2-3 weeks to try out, less time than antidepressants.

The only thing that worked for me was clozapine. It's officially only for schizophrenia, but it is sometimes used off-label as a last resort for serious depression. Speaking personally, it's particularly effective at attacking suicidal ideation. After an 18-month episode and 4 hospitalizations, my suicidal ideations vanished within 2 weeks of starting it and depression went from severe to mild. It is hard to find someone to prescribe it, because it carries some risks that require you to get blood tested every week for the first 6 months of taking it. Also I gradually stopped taking it because it was causing serious fatigue that made me quit my job and I gained a lot of weight on it. But it saved my life and my symptoms haven't been more than mild since.

It's unfortunate this information isn't easily accessible and that more medical professionals aren't aware of the full spectrum of stuff to try, considering how common MDD is and how a third of people with it are treatment-resistant. I was fortunate enough to have out-of-network coverage as most competent psychiatrists downstate do not take insurance.",t2_6pr1gh5,hfoqywaaoy,0,1647943731.0,0,t1_i1n69mx,i1n69mx,False,Bleumoon_Selene,t3_thr0mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/thr0mf/has_anyone_had_any_luck_with_fidelis_covering/,Has anyone had any luck with Fidelis covering antidepressant alternatives?,/r/Binghamton/comments/thr0mf/has_anyone_had_any_luck_with_fidelis_covering/i1n69mx/,2,r/Binghamton,0,2
"Thank you for the info and guidance. You seem very knowledgeable.

I am a bit scared of ECT because a friend of mine got it when she was young and it made her worse in so many ways. But she's in another country so I don't know how much different their administration of the procedure is compared to the US. 

As far as medicines go I have tried the following:

Zoloft, which worked ok but some of the side effects were messing with my every day life)

Wellbutrin, which didn't work too much but I took it separately and alongside Zoloft

Trazadone, which I only took for about a week because it made me sleep all the time. When I wasn't sleeping I just felt groggy and cranky because of it. 

Lexapro, which actually made me feel more depressed. 

Now I'm on Venlafaxine/Effexor. It's barely working. 

But I haven't tried any antipsychotics or anything. I didn't know you could use an antipsychotic if you're not experiencing psychosis.

"Spravato is FDA-approved for depression so it should be covered. For TMS ask [this practice](https://tms-ny.com/) and double check with Fidelis. 

Having personally recently recovered from severe treatment-resistant depression, I'm curious to know what you have tried. Have you tried adding Wellbutrin/bupropion and/or an antipsychotic like Abilify/aripiprazole? It's possible to take an SSRI/SNRI plus Wellbutrin plus an antipsychotic all at the same time. Or even older but more powerful drugs like MAOIs? If you can, seek out a good specialist even if it means travelling once in a while. I can recommend someone in Towanda who takes insurance.

Also consider ECT. I tried it and it's really no big deal. Don't get scared. Obviously try other things first though.

"I’m not questioning the data. More so the conclusions drawn from it and what types of economic incentives are created by reassessment for corporate real estate investors. Imposing an additional cost on landlords via increased taxes likely feels good in the short term. Especially from a political standpoint. That additional cost would be passed on to others. Changes to the cost structure of student housing ripples through the rental market in general. Higher housing costs for all with the exception possibly of existing homeowners. I’ve seen advocacy for affordable housing dominate this sub via this account and the Mrs Binghamton alt account. Not that I’m an expert in this but raising the cost to landlords and renters and lowering tax rates for homeowners (thus increasing asking costs for existing homes due to lower monthly tax cost) doesn’t seem to be consistent messaging. Landlording is a business just like any other. The existing tax structure makes the Binghamton market attractive for those developing and maintaining properties. Decreasing their incentive to do so doesn’t wise based on the housing conditions I see walking around town.

I agree the tax system needs some sort of overhaul. But would amicus and Stonebridge have bought those properties if their tax bills were 800k higher? Would the purchase price be lower to adjust to those higher taxes?   Would local people be priced out of the market anyway by higher taxes instead of higher prices?  Homeowners throughout the city are definitely paying more than their fair-share of taxes as opposed Property owners of income producing buildings but I think changing the assessments doesn't create a 1 for 1 change.

Science fiction It is already happening to some extent in our own society. Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed modern society gives them antidepressant drugs.

"I left a growing city out in the Desert SW to come here, and I don't see much development happening here at all. Plenty of potential with all the decay, but it seems the area is trapped by its past. IBM and EJ are not coming back. Dick's Sporting Goods gave Bing the middle finger and headed off to SW PA. Maybe we could try and leverage the area's history as a sort of ""birthplace of tech"" (IBM) to get a microchip foundry? But do we have the skilled workforce for it? Does BU have relevant programs for employment in such industries? Do the students want to stay here if there were jobs? 

There's push at the federal level to on-shore that sort of manufacturing as China keeps eyeing Taiwan the way Putin sees Ukraine and the Baltics. 

As for ""project after project"" -- it struck me with the news coverage at the outset of the war, all the cranes seen on the Kyiv skyline. Reminded me of just about any major western Canadian city in the pre-COVID late 2010s (haven't been back since!). Satellite cities around Vancouver, and downtowns of Edmonton, Calgary, even Winnipeg -- new highways, cranes all over the place, high rise residential towers, etc. Even the strip malls looked new and less ugly.  

Minor note regarding aesthetics, but how is it that a ""conservative"" (i.e., cheapskate) state like Texas or Arizona with low taxes can make something like a highway overpass a canvas for public art, while in the ""liberal"" northeast, we're stuck with the plain old ugly green paint, rust, and pigeon droppings at every overpass?",t2_1x05i1fx,Borderlandia1,0,1647753124.0,0,t1_i1dd7c6,i1dd7c6,False,WhydeClaw,t3_tg0z8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/,Do you guys expect Binghamton to experience a growth/decline in the next decade and in what ways?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/i1dd7c6/,1,r/Binghamton,0,1

"As others have pointed out, Lupo's and Spiedie & Rib Pit are the quintessential.  Start with these and try all the meats.  I have had the lamb at Lupo's and that was really good.

Come next summer, go to Spiedie Fest and also try others, including Salameda's State Fair sauce.

After all that, make them yourself.  Get some skewers, a loaf of Italian bread, and a bag of Lupo's chicken spiedies from the supermarket.  Skewer the chicken, grill over charcoal, then pull off the chicken using a slice of Italian bread and eat it as a sandwich.  In my mind, much better because you control not overcooking the chicken.

Good luck and enjoy.  After this, travel around and find other signature dishes in nearby cities, like a garbage plate in Rochester from Nick Tahou's.

"If Binghamton/NYS lowered taxes, Binghamton would become a place people would flock to. Simple as that.

During covid, people fled high cost of living cities in high tax states such as cities in California and New York City and moved to smaller cities in lower tax states. Many businesses did the same. Remote work opened the door for high earners to move to Binghamton just like they did to other places....but they didn't.

The whole notion that people wouldn't move to Binghamton because of the weather gets thrown out after you look at what happened to Spokane, Washington. A once undesirable place to live with even less daylight and harsher winters than Binghamton but saw a massive population surge during covid. The city was not prepared for this surge, so lack of housing caused home prices and rental prices to become unaffordable for the people who originally lived there. [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/business/economy/spokane-housing-expensive-cities.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/business/economy/spokane-housing-expensive-cities.html) . Spokane is closer to national parks sure...but it also experiences many climate related issues that Binghamton doesn't such as unbearable wildfire smoke in the summer.

So what's the main difference? Taxes. Washington doesn't tax income while sales tax in Spokane is only 1% higher than Binghamton (9% vs 8%). Property tax rates are significantly cheaper and business taxes in Washington are also much cheaper than New York. 

Binghamton gets very few if any of the industry benefits of New York City, but gets taxed the same as places like Long Island and Westchester where people commute into the city every day.

If New York created a different income tax zone and business tax zone for areas of the state whose economies operated independent of New York City (i.e. ""upstate""), people and businesses would move here in a heartbeat. Until that happens, I can't blame people for fleeing if they ever manage to generate wealth while here and for businesses laughing at the idea of moving here.",t2_kvdnrmwq,bingice,0,1647649986.0,0,t1_i183bk5,i183bk5,True,WhydeClaw,t3_tg0z8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/,Do you guys expect Binghamton to experience a growth/decline in the next decade and in what ways?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/i183bk5/,2,r/Binghamton,0,2

Binghamton is not a normal rental market about 1/4 of the population are students from downstate where $1200 a month is monopoly money.  Im pretty confident if slum lords were to have a mass of tenants refuse to pay rent they would evict them all and renovate into student apartments.  Also binghamton is unique in its small and rules don’t really applly depending on who you know and have connections with.  Its not right but its kind of how things work. I don’t know how you would change this but not paying rent is probably not the best idea.

Could anyone see an international event like LUMA happening in Binghamton a decade ago?

There's also the question of if Cuomo's plans for the region being the central hub of legalized marijuana for NY and eventually parts of PA come to fruition.  That would be massive.

The big concerns for me though are a rise in gentrification and decline in affordable housing around here.

"I expect Binghamton to grow.

We moved here because of the cost of living coming from Colorado. The West is still desirable, but some towns are running out of water, forest fires and climate change will make some places simply uninhabitable. We knew about the flooding potential here, so we purposely looked for housing that was out of major flood zones. 

I made a map of locations that were cooler and wetter, had a lower cost of living but still had a decent economy so that we could find employment. Another advantage for us was that this area had lower numbers of higher education attainment than where we came from, and that means that my spouse would have a better chance of a decent job since he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. We also liked that this area had a mix of political affiliations, class, and more diversity in general because we didn't want to live in a bubble. 

Our biggest drawback was definitely the taxes. We don't mind paying higher taxes, as Colorado's lower taxes are evident in the services that the state provides, but New York property taxes are about six times what we paid there. It works out to a similar amount just because the property is cheaper, but still, I think that might hold back growth a bit if that is what the state or city wants.",t2_ihck3,amandazzle,0,1647530659.0,0,t1_i111byk,i111byk,False,WhydeClaw,t3_tg0z8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/,Do you guys expect Binghamton to experience a growth/decline in the next decade and in what ways?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/i111byk/,10,r/Binghamton,0,10

EJ's made a critical error in business model, and ignored the athletic shoe revolution.  IBM-Endicott was heavily focused on Mainframe systems and IBM of the late 80's early 90's was at a crossroads and missed several market trends.  No unionization would have saved doomed business models.

"Interesting question. The larger area (the Northeast) has had a population decline in the last two decades, driven by the Rust Belt's collapse (Binghamton is on the very eastern edge of that). So, industrial jobs vanishing and--more importantly--the unions that supported them vanishing, which has impoverished the area somewhat. The other thing is elderly white flight out of the state to places like Florida. But that is just one strand. The other big thing with Binghamton is education and some other industrial stuff (engineering, health care, warehousing). The housing market right now is super hot, which is some indication of future growth: some of that (anecdotally) seems to be people decamping to a low cost of living area from big cities. Some of it is big developers betting on the students. These two things are happening to the extent it has created a housing shortage that is bad for the poor (bad). I dunno. I'm bullish. Protected from climate change. Beautiful area. Big, good university that hasn't yet spawned a real hippie college town in the mode of Lawrence or Asheville or Boulder or Madison.

"Just FYI, look into dental discount plans. [DentalPlans.com](https://DentalPlans.com) is an aggregator website that you can use to help find individual dental insurance plans and dental discount plans. Though, I'd recommend purchasing the plan on the plan's official website and not on dentalplans.com.

A discount plan starts immediately as soon as you receive it in the mail. It's not insurance (which might not be a problem since dental insurance kind of sucks anyway with tons of exclusions and tiny amounts they're willing to pay out). Discount plans not only start immediately, but they'll give discounts on a lot more things (even cosmetic dentistry for example). The discount plan has already pre-negotiated rates for in-network providers - though your discount % may vary depending on where you go.

I've heard good things about Aetna Vital Savings in particular. From from what I've read, dentists that accept any Aetna dental insurance by contract have to also accept Aetna Vital Savings, so the network is much larger than competitors.

Before you purchase it though, call up various dentists to see if they accept it or see if they offer their own discount plan. I know that Lalor Family Dental has their own in-house discount plan, but I'm not sure how it compares to the Aetna Vital Savings. I think they accept that one too.

Also, for the future, the best dental insurance is good dental hygiene  (brush, floss, limit sugar, don't smoke, etc.) and get consistent professional cleanings (2-3 times a year). Apart from injuries to your mouth (which are often covered by medical insurance), expensive dental work is most often only necessary for people who don't take care of their teeth.",t2_ksgddqnz,bingandham,0,1647464705.0,0,t1_i0xn820,i0xn820,True,carolpie,t3_tf2ohq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tf2ohq/dental_work_suggestions/,Dental work suggestions,/r/Binghamton/comments/tf2ohq/dental_work_suggestions/i0xn820/,0,r/Binghamton,0,0

"I've been doing business in Toronto for over 12 years, so maybe I can offer you a little perspective about some of the differences, or similarities.

Our area is akin to areas like Brantford ON.  We had a history of Industry that has since moved out, and we are now moving on to other economic segments and industries, such as BAE/Lockheed/Binghamton University.  So we have some bright spots, but still a little grit from that transition to overcome.

Our traffic is much better than Toronto and the QEW/401.  Our airport is not.  Public transit is not like it is in Toronto, no trains, etc.  But we have a decent bus system; I'd still recommend a car.  Housing is magnitudes cheaper here.

There is one Timmy's in Great Bend PA, about a 30 minute drive if you're homesick for a Maple glazzed.

If you will be traveling back and forth, get a Nexus card, as it will make your life easy going across the border.

Our area is fantastic for activities if you know where to look.  Skiing 45 minutes to an hour.  Lake's and waterfalls.  A strangely good amount of bowling.  We still have a roller rink.   
 Hiking galore.  Fishing and hunting if you wish.  Some small museums.  An emerging art scene.  Good food and brew pubs (although lacking at the high end).  My sons friends play in local hockey leagues, all though I don't know much beyond that.  We have a local minor league hockey team.

NY City is 3 hours, and Buffalo is 3 hours.  Syracuse is just over an hour, and Ithaca is also about an hour.

As someone who moved to somewhere else right out of college, my advice is simple.  Life is what you make of it.  If you stay in your apartment now in Toronto, don't expect it to be much different here.  If you look for adventure, you'll find it.",t2_3qyin9e5,AllswellinEndwell,0,1647444121.0,0,t1_i0w7kix,i0w7kix,True,IBSurviver,t3_tf9hup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tf9hup/what_is_the_city_like_for_young_people_moving/,What is the city like for young people moving here alone?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tf9hup/what_is_the_city_like_for_young_people_moving/i0w7kix/,11,r/Binghamton,0,11

"I moved here for an engineering job when I was 24. I was alone and didn't know anyone. I'm 29 now (almost 30) and still working for the same company. 

It's been lonely for me, but I'm at peace with it. I spend most of my day at work. When I'm not at work, I do errands, eat, scroll through Reddit/Discord/Youtube, and sleep. If the weather is nice, I like going out for a walk at a local trail.

I'm sure there's social stuff to do around here with other young people, but I'm introverted and I keep to myself. When I first moved here, I went out to the bars and tried to meet people, but they all eventually left the area after a year or two. Once the pandemic hit, I became a hermit. I don't have much of a social life now, but that's mostly on me.

Best part about the area is that it's cheap. I've been able to build up a lot of wealth in the past 5 years. Rent is very low. Housing prices don't look too bad, but as a single dude, I'm not interested in tying myself down to this area (even though I've been here for 5 years lol), and a house would probably be way more space/maintenance/headaches than I need.

"I just moved here, I'm no young buck but my brother in law isn't too much older than you and told me plenty. 

Winters are fairly long. But from what I've told they're not too bad where you get cooped up for long periods of time (having spent some time in Wasaga Beach and Oshawa during winter I can say it's definitely warmer here and more open). There's a decent downtown with bars and restaurants. Definitely going to be better in the coming years with all the development coming this way. 

What I know about the dating scene is it's fairly great but lots of people know each other, if you meet someone who frequents a popular spot high chance most people who go to the spot are regulars and know this person even in passing. 

There's a great arcade, comic book stores, soon to be some great dispensaries and a bit of everything throughout the year. Great mix of enough where you can stay in or go out. 

In the coming years if the speed rail gets finished you can be in NYC pretty quick. If you don't have a car get one, bing is great but the surrounding towns are pockets of awesome.
