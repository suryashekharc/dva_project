The Evel Knievel Museum is pretty interesting and cool for all age groups. If you're needing to stretch your legs, Lake Shawnee or the Governor's Mansion has some good, quick hiking trails. Ward Meade is a cute little prairie town worth a visit. 

Somewhere I always take out of towners is the First Presbyterian Church that is just across the street from the Capitol Building. They have a full set of Tiffany stained glass windows that are remarkable for several reasons. One is that they were commissioned late enough in his career to have all 7 types of Tiffany glass.

"Context: Born & Raised in BFE KS (4 miles outside a town of 50). Moved to San Antonio, DC, London, Dubai, DC again, KCMO, and now Topeka.

If you're into clubbing and traditional night life, you'll be sorely disappointed. We're only an hour from KCMO though for Power & Light (clubbing). Topeka night life is residential, dive bars, & microbreweries.

Topeka essentially consists of a Zoo, a few aquatic centers, half a dozen museums, chain restaurants, thrift shops, & Walmarts. We've got a bunch of social groups you can get connected with, but it's mainly residential life (like I have a DnD group that meets at my place, a photo club I meet with and a group that pub-crawls).

It's a great place to live if you're raising a family because there's a bunch of kid-centric activities & groups around town. If you're a single guy, whos looking to move somewhere inexpensive but not boring, I'd look just south of Wichita or just north of KCMO. You'll be close enough to uber somewhere fun without breaking the bank.

If you're more the homey type though and aren't afraid to make friends, it's a great town.

As far as crime goes, statistically its pretty safe on average, but there's some pretty rough areas. Basically anything south of 29th street on the east side of town is stabs-ville after dark. I managed to get a deal on a house in the old-money part of town. Nothing but grandmas and poodles where I'm at.

"If by ""DC"" you mean a Distribution Center, you'll be fine.  There are several distribution centers near SW Topeka Blvd;  Target, Walmart, Home Depot and a few others.  They are generally far enough out that the problems I'm referring to won't affect you.  Besides, they all have decent security.  No problems out there.

A couple of decent restaurants out that way also:  Banjo's (especially for breakfast) and Amigo's Mexican restaurant are both pretty decent.  Neither are the best in town, but both are good.  Stay away from the bars and strip joints in that area.  Some aren't bad but some are real problem places, and I don't know enough about which ones are which to tell you to avoid this one and go to that one.

Blind Tiger Restaurant and Brewery on the south side of town is also good (and safe).

"If you are coming to town for business, if you can stay on the West side near Wanamaker, you're safe (generally speaking).  Also, most places Southwest of Fairlawn and 21st are generally safe.  The downtown area is usually safe, as well.

There are plenty of residential areas outside of those areas that are safe, but since you are in town for business and not finding a place to live, I won't go through all of the neighborhoods to look at and those to avoid.

Generally Topeka Blvd south of downtown can be sketchy at times.  Avoid SW Topeka Blvd.  Also, avoid going north of the river.  There are some decent places north of the river, but again, for your purposes, avoid that area, generally speaking.

As far as hotels:  Hyatt Place, Hilton Garden Inn, any of the Marriott properties (Courtyard, Residence Inn, Springhill Suites, etc) are good.  Avoid Quality Inn, even though it's on Wanamaker and avoid the hotels within a block or so of 10th and Wanamaker.  The area in general is safe, but those hotels have tended to have problems.  The newest hotel in town is the Springhill Suites at 29th and Fairlawn.  That's in a nice little area that's just been re-developed.  Nice theater, a couple of decent restaurants and a coffee shop in the same shopping center as the hotel.

Restaurants:  Most places on Wanamaker are safe; some are better than others. Be sure to try Jose Pepper's (near Walmart on Wanamaker) if you like Mexican Food. It's a local chain based out of Kansas City.  If you've never been to a Jason's Deli, it's worth a visit, as well.  The Iron Rail downtown is good. Yuki is a Japanese Steakhouse at 21st and Fairlawn that's pretty good. It's not the best Japanese Steakhouse, but it's the best one in Topeka. 43-Ten Pizza is a local pizza joint that's fairly good.  Never heard of any problems there, and the pizza is decent.  Located at 4310 SW 21st Street.  If you ever want a BIG breakfast, try out The Big Biscuit at 29th and Wanamaker.  It's a local chain based out of Kansas City.  They serve breakfast and lunch.  Service can be a little slow at times, but the food is fantastic.  Bring an appetite; servings are large.

If you want to go to a local bar that's safe, Skinny's at Gage and Huntoon or Speck's at 21st and Gage are both good.  They are local dive bars, but the troublemakers don't go there.  Of course, you can find all of the typical chain places (Olive Garden, Chili's, etc) along Wanamaker.

Generally speaking, I think most of Topeka is safe for travelers.  A lot of the crime in Topeka is crime of opportunity, so people breaking into garages and so on, looking for things they can pawn to buy drugs, and lots of drug-related crime. As long as you aren't out on the streets looking to buy some meth, you can avoid most of that, even in the sketchy parts of town.

Can't stress enough: Stay away from SW Topeka Blvd, especially south of 29th street.  That's where the hookers, dealers, tweakers and strippers go after dark.

EDIT TO ADD:  Bobo's is a local burger/drive in joint that has been in business for something like 70 or 80 years.  It's a local landmark and was featured on an episode of Diner's, Drive Ins and Dives. If you are in town for several days and want a nostalgic ""blast from the past,"" it's worth stopping in once.  The part of town isn't the best in the world, but it's on a busy intersection and nothing bad is going to happen at the restaurant.",t2_imfsuvv,ixamnis,0,1646230158.0,0,t1_hz1tky9,hz1tky9,False,BiffBeltsander,t3_sli7ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/topeka/comments/sli7ca/what_is_life_in_topeka_like/,What is life in Topeka like?,/r/topeka/comments/sli7ca/what_is_life_in_topeka_like/hz1tky9/,1,r/topeka,0,1

"I've been in Topeka for 2 1/2 years and lived in several other cities.  

Honestly, Topeka wouldn't be my first choice of places to live.  It does have a low cost of living.  There are some nice older homes and if you know how to do some remodeling, some of them would make very nice homes if fixed up a bit.  

That said, the crime rate is a bit high. Job opportunities are somewhat limited, although if you are willing to work and don't have a higher education, most of the available jobs are blue-collar.  It's not a great city for shopping and restaurants, partly due to the fact that we are so close to Kansas City and Lawrence, so there is a lot of competition from those cities.

If you like sports, you won't find anyplace that has more to offer in a city this size, as long as you are willing to drive up to an hour and a half.  One of the best NFL teams in the country is in Kansas City, as well as a top-notch baseball team.  Lawrence is home to Kansas and Allen Fieldhouse, which some describe as the ""St. Andrews of College Basketball.""  Topeka is also home to Washburn University.

There has been a lot of effort put into revitalizing the downtown area over the past few years, and while it's not the best in the world, it's much better than it used to be and still improving.

All that said, if I were looking for a city in this area to move to and had no specific ties to the area and no job lined up, I'd probably be looking at Lawrence, Wichita, Omaha (Nebraska), Tulsa (OK) or Oklahoma City before I'd be looking at Topeka.  With the exception of Lawrence, all of those are larger cities and most of them probably have a higher cost of living, though, so that may play a role in where you'd like to dream about living at this point.

"Quick answer is that it's mostly great. I call it the new Brooklyn, after the 1980s/90s art explosion because of all the cheap warehouse space. Topeka isn't there yet, but has tons of potential.

I can also see why many are frustrated. The town is going down (compared to Topeka 30 years ago). More crime and more drugs. And opportunity is low.

However, compared to other towns (like NYC, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Detroit, Akron OH), it's fine and better than average. People are friendlier. It's not busy or stressful.

---
In other words, Topeka is going from 0 thefts to 1 theft. But the rest of urban places was already at 5 thefts or more. So any outsider is gonna say: ""Topeka is nice, nicer than where I came from"". While the old-timer will say ""Its way worse than it use to be.""

1 Terabyte per month and 10 bucks every 50 Gigabytes thereafter with Cox. They offer no data cap for an additional 50 dollars. I have the highest residential tier and unlimited bandwidth for 150 bucks a month.

I rarely go over a terabyte but on the odd month I re-download my XBOX library, I don't have to worry. In truth I went unlimited because YouTube replaced all other options and I was worried about leaving it on all day and night


I have been Pro Cox all twenty of my Adult bill paying life. Att is not an option for me because blah blah nlah blah.....

I like my plan and it may not suit your needs? Try att if you must and whatever you do ALWAYS ask every single question you can think of and then ask some more and then ask them to go over precisely the time and date and procedure for billing. Then ask them for more discounts that don't involve bundles. When it comes to bundles it is possible to get a deposit skipped on service equipment you won't be using and still get the discount. Then ask even more questions. Cox had the infrastructure and att had the name recognition BUT,  they BOTH know good and well not to give discounts to those that do not inquire about them.

Now go get you the Precise internet YOU want from whomever will get you the closest.

"It's not a complete pass-through though. It either double NATs, which can mess with some things, or the ATT box does the routing, which defeats the point.

The real modem is the ONT (white box) that receives the fiber. One could plug the router directly to that, but it uses a special authentication and keys that are on the black box.

The setup I was using was similar to the last one in this article:

"I think your options are ATT cable, ATT fiber, and COX.

I have no experience with ATT cable.

With ATT fiber, you can get awesome speeds, but... the advertised plan prices do not include an equipment rental fee (10 dollars?), and you cannot just buy any modem and call it a day. Also, their supplied box sucks. It struggles with multiple streams and concurrent users. It's not the internet, but rather the router that can't process things fast enough. It sucks. If you are hacky enough, you can use your own equipment (google ATT WPA supplicant). Once I did that, it was very good!

The other option is Cox. It's cable. It's fastest plans are not as fast as fiber. But it's decent enough. It's about the same price if you skip the equipment rental. You can use your own equipment without having to do hacky things. I got a cheap netgear modem from amazon (40 bucks I think?), plugged it into my good router and its been excellent. It does come with a data cap. I think its a terabyte per month or something like that. I never hit it. We are two people.

"Really,   I've driven around and it looks like a half decent area to me.   Lake Shawnee area seems real nice.  Central parts of Topeka look old and run down but no signs of outward neglect.  Certainly not a ghetto.   Some of the houses near Washburn are real nice.  Everything East of Adam's Street seems ok to me.   I sure don't see any gang graffiti or blight like you are gonna find in Kansas City or St. Louis.  

I'm wondering if it's just some real estate agents that like to redline certain areas so they can push people over to high dollar areas where they have houses forsale.  It just seems unnuatural for people to hate on a particular part of a city when by the data crime is no worse than any other part of town.  

Seems every real estate agent or anyone I talk to steers me over towards the Topeka West side.   Maybe it's a good thing.  I've got my eyeball on a house Southeast Topeka right now.

"Topeka is an interesting place to live. I moved here from the east coast a few years ago and it was a huge culture shock. People are much more friendly here. Housing is plentiful and cheap. The library is really fantastic and if you look hard enough there's a decent amount of stuff to do. However meth is a huge problem in Topeka and your stuff WILL get stolen if it's not nailed, bolted, and padlocked. When I first moved I bought a house in College Hill because it was supposed to be a great neighborhood. Well...it was nice but our cars still got broken into, stuff stolen out of our yard, cars broken into twice, countless meth heads traipsing past the house, and my husband got jumped in the alley. After two years of gunshots and sirens every night I sold the house and moved to far south Topeka. So much better! Much quieter, a fair amount safer, and less traffic. 

Topeka is very easy to navigate once you get a feel for the layout. Minimal traffic and easy interstate access makes it so that you can get pretty much anywhere in less than 20 minutes.  The roads are horrible though. You'll quickly figure out what roads to avoid once you pop a tire or two. The handling of snow removal leaves a lot to be desired here. The city seems to at least be aware of the problem though and has tried a few strategies to make it better. I think people want Topeka to be a good place to live again (everyone always says it used to be good but then it changed) but it has some very serious issues at its core that need to be addressed by people who actually know what they are doing. Topeka doesn't seem to have much in the way of leadership. Lots of band aids on bullet holes for the big things that really make Topeka not seem like the greatest place to live. I'm not planning to leave Topeka any time soon so I really hope that it can continue positive momentum.",t2_ypi8d,Xxmissvxx,0,1641100175.0,0,t1_hqwf2ee,hqwf2ee,True,chongman99,t3_rtnlae,https://www.reddit.com/r/topeka/comments/rtnlae/why_im_choosing_to_move_to_topeka_ama/,"Why I'm choosing to move to Topeka, AMA",/r/topeka/comments/rtnlae/why_im_choosing_to_move_to_topeka_ama/hqwf2ee/,2,r/topeka,0,2
"My neighbor across the street had their house shot up by a drive by over the summer. Every summer I catch people in my driveway checking my car doors.

"I'm a real estate broker living part time in Topeka (since Aug.) while attending law school. Your observations are a bit different than what I've been seeing. The crime rate in Topeka where homes are priced in the range you mention is about 7x the national average.

I have been enjoying my time in Topeka and purchased a small house in the same price range north of the river on Kansas Ave. The crime rate there was significantly lower than the areas south of the river. If you can go west of MacVicar, it seems to be good. But again, I'm part time and relatively new, so others can pipe up if I am mistaken.

It's nothing at all like LA, San Francisco, or Las Vegas, in my opinion, based on spending as little as two weeks and as much as many months in those locations.

For me, it feels like Topeka is a place where time moves a little slower. There are so many things I've seen in Topeka that I haven't seen in a decade in other places: Golden Corral, Schlotzky's, Long John Silvers, Denny's, Hobby Lobby and other places I haven't seen very often in the last ten years in other cities. Yesterday I saw a [spotlight](https://gobigadvertising.com/searchlights-for-sale/) like stores used so often in the 1970s and 1980s.

I've found the people to be pretty friendly. I joined a pool team at Breakers and it seems like people take you as they find you.

"I moved to Topeka from a smaller city a couple years ago. I was here for 6 months, I ended up moving away but I came back. That's how much I like it here. It is somewhat dangerous, and drugs ARE an epidemic here, especially meth, but if you aren't looking for trouble, you won't find it. It's very culturally diverse, there is definitely opportunity here, it's only 40 minutes away from KC, 20 minutes from Lawrence. I like the women, the vibe, and the diversity. It is very affordable too, you can find nice apartments around the Washburn University area for a good price. Just shop around, but for a nicer 1 bedroom/studio you're looking at 500-700 a month. You're also never more then 30 minutes from anything in Topeka by car, and our public transport system is really not too bad either.

"A couple minor observations: 

1. Privately owned land doesn't necessarily require a no trespassing sign to be on it. You are still trespassing. The police won't arrest you without evidence that you knew you were trespassing, which is the reason signs get posted, but you still don't have any right to be there if it's not public property.
2. Police have the right to pursue a someone suspected of a crime. I am no expert on what limits there might be to it, but it's called the ""fresh pursuit"" doctrine. If the security was an off-duty police officer, perhaps that would explain the chase?

If there are no trespassing signs on the building, that probably means that you are not invited to enter the owner's property. I don't know too many owners who would say, ""You can't enter my structures but you can trespass on my land,"" if that makes sense. I can't imagine what they might've thought your friends were guilty of, but realistically, you've only heard their side of the story, which might be leaving out details that would change your perceptions. I mean, if they were chased from the moment they climbed out a window, that wouldn't be quite the same understanding as you have now, right?",t2_6q16o,MsTerious1,0,1640805824.0,0,t1_hqg33vu,hqg33vu,False,weoutsideimoutside,t3_rr4qlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/topeka/comments/rr4qlu/menninger_clock_tower/,Menninger clock tower,/r/topeka/comments/rr4qlu/menninger_clock_tower/hqg33vu/,3,r/topeka,0,3

"Yes, but... that is the Southern tip thereof. Topeka High is at 10th and Western just a couple of miles south and a touch (three blocks) West from there. USD 501 is rather big for how little it encompasses. USD 345 (Seaman) main offices on NW Lyman and runs North out to between Topeka and Meriden (USD 340. Heck yeah!). You are in a border area with a choice, and usually, and an argument thereof. That has been a rough area for a while and since it is mostly depressed and White, parents want their kids to head to Seaman. Why? Because Seaman historical means more Landed, Monies, and White. The ""troubled"", poorer, and less likely to succeed go to 501. Yes I acknowledge this is a wildly oversimplified generalization that directly results from Brown v Board being only a few generations removed from the utter racism and discrimination that is White Topeka. North meant white and Central meant black as White flight made central Topeka an Urban (read  black/er) area. Especially maddening as Central Topeka was founded by the same people who abandoned it and then raised terribly less respectable white families on the North side of the river. Just look where the Mission is.... Not on the south side of Topeka Boulevard Bridge as that property wasnt nearly as cheap or undesirable.

"I've always thought it could be the local hub of Topeka. Basically imagine if NOTO completely packed up and filled the entire mall. The first friday art walks (FFAW) would be just as popular in December as they are in June because it would be indoors. There would finally be enough parking for the FFAW. Vendors could setup in the middle mall areas like they do for card shows during FFAW. This would generate a much bigger regional draw than the current retail stores in the mall because it would be completely unique to Topeka. It would also serve as an incubator for local small businesses in Topeka, whether it's restaurants, a local art gallery, a tattoo artist, local nail salon, photography studio, etc. you would know where to go to experience and buy what's local to Topeka. I believe there are so many Topekans that think if they need something, then go to Wanamaker where all of the big box stores are. You could change a lot of that purchasing behavior if local options were right next to them which in turn helps Topeka grow by keeping more money local.

Realistically I would never recommend the NOTO area be abandoned because what they've done is amazing for Topeka and I wish them nothing but the best and to keep growing the area.

"I don't know if you'll still consider this relevant, given how long ago the question was posted, but I wanted to chime in anyway.

I will start with this: All I've ever heard about Wichita from people who've visited there and lived there is that it's The Worst. I don't really have an opinion as I've never lived or visited there, but Ive never heard anything good about Wichita.

Now, I've lived in Topeka my whole life, lived in various parts of town, from ghetto to upper middle class, and I've really tried to go out and experience as much as possible in town. Topeka has had sooo many ups and downs since the late 80s to 1990s, and that's because that was around the time that Topeka became an advertising test market. I think it still is. This is when everything started migrating from downtown and along the stretch of Topeka Blvd and Kansas Ave to every other direction, especially West. The west side of town is where they built the new mall as well as the towns first Hypermart, now Walmart. Once both those things happened, Everything about Topeka changed, including its identity, in that it didn't have one so much anymore.

Topeka is currently trying to rediscover itself, and the strides  and measures that have been taken in the last 10 years are promising. Topeka's biggest problem is that the very most loudest people talking about Topeka are also the people saying it sucks and there's nothing to do and go to Lawrence or KC if you wanna do something fun. Like, hello! Earth to ding dongs! Topeka is trying to get better, and it's not even bad!, but because some people's children are spoiled or unwilling to Try to seek out all Topeka has to offer, and it has A LOT to offer if you actually look, they trash talk it. 

I know a lot of people that are around my age, late 20s to early 30s, that are happy living here and raising their kids. I know several people that have moved back after leaving, as well. The trails and parks are awesome. There is literally always something to do, even if we do close a little early.

"I like the west side YMCA which has an indoor swimming pool, hot tub and slide. There are some fun outdoor pools too. One up north has a lazy river. 

I like the food. There are Thai and Indian places. Plus the BBQ Kansas is known for. 

The library is great. It won best library in the country like ten years ago. 

I like living near a university. Topeka has Washburn which hosts concerts and lectures when it’s not a pandemic. 

The zoo is nice. The families I know really use it a lot to occupy their young kids. They just put in a Japanese garden and the tigers had like 5 Cubs a few years ago so there are lots of tigers. Sadly, the elephant and wolf passed on. But they are fundraising for a big improvement for the giraffes.

"I moved to Topeka from Los Angeles years ago so my kids would have a nice environment to grow up. I have zero regrets.

"I’ve lived in Topeka my whole life. It’s not all that bad. As another notes, there are places to avoid living. Topeka is very block to block. You can have drug busts and shootings just blocks away from nice-ish neighborhoods. The west side of town is the safer side of town. Or the lake Shawnee area on the east side of town. Like I said though, very block to block. 

The downtown area is attempting to come alive but ever since Covid, they haven’t been doing too great. The places down there all pretty much close by 11. Our mall is a complete joke. There are literally more vacant store in there than there are open ones. 

I’ve never lived in Wichita so I don’t know much about that. My whole family has lived in Topeka their whole lives so it would be a tough move. But I think when I can, I’ll be looking to head to Lawrence or the Kansas City area. I don’t HATE Topeka, but Topeka doesn’t really try to give you much to love.",t2_biskwy79,RaisinSmooth,0,1630763815.0,0,t1_hbkhof2,hbkhof2,True,meggiefaith,t3_phgzcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/topeka/comments/phgzcc/help_us_decide_topeka_or_wichita/,Help us decide!

"Topeka has some great schools and a great small county feel within those schools. Also, everything in Topeka is less than 15 minutes away which is conveniently close.  If you are a person who doesn't need a new scene each week Topeka is a great city.  

Wichita has much more variety hands down.  If you value nightlife Wichita has it.  That said, if you live in Topeka, Manhattan and Lawrence are 20 to 40 minites away (the same amount of time you might spend going from one part of Wichita to another) and have all the character you need for a getaway.",t2_9mm5e,lalh20,0,1630763681.0,0,t1_hbkhep0,hbkhep0,True,meggiefaith,t3_phgzcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/topeka/comments/phgzcc/help_us_decide_topeka_or_wichita/,Help us decide!

"Both have the same issues every big town or city have.

Wichita is big enough to have suburbs. I never lived there. But I have family that has been there forever. Obviously they like it and I like to visit 

I live in Topeka. People pile on negativity. But it's not bad. I agree with the comment that Topeka needs to stop trying to copy other towns and be itself. Close to Lawrence and KC. I'm not a night life guy, but I can't imagine there is much of one here. There's stuff to do, but you have to sometimes work at finding it.
