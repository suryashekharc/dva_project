">But I’m confused as shit by you stating that people paying a lot more for housing are supposedly not being told they will struggle for basic services and good for their kids or pets. Those people will never have a problem unless literally everyone will.

This just isn't complicated.

Yes, they have wealth. But there are literally not enough people working these jobs to service the amount of people moving here right now. When a new client calls into my work, we turn them away because we are at capacity, like many many places. We don't ask ""well what's your net worth, I'll kick out a client with less money and replace them."" There are businesses in the area that have been open for 12 months that are at capacity and no longer taking new clients. 

This would be a non issue if a proportionate amount of people who are qualified and able to run these services and provide these goods were also moving here. But it has become so unaffordable here that not only can these types of workers not move here, but the ones already here are being rapidly pushed out. 

This isn't some type of a judgement from me on wealthy people moving here. It's a completely unsustainable reality that will have to be grappled with regardless of whether people who haven't been confronted with it yet are able to admit it's happening.

>Let people move where they want and fuck off with the gate keeping shit. 

Again *this isn't some gatekeeping judgement. This is a very real and enormous community issue.*

>If it bother you that much, leave. You’ll be happier elsewhere

You can feel this way but this town *needs* people to run it and if you are fine with everyone providing goods and services having to leave you are all going to be left with a nonfunctional community.

I'm not old or opposed to growth by any means. I had been very excited about people moving to the community and it expanding until very recently. The problem is not the growth. The problem is the total lack of class diversity in the growth. The problem is the growth not coinciding with proportionate increase in affordable house for the people working in the community to live in.

">Both incorrect buddy.

Frankly, I don't believe this. I've lived here for 25 years and every single person I know here understands that working class people who do hands on services/work in the community being priced out within a 40 mile radius is a serious infrastructural issue for our community.

>If someone wants to move to Frederick, let them without questions their motivations lol.

I bring these issues up for several reasons. One of which is that I am considering whether to leave and find a different community to service and would like to hear from people moving to the community about who they are and what their thoughts are to get a beat on who I would be serving in the future if I decide to stay.

Another reason is these are issues that sellers, real estate agents and newer members of the community are not going to bring up to people considering moving here. No one is going to say ""you are rapidly going to struggle to get basic services and good for your kids, yourself, your pets, etc."" I turn away 5 new clients A DAY, for example.

Urbana Liquors is the worst booze shop I've been to outside of DC.

Don't bother asking if something's in stock, he'll point to the section and tell you ""look there.""  

Orion is super friendly and has a great wine selection, booze is average priced, nice store with helpful people.

Franklin is friendly enough, but you go there because the couple of minutes drive will save you some $.

"Alright, so, sorry for the long response - 

I figured the least I could do was reply, explain my situation a little more and show some appreciation for everyone's replies and support. Really means a lot. 

Unfortunately, too often, rights are for those who can afford to defend them. Originally, my lease was a six month lease, then month to month. Under the new owner, I was told it would be on a month to month basis. The due date on my rent was changed from the end of the month to the beginning of the month, and the only lease I've signed with the new owner was a copy of the original owners lease, altered to include the revised payment date. This was signed three months ago.

Legally, I'm not sure where this leaves me. If I did pursue legal action, I worry a week is not enough time to find out.

Homelessness is not an option I want to consider. I have little support in the area, and never learned how to drive (😖), so my options are extremely limited.

Realistically, I don't think I have the time or resources to seek legal counsel, nor am I sure I want to continue conducting business with my current landlord.

Once again, I appreciate the kind words and advice. I've never been through this before - so if I am wrong about seeking a lawyer, or there are resources available that would be able to resolve this quickly - please do not hesitate to send me more information.

"Baker park is one of the better dog parks Ive been to. It is more than big enough despite what one other post says. 15 dogs can all have plenty of room. It's not like you want some massive field where you lose sight of your dog anyway. And baker is usually well cared for by the city and regulars. For example it has a doggo water fountain and even in winter when the city turns off the water the regulars are great and bring cartons of water for everyone. It also depends on what your dog needs. Baker has a consistent crowd of mostly very nice people on weekdays after work and a decent crowd on weekend mornings, so it is good if your dog likes to run with others and play.",t2_8ujf2y9d,MysteriousAd4462,0,1648000718.0,0,t1_i1qs169,i1qs169,True,hallmark116,t3_tk3mba,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/tk3mba/dog_parks/,Dog parks?,/r/frederickmd/comments/tk3mba/dog_parks/i1qs169/,1,r/frederickmd,0,1

"$1K/month apartments are uncommon these days in Frederick and may involve compromises you’d rather not make, and may be few and far between.  

But it it’s still doable in some outlying areas like around the smaller towns. Thurmont, Emmitsburg, Brunswick, maybe Walkersville. I know someone who just moved in to a $800/month 1BR 1BA apartment in Thurmont. It’s a well maintained ~50 year old building but no gym, pool and other amenities that the $1500-$1700 1BRs in Frederick often have.

"I think these people don't understand why there is ""Black"" culture but not ""white"" culture in the US.  

They don't understand that (I have no idea what the actual breakdown is) a majority of Black people's family history stops a little more than two generations ago.  What they have is the experience of being Black in America.   Being the descendants of slaves (chattel slaves) or just not know where their family is from.  Experiencing prejudice at all levels.

It's not their race that they're celebrating, it's their communal experience (I just ad libbing and this is all up for interpretation feel free to chime in).  


The vast majority of White people have some idea of where their family is from because it wasn't ripped away from them.  Their culture is from specific places like Germany, France, etc etc etc.   So there isn't really ""white"" culture in the same sense as ""black"" culture.

"**[Blue Lives Matter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lives_Matter)** 
 
 >Blue Lives Matter is a countermovement in the United States advocating that those who are prosecuted and convicted of killing law enforcement officers should be sentenced under hate crime statutes. It was started in response to Black Lives Matter after the homicides of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York on December 20, 2014. Criticized by the ACLU and others, the movement inspired a state law in Louisiana that made it a hate crime to target police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical service personnel.

"Not doubting there are little to no racist signs. But I wouldn’t put it past them to understand PR and optics. To have say “stay out of my country” or something stupid is way to obvious. However, between where they are set up and DC which I travel everyday, I see indirect representation of the expected bigotry. For example the Blue Lives Matter flag which can be argued either way but found roots as a reactionary response to BLM. Another would be the American flag being flown with the Christian flag, which someone could argue “the US was founded on Christian principles, our dollar says in god we trust” but that does not align with American values of freedom of religion. In fact I would argue the use of that flag being represented was more along the lines of claiming Christian and white Anglo-Saxon background supremacy which it is more often used to indicate like in the use of kkk.

The electrician will advise if you need to be hard wired or just using a NMEA 14-50 plug. As far as brands for the charger, look at Clipper Creek, Grizzl-e, Juicebox or Charegepoint.

"2022 REVIEW: I hope things turned out good for you with moving to Frederick.

I moved to Frederick from Virginia in 2009 and lived there until 2020. Overall, Frederick is a great city and it is in a great location in the state (easy access to Baltimore and DC also with nice scenery). However, I can’t help but point out the obvious issue with Frederick, and that is the fact that over the last 8-10 years, it has become completely overran by delinquents such as wannabe gangsters and a lot of teenagers who have been mentally manipulated by Hip Hop and Rap culture. There are without a doubt lots of great people in the city of Frederick, but they are quickly getting outnumbered by the bad. I moved out of state in December of 2020 for business-related reasons, but other than missing the scenery (awesome view of the mountains all throughout the county) along with the diversity of the population (very mixed community with different cultures merging together), I couldn’t have been happier to escape the toxic environment that Frederick has become due to their brainwashed youth. This applies to just about every part of Frederick.

 Ballenger Creek is probably the nicest area to live, but it is easily the mecca for young teens trying to be something they’re not (the spike in crime in the Ballenger area over the last 5 years proves that statement to be true). Urbana is easily the wealthiest area to live in and the nicest-looking area, but their youth is also severely troubled (underage sex and alcohol). Middletown is quiet and peaceful until a person of color is present, then it suddenly becomes the south in the 1950s (very racist community). Liganore/New Market is for sure the safest and most family-friendly area to live, but all of it’s residents are either farmers, pot smokers (the kids even refer to Oakdale High School as “Smoke-dale”), priveleged kids, or rude high school athletes (no in-between). Nobody ever bothers going to Myersville, Thurmont, Walkersville, or Brunswick unless they either want to buy drugs or they’ve lived there their entire lives. “40” is an area that got it’s name from the highway that runs through it. Although it has nice neighborhoods and those who live there are lucky to live so close to a lot of restaraunts and stores, it has been the city’s hotspot for the MS-13 for years now, making it one of the most dangerous areas in the county. Downtown Frederick easily offers the most activities such as great food spots, lots of bars for night life, and historic locations. But wander off in the wrong direction, away from the attractions, and you’ll just as easily find yourself in a bad neighborhood (specifically Lucas Village) that is ridden with a bunch of guys who are caught up in their 1990s Compton California fantasy. The only place in Frederick County that has pretty much no negative aspects about it, is Adamstown. Absolutely beautiful place to live, everything from the houses to the scenery is breath-taking. It even has it’s own restaraunt, post office, and convenience store at a walking distance from both The Commons and Green-Hill Manor. Once in a while, someone from the inner-city will travel through Adamstown to rob the restaraunt or the convenience store (or commit petty crime), but they are always caught and arrestted shortly after.

Overall, Frederick started off as a 4/5 rating for me when I first moved there, and once 2013-2015 came, it dropped down to a 2/5 rating. This place is all about finding the right area to reside and trying your best to keep to yourself. If you can manage to do those two things, Frederick isn’t the worst place in the world to live. I feel like the whole problem with the teens and young adults in this area really roots from the city simply not offering enough entertainment. Therefore they resort to getting intoxicated and commiting crimes for fun. I still wouldn’t recommend it over other cities/counties in Maryland.",t2_dxaebz6l,TheGloryKid,0,1647626577.0,0,t1_i16kdzx,i16kdzx,True,HokieGirl07,t3_ne3sgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/ne3sgr/moving_to_frederick/,Moving to Frederick!,/r/frederickmd/comments/ne3sgr/moving_to_frederick/i16kdzx/,1,r/frederickmd,0,1

"Yeah strange times indeed, and to be clear, I'm not knocking those that paid a markup/adjustment, because everyone's time and money value relationships are different (you can afford the markup, but not the couple days off work to fly and drive a thousand miles back).

I think you mean Level 2 charger. Lever 3 is the DCFC (DC Fast Charger) with Electrify America or ChargePoint (or the few other vendors). L3 chargers cost over $100k/unit and require commercial power hookups. But don't worry about it, electric cars come with a whole new vocabulary to learn. 

L1: 120V@8/10/12A

L2: 240V@up to 50A (the specification can go up to 80A, but few cars and stations can do this, the EV6 is 240@45A I believe. 

L3: DC fast charging, up to 800v@430A (depending on what the car can do). 


Any licensed/bonded electrician should be able to install a Level 2 charger, I personally have the Chargepoint flex since there is a deal with Potomac Energy to use that charger and connect the accounts. Depending on your home wiring capabilities and recency of construction, a regular attached garage, with decently easy panel access should cost in the $500-$1000 range, if it's a complicated install it could be a few thousand. If it's more than a grand, I'd get a few quotes.",t2_6gt4ew8u,combustioncycle,0,1647624818.0,0,t1_i16fvz9,i16fvz9,False,rainbow-throwaway,t3_tgzc0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/tgzc0t/an_email_i_wrote_to_darcars_kia_in_frederick/,An email I wrote to Darcars Kia in Frederick,/r/frederickmd/comments/tgzc0t/an_email_i_wrote_to_darcars_kia_in_frederick/i16fvz9/,2,r/frederickmd,0,2

In terms of game shops there's Brainstorm in Walkersville for tabletop games. I think the downtown location also has table top merch but it's more of a comic shop. Video games I always recommend Cartridges Galore in Buckeystown. The staff is great and they've got a good selection in good condition. Tournament City Games is also a good pick but they're more of a card shop rather than a video game shop. My biggest pet peeve is some of their game cases have a little sun damage but those are typically on shoveware Wii games.

From my understanding,  he tried once to negotiate and they said no and then told him there was a lien on his house....which he doesn't own lol so THAT part I don't think is legit.

"I defaulted on a car loan in 1999. I ignored it. Took some bad advice about not ever having to pay a debt older than 7 years. I continued to ignore this debt. Bought a house, they went through my credit, made me pay off certain things for the loan. The repossessed car never ever came up. I'm laughing...all the way to the bank so to speak. Then, a few years later (last year) my employer informs me they're garnishing my wages,  for defaulting on that 5k loan for the car in 1999. Now they want 15k. Talked to a lawyer, was advised to negotiate, got it down to 9k, but had to pay it all at once. The only other option would have been bankruptcy. I'm lucky that I could pay it off. I suggest your friend contact an attorney,  they will more than likely give you a free quick consult over phone, and can probably tell you if debt is valid or not.

"Yes! The entire bodies of lakes are all man made by the Virginia Electric and Power Co. (which is now called Dominion Energy) & it was created for providing cooling water to the nuclear power plant there. Very incredible place and the water is pleasantly clean and comfortable year around! Ofc everyone jokes about “oh no radiation!” But its by far one of the cleanest and nicest places Ive ever visited, tbh.

Tons of places to stay there and a great choice of Air BnBs too since it was initially marketed to be a vacation home for people living in the DMV area. 

The state park is really well maintained. Even stumbled on some locals fishing and they too seem to really love it & the wildlife seems healthy… maybe because of the “Nuclear” aspect that makes the EPA extra careful to not make it look like a shithole, idk? 

**I do know that they have had recent issues with Algae bloom in the Northern parts of the lakes where the water is warmer (and closer to the power plant) but from what I read their next testing won’t be until May 2022.

Bottom Line. The cooks, managers, and owners don't care about the food that goes onto plates. It is garbage. Every night, they serve garbage to people and collect those people's money. As long as they can keep doing that, they'll keep sucking.

Basically, the DC and exurb area has a massive amount of growth and growth potential. Developers are taking advantage of that and getting rich.  I also hate that the neighborhood I moved into is no longer the neighborhood I once loved.

My (perhaps accusatory) point is: we all want things to stay just the way they are when we decided this place would be our home. The development does indeed feel like it is encroaching on that plan.

However, our homes were at one point fields. Those fields were one time forests. The new folks moving in are just as wide eyed about their new homes as we once were about ours when things were pristine.

"The Dixon House has been important to the Urbana community as a tavern and Inn since early in the 1800s. By 1822, John Rine, the son of Casper Rine, a tenant on one of the Johnson brother farms was operating a tavern in a log structure close to the present Dixon House site. In 1848, John Rine died (his grave is in the cemetery next to the house} and willed the plantation whereon I now dwell"" to his two daughters Mary Dronenberg and Lucy Dixon.2 In 1850, the land was divided and Thomas and Lucy Dixon obtained the land where the present building now stands.

In 1855, a new brick building replaced the log structure. According to J.W. Dixon, son of Lucy and Thomas Dixon, Jim Phoebus was the bricklayer, John Gardner, the master carpenter, and John Brengle was the painter.3 The house remained in the Dixon family until 1906. In 1926, the Baumgardners bought the building and converted it into a restaurant which still is owned by the family.5
