The office spaces are definitely interesting. When I first started I was at a WeWork that had similar vibes; I was lucky enough to find just a spare space in a building because I have no in-person retail presence and I don't want to pay for what I'll never need.

That said.. If the price is right these places would be great. I'll add them to the search while I try to re-create my unicorn office that I found here.

"I can't help on the office space part of things. But I will highly recommend my apartment complex Hunters Lake in Cuyahoga Falls. It's just off of Howe Ave so very close to shopping. I feel like my apartment is very quiet. The only shared walls are the kitchen and then the stairwell and one bedroom (I'm in an end unit). I never hear my neighbor beside us and the neighbors who share a kitchen wall with us are also quiet and I only ever hear their cupboards shutting. I see lots of people with kids here, there's even a small playground and a fenced in dog area, as well as a 1/4 mile walking path around a pond. 100% very pet friendly, I'm not sure but I don't think there's even breed restrictions because I see pitties and extra large dog breeds around. I genuinely love it here. I lived in Kent for 8 years and bounced around from apartment to apartment and this has been my favorite one so far because of how quiet it is.

"That was Don Flowers. Great guy...great ribs.
He passed away a couple of years ago. 
His BBQ sauce was original Open Pit, thin orange slices, chopped onion, and garlic powder simmered to perfection. He did BBQ chickens, too.
Once when he was cooking in the Eastwood's parking lot, a car went out of control and crashed into his set up. He didn't get hurt but his stand was trashed.
Don also used to set up outside of Sir Dudley's Pub on S. Arlington for several years after the Eastwood closed.
He was a lot of fun. We used to hit the bars on St. Patty's Day and Don would always wear a green tuxedo with a top hat.

"There aren't any grocery or convenience stores in downtown. Your best bet would be something close to campus meant for students or a gas station but that will have limited options, especially for anything fresh. There's an Aldi fairly close to the south end of downtown but I would take public transit. Google says Aldi is a 15 minute walk from 401 Lofts but it's heavily trafficked so I'd be weary.

There's several restaurants downtown so getting food should be fairly easy. There's a lot of options closer to campus too that you could easily walk to.

I think it's definitely doable to not have a car as long as you have realistic expectations of the limitations and have a flexible schedule to take public transit.

"I would not consider Akron very walkable but anything can be done if you are determined. The infrastructure was not created for it, nor was it for biking. It is can be hilly in some places and there aren’t always sidewalks. I know of a few pedestrians/bicyclists who have been hit by cars in Akron so I would highly recommend wearing bright, reflective gear, especially at night. 

There are some restaurants downtown but they’re pretty spread out. I’m not sure about grocery stores but I am not aware of one in the immediate vicinity of downtown. The bike “lanes” are laughable. Plus, the weather sucks. I used to work downtown and I had a short walk from the parking garage to my job and it seems like the tall buildings downtown create some kind of wind funnel because it was unbearable in the winter. However, I am a baby. If you have your heart set on it, I highly recommend buying proper winter gear (for next year, obviously). Not sure where you’re from originally but wool socks, a good scarf, windbreaker and proper foot gear will go a long way. 

This might be a controversial take as I haven’t lived or explored downtown in a while but it hasn’t always been the safest. Not is it the most dangerous. But if I were you I would plan to carry some kind of protection like pepper spray or something. The recent developments downtown have been great and I think the city as a whole is on track to be growing in a good direction. I’m very proud of this town and what it has to offer and I do think it’s getting better. 

If I were you I would look at living around the university. Again, haven’t been hanging around there lately but I imagine there are more amenities for college kids without cars there and it is in the vicinity of downtown. Not sure what housing is going for but I know a lot of college kids choose to live in Highland Square bc it can be cheap, which is a small but walkable neighborhood that has groceries and restaurants. And there are several bus stops if you decide to go that route. 

Hope you find what you’re looking for!

"> Why are you so bent on saying this is crazy conspiracy stuff?

When it seems as if someone is trying to hatch a new conspiracy theory, such as some police personnel acting in concert to suppress information, I take notice.  Conspiracy theories have done a lot of damage over the last 5 years or so.

>I'd like to think our SWAT officers are more careful with their weapons. Is that an unreasonable expectation?

I'm pretty sure that even high-speed SWAT people make errors.  So while perfection is a nice goal to have, I think it is an impossible one.  So you'll have things like this occasionally.

Almost anywhere around the southern area of Akron is a good place to raise a family.

If you want a small city with good schools, check out Green. Want a slightly bigger city with decent schools overall, that's North Canton.

Looking for lake access?   
Portage Lakes and Turkeyfoot Lake are probably the most popular in the area. Slightly further south is Nimisila Reservoir.   
Northeast of these, just outside of Akron is Springfield Lake (Lakemore/Springfield Township). It's smaller in comparison, but the closest lake to the Akron city limits.  
To the southeast is Wingfoot Lake. The area is more rural. Wingfoot Lake State Park is very nice and has a dog park. There's also a blimp hanger for one of GoodYear's smaller blimps. Sometimes you'll see the blimp docked or flying around the Akron area.  
East of Akron is Mogadore Reservoir. Good area, also more rural. I've never been to the lake yet, but it has a camp ground.

Property taxes and school ratings vary depending on the specific area. Since most of the area is outside of a city, houses are further apart and developments with HOA fees are scarce. But, if you like close neighbors and a bunch of neighborhood kids to get your kids out of the house, look for a suburb of Akron.",t2_8kn6nzse,Pools_Closed1,0,1647026652.0,0,t1_i0a0qcp,i0a0qcp,False,Puzzleheaded_Put6197,t3_t6ulyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/akron/comments/t6ulyw/cool_place/,Cool place?,/r/akron/comments/t6ulyw/cool_place/i0a0qcp/,2,r/akron,0,2

"If you're interested in the Akron area, I'd recommend a township around Akron. It's easier to find houses with more property, lower taxes, and probably better schools than Akron City. This is fairly obvious, but consider the school ratings in each of these areas, the will vary. 

I'm not very familiar with the northern area of Akron. So, I'm covering what I know and where I would look for a home.

Depending on your budget, you reliably find a good place to raise a family in these areas around Akron:

Mogadore

Suffield

Springfield township, Lakemore

Uniontown

Portage Lakes

New Franklin

Norton

Copley

"Look up the 85th percentile rule in traffic engineering.  By definition, on a controlled access highway, if everyone is going fast that's the correct speed.  There is no such thing as a road with a speeding problem, if the majority of traffic is exceeding the posted limit that means either a high speed road was built where a low speed road is needed (cities that put four lanes with wide shoulders through a neighborhood and then wonder why no one goes 25) or it's a legitimate high speed road with the limit set arbitrarily low by some local law.

You should be asking why the posted limit is irrationally low.  If a speed limit is supposed to mean ""it is objectively unsafe to exceed this speed no matter what you are driving"" then on a controlled access highway that number is set by visibility.  Straight, flat stretches of highway with effectively infinite visibility don't need limits, as proven beyond any reasonable doubt by Germany.

"As far as a **wedding** venue, you might want to check out the Glamorgan Castle in Alliance. https://www.glamorgancastle.com/

It's public land. But, I'm not sure if their policies have changed in the past few years. When I got married there, I needed event insurance to cover the venue. Then it was just the cost of the setup (tables, chairs, etc.). To clarify a little, we used the grounds/exterior of the castle for the wedding ceremony only. Our group was also around 100 people.  I know there are more rules, costs and group size limitations if you want to use the inside of the castle.

Our reception was the the Elk's Lodge, about half a mile away. We reserved some rooms at the Hampton for out of town guests. It's also super close, probably less than a two mile drive. Everything went super well. If you want to get married at a castle, this is your most reasonably priced option.

I have a 1st grader. He has a Chromebook and does work on it daily. I am not sure how much per day though. He is supposed to complete 100 min per week of a learning program and is generally able to do that amount at school. I think some of their standardized tests are also on the computer.

"I think age factors into this. The Akron/Kent music scene is nowhere near as popular and busy as it was 15-20 years ago. That's not to say there aren't any good bands currently around, as there are. It just isn't what it was when I was a teen. Back in the early 2000's, there were kickass shows literally every weekend in the area. And the metal bands from the area were getting national recognition, even jumping on tour dates with HUGE names.
  A large piece of the problem now is the lack of venues. Many of the ones that I grew up in have been torn down to make way for larger businesses or developments. Or they closed because the owners got old and wanted to retire.
   Akron really needs a new premiere venue dedicated to local music. A place that still has cheap entry, great sound, and a friendly atmosphere. I think the closest thing to that currently is the Musica, and quite honestly, their sound sucks.",t2_z79yiq,Jimbodini25,0,1646181122.0,0,t1_hyzgl7a,hyzgl7a,False,greenhousecrtv,t3_t4lpmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/akron/comments/t4lpmh/reviving_the_akron_sound_tattoo_artist_turns/,"Reviving the 'Akron Sound': Tattoo artist turns former post office into music venue, creator's space",/r/akron/comments/t4lpmh/reviving_the_akron_sound_tattoo_artist_turns/hyzgl7a/,11,r/akron,0,11

I work for a local government here. Contacting your HR sounds like the correct first step. To my knowledge the Norton/Barberton JEDDZ is limited to areas surrounding Norton to help finance and expand Barberton sewer and water infrastructure. I don't believe that Peninsula or Boston township have a JEDD and if they did it would have more than likely have been with Akron to pay for similar infrastructure since they would have the closest lines. I would assume you live in Boston township and since it's a NC company they probably just picked a random income tax district to remit your income tax without fully knowing or understanding how 1. howmunicipal income tax in Ohio works and 2. Townships don't charge income tax when a wfh resident or place of business is located outside a JEDD area. If your employer can't help figure this out I would get ahold of Barbertons income tax and planning departments to prove you don't live in the JEDD and that they owe you money back for improper tax collection. They planning department will have copy of the JEDD map and obviously income tax has your money.,t2_1z24zsa0,peeppoll,0,1645981249.0,0,t1_hynwduf,hynwduf,False,beeficecream,t3_t08cce,https://www.reddit.com/r/akron/comments/t08cce/as_a_resident_of_the_northfieldmacedonia_area_why/,"As a resident of the Northfield/Macedonia area, why would I be paying into the Boston Township/Peninsula and Norton-Barberton JEDD/JEDZ funds from each check?",/r/akron/comments/t08cce/as_a_resident_of_the_northfieldmacedonia_area_why/hynwduf/,2,r/akron,0,2
