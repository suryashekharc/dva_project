"Op wants to forge a class schedule for GF's work so she can back up her work availability. It has nothing to do with an actual class schedule.

First, I frequent /r/antiwork so my post is gonna reak of *that*.

Anyway, document forgery can be a crime in certain circumstances. She should tell work that she has a second job. Then she'll provide your phone number as that work's HR department or ""My boss at [other company]"". When her boss calls (probably with an unknown or blocked number), you answer it like ""Thank you for calling Dunder Mifflin Human Resources department. How can I help you.""

They'll ask about her work schedule and after you confirm the last four of her social security number or date of birth or something like that (make them jump through a couple of hoops), you reply ""Per company policy and per state law, I can only confirm that she started working with Dunder Mifflin on April 15th, 2019 as Executive Assistant to the Accounting Department and is a current employee. Is there anything else I can help you with?""

If they press for a schedule, ""First, I can't give that out. It's a privacy thing and state law says I can't. But, what does a prospective employer need with a current employee's schedule?"" (Note the intentional misunderstanding of why this call is happening to highlight to the person calling how unusual of a request this is.) At this point, they'll concede that they don't *really* need it and you're done, or they'll double down. ""Listen, availability is not a 'request'. Whatever an employee tells you is their availability is their availability, take it or leave it. Which company did you say you're calling with again? [wait for answer] Okay, so listen, I'm not here to tell you how to run your business, but, well there's a reason we don't do stuff and it's spelled the same was as 'wrongful termination lawsuit'. Anyway, sorry I couldn't help you. Have a wonderful day and thanks for calling Dunder Mifflin.""

(You'll want to replace Dunder Mifflin with a better company name and probably the name of the position and the start date can be anything so long as it was a Monday. Stick to the script. Sound like you've taken calls like this hundreds of times. If you give them anything about how good of a worker she is or anything about the schedule, they can figure out it's not a real HR person. Use a real company name and provide nothing in writing. You don't know who the GF is, only that you had to look her up in the system to do an employment verification.)

"I've been here for the time and era that you're thinking of, but as far as I know that building has always been a Stater Brother's on Ave L and 30thW. At 20thW there used to be a Vons. So was it the strip mall with what housed the Taco Bell, Subway, and that old movie theater (which is now some kind of a church, and was also a beauty school at one point), and Schooners. Or was it the smaller lot at 20thW? At 20th there was a Pizza Hut, a small greek or Mediterranean restaurant  called Fresco. But I do not recall an independent burger joint at that time in either location, but if it was there - it may have only been but for a brief period in time that I also missed out on. 

Try maybe using google maps street view, and changing the date in the upper left corner to as far back as it goes. Around that area it can poke back to 2007 or 2006 at points.

I don't think I've ever heard anybody admit that before haha. You usually only ever hear people complaining about it. 

Can you find a job in your profession here in the AV? Commuting is life draining. If this is something you really want, then there are a lot of options for carpooling or even the metrolink. So at least you can nap or read or whatever. Driving yourself is hell though, especially if you work the standard M-F 8-5 deal, because of rush hour.

"I'm pretty sure Windrose apartments allows dogs. It's definitely not the most desirable area but not the worst either. I would drive through during the day and night to see what you think. There's lots of families with kids and lots of people walking their dogs. I don't live there but have friends and family who do.

When I was looking for an apartment several years ago that was one place I looked. They are among the more affordable places to live in the AV, they don't accept section 8, and the residents are very diverse (by that I mean there's a pretty even mixture of black/white/Hispanic). To me everybody seems normal and friendly. Just families trying to make a living like everybody else. Whenever there are issues with troublemakers and gang members or whatever they get kicked out quickly. 

Other than the occasional fireworks being set off or people playing music too loud sometimes it seems pretty quiet. I spend quite a bit of time there visiting and staying over night. When I'm there it's usually pretty quiet at night.

"If the speed limit is 40, wouldn't that mean that going 40 because it's the limit is fundamentally flawed thinking? Going the speed limit doesn't inherently make you safer, but paying attention and obeying traffic laws and patterns makes you a safe drivet, and being overly cautious and travelling at a reduced speed because of perceived danger is also dangerous. It does make sense to go the limit, but i think we should just agree to disagree :) no harm no foul

Not so sure about the attack here... I've never been in an accident, and you have a pretty incorrect version of what my vehicles is. It's not a van, and I deliver autoparts, and the truck is very well taken care of. I'm a very safe driver and i drive very defensively, often letting people cut in front of me, because we all need to get where we're going safely. Now you say I sound like the reason, but you have never seen me drive, so the comment seems pretty unwarranted, anon. Not cool. Every area is dangerous to drive in, and insurance rates are proportionally tied to population if you look at some quick statistics, obviously because of accident rates, but almost every other place in california has much higher rates so I'm not quite sure where you're coming from.

"I'm a delivery driver here in the AV, and I can tell you that there are more people who drive with extreme personalities here, meaning that people who have errands like to zip all around town and rush everywhere, and people who don't gove a toss about how far back they're holding up traffic, because tjey feel that they need to go 40 in a 55 (really bad on M past Sierra Hwy going West) so to answer your question, I think there are too many people here and not enough common sense to go around. I think maybe because this is a town that has both impoverished areas and rich areas alike, coupled with the fact that it's an industrial area as well, meams that we have to share the road with a lot of big rigs and fleet vehicles, and it can be challenging to not lose your cool and speed around someone when you just wanna get to where you're going while at least going the speed limit. But there are also people here who just don't actually know propper driving etiquette, like people who stop when turning right onto M from sierra highway. There is no signal to stop, it's a yield turn, but people stop there all the time. Or people who stop on L and challenger at the roundabout when no one is coming. People literally are too ignorant in this area, and it's rural enough for no one to actually have an incentive to care because the police and the city do almost nothing to enforce the rules for the new roads they force on us, like new traffic patterns and the like.

"I'm a transplant to the AV, I've concluded California just straight up doesn't know how to build roads. In Rosamond they tore up part of 30th West about 2 and a half months ago. After a month of letting it sit there and doing nothing at all, they went and re-paved the shoulder they had just torn up. Another month or so passed with nothing, but the cones were still there making the new shoulder unusable. Today they just painted the white lines on the shoulder they just paved over a month ago, and moved the cones slightly further so they are still on the pavement but just outside the new paint.

So in summary in nearly a quarter of a year they have managed to essentially repaint the white line and leave cones all over the shoulder so it can't be driven on.

Here's the text of the story, I think you would have to be insane to think this is a ""political ad for Joe Biden disguised as a news story""

**LANCASTER (CBSLA)** – An 82-year-old grandfather [who was brutally beaten and robbed](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/07/09/police-search-for-suspects-in-beating-of-elderly-man-at-lancaster-grocery-store/) in a Lancaster grocery store last month has died of his injuries.

Roberto Flores Lopez passed away Wednesday, his family disclosed.

On July 8, Lopez was using the bathroom at Superior Grocers on East Avenue J when he was violently attacked, suffering a broken jaw, a broken nose, and several fractures.

On July 12, Damaris Wade, 22, and his girlfriend, 33-year-old Tamika White, [surrendered to authorities after being identified](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/07/12/2-arrested-in-connection-with-brutal-beating-robbery-of-82-year-old-grandfather-in-lancaster/) as suspects in the attack.

Surveillance video [appeared to indicate that Wade attacked Lopez](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/07/10/authorities-identify-2-suspects-in-beating-of-elderly-man-at-lancaster-grocery-store/) after White had accompanied him into the store, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department reports.

Wade was charged with attempted murder, elder abuse with infliction of injury and second-degree robbery.

While White was initially charged with being an accessory to the crime, the charges against her were later dropped.

Lopez’s family was scheduled to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon.

"‼️‼️‼️Update for anyone who may see this looking for a vet: I tried Palmdale Veterinary Hospital after a series of bad experiences at North Valley and it was THE WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD. The vet was absolutely straight up rude to me from the first time I met him and acted this way each time I had to come in afterwards (my dog had a chronic condition). The first time I met him he didn’t introduce himself or say hello or even LOOK AT ME. There was ZERO attempt to make me feel welcome or even acknowledged. It was actually uncomfortable how little common courtesy he showed me. 

The last visit I had with him he told me to put my dog down and acted like I was being selfish when he wouldn’t even listen to my feedback about her quality of life. I am a responsible and dedicated pet owner and I knew she was still showing zest for life despite her progressing illness. He didn’t even give me a chance to say that. And on top of completely ignoring my feedback and comments during the visit, he actually made me feel like I was the one being a rude jerk. I left the office crying, he made me feel that bad. No one should EVER have to experience so much disrespect when already dealing with the pain of losing their dog slowly to a terminal illness. It was the worst vet experience I’ve ever had. 

DO NOT GO HERE PLEASE!!!!! unprofessional, uncompassionate, insincere, uncaring, and absolutely rude. I cannot even come up with enough words for how bafflingly poor he treated me as a paying customer/patient. I truly felt traumatized after the last visit. And he is the owner himself so no one to complain to!!! Please for the love of god do not take your animals to this freak. Do not settle for this treatment.

Also, the lanes don't go where I need them to go, generally speaking, and the roads I need them on the most also tend to be more dangerous because of it (no shoulder, no place for a bike to go, etc).
