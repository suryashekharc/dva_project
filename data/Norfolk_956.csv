Norfolk settles 'Hula Hoop Lady' lawsuit for $65,000 

Attorneys for Pamela Brown filed the suit, seeking $5 million, against a police officer who used a Taser on her during an October arrest. The suit claimed Brown's civil rights were violated and that the officer used excessive force.  
  
Under the terms of the agreement, there is no finding or admission of liability on the part of the officer, Nicholas G. Parks, or the city.  
  
Federal Magistrate Judge James E. Bradberry accepted the agreement Friday and indicated he would sign an order once it has been drawn up.  
  
Brown sustained a brain injury when she was hit by a truck on the day of her high school prom. Now 50, she livesindependently and is a fixture on Granby Street, where she likes to hula-hoop in the median as motorists pass by. Even the judge told Brown on Friday that he often passed her on his way to work.  
But not everyone is a fan of the radio Brown likes to play at the median. The Taser incident grew out of Parks' response to a complaint from a resident about the radio volume on the morning of Oct. 11.  
In a deposition, the police officer said Brown would not comply with his requests that she turn down the radio. He said she pushed him and hit him repeatedly in the arm with her fist when he took the radio and tried to turn it down himself.  
During the confrontation, he drew his Taser, which had a camera that captured two minutes of the incident. Brown is seen shouting, one hand cuffed. She does not put her other hand behind her back as the officer repeatedly demands.  
Her words are difficult to understand; she referred to prior injuries and her ""medic alert."" Parks said that only by later viewing the video did he understand what Brown was saying.  
She was charged with making excessive noise and with assault, but prosecutors dropped the charges the next month.  
On Friday, C. Stewart Gill Jr., her attorney, told the judge that about $17,000 of the settlement would go toward costs incurred in the suit and $26,000 toward the lawyer's fees.",t2_tw4jd,stacey1771,0,1648088420.0,0,t1_i1vqhaw,i1vqhaw,True,fuzijo,t3_tkur2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/norfolk/comments/tkur2z/be_careful_when_calling_911_for_mental_health/,Be careful when calling 911 for mental health episodes,/r/norfolk/comments/tkur2z/be_careful_when_calling_911_for_mental_health/i1vqhaw/,2,r/norfolk,0,2

"I will say this, Norfolk Police were better equipped to help my sister eventually get the help she needed over 10 years ago.  I'm saying this after my family called Chesapeake PD numerous times, only for CPD to tell my parents to pursue civil action.  A Norfolk PD officer,  recognized signs that my sister was in distress when she had an episode at my aunts home, and she was treated at a hospital and given a proper diagnosis.  The journey since has been a roller coaster, but we may have finally hit something that will work after she spent time in jail..

They instituted the shot spotter program and purchased ballistic evidence equipment unlike any found in any other local department.  They go after people who aren’t supposed to have guns or who do stupid stuff with guns with a vengeance. And they post their mug shots on Twitter and Facebook.

"Yo I'm 24 and just moved here last month over in Ocean View/East Beach area.

There's hella breweries. I saw somebody already mentioned The Bold Mariner, but I'll +1 for that. The game night is tonight at 6:00 P.M. There's also COVA, which is a cool spot that does other events (and has beer that you pour yourself, which is a fun novelty), but it's a little smaller venue. Great spot to sit outside and talk.

Follow @nfk.va on Instagram, they do a daily rundown of literally any and every event in Norfolk on their story.

"I'm a little older but I felt the same struggle when I first moved here.

 It seems like fitness-oriented groups are one of the big ways people make new friends around here. There's lots of clubs for running (North End and Norfolk Run Club being the biggest), biking (Local Bike Shop and East Coast Bicycles both do group rides), and general fitness (November Project) in the area, as well as the adult softball/kickball/volleyball leagues. I've also met a few people through climbing if you're into that. 

There's also a chess club that meets most weekends at local coffee shops (no idea how many young people are into chess, but maybe?)

"Carvana is nice, but you’ll definitely overpay. The payments will be OK but the purchase price will be rather high. Got a 2013 Fiat 500C Abarth with 30k miles. For being that old it’s like new. There are some gems on there. Unfortunately, that brought the price to nearly double, because of the chip shortage, great condition and them being discontinued in 2019. 

I wouldn’t recommend it though, for just buying a grocery getter. There are better deals out there. It just depends on what you want—whether you’re going for your dreams or just a simple vehicle.

Going for a “unicorn” means taking it to the dealer, specialty shops, or working on it yourself—and having your own parts on-hand. I do this as my daily driver, but I’d highly recommend something more practical unless you already have a car.

The advantages with CarMax and Carvana, are being able to choose from cars on a national level, not just regional or in-stock. You can plausibly find anything you want, for a price. I’m not the type to settle on a car over 50k or 100k miles. Less useful life IMO.

Avoid anything with a turbo unless you’re comfortable adding oil and coolant every two weeks. I replace about a quart of oil and pint of coolant each month. I keep extra fluids in the trunk. There is an advantage in that though. Insurance charges you by engine displacement in liters. I can beat a Mustang, but my insurance is $54/mo. It’s fast, but they charge for the small engine (1.4L), not the turbocharger. The Mustang owner would pay more to insure, having the larger engine displacement. You also see better fuel economy running a smaller engine with a turbo, vice a larger engine without. Just not in my case because I get 20MPG due to driving habits. Cheaper insurance can offset a higher payment—though its more likely to require premium fuel. 

GDI engines without turbochargers, also snack on oil. It’s not unthinkable to be down 1-2 quarts before a scheduled change. Hyundai/KIA are notorious. The front end suspension also goes if you hit a single pothole. You’ll destroy a strut and sway bar pretty easily.

You can also buy a used Prius with a dead pack. If you can safely work with high voltage, the cells can be replaced individually. It’s something you can YouTube and DIY at your own risk. People frequently sell them cheap not wanting to go through the hassle or expense of replacing or rebuilding the battery bank.",t2_iotnjhrw,bradleynanthony,0,1647808968.0,0,t1_i1g4xui,i1g4xui,True,Theoriginalkylee,t3_tipxg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/norfolk/comments/tipxg7/looking_for_a_car/,Looking for a car,/r/norfolk/comments/tipxg7/looking_for_a_car/i1g4xui/,1,r/norfolk,0,1

"The science doesn't really back this up. Foot patrols may provide a modest effect on some crime types in certain areas but they are far from a silver bullet.

"The real issue are plea deals and bargains made with DAs/police. Mandatory minimum sentencing needs to be stricter with increased penalties. Committing crime is all about the risk/reward factor for criminals. To say criminals are irrational isn't really the truth. Criminals rationalize acts/behaviors based on the likely hood of consequences for their actions. If you make it a mandatory. The mandatory minimum for using a gun in the commission of a crime is 3 years. In hindsight, 3 years is absolute nothing; we've spent almost 3 years in lockdowns as it is. That should be increased to at least 10 years

"So here an interesting aside. I used to hang out with a guy who taught at the bad kids school, forgive me I can’t remember the name of it, but it’s where kids went when they had been expelled from any other viable school. He has been teaching there for probably 20 or more years at this point. 

He said “it’s really interesting teaching those kids because they don’t process future consequences.” A direct quote. He said if a kid was acting up, you can’t threaten like with “normal”kids “if you do that again you’re going to get x,y,x” because it literally has no impact. Only after the incident, when they are facing immediate punishment do they register the ramifications of their actions. 

It was really neat hearing some of his experiences there and a lot can, I think, be linked to society.

So yeah, that combined with the hype made me expect a lot more. Murphy's in VB isn't exactly prime time either, but at least I've thoroughly enjoyed everything I've eaten there over the years. 

Also, how does a place that preaches so much about authentic Irish cuisine not even have colcannon on the menu? 

For this type of cuisine, the best I've tasted in the area by light years (flavor and portion size) is Park Lane Tavern in Kempsville.

"Ah, nice, thanks for the info!

To get you on the water, I'd suggest taking the [Elizabeth River Ferry](https://gohrt.com/routes/ferry/) ($2 single trip, $4.50 1-day GoPass) from Norfolk's [Waterside District](https://watersidedistrict.com/) to Portsmouth's [Olde Towne](https://oldetowneportsmouth.com/) to visit [Fish N Slips](https://fishnslips.com/) if you like seafood, or [Legend Brewing Depot](https://www.legendbrewing.com/portsmouth.asp) if you don't for views of Norfolk, food+drink and a walk along the River Front Park. [Lightship Portsmouth Museum](https://portsmouthnavalshipyardmuseum.com/lightship/) is closed but you can still view the exterior while you're there.

Not sure when they're starting back up for 2022, but [Norfolk Kayak Rentals](https://www.norfolkkayaks.fun/) could be another option for you if the timing of your trip works.

Chrysler Museum is great as well, and depending on when you're in town they might even have a glass blowing demonstration going on. That's near downtown as well, and you could walk down Mowbray Arch which is on The Hague (a waterway) and that area of Ghent has some beautiful houses.

"Fear of missing out and remote working. The issue isn't so much as lack of inventory, its really a lack of move-in ready homes in super nice areas. If you look online then locally there's plenty of homes in south norfolk and portsmouth that are sitting around. People are extremely.picky however and unwilling to make sacrifices 

Work from home has been a huge culprit though. People with white collar jobs that used to live in cities would have easily been able to afford a $2k a month rent or $700k house. This meant People earning less could fill the lower cost housing or those that lived in suburbs or country could afford homes at their income lowers

The shift to digital working has meant these people with large salaries move to areas with lower housing costs, outbid each other, and increase the listing proces. This has destroyed the ability for middle class workers to buy a house that was once economically viable for them. They of course can't move to big cities and if did, wouldn't be able to afford housing there

"Interest rates going up will put a clamp on upward price climbs, however, Chesapeake didn’t see near the spike observed in NoVa for example. 

If prices do dip as interest rates peak, the dip won’t be as sharp here as markets that are seriously overpriced. 

If you captured from gains where you are now, I think you will be fine. Give it three years and mortgage rates will dip and you can refinance…

Summer buying season does get stupid with bidding wars and then trying to use a VA loan might get you stuck on the sidelines unless you’re able to buy at appraisal plus $30K (cash) for example. That was the scenario last summer. 

Also, that’s close to a realtor’s take…so if you skip the realtors and buy from a private seller, your appraisal can put the same cash in a seller’s pocket. Just gotta get smart if you go this route.

"The issue for sports is not the size of the area.  Plenty of smaller metropolitan areas do just fine.   Pittsburgh and Cleveland have large combined statistical areas, not large metropolitan statistical areas.  So Cleveland benefits from being in close proximity to Akron and Canton, with each having their own MSA.  Pittsburgh is the only city until you get to Youngstown to the west and maybe Scranton to the east, depending on who you ask.  Neither of which have teams.  Bottom line is that, for example,  with Cleveland,  there are no other teams in Northern or Central Ohio.   You have to go all the way down to Cincinnati to find another team.   Unless you count Columbus' collegiate scene. It would be same around here.   No other teams in Virgina.  

So the argument then becomes that combining Hampton Roads with Richmond creates a CSA large enough to get this done.   It can be sustainable.  The real issue here is disposable income, and discretionary income.  People around can barely afford gas and groceries.  Personally I would shoot for something like indoor soccer before going all in on the NFL.  I don't know about the NBA.  Are there enough fans in Virginia?

"That’s not how it works.  Like I’ve mentioned before, you really need to educate yourself on how these projects are funded and the process.

There is an extensive study period, then design period.  There are multiple submissions to the Federal Transit Administration.  The state Department of Rail and Public Transit is involved.  HRT has to approve the city’s plans, there is a requirement for expanded bus service as part of the expansion.  Expanded bus service leads to more para-transit costs.  

Bottom line is that it is neither easy nor quick.  It’s not cheap.  And there are multiple off ramps along the way.

"Oh boy, time for a recent history lesson! The tide was originally intended to extend from the current Newtown Road station down the abandoned Virginia Beach branch line. The state had already allocated the funds for such an extension and the City of Virginia Beach bought the right-of-way explicitly for this use. 


The city then proceeded to do fuck-all for several years, before finally throwing the political football to a referendum in 2016. The measure was voted down 57-43, with the most prominent argument of the detractors being that light rail would bring ""crime"" from Norfolk. Make of that what you will.


At any rate, with the plan for light rail officially dead, the city returned the funds to the state and new plans are underway to possibly make the corridor a rail trail.

"I think Norfolk is pretty safe, even in the bad areas. Most of the crime is the type that only comes if you're involved with it (drugs). Car break ins can happen if you're somewhere sketchy, drive a nice car, and have stealable things. I've never had an issue. The map will show some robberies/mugging - but again that's if you're already involved or are flashing wealth.

Norfolk has a strong sense of community - you're way more likely to have a dozen strangers ask if you need any help than have be robbed.
