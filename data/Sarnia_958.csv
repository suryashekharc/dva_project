"That is exactly how you join a union, where do you think our thousands of apprentices come from?

Like I mentioned in my post if you know someone it can make it easier to get in
Lots of our apprentices are cold calls amd just show up at the hall
If the halls are busy they will be taking apprentices, if not you may have to gp back a few times, it is all about timing.

Recently 2 of my Nieces just got apprenticeships, and this is exactly how they got in by going to the hall.. Right now is a good time to get in with all of the shutdown work here at home and the refurbishment of the reactors up at the Bruce the halls are pretty much empty.

Granted some Unions arw tougher to get into than others like UA 663 can be though to get into if you do not know someone in or have family in the local.

Every hall's process for intake of apprentices is a little different, if you know somone who  can explain the process to you it will defintley help.

Where I am at our first year apprentices with LOA are making roughly just under 90k with no overtime, 
Overtime paid at double is available every week, and the job is scheduled to finish in 2033.

"I am in renovations and construction so I can‚Äôt speak to your trade, but I‚Äôve found that for the most part you will be fine. I have dealt with some sexism and sexual harassment and usually it‚Äôs been from customers and not my co-workers. This happens more so on projects that are in public spaces like downtown/high traffic areas. I have been fortunate that my co-workers and majority of my projects and customers have been nothing but respectful and value my opinion. I have seen more and more women on job sites (painters, electricians, plumbers) which always makes me happy. It‚Äôs nice to see other women in the trades for sure and I find that I am definitely seeing more in Sarnia on jobs. A friend of mine who is a woman and an electrician does pretty well for herself. She is in the union and had a great female mentor. I am not sure which outlet you will navigate to become an electrician, but definitely look into talking to your local union over at IBEW for sure. They can be very helpful and will often connect you with a mentor similar to you. I was previously in the painter‚Äôs union but working for another company now but if you ever need any advice please feel free to reach out.",t2_1msahzed,TrickTry,0,1647451970.0,0,t1_i0wqxn3,i0wqxn3,True,Dogs-are-life-99,t3_tflzjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sarnia/comments/tflzjt/28f_any_women_in_trades_im_looking_at_becoming_an/,"28F: Any women in trades?

"I see only one (of 18) response that seems to indicate that they feel the city should be responsible for the costs associated with maintenance while also keeping the current ""access"" situation.  The rest seem to fall into 2 categories, either the city takes over maintenance and does what they want, or the city transfers ownership and all maintenance costs to the adjacent properties.

I'll admit that I've never seen the shoreline there, so you certainly have a better idea of what has or hasn't been done over the years.  It's quite possible that the land owners were lying when they say that they have spent money to control erosion.

I agree with you that security concerns are being overblown, but at the same time, I think that it's disingenuous to equate a pathway in that location  to a sidewalk.  A sidewalk has the advantage of road traffic and is much more visible than a pathway behind houses.  I'm sure that the majority of people would say that they would feel more comfortable walking on a sidewalk than the HWT trail at night. 

All of that aside, my biggest issue with this is the associated cost.  The city estimates a cost of $7-$10 million to gain 750m of pathway.  I understand that this city doesn't have a lot of lakefront trail (it was honestly one of the biggest surprises when we moved here), but that seems like an exorbitant amount of money for very little actual gain.",t2_6knya,Mike1767,0,1647017363.0,0,t1_i09cmtw,i09cmtw,False,joelvdvies,t3_tb6qg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sarnia/comments/tb6qg6/old_lakeshore_road_rightofway/,Old Lakeshore Road right-of-way,/r/Sarnia/comments/tb6qg6/old_lakeshore_road_rightofway/i09cmtw/,1,r/Sarnia,0,1

"You‚Äôre correct when you say that no one is asking the city to pay to upkeep their property, because over half of the replies acknowledge that the city owns right of way. They do seem to imply that the city should pay for upkeep, but for reasons like ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù and ‚Äútrespassing‚Äù a path shouldn‚Äôt be installed. That sounds like upkeep on what is private property in all but name to me. 

They go on to say that they feel the city should either transfer ownership (would be interested to see how that answer would change when cost comes up) or that they‚Äôve already forfeit ownership due to the residents having to pay for erosion control, but as someone who has walked that way many times I‚Äôve yet to see any indication of a barrier or infill work done by any private property owner. I am sure they just misplaced the receipt. 

Further - there are several comments about how installing a path would be some sort of security concern, as if most homeowners don‚Äôt have sidewalks that run right in front of their homes. 

I don‚Äôt feel that all of those residents are in the wrong by any means. Many of the older residents have lived there for many years and seem to have a good understanding of the situation, but it also seems like a few people liked the informal arrangement of low ‚Äúwater view‚Äù taxes (vs water front) and de facto private beach access due to the lack of path.",t2_9y31m,OnceEmulated,0,1646981779.0,0,t1_i07ocfa,i07ocfa,False,joelvdvies,t3_tb6qg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sarnia/comments/tb6qg6/old_lakeshore_road_rightofway/,Old Lakeshore Road right-of-way,/r/Sarnia/comments/tb6qg6/old_lakeshore_road_rightofway/i07ocfa/,10,r/Sarnia,0,10

"That's not what's happening here at all. You can read the land owners responses on the city website. Not a single one is asking for the city to pay to upkeep their property. They are upset for a number of reasons, the biggest being that the city has repeatedly denied requests to maintain the city owned land, so many of the owners have spent a great deal of money trying to protect their land from further erosion. Now, after 50 years of neglect, the city has decided that they would like to start to enforce the right of way.  From what I read in the responses, it appears that the majority of owners would prefer to buy the land from the city and continue to maintain it on their own.

I don't understand why the mayor and multiple councilors mention that the city won't spend public money on private property. That's not what anyone is asking for.

"So let me get this straight. Some of the already multi millionaire landowners along the lake want the city to foot the bill for shoreline repair and maintenance, but want to keep their illegal encroachment so they may continue to deprive tax paying citizens access to the lakefront. 

We have the same issue over past Skeeter Barlows. The first house along the lakeside continues to claim that the beach beside her home (not between her home and the lake, but beside it and along the road) is her personal property, and will harass members of the community enjoying the beach during the summer.

‚ÄúCoun. Margaret Bird said the city has a duty to invest in the shoreline to preserve the properties there that pay high taxes.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt agree that someone should get proportionally more out of government benefits just because they pay more in tax, never mind the likely hood of this costing more than those property owners have contributed in the past 20 years.

"Shipping, storing, and distributing these items is a massive hurdle. It‚Äôs more efficient to send money. If you sell your items and gently used clothes, take that money and donate it, your dollar will go FAR further. $1 to a humanitarian aid in Ukraine will go further than the amount of money, resources, and time it will actually cost to get your gently used items/necessities to the people in need in Ukraine. Donating an item might even result in a net negative result, that is why it is not done this way. 

Donate money. That is all they want/need. Organizations can make your tiny donation to be far better used than if you were to spend the same amount here. Donating $1 is better than donating $500 worth of used clothing. 

Example: $500 worth of used clothing‚Äîshipping from Canada to Ukraine requires fuel, staffing or volunteers, hours or days of time, planes, transport, trucking, storage, distribution of items. Overall it might end up costing $700 to get the $500 worth of used clothes to the destination. 

Sell the stuff, make a couple bucks, and donate it.

"It was a common story that Sarnia was a top target when I was growing up there in the sixties. It was also a common story about each city I‚Äôve lived in since. 

A few years ago I did a Diefenbunker tour (highly recommended https://diefenbunker.ca/en/) and there were several maps from that era showing potential targets in Canada. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt find the photos I took of them. 

Anyway, Sarnia wasn‚Äôt a primary target. It didn‚Äôt need to be, since there were larger population centres that would yield more destruction while still preventing the transport and such of materials from smaller places like Sarnia. 

If one‚Äôs goal was to kill as many people as possible, then Lambton is not a target. 

If one‚Äôs goal was to win a war and invade eventually, messing with a bottleneck in the Great Lakes system is not a sensible choice. Not to mention that the preservation of what at the time was exceptionally vital industry would have been a long term benefit for invaders.

"Infrastructure targets are a big considerarion when discussing limited nuclear exchange. Sarnia is at the very edge of PADD 2 (Petroleum Administration Defense District 2), and would be considered a target over other locations due to our nation relying on oil for transport and energy (among other things).

But I wouldn't worry about nuclear war just yet. Canada hasn't even made a declaration of war, last I checked. If you're really, genuinely concerned, make yourself a ""Shit-hits-the-fan"" kit at home with 3 days worth of food and water, along with some extras like a 1st aid kit and a crank radio if you can.

"Having different OPINIONS is one thing. I can think, say McDonald‚Äôs food tastes awful, but, you may love McDonald‚Äôs food and think it tastes great. That is an OPINION (definition a view of judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on facts or knowledge).
Having your own set of facts and reality is NOT an opinion. Spewing false Russian propaganda is NOT having an opinion. It is choosing to believe and support the oppression of others. That isn‚Äôt an ‚Äòopinion‚Äô. 
Let me give you more of a specific to that very subject example of an opinion: 1- Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine is the worst thing that has ever happened in all of time. V. 2- Russia invading Ukraine is horrible, but not (yet) as horrible as other events in history. Those are opinions. The reality is that Putin is invading Ukraine, a sovereign nation, oppressing his own people, cutting his own people off from the rest of the world (trying to lockdown/isolate Russia like DRNK), lying to his own army and (the latest I have heard, take it with a grain of salt) planning to force prisoners he has detained for speaking out against him, protesting the war, saying the word war or even just wearing blue and yellow, to fight his war for him. He is not, as his propagation machine, or these useless slimeballs as the leaky tank claim, liberating people from naziism in Ukraine; who‚Äôs leader is a Jewish man, whose ancestors suffered (immensely) during WWII and the holocaust. 
Do you see the difference between opinions (which can vary) and FACTS? 
Another quick example cos you brought it up. Masks. You can protest all day long you don‚Äôt want to wear masks, because you don‚Äôt WANT to. That is an opinion. You can not protest them because there is an overwhelming amount of evidence they don‚Äôt make a difference, when the reality is there is a mound of evidence they DO help. 
One more, I can hold the opinion that the leaky tank has awful food, therefore everyone that eats there likes bad food. (Opinion)
V. 
The leaky tank, it‚Äôs owner and employees all support overthrowing democracy by participating in the ‚Äòconvoy‚Äô lead by white supremacists, who submitting a MOU stating their goal was just that, overthrowing a democratically elected government; AND further by supporting Vladimir Putin as he invades, unprovoked, a sovereign nation, thereby committing genocide. Therefore anyone who patronizes the leaky tank (eats there), also supports white supremacy, overthrowing the government and our democratic principles, and supports the very worst historical figures who are subsequently facetious dictators (and/or trying to be).",t2_wfpoztu,octaviadaenerys,0,1646578476.0,0,t1_hzkxa2f,hzkxa2f,False,Cintesis,t3_t37yf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sarnia/comments/t37yf3/the_leaky_tank_removes_their_apology_doubles_down/,"The Leaky Tank removes their ""apology,"" doubles down on initial Russia-Ukraine comments",/r/Sarnia/comments/t37yf3/the_leaky_tank_removes_their_apology_doubles_down/hzkxa2f/,2,r/Sarnia,0,2

"... oi. People are too literal and ready to argue eh?

*What if* the government decided to mandate children to get an exparemental vaccine, and a bunch die or get bad reaction on a large scale?

There are reasons. Not in this case, but that's not to say there won't be reasons... I'm not anti vaxx or anything, got my shots as soon as I could because I have enough understanding of RNA vaccines. But I think it would be fair to say many don't. FEAR is what drives humans to loose ration. And if a government wants to rush a vaccine, they should have started with education first. Experimental vaccines normally don't get pushed like they did so it's no wonder so many people are afraid of it. To me, being afraid due to lack of knowledge is a justified reason to not get it. BUT *a big but*, ignorance is bliss. And people often choose an irrational excuse rather than admit it. 

Now, I didn't come on here to readily argue my opinions because once Im done I'm not gunna care. People need to stop getting angrey at each other over a difference of opinion and instead need to use education to avoid irrational, fear-driven ignorance that leads them to come to irrational conclusion.

I locked it without it even being reported, and I thought it was important to leave it up with adding the caveat that it's fake so that the people who had previously been duped would be aware that it was fake.

"Ok so a little mixed reviews on this place make sense. 

These places recently are being flipped to get rid of the low income riff raff that are in it. Any tenant who moves out, the units are flipped, and the prices are increased. There is an incentive to attract a more professional crowd to the building and downtown core. 

The people who were previously in the building were there because it was cheap. As the new modern reno‚Äôd ones become less affordable, it is weaning all of the low income individuals out. The end goal of the Kenwick is to make it a premium place to live again. So they are accomplishing this slowly over time.

If you were to move in now, you will live with about 50/50. Young professionals, seniors with money (the target demographic) OR drug addicts, low income population, people who NEEDED housing (previous demographic). 

Depends if you are there long enough to endure the change. Downtown is becoming a desirable and expensive place to live. So if you can sign on for a cheap price now, it might be good as the price of these places is only going to go up.
