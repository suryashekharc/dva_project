"The problem is solvable, it would just take the right will to do it.

I would design a combination car and solve a few problems at once.  Put two bathrooms in it at one end.  Find a way to make bike racks down one side, a single, wide isle down the middle, and seats down the other side.  (Maybe just single seats, so you can sit with your bike.). Put in an extra wide door to speed up boarding.

Like they do now, put the bike/bathroom car behind the locomotive, so it’s easy to spot it at the high level platforms where there are any. (There are still a lot of stations that don’t have one.)

The difficult thing is that once you start offering the service, you need to keep it up.  If the program gets popular, but you don’t have enough bike cars, you could get 5 people with bikes in a crowded train and no bike car to put them in.

"The rats are just something they’re tossing in to heavy the complaint load.

I got to talking to him and followed him around for 25-30 min cause I was so in shock at what I was witnessing.

The noise, however, is absolutely a real thing, and is unquestionably a valid complaint. That volume of outdoor seating must be multiplying it by 3x at least.

"north end resident here. I think that people generally enjoy the liveliness and ambiance that outdoor dining brings to the neighborhood. most of the problems mentioned (sidewalk congestion, trash, rats) are associated with the streetscape being woefully insufficient. trash and rats always litter the streets—maybe we should be advocating for containerized trash instead of having to throw it onto the street twice a week. maybe we should be advocating for better street and sidewalk cleaning that actually makes the neighborhood feel sanitary. these problems existed before outdoor dining and they’ll exist after it until we tackle how we allocate space and resources. 

making hanover one way is great! let’s expand sidewalks, lower curbs, make patios more permanent. let’s put our trash into actual bins. those things would go way further to address these issues rather than just banning outdoor dining altogether.",t2_a4kxk,joshsvo,0,1648264696.0,0,t1_i25gx1c,i25gx1c,True,lifeisakoan,t3_to9t6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/to9t6t/wus_letter_to_north_end_restaurant_owners/,Wu's letter to North End restaurant owners.,/r/boston/comments/to9t6t/wus_letter_to_north_end_restaurant_owners/i25gx1c/,39,r/boston,1,39

"I'd say that Massachusetts is one of the best places to be trans.

Massachusetts had a vote on trans rights back in 2018 and out of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, only 5 were against it. Lots of rural towns saw strong support for trans rights and the overall result was a 2:1 victory (https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/11/06/question-3-transgender-ballot-yes-wins). One of the great things about Mass is that you can go for a gaycation in Provincetown or head out west near Amherst and explore rural Massachusetts with a really big LGBT population. You aren't confined to the city.

I don't know where you're coming from, but Boston is probably one of the best places in the world to be trans. While other states are doing their crap, the Mass Attorney General was reminding healthcare providers that Medicaid in Mass (MassHealth) covers gender affirming surgeries with no out-of-pocket expense. Mass has really strong civil rights protections.

If I were thinking of neighborhoods, I think Cambridge/Somerville (distinct cities from Boston, but they're accessible by public transit, walking, and biking and full of stuff to do) and Jamaica Plain (on the Orange Line and I know lots of lesbians and trans people there and Queeraoke at the Midway is a great time on Thursdays) would be my tops.

"What a fun time! For several hours today I lived with the news that Biden said he would send the 82nd Airborne to Ukraine!


Meaning the US would try to enforce a no fly zone! Meaning an air war, one most likely the US would win. Which then means the Russian tanks on the ground are done, with the US controlling the air, the Russian ground army stands to no chance.

Which means the US is at war with Russia, and Russia, a nuclear power, is losing the traditional war. And Putin is old, close to death. 

I wonder if he might use nukes....

"Can't believe I'm going to say this, but I agree with her plan, especially after reading this letter.

The issue isn't only about parking. Outdoor dining has put an undue burden on city resources, and the only ones benefitting from the strain are restaurant owners who, up until now, have never even had the option of outdoor dining. Covid seems to be getting more and more manageable, restaurants should see as many customers as pre-covid. Outdoor dining was only meant to be a temporary way to support restaurants. 

The neighborhood is dense. Residents have the right to live in peace. When there are rowdy tourists until midnight, trash and rats everywhere, and nowhere to park their car that they are allowed to own, they're going to be pissed.

If the city and residents are burdened by what was supposed to be temporary, it only stands that those who want the *privilege* to operate outdoor dining should pay for the cost of doing business.

"Here's my take. We all (mostly) agree that $7500 isn't a big impact on a restaurants business. But - a restaurant will only apply if they actually need the space. A lot of the issues and problems are about the space and safety, not just noise. Now, restaurants will be more likely to choose to apply and pay $7500 if they have a genuine need, not just because it's free.

A lot of things in life have nominal fees to help reduce people/businesses using resources they wouldn't otherwise need. It's kind of like the quarter for an Aldi cart. Nobody cares about the quarter but it's enough to keep things organized and returned. 

So, I think trying to reduce the amount of space going to restaurants that really want it / are willing to jump through a few hoops is a good middle ground vs letting any restaurant that wants it to have one.",t2_651me,bbqturtle,0,1648260503.0,0,t1_i258xq8,i258xq8,True,lifeisakoan,t3_to9t6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/to9t6t/wus_letter_to_north_end_restaurant_owners/,Wu's letter to North End restaurant owners.,/r/boston/comments/to9t6t/wus_letter_to_north_end_restaurant_owners/i258xq8/,72,r/boston,0,72

"The owner of RSM posted a response/some context on the Brookline facebook page. You should definitely read before being outraged:

&#x200B;

*Two days ago, I posted a series of provocative questions in our Camp RSM group, a private facebook group for families that attend my long-running overnight summer camp of 25 years. Unlike our school (in which politics is never discussed in our classrooms), my camp hosts “serious nights” to allow campers to openly discuss current events.*

*The questions I proposed in the Camp RSM group were the starting points for discussion for one of these “serious nights,” and were purposefully controversial in nature, as all of the questions I pose to my older campers are. Over the years, I have posed similar questions about the Holocaust, Israel, and many other topics. I am a teacher, and the purpose of these questions is always the same - to challenge my campers to think, to develop clear and logical arguments for not only their viewpoints but to also understand opposing viewpoints and how to argue against them.*

*I understand the questions alone can be shocking to some, particularly to those unfamiliar with camp, and so I posted them in advance specifically so that camp parents could see them and decide for themselves whether they want their children involved in such a discussion.*

*Those questions were then screenshotted and shared broadly, out of context, as a representation of my personal views. I am deeply saddened to see that my misrepresented  post has hurt people in my community. I have been very open about my personal views on Putin and his criminal war on Ukraine, and those views have not changed. I continue to stand unequivocally with the Ukrainian people against the Russian military invasion of Ukraine. My personal actions and those RSM has taken over the last few weeks in support of Ukraine and its people speak louder than any words I could write.*

*I fled the Soviet Union from Minsk, as a Jewish refugee, over thirty years ago not only so my children could live in the comforts of a western society, but so that they could live in a free one. That freedom comes with the responsibility of thinking critically, and of speaking loudly and intelligently about the principles we hold dear.*

*Most importantly, this responsibility starts with a deep understanding of what a free and democratic society means: a right to sovereignty, freedom to think and speak without fear of imprisonment, and respect for the rule of law. This is what I believe the parents of my campers’ Ukrainian peers are fighting for.*

*In order for my campers to truly understand this, and to be able to loudly and intelligently advocate for it, they must first debate it, discuss it, and ask themselves difficult questions. This is what I have always done at Camp RSM, and I am proud of the community of young people that continue to grow out of this environment.*",t2_d2qfm,kpe12,0,1648260137.0,0,t1_i2587um,i2587um,True,bostonstrong781,t3_tnmecj,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/tnmecj/russian_school_of_math_cofounder_blasted_for/,Russian School of Math co-founder blasted for saying Ukraine shares blame in death toll,/r/boston/comments/tnmecj/russian_school_of_math_cofounder_blasted_for/i2587um/,2,r/boston,0,2

"If possible I would also highly advise you to post this in subs, on Facebook, anywhere where the community is trans people. I explained more in another comment, but in terms of being socially progressive, Boston is very paradoxical. In some ways we're the most progressive in the country, in other ways we still have loads of problems with -isms and the like. I would say that in my experience Boston is very progressive relative to the rest of the country in regards to LGBT people in general, but I'm not a part of the T so I really don't have personal experience with that. I'm worried you're going to get a lot of comments here from cisgendered people talking about what they assume to be the average experience of the average trans person in Boston, but that may not be reality.

"You mean the good peppers. Yes tread lightly, wear gloves while handling, prepare your sphincter with some soothing balm, and then enjoy the ride.

But more seriously... The thing is different peppers hit differently. I've had pickled jalepenos that left me hurting a bit (the pickling doesn't help). I've also had plenty of scotch bonnets and habaeros and the heat is hotter but is more approachable. I added a scotch bonnet to a plate I served to friends who are largely adverse to heat and they thought it was perfect. There's a lot of nuance to how a pepper heats the dish vs total heat level. 

peppers vary from one grow to another. You always have to try a small bit of the pepper raw while prepping to know what you're dealing with. I've had habanero peppers that were little more than a spicy bell pepper (OK not that mild, but you get the point) and I've had some that would melt most people's face off.

All comes down to knowing you ingredients.

"One of the big reasons so much of Harvard Sq sold all at once and displaced so many businesses with rental hikes is because a huge percentage of those buildings were all owned by the same trust for a century- I believe it was the Dow and Stearns trust or something like that - and then the trustees new generation decided they wanted to cash out.  This means that buildings that probably hadn’t had a mortgage on them for 50 or 75 years, buildings that could foster long time small businesses at fairly normal rent because they had no huge note to pay, suddenly went on the market at astronomical prices.  So no matter what entity bought them, all of a sudden these properties that used to generate a profit with regular rents now have to generate a profit to cover a $90m mortgage.

"It’s hard to pick one area. The North End is great. It’s Italian food. There’s some gems and some misses. I always recommend the Boston Public Market to folks visiting because it’s a neat indoor farmers market and food stall place. You can get little bites/orders of a bunch of different foods. They focus on local made items, local companies. Not chains. The Ice cream is a must. 

The North End has cannolis and big pasta dinners and Italian sandwiches and great pizza and amazing seafood. 

I just had a friend in town and I took her to Neptune Oyster and then we walked to Bova and got cannolis. And we got seafood from the Boston Public Market to cook at home together.

"People should get what they can negotiate. There's no sense in trying to insert some form of morality into a negotiation between two parties. The issue is that negotiations, for basically all of human existence, have favored the owner and not the worker.

You lose an employee and you're down 1/100th of your company workforce, or probably even less than that. The biggest headache is tasking HR with hiring someone new and then training them. You lose your job or look for a new one and you're looking at potentially moving, losing your local support network, disrupting your kids' childhood/development, etc...

That's why unions were so necessary. When employees are on their own, their only leverage was, ""yeah, well maybe I'll uproot my life and mildly inconvenience you."" Unions give workers a big fulcrum and a means to negotiate. Basically, crying about what's ""fair"" is not getting anyone anywhere. Companies are going to tell you to fuck off and take a 20% pay cut if you go remote. Better to say, ""workers need better negotiation tools,"" than, ""workers deserve this because it's fair.""",t2_ize7bfha,ByeByeACL,0,1648252991.0,0,t1_i24tgf8,i24tgf8,False,bostondotman,t3_tnmra0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/tnmra0/thousands_of_residents_left_suffolk_county_during/,Thousands of residents left Suffolk County during the pandemic,/r/boston/comments/tnmra0/thousands_of_residents_left_suffolk_county_during/i24tgf8/,7,r/boston,0,7

What I’m saying is- With housing, you’re talking about worldwide demand- 3 billion possible buyers and limited land. Demand will always be high because you’re never going to be able to build enough to meet it. Meanwhile, workers essential to the economy can’t afford to live there anymore and it basically becomes a city of bank accounts. It’s not as simple as build more housing.

I don’t claim to be an economics professor. But the one thing about supply and demand with housing is that demand is not limited to those who live nearby and will use the item. It’s basically an investment account for people. A place to store money and then reap interest. It’s like saying keep opening more bank accounts and people will stop using them. There has to be an additional disincentive to ppl to purchase property they’re not going to live on (and thereby keeping it out of the hands of ppl who would live there and improve the local community.)

"Spectacular question fellow Redditor!

The short answer is: they can't! Specifically, I'm referring to taxing *land* or perhaps better put, *location*, not property, which is land + improvements (like buildings). This may seem like a wild claim, but let's walk through it, and feel free to raise your hand if you have any questions. 

First things first, why doesn't your landlord raise your rent *right now*? Well, because you'd go rent from somewhere else. Maybe *everyone* raises their prices, but somewhere out there is a landlord with an empty room. He'll lower his price just enough to poach a tenant. The guy he got the tenant from does the same, and so on, and look, we're back to where we started! **Landlords are already charging the maximum price they can** (what ""the market will bear"" in fancy-speak)

But all that is *without* raising taxes, just landlords deciding to hike prices. And definitely taxes *do* typically get passed to consumers, so what gives?

Well let's pivot for a moment and talk about cheeseburgers. I love cheeseburgers. You like em, but not nearly as much. Cheeseburgers cost us both $5, and you wouldn't pay a cent more, but I'd be willing to pay $10 for one because they're so tasty. The equilibrium price settles at $5 though, based on supply and demand. Maybe McDonald's tries raising their prices, but then you stop buying from McDonald's and start buying Burger King or Wendy's. Burger King can satisfy your cravings because *they can make more burgers*. This is what keeps prices in check: anyone who tries to charge more loses customers to the competition, who can increase their quantities to absorb the increased demand. 

Now let's say the government comes along and adds a $1 tax to cheeseburgers because cows smell bad. Okay, what happens now? They were already charging as much as they could, so the burger makers just have to eat the tax, right? (Pun fully intended). Nope! See, Wendy's also makes burgers, but with razor thin margins: they only make $0.20 on each burger. Wendys has to raise their prices to stay in business, and they start charging $5.80 just to break even 

Well you don't like cheeseburgers enough to pay that, so you stop buying from Wendy's and switch to Burger King or McDonald's only. One of two things will happen: maybe Wendy's  can't maintain enough customers to pay their fixed overhead (rent, utilities, etc), so they close. Alternatively, Wendy's stays open, but loses the ability to absorb any customers who are willing to pay between $5.00 and $5.80 for a burger. Knowing this, McDonald's and Burger King both creep their prices up too. Everyone's passing along the cost of the tax. Each can do this because McDonald's knows BK can't absorb all the customers alone and vice versa. It doesn't matter if you lose potential customers if you can't increase supply to serve them. Now everyone pays more for burgers, except for people like you who don't buy any at all. Demand is the same (everyone still wants burgers) but overall supply is less (because Wendy's dropped out) so price goes up. The loss of customers like that is called the ""dead weight"" loss of a tax, and it's a big deal in economics. It means things aren't working efficiently. 

""But wait!"" you cry, ""first you tell me taxes can't be passed on, then you say they can! What gives?"" I'll tell you what doesn't give: land supply. There's a certain amount of land in the world, and we can't make more. So if we tax the hell out of land, and someone can't afford to rent it out, then some landlords will turn a loss, but less of a loss then if they didn't rent it out at all. They could try raising their prices, but then they'd just lose tenants to someone with empty rooms. But there will be no reduced supply, because no one is making any land to begin with; you're just paying for access to it. 

Another reason landlords can charge the maximum price is that basically all land is monopoly, or damn close. There's exactly two plots of land immediately next to the NY stock exchange, and they are *very* valuable to stock trading firms. Nowhere else is as useful to them. In less extreme examples, being in a major area of the city is super valuable. There's very few plots of land that are within a block of Downtown Crossing, and even fewer that are ever up for sale at a time. When you have monopoly markets, there's no competition, and the seller gets to charge 100% of what something is worth to you. 

Now people do make *housing* which has to be built on land. One option for our troubled landlord is to develop their land more. More rooms means more income (and since we're just taxing the land, they don't pay more taxes to build more). Enough income offsets the land tax. Or, they could sell the land to someone who will develop it. Again, we end up with more housing/businesses/whatever is a good use of that land. This can actually drive the rent *down* by driving development. 

These kinds of taxes also punish speculation, which is where someone buys something in order to hold it and sell it for a profit later, doing nothing in between. If you see run down houses in nice neighborhoods, odds are that this is what the owner is doing. If you make undeveloped/underdeveloped land expensive enough to hold, speculators will sell to developers and the land will get used for something good.
