"""The Oval"" is the name Downtown Toledo is trying to make happen for the pedestrian island on Summit Street in front of the Promedica/YMCA building. The entire Summit Street reconstruction cost something around $11 million last I saw (that's not to say the pedestrian island itself cost millions), and raised questions and a Federal investigation into roughly $1 million the City spent to relocate Buckeye utilities (while other utility providers themselves paid for relocation of their utilities). The City has taken Block (Buckeye) to court to try to get them to pay the City back, but I haven't heard any resolution on that so as far as I am aware that litigation is still ongoing. And yes, the Summit Street project was billed as a way to impress Solheim visitors to Toledo. As I mentioned in another comment, functionally they basically just repaved Summit Street and I think they missed out on a great opportunity to really actually improve Summit Street functionally for **people** downtown.",t2_9begzp6n,tolwat,0,1648259043.0,0,t1_i2560ns,i2560ns,False,Ponch47,t3_tkicpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tkicpd/reflective_sculpture_going_up_in_downtown_toledo/,Reflective sculpture going up in downtown Toledo on Summit Street,/r/toledo/comments/tkicpd/reflective_sculpture_going_up_in_downtown_toledo/i2560ns/,1,r/toledo,0,1

"HOT DAMN!  Perfecto!

Edit:  Interestingly, that recipe doesn't look too terribly different than the myriad recipes for moussaka that I've googled.  Since she loves THAT specific Toledo moussaka so much, I figured there'd be some peculiar wrinkle to it, that sets it apart.  But nope.  Same sorts of spices and techniques as every moussaka everywhere.   Her love of it may be due to her memories of the experience as a whole, what with getting to see the dancing, and hanging out in a downtown of a decently sized city and all.  Whatever.   I'm gonna make it for her birthday, and we'll see how it goes.

Downtown has kind of weird gaps between areas with stuff that are just empty, but the gaps have been shrinking. Lots of lofts available.

"I-75 will get you to and from downtown Toledo is 25ish minutes depending how close to live to the highway, but if there is construction it could take way long. If you're taking back/side roads it may take 45-60 minutes depending on traffic and where you're located in Toledo.

You could always split the difference and live in between like some others have suggested, unless you're wanting to be very close to the fun stuff. Places like Temperance is on the border of MI/OH or you could go North to somewhere like Belleville which is between Ann Arbor/Monroe (probably 20-30 minutes to get to either) and somewhat closer to Detroit even.

Unfortunately, if you're wanting to be right next to the bars/clubs/parties you will likely have to commute a ways to Monroe.

"I'm from the Toledo area and lived in Monroe for a few years, back in Toledo area. 

I'm assuming that you're working at the actual hospital in town, on Macomb. Personally, I think it's easier to get there from I75 than it is through town. Monroe is set up slightly strange where there's no real good way of getting through it without hitting a bunch of lights. 

Monroe isn't bad. In my opinion, it isn't great. There's a lot of stores. And a lot of food options, but not much to do. Toledo and Detroit are going to have the 'activities' Plus if you like going to State\county Parks you either have to buy a rec pass, or pay to get in every time. 

Point Place is great. So are parts of Toledo. That's if you don't mind dealing with out of state taxes every year. 
Toledo area has an amazing amount of metro parks that are all free to get into. Toledo has ALL the food and has a minor baseball\hockey team and occasionally has some decent concerts.

Like others said, Lambertville\Temperance are close to the State Line, but have quick access into Monroe, but still really close to Toledo. Small towns though.

Toledo is a surprise in many ways, with a world class art museum and zoo, surprisingly both better than Detroit's. It's Little Detroit in all ways, including the good ones.

The owners of the Westgate Village Shopping Center plan to purchase the vacant Sears building and redevelop the property, the company’s CEO told The Blade. 

Liz Holland, the CEO of Chicago-based Abbell Credit Corporation, which owns the Westgate plaza, said the vacant building would be razed and plans would be evaluated to determine a redevelopment proposal for that site.

“We’ve been their neighbor since 1956 and we feel like we are probably in the best position to redevelop it,” 

The company already owns the parking lot that wraps around the building, she added.

 

“It made the most sense for us to be the logical buyer,” Ms. Holland said.

The purchase price will not be disclosed until the sale is finalized.

There are no plans to purchase the vacant Elder-Beerman building, which sits adjacent to the Sears building, she said.",t2_1yl01e3,Ponch47,0,1648047091.0,0,t1_i1sv0q1,i1sv0q1,True,Ponch47,t3_tkvmk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tkvmk6/vacant_sears_store_at_westgate_could_see_new_life/,Vacant Sears store at Westgate could see new life,/r/toledo/comments/tkvmk6/vacant_sears_store_at_westgate_could_see_new_life/i1sv0q1/,12,r/toledo,0,12

"Yeah, I felt like the Summit Street reconstruction project was such a wasted great opportunity for the city to make a statement on its showpiece street about shifting the paradigm and making downtown a place for people. But instead they just put down shiny new pavement and effectively said that the status quo will be maintained and the most important thing to focus on is allowing cars to drive through our showpiece street as quickly as possible. There are definitely improvements being made, but none of them feel like the bold statements that need to be made (I know there is a lot of pushback to that but I still think bold strokes are needed) and I don’t really see a systematic approach being used (or at least communicated), it just feels like things are put down in isolated haphazard pockets that aren’t too useful by themselves.

"Thank you for this! Most of it is exactly what I thought. But, I had completely forgotten that I have a medical exemption that I had turned in at the beginning of January because I was in and out of the hospital and have been using these exemptions since I initially got really sick and started struggling financially from spending weeks at a time hospitalized. I suffer from onset heart failure and a few types of Dysautonomia. 

I know that they just started being able to do disconnections in October after Covid. So I’m wondering if they are just trying to get as much money as possible because of the effects of that. I would imagine some people just defaulted if evicted or losing their homes also. Back in October actually I had a woman come to my door specifically to give me a 10 notice telling me I had to pay on due date and that now they can start disconnecting again. She was trying to bully me into paying right then with her. I will admit that I was two months behind. I have been on Auto-Pay since then. This month I couldn’t pay exactly on due date. But, it was only 12 days late. And I received no prior notice. Could not pay with debit or credit, and suddenly added on an extra $124 on top of reconnecting fee.

"Definitely not more to the story. Wish I could say their was. I’m not ashamed to admit I’m a poor single mom and have had past due bills. Honestly the $197 is one of the lowest bills for electric I’ve even had. Usually my bill is around $250 a month. But in the past anytime I have had a disconnect notice, the first put a 10 day notice in my door or mailbox. And the one time I did have a shut off, my bill was almost $600. Also there wasn’t an extra $124. Another difference is that when I went to pay for it, I couldn’t use credit or debit. I had to give banking/routing #. That was my only option for payment method.

"Question: has anyone ever seen a single person hanging out in “the Oval”? The renderings show people eating at picnic tables there, and I feel like it was marketed as being a nice place to hang out, but I cannot see how anyone would find that small island in between 4 lanes of traffic an enjoyable place to be, especially with Promenade Park and Levis Square right there. I’m 100% in favor of the slight traffic calming that the Oval provides by shifting the alignment of the road, and the pedestrian safety it affords by cutting down travel lanes to cross from 4 to 2, but it still feels like a bit of a boondoggle to try to distract from the fact that Summit Street is still 4 lanes wide and will still feel like a pedestrian barrier between downtown and the river (I mean thank goodness it didn’t become a highway, but still).

"Maumee has some really cool suburbs right off of Airport Highway(more of a big main road than a highway). Runs right through Maumee with tons of food and shopping alongside it. Definitely nicer than parts of Toledo and only a 20 minute drive to Toledo (even shorter if you use tolls). That goes for any of the surrounding towns: Perrysburg, Maumee, Ottawa Hills, and Oregon(basically is Toledo still). 
Idk about selling potential, but with cities like Nashville, Pitt, Denver (Tol is not as big as those) slowly becoming transient shitty places, Toledo may be a place to buy and stay for a while until it gets engulfed by transplants like other cities have, then sell once cost of living goes through the roof. 
Toledo's great, the towns around it have just as much to offer  just without highrise buildings and you can always travel 15-20minutes into the city from ANY of these towns to catch a Mud Hens(minor MLB), Walleye(minor NHL), or a Rockets(college football) game.

"The metal itself should have no difference, but there are slight functional differences. When using cast iron you'll want to ""season"" the pan which is a process of cooking it with a thin layer of oil that will build up overtime and help create a non-stick surface. When they used to cast pans back in they day they would use ultra fine sand and pour the iron in so the surface is smooth to the touch and the eye. Some of the boutique producers today will use ultra fine sand in the production or they will grind the surface smooth. Lodge, which is pretty much the budget brand for cast iron, used larger grain sand and often the cooking surface will be textured. You can still get that non-stick effect on the pan, but in my experience it take a much longer period of time to do so. 

The boutique brands can be expensive with some new pans being more expensive than vintage.

Also many vintage brands no longer exist so it's cool to have a piece of history and some of the pan sizes they used to produce I can't find from any modern producers. I just got a 14 inch cast iron skillet the other day and the largest I've found from modern producers was like 12.5 inches. 

Regardless, any cast iron you buy today will treat you well if you take care of it the right way. Also, the metal is a great at retaining heat and can keep your food warm longer after cooking. If you want more info r/castiron is a great community. 

Some brands new and old did have various ways to reduce the weight of the pans.

"Our public transport is FREE and it's not being used. 

Insult our concerns of more investment as ""low hanging fruit"" if that's you.  The actual facts in this country are, people would rather sit hours in their car than take our version of mass transit. People do not trust the government, certainly not TARTA, particularly after that big build and high Administrative costs (which taxpayers will always assume true), to create a desirable mass transit system. Taxayers simply are not going to trust that the people pushing this are not looking to self-enrich when even FREE, the system isn't desirable.

Forcing people to pay even more of their paycheck into something they do not see purpose, do not enjoy and insulting their reasons is not going to gain supporters for your movement, no matter HOW much sense it makes to YOU.

As a polite suggestion to a person who prefered to insult, maybe YOU can donate YOUR money to TARTA to help pay for those that struggle to pay the boarding fee or maybe smarter, start a non-profit for that purpose so others can get a tax break for helping.

Food-processor parts in clean storage were dirty with food residue on food-contact surfaces and were stored improperly with a cloth towel. The dish storage shelf in the dish machine room was not kept clean. Storage bins for clean utensils contained food debris. The main ice machine was filthy. Iced-tea dispenser spouts had heavy buildup. Cleaned food containers had sticker residue and dirty film. The prep line cooler and two-door salad cooler failed to maintain proper refrigeration temperature. Multiple pans, plastic containers, plastic lids, and ice scoops were broken, dented, cracked, melted, and chipped. Pans had baked-on residue.

Mancy’s Italian, 5453 Monroe, inspected Jan. 18. Foods in the prep-top cooler were holding at improper temperatures because cooler’s fan covers obstructed proper air flow.

"Leaf and Seed downtown is excellent. I like to point out that they're right next to Culture Clash, an outstanding record store.

I've heard excellent things about Souk as well.

Registry has great veg options. More upscale.

Lowrider Cafe is an AMAZING Mexican restaurant. They started out with a vegan-only menu and their vegan options are outstanding. Pretty inexpensive.

Fowl & Fodder has a great brunch menu. A small set of veg options, but they are very good. A little pricey but worth it.

For a nice peaceful coffeeshop, try Plate One, a great place to lounge for a couple hours with a latte and an elegant small salad. Love their food.

Grumpy's is M-F. Nice local cafe with some simple but tasty veg options.

If you're willing to travel a small bit, try out Bellwether for interesting cocktails, veg small plates, and a great view. Casual and reasonably priced.

Similarly, in the Old West End, close to downtown, there is Black Kite, a coffee shop with a really great veg-friendly weekend brunch menu. Pretty inexpensive.

Also near the OWE is the Toledo Museum of Art, which absolutely deserves a visit in and of itself, but its cafe is also phenomenal and has veg options (salads, sandwiches, plus wine).

The Things to Do in Toledo stickied post has info about bike etc shares that you can use to get around while here.

"As others have mentioned, Souk is great! I have a very inconvenient sesame allergy which makes my love of Mediterranean food quite complicated. I say this just because the staff there have been incredibly accommodating re: me asking about ingredients and being generally more work than your average diner, I guess.

Spicy Tuna is a sushi place with a BOMB vegan menu. I never wanted or needed to try vegan tuna/salmon, but they went for it. It’s delicious. I’ve brought vegetarians and omnivores alike there since moving to Toledo, and their vegan rolls have always received rave reviews. It’s not all imitation fish or trying to “replace” the non-veg elements. They have original stand-alone rolls on the vegan menu in addition to veganized classics (and a full regular menu).

"Thank you. I definitely hear what you are saying about not wanting to make biking dependent on driving. It kind of defeats the purpose.

At the same time, I know that not all bike paths are easily accessible from every part of the city. If people have to bike through traffic, on roads that aren't safe for biking, in order to get to bike paths, then that might deter people from using the bike paths at all (I can say that this was the case for me!).

Until road biking infrastructure is safer and better, driving to the bike paths may be necessary for some folks. But I am hopeful that starting to bike at all will be a ""gateway"" to more daily life/road biking, which will then exert pressure to make infrastructure for road biking safer!

Anyway, I definitely respect where you're coming from. It's a catch-22 situation and I support your point of view. And I really love your passion for city biking!

"I could not agree more with your perspective and your feelings about improving bike infrastructure. I think that people would want to bike if given the opportunity, but our current system's lack of safety is a huge barrier to getting started.

A lot of people also argue that, because supposedly no one will bike in the winter, there's no use in building bike lanes at all. I thought that this argument from the Youtube channel Oh! The Urbanity was excellent: Most shopping center minimum parking requirements are based on max demand (i.e., the holiday shopping season). The rest of the year, those parking lots are barely full. So, we build parking infrastructure based on peak demand, but we build bike infrastructure based on trough demand.

Of course, the same argument still stands - if you build winter-friendly bike paths, and maintain them, and clear snow from them the way you do with roads, people will use them.

I see lots more discussion around bike infrastructure these days, and I share your hope that things will continue to improve.

Acreage isn’t really the issue for me.

We’ve visited a lot of the Huron/Clinton parks, and enjoyed them.

A knee-jerk impression of a lot of the Huron/Clinton parks would be a LOT of mowed grass, a lot of vehicle traffic throughout the park, and a weedy/worn feeling to the natural areas (like in maintained trails and no effort to keep invasives like phragmites, honey suckle, or buckthorn under control).

"Gotcha. Makes sense - I think our primary difference in opinion comes from my enjoyment of less-nature-related recreation.

One place I disagree with you: You mention basic land being ""just as good"" and provide size as one of the contexts - Huron-Clinton Metroparks have over twice as much park-land as Toledo Metroparks, at least in terms of developed parks (I'm honestly not sure if the 12,000 acres listed for Toledo Metroparks includes the land they purchased but have not yet developed and don't have time to look right now). I do recognize that some areas of HC parks are more congested, but in general I do not think they are overall as congested - I'd venture that there are as many serene and pristine nature focused areas in HC parks as Toledo's, though the proportion of the land that is that way is likely **far** less.

For comparison on size - there are two HC parks similar in size to Oak Openings, our largest.... and there are six HC parks around double or more than double the size of our second largest, Secor.",t2_k4lio63,cwojputt,0,1647533978.0,0,t1_i119vuf,i119vuf,False,DeliveringOP,t3_tfubrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tfubrc/anyone_else_up_for_seceding/,Anyone else up for seceding?,/r/toledo/comments/tfubrc/anyone_else_up_for_seceding/i119vuf/,2,r/toledo,0,2

* historic and nature education/interpretive info and signage

* less congested and better behavior by visitors

On the other hand - the fact that she can not run for a seat on the court may have played a role in her willingness to support the petitioners.

For the mountain bike trails, as the link shows, if needed the primary parking area is at the Jermain Park tennis courts, the entrance to the trail is in the woods on the south end of the parking lot next to an informational signboard. If needed Paved trails can be easily access and found from the main parking areas at Ottawa Park near the picnic shelters and amphitheater. Paved trails in Ottawa Park connect to the Chessie Circle trail at the corner of Douglas and Kenwood, and to the Overland Trail on Ottawa Parkway (the Overland Trail is also the perimeter trail of Ottawa Park's east side). Ottawa/Jermain Parks and their trail networks can also be accessed from many points from the surrounding neighborhoods.

"Overland Trail: Currently runs from Ottawa Park at Bancroft Street and Ottawa Parkway (Parkside Boulevard) to Stickney Avenue at S Expressway Drive. About 6ish miles long I think. Plans call for it to eventually run all the way out to Detwiler Park. Several road crossings including some highway exit ramps, and several locations where you have to bike on the street (Auburn Avenue to cross the Ottawa River and I-475 \[unprotected bike lane\], W Manhattan Boulevard \[unprotected bike lane\], and Windmere Boulevard adjacent to Mt Carmel Cemetery \[no bike lane\]) though none of these streets are particularly busy and shouldn't be an issue for most people. It can be a bit difficult to follow the trail at the multiple roundabouts in the Berdan/Cherry/Manhattan/Phillips area. Parking available available at Ottawa Park, Willys Park, and Joe E. Brown Park. The trail along Ottawa/Jermain Parks is relatively scenic and also allows you to connect to the trails around Ottawa Park as well as the northern portion of the Chessie Circle Trail and the University Parks Trail. The trail also takes you through Historic Woodlawn Cemetery which is interesting. Willys Park and Joe E. Brown Park are both off of the trail. But the portion of the trail along I-75 is a bit monotonous and loud from all the car traffic. The trail also takes you right by the remaining smoke stack from the Willys Overland Jeep plant which is pretty neat to look at up close.",t2_9begzp6n,tolwat,0,1647473050.0,0,t1_i0y7w7q,i0y7w7q,False,goingmadforyou,t3_tfk9lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tfk9lm/all_things_bikes_bike_trails_and_bike_paths_in/,All things bikes!

[Bike Rides Matter glow rolls](https://toledocitypaper.com/online-exclusives/the-story-of-bike-rides-matter/) are the most fun group bike activity I have participated in in Toledo. 100% recommend (first glow roll of 2022 is April 2nd).

Other local bike shops (Wersell’s and Reggie’s) will also host the occasional glow roll. Glow rolls are definitely fun and look very cool.

In the past, Patron Saints Brewery has put on a “Pedals and Pints” event that involved a casual slow bike ride as a group to get drinks somewhere. Not sure if they will be putting that on in 2022.

"Chessie Circle Trail (northern portion): I can only speak to the northern portion of the Chessie Circle Trail, plans are for it to eventually run all the way to, and potentially across the Maumee River. Someone from South Toledo can provide more info about the southern portions of the trail that are complete. The northern portion of the Chessie Circle trail runs from Bancroft Street (Ottawa Park/UT) to Jackman Road (Bwoman Park/Miracle Mile/Start High School). About 3 miles long. Another flat, straight trail (also rail to trail project). Several road crossings, some of which are quite large and offer no protection to trail users so exercise caution (some of the road crossings may also have curbs that need curb cuts added so trail users don't have to hop the curb to get back onto the trail after crossing the road). Parking can be found nearby at Ottawa Park, and Bowman Park, as well as in the adjacent neighborhoods. A connector brings the trail to the North Towerview Boulevard entrance of UT from which the University/Parks Trail can be accessed (after a little bit of road biking through campus) and another connector at Douglas and Kenwood ties the trail into the Ottawa Park trail which can take you around Ottawa Park and to the Overland Trail.

Veo is only partially a ""bike"" sharing system as it also uses electric scooters and mopeds. It is a dockless sharing system, so you have to check on the app to see where the bikes/scooters are, though there are hub areas.

"[University/Parks Trail](https://metroparkstoledo.com/trails/universityparks-trail/). Probably the most popular bike path in the area. Runs from UT to Silica Road out in Sylvania. 7 miles long, predominantly flat and straight trail (being a rail to trail project). Several road crossings, some with stop signs, some with lights. Very well maintained by Metroparks.

"Whew, this is gonna be a long one. 

Howdy there. If you look through the actual thing instead of going to the bottom of each category you'll see that ""single"" item things (ex. chocolate chip cookies, blueberry muffins, banana bread, etc) are fairly priced. As well as the ""double"" item things (ex. lemon poppyseed muffins, maple bacon pancake cookies, pumpkin pecan bread, etc). 

My way of doing this menu is that way I can cover my own costs on flour, sugar, vanilla, baking powder/soda, cream cheese, and other essential baking items and whatever else is needed including my TIME. I spend a bit of time advertising, chatting with customers (which are very pleased with the items they get), and actually making them and making them look presentable. I understand if you think that these prices are high. However, I'm also not expecting anyone and everyone to understand this way of pricing. If you'd like a loaf of banana bread or muffins from the grocery store..please by all means feel free to get them. Just remember, they're full of preservatives and things to keep their shelf life for a long time. Where as mine, when you order them they are still warm to the touch because I make them that day. 

I know my worth, given my time and baking knowledge. I know my prices aren't the cheapest but I also can't pay my rent on cheap things. Honestly, I've had people pay more for the same things that I'm selling and they're happy to do it time and time again. 

Also to the part of your comment that you edited and deleted..

You'd also see that the buckeye prices (if someone orders them in a 30 or 50 count) are $0.50 a piece, which is what stores sell them for. The one exception is the 15 piece one but it still averages out to $0.67 per buckeye. 

Prices also include delivery if you're in the Toledo area, so I feel like my prices are more than admirable. Especially with gas being as high as it is.

">	A former Scott High School teacher was sentenced yesterday in Lucas County Common Pleas Court to three years in prison for having sex with a 16-year-old female student.

>	John ""Mitch"" Balonek, 48, was told by Judge Denise Ann Dartt he violated the trust the victim's guardians and others placed in him and the Toledo Public Schools to educate and care for their children.

>	""When something like this happens, it creates a breakdown in the system and a lot of mistrust that can be very unhealthy,"" the judge said.

>	A well-liked instructor among students and an unsuccessful Toledo City Council candidate, Balonek, of 2631 Sherbrooke Rd., pleaded no contest and was found guilty April 16 to sexual battery in connection with a relationship he had with the student, who has since turned 17.

>	The student, who was not present in court, was removed from Balonek's English class at the high school in November at the insistence of the girl's foster mother, who became aware of inappropriate conduct between the girl and Balonek.

>	Judge Dartt said the guardian's request should have been a warning.

>	""That would indicate to me that there had been some concern. That should have been the trigger that this has got to stop. But it did not,"" the judge said.

>	The foster parent went to the school district with concerns about the defendant after learning the victim had dinner at Balonek's home, and after finding the girl with Balonek in his car while it was parked outside the guardian's home.

>	Sylvania Township police found Balonek in his car with the girl Jan. 7 in an empty parking lot of a business in the 7100 block of Granite Circle near the University-Parks Trail.

>	He and the girl were not wearing shoes, and they were putting on their clothes when officers found them. The officers found a used condom in the back of the car.

>	Both Balonek and the victim admitted to police in separate interviews to having a sexual relationship, which began about a month earlier.

>	In asking the judge for leniency and mercy, Balonek said he made a terrible and costly mistake and assured the court it would not happen again.

>	""I betrayed the trust of my students and my profession. It was very unprofessional the way I acted. I deeply, deeply regret my actions. If I had to do it over again, I would have made different choices,"" he said.

>	The defendant's wife and children were among his supporters at the hearing. They appeared visibly upset with the punishment imposed by the judge.

>	Balonek could ask the court for early release after he completes six months of the sentence. His early release would be up to Judge Dartt.

>	Balonek was suspended by the school district without pay Jan. 10. He resigned from his $46,000-a-year job May 3.

>	The resignation is to go before the school board for approval at its next scheduled meeting, on June 7.

>	Balonek finished with 4,928 votes as an independent candidate for council in Toledo's primary election last September, placing him 13th among 16 candidates. The top 12 vote-getters in the primary election went on to battle for the six at-large seats in the November election.

>	Balonek is the second area high school teacher convicted of a sex crime involving a student this year. Nicole M. Long, who was an English teacher at Ayersville High School in Defiance County, was convicted of having sex with a 17-year-old male student in her home in Defiance.

>	Long, who pleaded guilty to sexual battery in Defiance County Common Pleas Court, was sentenced to 90 days in jail.

"I would say that calling it 'plans' is a bit premature. The city is not really involved directly in this funding, and they are probably evaluating the impact that it will bring as well. I think your questions would be better answered by members of city council, the Port authority, or the chamber of commerce, but I think they're very good questions and the more people that ask them, the more they will have to develop an answer.

To their credit, the city has been investing resources in the area. Lagrange has been resurfaced, the sidewalks and lights have been updated, and I believe the land bank has been active in the area with some of the storefronts.

The area is so close to the emerging development of the Vistula that I would love to see it be a walking area with art galleries, performance spaces, a bistro type restaurant, a coffee shop, etc. to help support that as well.",t2_2s3eqqhj,Tiger49er,0,1647278942.0,0,t1_i0n34lc,i0n34lc,False,pBlast,t3_tdkcr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tdkcr6/the_ohio_theatre_got_a_25_million_federal_grant/,The Ohio Theatre got a 2.5 million federal grant,/r/toledo/comments/tdkcr6/the_ohio_theatre_got_a_25_million_federal_grant/i0n34lc/,3,r/toledo,0,3

Show them that we, as a city, care and maybe the control some of those malcontents hold will dissipate, maybe the pipeline to fuel the malcontents' ambitions with willing participants will fade.

"Do not rely on Uber as a primary means of transport unless you have no other option. For anything you absolutely *must* get to, make sure you have a plan B, even if that's to leave yourself time to walk.

I rely heavily on Uber due to medical issues that preclude driving. I can *usually* get an Uber, but sometimes I have to wait thirty minutes to an hour. It's not uncommon to not get a ride at all - about once a week for the past month, I have had to just give up and walk to my destination. When I do get a ride, the prices are often ridiculous - I often have to pay as much as four times the usual cost.

"Yeah it's a really nice spot they've built there on Summit St. My great grandparents owned a house on Bush St. just behind Tolhouse(up the road from Toledo Spirits) so it's been cool seeing property after property in the Vistula district *finally* getting some attention. If they were still here I suspect they'd be pleased with the direction of their neighborhood. 

What'll be especially cool about the Heavy Wheelhouse at the Treehouse Village is if you're into mountain biking. The Metroparks are building miles upon miles of trails and they have a sweet obstacle course already built at the Beach Ridge Trailhead(where all of this stuff sits in Oak Openings). 

The idea is that on top of private events, they'll be able to have people make an afternoon out of riding and then get dinner and a beer afterwards right on the property. It'll also be available to people just passing through along the trails. With the state finally starting to relax a damn bit on special use permits, hopefully this will lead to more places within the Metroparks being able to do these types of ventures and with luck our entire park system will stay continuously improving.🤞🏻",t2_6ur7y,Icantevenhavemyname,0,1647135988.0,0,t1_i0fwwi7,i0fwwi7,False,greenhousecrtv,t3_tc452o,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tc452o/new_brewery_coffeehouse_opening_at_oak_openings/,"New brewery, coffeehouse opening at Oak Openings",/r/toledo/comments/tc452o/new_brewery_coffeehouse_opening_at_oak_openings/i0fwwi7/,2,r/toledo,0,2

Why is a dramatic increase in spending on public transit possible in Toledo? Because as a below-rank city in terms of spending, in a state that is near the bottom of the barrel in terms of spending, we have nowhere to go but up. I’m not talking about a city sitting in the middle of the pack nationwide in spending, or even near that. Why can we do better? Because around the country – cities are doing better.

A good concrete example would be Madison, Wisconsin. Madison. Toledo and Madison sit next to each other in terms of total population (270.8K and 269.8K respectively), and have very similar population densities (3.31K and 3.34K per square mile). Multiple websites I can find list Madison as a top-10 city in the US in terms of the quality of their public transit infrastructure. Madison began their transition in 1998. In 2021 the Traffic Engineering team in Madison earned the “Transportation Systems Management & Operations Council Organization Award” from the Institute of Transportation Engineers, an award that considers cities around the world. Some of the reasons for being awarded are: traffic congestion reductions, utility of network, network support of cost effective and sustainable growth.  The city operates on an annual budget of $59.4M, within the context of a state that funds at a level of about $14.50 per capita. According to the Wisconsin DOT Madison reduced congestion related costs in the first five years of investment by $23.6M annually. In terms of out of pocket tax payers experienced about $6.96/trip in out of pocket savings in that span.

To me, Madison is a good example to follow. Wisconsin, at a state level, may not be the best comparison – spending over double what Ohio does. But if Madison can be an award-winning top-10 regarded city in the country in terms of public transportation systems, there’s no reason the City of Toledo can’t significantly improve the costs and experiences of residents with increased public transit funding.",t2_k4lio63,cwojputt,0,1647110419.0,0,t1_i0edivo,i0edivo,False,Johio83,t3_tb42kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tb42kn/car_dependency_is_holding_toledo_back/,Car dependency is holding Toledo back,/r/toledo/comments/tb42kn/car_dependency_is_holding_toledo_back/i0edivo/,5,r/toledo,0,5
"**I also would rather CHOOSE how my money is spent. We have all the public transit I feel I need in the event I don't want to use my car. And I rarely use that transit. I get tired of being asked for a dollar by people I don't know. Listening to their foul music. I'm not a big city person where that maybe goes in one ear and out the other. Now bike lanes where I can use my private bike? That appeals a bit more to my socialist infrastructure side.**

What about the perspective of others, who want public transit, and don’t want to be restricted to needing to own a car? Although I’m sure many would rather see a dramatic reduction in the number of car owners – I haven’t seen in any of these threads anyone advocating for taking your car away. Frankly, in any city that would be impractical both now and even following implementation of better public transportation.

But in Toledo more than enough people are without vehicles to necessitate better infrastructure – about 1.5 households out of 10 (per annual US census bureau est). About 15% of Toledoans only have the option of using underfunded public transportation that runs few enough lines to few enough places that many jobs and opportunities are simply out of their reach. The rest of us, who do own a car, have no viable choice otherwise. We use our car, or we don’t get to work.

**And you think a re-re-work would cost.... ?**

**We don't need to spend BILLIONS to dig up old tracks and put up electrical lines because it what, looks cool?**

You know, this was your first interaction with me. You chose to infantilize (“because it what, looks cool?”) my statement that Toledo would benefit from a return to being a city built around competent public transit. That I reacted by calling your response “hilariously out of line” was not on my part a positive move, but maybe practice what you preach? You know full well that nobody is merely pushing for this “because it looks cool.”

To the point you’re making – yes, over time we spend money to save money. Do I know the exact cost of a wholesale transition all at once? No. Nor am I interested in that. You don’t change all at once, that’s a silly way to transition and a recipe for disaster. I, in that post, expressed a desire to see Toledo return to that – but it would be simply idiotic to do a wholesale change all at once. If you assumed I meant that, out of my wistful statement, I apologize for giving that impression. I'm going to focus this post on the benefits of continuing to increase spending on public transit, not the pie-in-the-sky dream of eventually arriving at a quality rail service.

There are economic benefits to the average city resident from a consistent and measured development of systems. According to the American Public Transit Association impact report (using the framework proposed by Hale, 2011, New Approaches to Strategic Urban Transport Assessment – which assesses the literature on public transit performance in Australia and the US) the average resident of a region adding bus transit route that increases ridership by 1000 daily riders M-F sees a 2-3:1 benefit:cost ratio and adding rail transit route that see 10,000 daily riders see 1.5-2:1 over 15 years. This is in terms of direct+indirect benefits (jobs in transit, vehicle cost reductions, congestion reductions, parking savings, traffic incident costs).

If we chose to focus on our most in need via direct development of public transit oriented neighborhoods, those tend to provide the people in those neighborhoods (for example: if we chose to reorient the Old North End neighborhood) with a 50-60:1 benefit.

**We have public transport. We have for hire transport. And by far, most choose not to use it because they prefer their personal transport for which they happily pay.**

As noted above – we barely have public transit in Toledo. When you refer to most choosing not to use it – you’re referring to people not wanting to use a system that is funded-to-fail.

The boost provided by the November levy to bring funding from 13M annual to 32M annual is a great positive step, but excuse me while I hope for more. While this does put Toledo more in line with other cities near the bottom of the public-transit-spending barrel in Ohio – taking us from by far the lowest-spending city per-capita in the state, to ahead of Cincy and in line with Akron. But still well behind Canton, Parma, Dayton, Cleveland, and Columbus. We don’t need to be at the top of that list, but continuing to elevate spending to put us in line with our rank in terms of the size of our urban population would be nice.

Additionally – it must be noted that this is within the context of being in Ohio. The state is likewise not investing in the public transit infrastructure, per the annual report of the Amaerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. On a per capita basis Ohio will spend about $6.00 on public transit at the state level over the next two years (a tenfold increase over what it was, and lets note that our conversation at this point is focused on the system people have been “choosing” not to use – so what we’re using has been developed on the back of state spending at $0.63 per capita). Indiana spends $10.18. Michigan? $26.73. Pennsylvania? $128.83. Illinois? $200.59. Ohio’s population density (289/sq mi) is 15th in the country. In line with Pennsylvania (291), and well ahead of Illinois (231), Indiana (189), and Michigan (178).

On your point regarding what people “happily” do – as someone who owns a nicely functioning vehicle, let me just say that I fucking hate driving myself around. It is one of the biggest wastes of time in my day. If I could sit back with my laptop or tablet and get some work done on public transit, that’d be FANTASTIC. I would gladly transition if I could step outside of my neighborhood, onto a bus, and get to where I need to be every day without wasting \*additional hours\* dealing with the limitations of our currently underfunded system. What I \*do\* is far different from what I \*happily do.\*

**Economics isn't hard. If personal cost of living of the masses goes down because someone has decided well, we don't need to pay for all those cars and prefers to force the masses onto busses then guess what? So do salaries. It all balances according to demand.**

Again with the infantilization, also still before I’d said anything beyond noting that Toledo was, once upon a time, built upon public transit and I’d like to see it go back to that. Frankly – I’m not sure what your point is here… so you’re saying that you believe that this whole thing would be an economic wash? That hasn’t been the case in other areas, as I noted above in terms of average urban benefit:cost ratios. The average resident benefits economically over a 15 year period from increased urban public transit, when considering direct and indirect costs.",t2_k4lio63,cwojputt,0,1647110363.0,0,t1_i0ede2g,i0ede2g,False,Johio83,t3_tb42kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tb42kn/car_dependency_is_holding_toledo_back/,Car dependency is holding Toledo back,/r/toledo/comments/tb42kn/car_dependency_is_holding_toledo_back/i0ede2g/,2,r/toledo,0,2
