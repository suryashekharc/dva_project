"So, they were cited for merely being an unlicensed security guard but not criminal impersonation?

Remember that degenerate security guard that shot and killed that man at the Kroger gas station over loud music? I sure AF do...

Security guarding is a serious job and anyone who takes up this field should take it seriously.

I understand one of them was an actual certified guard but all of them were not.

Just because we have a 'Constitutional Carry' gun law, doesn't mean you can run around and play John Wayne. This law is in place for you to defend yourself or your loved ones, not to take advantage of.

BTW, in some circumstances and in this one, it is actually a criminal offense to impersonate a security officer.

Also, you cannot have your pistol on your person within an establishment that serves alcohol unless you're law enforcement or are an employed security guard at that location. (I may be wrong about this, not too sure.)

These people should face hefty criminal charges and financial penalties, along with this business having their upcoming liquor license reevaluated before it is issued.

"Don't we all wish we knew the answer to that question.

I think younger people seeing other people do it has a lot to do with it.

One person starts driving like a drunken Oompa-Loompa and everyone thereafter plays follow the leader.

IMO, driver's licenses are a fucking joke. The process of obtaining  one doesn't really consist of any learning process.

A DL is merely a privilege that our government gives us so that later on they can take it away and use it against us.

If you look at the booking log @ 201 Poplar you will see a huge percentage of people arrested are charged with; 'Driving on Suspended/Revoked/Canceled'.

Almost all of them fall into the canceled category which happen mostly for simply not paying a single speeding ticket or missing consecutive child support payments.

I don't support suspending a person's right to travel for such offenses. IMO, it's incredibly unconstitutional and also falls into line with 'cruel & unusual punishment'.

Suspending someone's DL could cause them to not have transportation to work, pick up their kids or take them to school, drive to the grocery store (several areas in Memphis are considered food deserts), miss court dates, the list goes on...

... but most of these people will simply continue to drive. They will end up getting caught and being cited and/or go to jail depending on how the officer is feeling.

Now they will need to hire an attorney, along with finding transportation to and from each and every court date, starting the never ending downward spiral that's very difficult to stop for someone struggling financially.

"Hi guys,

We've gotten OVERWHELMING SUPPORT from the various Tennessee subreddits in working to try and defeat William Lamberth's HB-1927 that seeks to outlaw Delta-8 THC and other alternate cannabinoids in TN.

If you haven't seen my original posts about contacting state representatives about this bill, please visit my profile and you'll see posts from me in the Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and Murfreesboro subs.

I spoke with the Tennessee Growers Coalition who are lobbying to defeat this bill that is getting voted on next **Wednesday, March 30.**

The **Tennessee Growers Coalition** in the process of hiring an ADDITIONAL lobbying team to directly defeat this bill.

They told me that if we donate to the link above, it will go directly to defeat this bill. I wanted to raise awareness about this in case you can help with a donation.

We can donate and we can use my original posts mentioned above to contact those voting on this bill. This is how we can help!

"Thanks for posting this! It is unfortunately as grim as the numbers suggest. For context, I work as a transportation planner at Shelby County (I'm not a TDOT employee, elected, or an engineer so no one listens to me and I have no power), but I want to provide some additional information here as well.

&#x200B;

* at 20 miles an hour, one out of ten pedestrian/car collisions are fatal. This increases linearly to 40 mph, where the number is 9 out of 10.
* Most of Memphis's major arterials (poplar, union, Lamar, Jackson, Sam Cooper, 51, etc) are TDOT controlled and are almost completely posted at 40+ mph
* There's very little local agencies (city of Memphis, Shelby County) can do about these without state approval, and engineering as an institution prioritizes flow of vehicle traffic over safety for a lot of reasons I can't cover here, but examples are inability to reduce speed limits (rule of thumb is to set speed limits at the 85th percentile of observed speed), narrowing lanes from 11 to 9 feet wide, removing right on red in highly urbanized areas (one of the primary causes of pedestrian fatalities), installing mid-block crossings where many people are observed crossing the street etc.
* over 35,000 people a year are killed in traffic fatalities. This number does not include serious and life-long debilitating injuries. This was the #1 cause of death for people under 40 for decades (fentanyl surpassed it in 2021). This is more than gun violence or disease
* across the state and the nation, traffic fatalities have climbed from a low point in 2011: in 2021 we saw the largest six-month increase *ever recorded* in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System‚Äôs (USDOT) history. An estimated 20,160 people died in motor vehicle crashes in the first half of 2021, up 18.4% over 2020. That‚Äôs the largest number of projected fatalities in that time period since 2006. (read more [here](https://www.vox.com/22675358/us-car-deaths-year-traffic-covid-pandemic) at Vox).
* Memphis [ranks](https://www.memphisflyer.com/report-memphis-among-top-20-most-dangerous-cities-for-pedestrians) \#11 in most dangerous cities for pedestrians and 9th [deadliest](https://www.carinsurance.org/deadliest-cities-for-cyclists/) for cyclists.

&#x200B;

I frequently compile reports on this stuff and see these numbers all the time, but I am reminded of them every time I see a driver blow through a stop sign, run a red light, gun it at between 50-70mph on an urban road, pass people in bike lanes or turn lanes, parking in bike lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or the middle of the street (looking at you Madison and Front St), all for the conveniences of a couple seconds saved (and we've all been in that situation where someone violently passes us, just to pull up next to them at a light). And in traffic crashes, there's often a prescription of ""accident,"" when one or multiple drivers were driving carelessly, and even victim blaming and intimidation of people transporting themselves in the elements with their own two legs instead of a climate controlled fossil fueled tank (seriously, have you noticed how much [bigger](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/suvs-trucks-killing-pedestrians-cyclists/621102/) cars are getting?   Anecdotally, the MPD doesn't seem to care to enforce any sort of traffic violation. I understand that they are severely understaffed and to say there are bigger issues to deal with in memphis is plausible but those don't seem to be getting any better either. Do you know how much revenue the city could earn if they sent out a couple of officers down front, union, south main, and madison and ticketed illegally parked vehicles? I have been skeptical of speed and red light cameras in the past because of constitutional concerns and somehow a private company in Texas gets like 50% of the ticket, but if they were actually enforceable in Tennessee I wonder if that 255 fatalities in Shelby County number would be smaller, and how many people would admit they don't think those lives saved are worth the cost.

"I moved to Marion, small city outside of Memphis, for work a few months ago.  There's not much to eat out this way.

There's a place out here called Seafood Shack that's good.  I wouldnt say it's worth the drive unless you really just want to get some food out this way.  

Sen Sushi is good but same as Seafood Shack.  Better sushi in Memphis.

Farther out is a place called Wilson Cafe.  The food used to be better, but it seems that the quality has gone down hill.  I work out that way and we take visitors there for lunch.  It's not bad, but your talking about an hour drive outside of Memphis for some decent food.  I'd say it's not worth the price, but it's in a tiny town that you can walk around for a bit.  They have a museum but I've never been in it.  If you do make the drive to Wilson, just make sure to slow down when you hit the town.  Goes from 55 to 35 fast and the cops will pull you over.

Shameful really. Seven of the city council members didn't want their constituents to make the decision, so they literally blocked them from voicing their opinion on the matter.

"Pros: This opens up the hiring pool for police and firefighters, theoretically eliminating one of the largest hiring barriers to public service which is convincing someone that Memphis is actually a good place and not a lawless wasteland like the top 10 lists would want you to believe.

Cons: First responders will no longer have the requirement to ""serve the community they live in"" because they won't live in the community that they serve. According to some, not having attachment to the community might result in less effective service. In addition, this opens up the door for first responders to follow the migration out east into ~~Lakeland, Arlington, Collierville, and Fayette County~~ **other counties** which means lost tax base.

Ultimately it's up to you how you feel about it. All of our public services are understaffed and to me that seems like a more immediate concern, but at the same time the long term implications might have some unintended side effects.

But MOST IMPORTANTLY, the fact that this decision was made at the state level is the scary part.

"I‚Äôve never done this maneuver, or seen it in real life. I don‚Äôt think it should be legal, and it‚Äôs definitely not going to be a safe maneuver 100% of the time, but this driver did it and everything was fine. There‚Äôs no point in getting pissed at every bad or risky driver on the road. I‚Äôm actually a very cautious driver, and I carry full coverage insurance because I don‚Äôt trust anyone on the roads. Never gotten a ticket, never been in a wreck. 

As far as illegality goes, I wasn‚Äôt referring to drug charges. If a light gets stuck on red, are you going to sit there for 45 minutes, waiting for a cop, or are you going to cautiously proceed? It‚Äôs illegal to run a red light, period. At least that‚Äôs what I was told by police when I called them during this exact circumstance. I decided to go. Was it risky? Yes. Did anything bad happen? No. Were other people doing the same thing? Yes. It‚Äôs illegal to drive in the breakdown lane, but if traffic is at a halt and your exit is 1/4 mile ahead, lots of people put on hazard lights and slowly proceed to the exit. Speeding is illegal, people do it anyway. We all have. Not using a blinker is illegal, people do it anyway. In a crash, neither of those things factor into which driver is at fault. In Tennessee, nobody is supposed to be in the left lane unless they‚Äôre actively passing someone in the right lane ::gestures widely::

"I'm glad traffic laws exist and you have no part in creating them. You clearly have a faulty idea of what safety is, and you would argue that more drivers should be allowed to do stuff like this because you are personally inconvenienced when you are forced to sit through 2 lights at rush hour, ignoring the fact other people have to do the same. 

Just because things are illegal and people do them anyway doesn't make them any less legal. I would argue there are definitely things that are illegal now that shouldn't be illegal, but who are you to judge what things should be legal and illegal? Furthermore, what makes you think acting on those thoughts makes them right? Possessing a shit ton of weed for example will get your ass hauled off to prison. The law as it's executed right now doesn't give a shit if it's the right thing to do or not, your ass is still going to prison. ""Well, I don't think possessing a shit ton of weed should send you to prison"" doesn't keep you from being sent to prison. 

What about the oncoming left hand turn lane? There was a car in it. What if they had a green light? How do you know they didn't have a green light? Looking both ways wouldn't keep that car from turning left (our right). They wouldn't expect our left hand turn lane to turn right instead. They might swing out a little more because that's what you do in Memphis. There's significant potential for a car crash there. Regardless of how vigilant people are, they don't have eyes on the back of their head. We're always dealing with incomplete information of our surroundings. It makes zero sense to be driving in an unpredictable manner when you will never have a complete understanding of the traffic conditions. That's why this is illegal. That's why this is wrong.

"You are just proving how stupid and easily brainwashed you are. That seeming contradiction has been explained a million times too and is simply the result of recommendations changing as they gathered more information and ran more experiments. In other words, they made hypotheses and then tested them. We simply saw the scientific method at work in real time. Some of their initial hypotheses like the masks not being effective we're proven wrong by that testing. At the beginning of the pandemic before they had any real solid knowledge about this virus it was believed that it was a truly airborne virus. If that had been the case then only properly fitted N95 masks would have been the only effective defense. However, further testing showed that it wasn't a truly airborne virus and that it simply hitched a ride in tiny water droplets from our respiration. Those majority of those water droplets can be caught or at least deflected by regular masks.
