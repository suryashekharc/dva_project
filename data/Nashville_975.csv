" It's kind of like the equivalent of people moving to L.A. to act. I know people's responses are harsh but reality is harsh too. 

I think the biggest advice is to understand that the music business is a business. Producers and labels know exactly the kind of talent they're looking for. They're looking for their specific image and what they're trying to market, it's much more business than art at the end of the day. This city is absolutely full of talent (also, it's full, the housing market is so impossible to navigate right now), for everyone moving here with this dream- which is a legit dream, no one's saying that!- a hundred other people do too.

Imma gonna go on a tangent here, cause I have a feeling you're mostly going to get stupid answers, and it's not unjust cause like...everyone and their dog moves here to write songs. But that doesn't mean there's not legit advice. 

I feel like the best things you can do are:

1) practice practice practice. Find your niche. Get yourself out there as much as you can where you are now, including establishing a social media precense. That way when you get here you'll spend a lot less time just establishing any kind of platform, you'll already have one. People move here with entire independent albums under their belt, have been opening acts or written for other people and still struggle to make it big. It takes years and years of constantly learning your craft and the business

2) be ready to take criticism. Take some classes if you haven't already, you can even take some for free on the internet. It doesn't matter how big you get, your stuff is going to go through so many drafts and versions, there's always going to be something a label doesn't like or something that won't be good for radio. Be ready to have your stuff studied and taken apart and put back together again tenfold. 

3) be ready to cater to what other people want- especially if your dream is songwriting more than being a musician yourself. This might mean collaborating with teams, writing things that some exec wants, fulfulling other people's visisions. 

4) learn as much as humanly possible about the music biz, about the labels you'd like to work for, or about being an independent songwriter, then about the Nashville industry. Look up songwriters on all the top 100 songs, for the bands you like and don't like, find out how they all got to where they are now. Attend any networking events you can- lucky you many are online now.

5) biggest tip is to listen to Lightning 100, they're our local independent station here. They're always looking for independent artist to play, having all kinds of contest. **They also have a show on Sundays called Music Business Radio. Listen to the crap out of that show,** it's songwriter wannabe goldmine.

Definitely have a day job- there's no shame in that, everyone has one (or two...or three...). It's gotten crazy expensive to live here, you're not gonna be able to just save up, get an apartment and wait tables while you do open mic at night. Everyone has a roommate...or seven. 

Give yourself a realistic timeline. People move here and give up after six months. Many successful artists spend a decade or more trying to make it before they get a breakthrough. Have a timeframe in mind of how long of a shot you want to give this and have a gameplan of how you're going to realistically live and get by as a human during that time. 

My absolute biggest advice...look, having dreams isn't stupid. Is it stupid to move to an expensive crowded city with no gameplan wanting to become a country star in three months? Ya, that's pretty stupid. But is it stupid to consistently work on a lifelong goal to get to share your music with the world? Nope, not at all. **But people are always going to assume you're going to fail before they think you can succeed.** Don't make a huge deal out of quitting everything and up and moving to Nashville to make it big. You're gonna get all kinds of told you're stupid and laughed at. You're gonna get a hundred Nos before you get the tiniest yes out of anyone. 

One of the best pieces of advice I ever heard was stop telling people your plans. Do you, work on you and your goals.

Get as far as you can before you get here, be ready to put in the work when you get here, be ready to ""fail"" time and time again. If a no is going to make you feel like you failed it's gonna be a hard business for you. Be ready to constantly have to prove yourself and be up against incredible talent everywhere you look. People every day really do move here with similar dreams. 

Also----I feel like the best way you can make it is to have an open idea of what 'success' is to you. There are shit tons of musicians out there whose name isn't in lights or on the top 100. But they still make a stable living doing what they love to do. 

If all else fails, you're not a failure in life if you don't make a living off of your passions and art. It's totally okay to have a ""normal"" job and just write songs for fun or just have a youtube channel or do open mics for fun. In fact, that's really the best way to stay true to your art and the music you want to play cause it's an ice cold business out there and the fun can be sucked out super quick.",t2_7perns8p,skywrites8,0,1648255270.0,0,t1_i24y6ur,i24y6ur,True,SadPatient28,t3_to79sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/to79sv/nashville_songwriters/,Nashville songwriters?,/r/nashville/comments/to79sv/nashville_songwriters/i24y6ur/,19,r/nashville,1,19

"She had to override the system. The system was upgrading to Epic and the current system and Epic basically weren't communicating so in order to get meds you had to override. 
These overrides were not ""DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GIVEN THE PATIENT WILL DIE"" kinda overrides. Those actually did not come up, both the nurse and the staff said this.

The vial was just a regular vial, it wasn't special or anything. She was also asked to go to the ER almost as soon as she got the drug instead of being able to take her time with the meds and staying with the patient, which she should have stayed but was told not to. There's also a name brand vs generic drug name problem, and this was a new nurse too who was floating to the unit. It happens far easier than you could ever imagine if not in nursing but the system def shouldn't have let it too. When she heard what happened and they realized about the vial she immediately owned up to it and wanted to report it. Vandy does everything they could to cover this up. They paid the family off, fired the nurse and wanted everyone to shut up about it...but someone put an annon tip to medicare.

No one is saying she didn't make the error(even she was the first to admit it), but her intent wasn't murder. She made a mistake just like it was a mistake that the computer systems were messed up.

That doesn’t count the hundreds of millions of urgent care visits and outpatient visits and various office procedures done annually. 

So even if we take the 250,000 number, which the study you linked to says was a big overestimate, the number of deaths attributable to medical error doesn’t strike me as “insane.”

Thats not to say that 22,000-250,000 are trivial numbers. That’s not to say that every death due to medical error isn’t a tragedy. That’s not to say that we shouldn’t always try to improve our processes. 

Probably there are many deaths that are unaccounted for such as people who died due to undiagnosed medical interactions etc.

Short staffing caused her to rush, the medication machine wasn’t working correctly leading her to override the medication, she was orienting a nurse causing her to be distracted, the charting system at the hospital was new and not working well which created tons of issues, and Vanderbilt has a lot of new nurses and imo there were a lot of unsafe practices that went unchecked as a result, also most places have their paralytics in a separate box with a label that says “paralytics.” So yes, she made a series of mistakes but there were also a lot of system errors that contributed.

2) no one is saying the nurse didn't make a mistake- even the nurse. She's taken responsibility & is held herself accountable. She wanted to report it & Vandy wanted to cover it up. Why? The computer system never should have allowed this to happen. That's not in theory, it was not supposed to be able to happen. They tried to not report it, tried to botch the investigation & cover it up & then threw the nurse completely under the bus. That's what people are upset about. No one else down the line is getting any blame for this, even the hospital trying to act like it never happened. The hospital should absolutely hold some accountability in this, this is the point. 

Even the family didn't want the nurse to go on trial, they forgave her.

Overrides are part of how these systems work too. The nurse said the patient's case had required like 20 of them just in a few days.

"Julie Thao killed a patient in 2006, injecting an anesthetic instead of an antibiotic at a hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. She worked L&D in the early days of the hospital’s barcode scanning system which malfunctioned frequently. Another problem, not at all unique to this hospital, was that the anesthesiologists required the epiural to be set up, ready to go, before they arrived, and they wanted patients to be absolutely sure, so Thao had it out to prepare and to convince a particularly nervous patient that it was in her best interest to take the drug. 

Thao pled to a lesser charge of administering a medication without a prescription (which is not really what the law is meant for). 

The hospital, of course, threw her under the bus once the DA decided to charge her.

"They put nurses, who operate under time pressure and responsibilities to multiple patients, into a system where you HAD to do overrides constantly. For everything. Because they knew it would be the nurse’s fault if anything happened even though they completely set them up for failure with an unsafe system. If anyone is negligent here it’s the hospital.

Forcing nurses to do constant overrides for mundane medications, because your system doesn’t work, trains them to ignore the override screens. It’s as if your car alarm went off every 10 minutes. The first few times you come out running because what if someone’s stealing your car?! Then you realize the breeze sets it off and you start glancing out the window. Because you can’t be running to check on your car every 10 minutes, you have things to do.
Then your car finally gets stolen. You didn’t see the guy when you glanced out the window, or maybe you didn’t look. The car alarm company says it’s not their fault, because the alarm worked perfectly.

">the ability to identify the proper procedure for doing things that are within their job description.

This doesn't have to do with the nursing license. The nursing license just lets you apply for the nursing job. You learn some basic procedures and do clinic in school, yes, but it's not meant for you to walk in a hospital and magically be able to follow SOP documents and know what to do. That takes training by the hospital and it's the hospital's responsibility to train a nurse for a specific role and make sure their nurses are comfortable with the specific equipment and systems of that role. That...doesn't always happen. Using these systems more complex than just looking away and pressing whatever buttons. 

The system literally should not have allowed a nurse to do this, no matter intent or neglience. Vandy tried there absolute best to cover up and prevent an investigation because of it.

"You actually can put enough safe guards in place. Their system was supposed to be set up so that nothing like this could ever happen, not matter the intent or the negligence. Vandy was supposed to make major changes to said system and policies so this can't happen again but never did until there was an unannounced survey and they were made to. The nurse wanted to fess up as soon as it happened, but Vandy did everything in their power to cover this up. 

Even the family didn't want this trial to happen and said the woman who died wouldn't have wanted her to go to prison. You have to read and research the case details for yourself, there's a lot of misinformation out there that makes the system neglect look like it was as simple as not looking when it wasn't. Not many people are saying she shouldn't have had consequences or not lost her license, but the way Vandy both completely threw the nurse under the bus and also tried to totally cover up the case so their systems didn't get investigated speaks volumes.",t2_7perns8p,skywrites8,0,1648240274.0,0,t1_i240j9e,i240j9e,False,Crazyleggggs,t3_tnupdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/tnupdc/radonda_vaught_found_guilty_of_criminally/,RaDonda Vaught found guilty of criminally negligent homicide in death of patient,/r/nashville/comments/tnupdc/radonda_vaught_found_guilty_of_criminally/i240j9e/,8,r/nashville,0,8

"> These situations were both at Centennial about 7 years ago.

Lost my brother at Centennial 4 years ago.  Came in the ER with acute liver failure (probably due to a reaction to the gadolinium-based MRI contrast dye they gave him the previous day to check for brain cancer recurrence).   

They refused to put him on the liver transplant list because ""he said he was an alcoholic"", even though my brother was completely incoherent when I brought him in and incapable of lucid speech.

After a week of my family screaming at them that he wasn't an alcoholic and please just *CHECK*, they gave him a liver biopsy, which proved that his liver failure wasn't due to alcohol.   Then they started moving their ass, but by then it was too late.   He died 48 hours later.

"If you have a loved one in the hospital, stay on top of everything that’s happening.  I saw a weekend doctor come in and remove my mom’s lung drainage tube (extremely painful, especially for a weak cancer patient just out of surgery and near death) her situation worsened, only for the real doctor to come in Monday and say that never should have happened and she put the tube back in (extreme pain again) becaise her lungs were filling up. 

I saw a nurse give my dad no pain medication right after he had heart surgery and had a wound on his chest from a quadruple bypass.  He said he saw black and thought he was dying the whole time. I never should have trusted what that nurse told me when she claimed the doctor said no opioid pain meds.  Again, when we finally asked somebody else, turns out he was totally supposed to be on heavy meds.  The nurse was either incredibly dumb or a junkie stealing meds.  I don’t think she even got fired.  Never should have trusted these people. 

These situations were both at Centennial about 7 years ago.  I’ll never just blindly trust somebody in a hospital again without doing my due dilligence and asking questions. They’ll act like you’re annoying and they’ll talk down to you.  Fuck them.  

Also old folks homes are horrible.  I really feel sorry for patients who have no family to look after things, because these people don’t give a flying fuck for the most part in my experience. Richland was great for my grandmother to live in the assisted wing, but once they move them to the hospice wing it’s atrocious. There is an old asshole who looks like Santa Claus who handles them rough and is a complete dick.  Both sides of my family dealt with him.  My grandmother and my mom got treated like complete ass there.

"The word itself is very racist, the plant is called cannabis, “marijuana” has roots in Mexican Spanish, possibly meaning 
“prisoner” - and is now well understood to have been used to trigger xenophobic responses in the white voting majority for political means. Evidence of that can be seen by the fact that they chose the feminine form of the word marihuana, which I presume is so that those who oppose it could also pronounce it. 

I also agree with you that the road conditions are not funding related, and hopefully this was just a weird tangent OP wanted to bring up as cannabis is - by design - a hot button topic to spur the democratic base to the polls. They’re well within reason to be outraged because it’s so silly, but it likely won’t be resolved for a long time.

I also agree that anything with psychoactive properties is a drug (tea, alcohol, cannabis, etc)

"> From what I understand, based on how these products are made, it effectively just bans the products all together.

I'm going to bullet point this because it's so hard to explain:

-The [Federal] Farm Bill of 2018 made any hemp product containing less that 0.3% *THC legal

-In the bill *THC is defined as **exclusively ""Delta-9 THC.""** I don't know if that was an error or ignorance or somebody smart sneaking something by.

-The hemp industry recognized that **Delta-8** is still legal as long as it is derived from a legal hemp plant (as defined above), and found a way to isolate **Delta-8** from legal hemp. That process is outside my knowledge. To make **Delta-8** flower, they spray **Delta-8** on hemp flower (from my understanding). The gummies and tinctures/concentrates are much more popular than the spray-on flower.

-Shitstain's (Lamberth's) bill aims to limit **Delta-8** to 0.3% in Tennessee even though Federal law only restricts **Delta-9** to 0.3%. This would make **Delta-8** worthless in TN.

-**Delta-8** is about 1/3 to 1/2 as affective as **Delta-9**, so a 5mg **Delta-9** gummy from Colorado is ABOUT as affective as a 10-15mg **Delta-8** gummy. Effects may be slightly different based on the individual.

"Last year Michigan - and I’m picking Michigan specifically because it’s _not_ a tourist destination just to show you how much it helps even places that don’t have major tourist travel, whereas TN could more aptly be compared to CO for tourist figures - Michigan took in $172MM in total taxes and fees to the state for legal cannabis. Of that, $49MM went to schools and another 49 to the state transportation fund for roads and bridges. [Citation](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2022/03/24/how-much-money-is-your-city-getting-from-michigans-marijuana-tax-revenue/)

Can you please explain to me how an additional $50MM specifically allocated for roads and bridges does _not_ help better maintain roads and bridges? The proposed 22-23 budget for the state allots $620MM to TDOT. Are you actually saying that an additional conservative ballpark of 8% would not help that? More funding means more resilient road materials, higher income for TDOT employees, and overall better maintenance. How could it not?

Your narrow view of the benefits of cannabis legalization seem to have blinded you to what a large industry it creates in states that legalize it. The effects of that sort of tax income funneled to state works and communities would absolutely be palpable.",t2_6niz3,alexthealex,0,1648231449.0,0,t1_i23eomj,i23eomj,False,RevolutionaryMeet512,t3_tnnmru,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/tnnmru/wretched_pothole_season_leads_tdot_to_create_task/,Wretched pothole season leads TDOT to create task force to investigate asphalt,/r/nashville/comments/tnnmru/wretched_pothole_season_leads_tdot_to_create_task/i23eomj/,15,r/nashville,0,15

Berkshire Hathaway is an ""investment vehicle"".  Anybody worried that Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffett's company) won't be here 20 years from now?   My BRK.B stock is up 23% in the last 3 months.   And the longer you hold an investment, the more money you make.

Bitcoin is *speculation*, little different from buying a lottery ticket.   Whether you win or not depends largely on *when* you buy, not *how long* you hold.   Maybe its here in 20 years, probably it isn't though, it'll be dead just like Flooz and Beenz.    Yeah, it does have some ""legit"" uses, but not enough to warrant a valuation in the trillions.

"I've been wanting to talk about this actually. I spent quite a few years living in Murfreesboro and the neighborhoods and schools were a lot more mixed. I had tons of black classmates and neighbors. 

When I moved to Nashville I instantly noticed a weird segregation where white/Asian people were in one place and black/Hispanic in another without a whole lot of mixing. 

Also an ATL comment, I've visited close to 20 times and I noticed a weird racial strife there between blacks and whites, hard to quantify but it was a vibe. 

Back to Nashville, my take right now is that cities are basically middle class young ppl, upper middle class 40+ ppl, and poor ppl. Nashville is increasingly pushing poor ppl out. 

Suburbs at least Murfreesboro are much more all income brackets excluding the very wealthy. Black people overall didn't seem any poorer than white people there to me, it's just that poor white ppl tended to live in the country.

My current take is Nashville's lack of mixing is an income one driven by institutional racism that leads to more poor black people. 

It does feel really weird here when all of the service workers and most black, when in Murfreesboro the race is more mixed.",t2_jn1e273p,dirty_sun_breather,0,1648222927.0,0,t1_i22so1f,i22so1f,False,chidozinho,t3_tnc6u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/tnc6u4/how_are_my_fellow_black_nashville_residents/,How are my fellow black Nashville residents feeling about the city at the moment?,/r/nashville/comments/tnc6u4/how_are_my_fellow_black_nashville_residents/i22so1f/,10,r/nashville,0,10

"No worries. I got confused at first too. SB1767/HB1690 endorsed by the Grower's Coalition was introduced by two GOP legislators, Chris Hurt and Frank Niceley. I've seen that one of them is a member of the Coalition, but neither is listed on their member page, so I'm not sure.

This bill aims for better regulation for Delta-8 products, specifically, via putting wholesalers of hemp-derived cannabinoids at a higher tax rate (6.6% with tobacco), sellers of delta products to be licensed by the State, and makes the sale of products uniformly regulated under the Prevention of Youth Access to Tobacco, Smoking Hemp, and Vapor Products Act.

HB1927 is by William Lamberth, the shitstain in question (Republican representing Sumner County who looks like a Repbulican that represents Sumner County), and seeks to ban all cannabinoid products over .3% THC concentration on dry weight. From what I understand, based on how these products are made, it effectively just bans the products all together. 

I'll go ahead and say, I was a liberal arts major so the exact science of this goes over my head, if someone more well-versed wants to ELI5 on that front.

Interestingly, it seems State Legislation is trying to make the contents of this bill (and its Senate companion [SB1904](https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB1904&GA=112)) very tough to find. The Legislature entry for [this bill](https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB1927) has not been updated with a summary of either the bill text or the fiscal summary. I was able to find [this copy](https://altnuxt-wp-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/sites/4/2022/03/22134033/HB-1927-Amended.pdf) of the bill through a WBIR report out of Knoxville.

The Growers Coalition is also [endorsing](https://tngrowerscoalition.com/hot-oil-bill) Rep. Hurt's Hot Oil Bill ([HB0715](https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB0715)), which protects manufacturers that produce a cannabinoid product with higher than the .3% THC concentration by allowing them to process their product further to remediate the problem. It seems like its a common-sense bill that most other THC-legal states have already adopted in their codes. It looks like its companion by Senator Niceley has already passed the Senate unanimously.",t2_6nhu76t6,heyybailey,0,1648221679.0,0,t1_i22phdr,i22phdr,False,heyybailey,t3_tn1oxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/tn1oxh/call_to_action_form_letter_to_state_reps_to_keep/,Call to Action - Form Letter to State Reps to keep Delta-8 Legal and Available,/r/nashville/comments/tn1oxh/call_to_action_form_letter_to_state_reps_to_keep/i22phdr/,2,r/nashville,0,2

I'd like to add a bit as a young black man. I was born and raised in nashville (East Nashville specifically) and my grandparents have lived here for decades with their house originally costing less than 20k. As many know the cost in urban areas have been through the roof with more people coming to nashville as the next big city in the south. I'm happy that growth is coming to the city but it seems to be at the cost of alot of the locals both young and old and maybe even the soul of the city. The old people are being pushed out as prices increase with both housing and property taxes. Young people are also disheartened as the place they once wanted to have a family at is slowly becoming out of reach unless you either have a high pay job or already with money prepared. Not to mention our already bad school system does not seem to get any better as the standards increase. My hope is that some of the revenue will be given back to these communities in the places that matter. I can't blame new people on these issues as they just want a better life just like everyone else. Nashville has always been a diverse place and I would hope that it will continue to be a place of culture and not just a city that has lost what made it so great.,t2_10cir1,NeoThaHero,0,1648221046.0,0,t1_i22nwi3,i22nwi3,True,chidozinho,t3_tnc6u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/tnc6u4/how_are_my_fellow_black_nashville_residents/,How are my fellow black Nashville residents feeling about the city at the moment?,/r/nashville/comments/tnc6u4/how_are_my_fellow_black_nashville_residents/i22nwi3/,72,r/nashville,0,72

"Def, the National Museum of African American music is right near Bridgestone and amazing. You can grab a quick lunch somewhere at 5th + Broadway which is like a large shopping center that's very open air and cool stuff. I recommend a pizza from Slim & Husky's spot they have there. Tennessee State Museum is also 100% free and cool and you can park in the parking lot it shares with the Farmers Market and hit the market when you are done at the museum or if you need a break (you can come and go from the museum as you please since it's free) and grab some lunch there too. Other cool things are the Parthenon and the little art museum they have inside. Take cash. Pre-pandemmy it was cash only but only like $12 and it's a full scale replica of the parthenon in greece. You could also hit the Ryman for a tour during the day.

I would recommend pulling up google maps, putting in the spots you want to go, and using the thingy that lets you change the time of day you plan on going to said places then estimating the time from there to Bridgestone. 

Like Bridgestone to Seoul Garden and vice versa will likely be ~30-40+ minutes between 3:30-6:30ish. We have gnarly rush hour traffics so be sure to be mindful of that.

>What Are Some Examples of Regressive Taxes?
The burden of a tax results from both the design of a tax and the true economic burden of a tax. Regressive taxes are often flat in nature, meaning that the same rate of tax applies (generally) regardless of income. These taxes include most sales taxes, payroll taxes, excise taxes, and property taxes.

>Because the same rate of tax applies regardless of one’s income, a lower-income individual may face a higher tax burden than a higher-income individual with the same amount of consumption.

"Honestly, it's probably not coordinated. They're still competing with each other. It's a matter of supply and demand. Housing supply has tightened up because people were less likely to move (downsize) during the pandemic, supply chain problems led to sky high construction costs, etc. On the demand side, remote work has driven a lot of people to want more space in their homes in order to have a home office. There have also been shifts in where people want to live. You can probably get a good deal on an apartment in Gary, Indiana, because people are leaving, but you're not going to find it in Nashville.

We're also seeing a spill-over effect of the single family home housing market. Those homes have gotten hard to come by, for many of the same reasons listed above, which means more people are looking to rent.

I'll also add one more unpopular opinion - in its infinite economic wisdom, the current administration in Washington put in place bans on evictions. Unfortunately, some people have taken advantage of this by not paying rent for the last year, despite still having their jobs.

Landlords are going to charge whatever the market rate is. Mortgages have very little to do with it. Nobody knew 3 years ago that the housing market would go through the roof. If the pandemic had caused a massive long recession, those same landlords would have been in big trouble, especially with government mandates preventing them from even removing unpaying tenants.
