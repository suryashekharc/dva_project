"I know it wasn't your analogy, but you said it works in your favor and tried to pretend it did, of course I've been to a doctor and the experts should know best so why would I try to tell them what I need fixed??

That was my bad about the agenda comment, I saw your reply and someone agreed with you talking about an agenda being pushed and thought it was you.

 Notice the quotes around ""have a say"" it's people like you twisting it like that, it's not ""I want to know what my kids are learning and I can encourage them to add more stuff to their curriculum"" it's more of ""I don't believe they should be learning that despite it being true and helpful in life"". 

There has been multiple laws proposed in other states where teachers can get fined for teaching certain subjects, like stuff that goes against the bible, racism, LGBT, socialism, or even speaking negatively of Nazis (indiana). This tweet is definitely about parents wanting laws in place so they can control their child's education to make it fit their beliefs, not about being apart of their education in a beneficial way.

Tbh I don't even think the ""move to private schools or home school"" is a valid opinion because by changing the education from what everyone gets to something else, you are most likely hurting them in the long run. Alot of private schools don't teach alot of sex ed and throwing grown adults into society without knowing how everything works down there is a problem. 

Majority of things taught in schools are facts. Yeah some teachers will give their opinion and I think kids having healthy decisions would be smart in schools but what ""say in my kids education"" do you want other than going again these facts.

And yeah, the left. Known for such governments such as communism and socialism, where the people own everything and help everyone, don't care for the left and the right who claim being poor is a mindset and that they're just making bad decisions really want what's best for them.

It’s not my medical analogy it was the person I was responding to.  If you take your kid to the doctor you absolutely have a say in their care.  I’m guessing you aren’t a parent and/or have never been to a doctor.  Can you point out where i said anything about schools pushing an agenda or the rest of your soap box rant that has little to do with the topic at hand.  Read her tweet again if you need to.   Her point is that if you want to have a say in your child’s education you should send them to private school or home school. So tax paying parents should pay more for private school if they want to have a say in their child’s education?   What if they can’t afford it?   Does the luxury of having a say in your child’s education only belong to those who can afford it?   No surprise I guess from the intolerant left….

"The way the past two years has gone I'm fairly certain a majority of Americans don't think they do.

For the past two years people have labeled anyone not willing to wholeheartedly blindly follow government and pharmaceuticals as a conspiracy nutjob, people have literally advertised and celebrated that they were cutting out family members and friends for not wearing a mask, social media has silenced, suspended and banned anyone that was a skeptic, the news called them racist, selfish, ignorant, and blamed them for prolonging the ""pandemic""

Here we are today... our Governments and Health Organizations agree cloth masks do nothing, lockdowns cause suicide spikes in pre-teens, the vaccine isn't effective or safe and requires quarterly boosters, SCOTUS ruled the jabs unconstitutional, WHO warns us of vaccine involved AIDS, the inventor of the mRNA vaccine tells us the dangers of mass vaccine campaigns.

Your translation is scary but accurate.  I genuinely want to have a conversation with anyone who defends this nonsense.  All they do is downvote though and don’t say anything.   Apparently Ms Snodgrass thinks the taxes parents pay aren’t enough for them to have a say in their child’s education and they need to pay for private school if they want to have the luxury of having a voice.   Of course in her scenario of home schooling or private school if you want a say in your child’s education you will still need to pay taxes to the public schools.

There are many places to play Mahjong online. The first is Tenhou, but it is all in Japanese. There are browser extensions that translate some of the words. There is also a site Mahjong Soul. I play there quite a bit, though it is geared towards the Japanese obsessed American culture.  

I would start with the link posted above, it does a good job. I got better at just playing it and then you will want to learn the combinations of hands. One good print out: [https://worldriichi.org/s/WRC\_Yaku\_1\_5\_3.pdf](https://worldriichi.org/s/WRC_Yaku_1_5_3.pdf)

">Appleton is less homophobic and more racist. That's the hidden truth. 

Until fairly recently, Appleton and the Fox Cities were *very* predominantly white and Hmong. Over the last thirty years or so, more and more black, Latino, and (non-Hmong) Asian people have moved here, and the racism bit is *slowly* improving. Prejudiced people become less prejudiced when they spend time with people from whatever demographic they're prejudiced against. As residents end up spending more time in the company of other groups, at least *some* of these issues should continue to improve.

Edit: something else I remembered, Wisconsin used to have *a lot* of sundown towns

>I lived here 31 years. Spent 14 additional living in Minneapolis. Waaaaay different level of acceptance and culture out there compared back when I moved in 99. When I came back in 2014, the fox valley mellowed out quite a bit.

P.s. I don't mean she understands what she's doing, but an adopted girl likely has grown up quickly and learned how to manipulate issues. You also mention the parents argue? This girl is looking for attention. I feel bad for you, but also this girl. I really hope you find a solution. Might be better if your partner is female and she can go talk to the mom?

"God is fake, ancient people wanted something to believe in to explain what was unexplainable to them.

There is 0 evidence Jesus of Nazareth ever existed. There is 0 evidence Moses ever existed. Historical records show that the Jews were never enslaved by the Egyptians. The Bible contradicts itself so regularly that even the source material of Christianity is unreliable. 

Everything about Christianity is a copy of older religions. God as you know it comes from Judaism. Jesus comes from the Helcenic religions and mimics the entire life of Dionysus who is 2,000 years older than Jesus. 

God the creator of the universe and savior of all mankind only showed himself to a small nation in the Middle East 2,000 years ago and never again? 

I studied latin, memorized word for word all four series of the Baltimore catechism, served as the MC in the nations largest pilgrimage Latin mass for 6 years, and was preparing for seminary. Was a regular speaking guest of the Marian Hour the countries most popular radio rosary broadcast for a decade. 

And everything I know, and everything I've learned... God is not real and the popularization of religion was strictly to control people. Governments weren't effective at maintaining order and controlling populaces in areas that they did not reside or have a strong presence so they needed religion to control those people. This is why ancient empires always work so closely with the church. 

Now governments and law are much more effective and we've separated Church from State because the church is no longer needed to control those people because the law is so effective.

"Have you thought about switching careers? I'm looking into Salesforce myself. Yeah CO is really expensive. I wouldn't be able to live here if it weren't for my partner being in tech. The weather (minus the summer) is really nice here for sure - so mild! I'm glad you were able to enjoy it for the time you have been here. 

Yeah the housing prices are what got me looking into Appleton. I couldn't believe how affordable they were and they looked really nice too (not run down like a lot of cheaper cities). I would like to retire early if possible and I don't need a lot of things I'm finding, even though I'm from a large city. I care about grocery stores, libraries, parks, some natural areas, trees, coffee shops. I have heard Door County is nice and it looks like Appleton isn't far from the UP either.

We are looking at the upper Midwest since we don't think CO is the best place for climate change (drought & wildfires). Appleton is actually in the Great Lakes Basin as well.

"Hey!  I think the heart of the matter is that I simply didn’t set myself up well in life to live in any area outside of my regional company I worked for back in Appleton.  

The cost of living is a bit more here in Colorado, but again, it was my own responsibility for not putting myself in a position to be able to better afford my family and myself being able to live here.  But otherwise, CoSprings is quite lovely and I wish I would’ve came to a more positive conclusion about this place earlier.  The weather this time of the year will be missed greatly when I’m back in Appleton this time next winter.  Being able to be out in a thin shirt in the afternoons in January and feel perfectly comfortable has been amazing!  Just as it had been to enjoy all the trails and such here, too.

Depending on how much you love being in a bigger Metro area like Denver, you might find Appleton to be a boring, but that all comes down to individual tastes and temperament, but… if you’re selling a house in the Denver area and buying in Appleton, you should be able to set yourself up very nicely financially as houses seem to be about 1/2 to 1/3 less in Appleton versus CO these days.  And there is trails and nature stuff to do, nothing as exciting as ascending a mountain and jogging down a switchback… although some lakeshore views (Door County) can still take your breath away in awe in a different manner.

Hopefully you enjoy your stay if you go, Wisconsinites are an interesting brand of people, some find us creepy levels of kind and others like the culture quite a bit.

"Yes it's just hype and if you don't realize that you're a buffoon.

The lady deleted her comment because she didn't know the CDC allows vaccinated people sick with covid to come back to work.

People get sick from covid, the flu, the common cold, it happens it's no cause for alarm.

Also check your facts.. hospitals aren't overwhelmed they're understaffed. And they're understaffed because we terminated a good portion of workers for not being vaccinated.

If you'd stop watching CNN or sitting in your echo chamber of regurgitation sensationalized news you would realize you got caught up in the hype.

Hospitalization figures are no higher than any other year... Unless you count last year the peak of covid was actually our lowest hospitalization rate in the last 20 years. 

But, you were led to believe things were bad last year and you believed it... The reality was it was our least hospitalized year in the longest time. 

Chris Cuomo from CNN after he got fired even made a public statement that CNN was intentionally hyping up covid to scare people because they wanted to get Donald Trump out of office...

"I grew up near Appleton, in a town called Harrison , on the N shore of Lake Winnebago. I went to West HS. I’m currently living in West Hollywood, but have been back numerous times - my parehts still have their home there. 

I would say Appleton is a tad more conservative than it is liberal, but it has changed A Lot m, for the better since the 9o’s LOL. Some areas are almost completely unfamiliar like Darboy and the North side. 

There are many great areas to live in the Fox Cities. But my least favorite is Menasha, or as friends used to call it… Metrasha LOL . 

The towns along the Eastern shore of Winnebago are small but are gorgeous in the summer- Sherwood, chilton , hilbert. 

The school system is great & it’s pretty safe everywhere. My least fav part of Appleton is near West HS , maybe it’s just old memories but I find it depressing. My fav part is along the river but those homes are probably the most expensive in the city. Neenah has some gorgeous homes as well by the Bergstrom museum .

A lot of people drink heavily and live the Packers. But 97% of people in WI are very nice, and even strangers will have conversations with you - not like LA lol.

Just make sure to have a very warm jacket, an ice scraper, snow tires, and stick up on mosquito repellent- they were absolutely brutal this past summer.

There are plenty of nice gyms in the area… crunch gym , planet fitness, lake park fitness and tons a f great parks. High cliff is awesome as well. 

In the summer it’s fun to take the SS badger in manitowoc over to MI. I’d recommend checking out crystal lake in MI for a vacation - it’s absolutely stunning.

Lake Winnebago is nice for kayaking on a calm day , but it can get very green and stinky . Like really stinky .

"I’ve lived in northeast and east-central Wisconsin almost all of my almost-65 years. Our family moved to Appleton in December 1985.

I concur with most (not all) of the comments and observations here. But I’m a little surprised by seeing only one comment about the influence of drinking.

For a few decades, I was in a position for hiring workers, often from outside the area. Without fail, when I asked “outside” applicants and new “outside” hires about their impressions, they said in so many words: “I’ve never seen a place that drinks this much.”

That is a fact. Wisconsin, in general, and the Fox River Valley (generally, Oshkosh to Green Bay), in particular, revolves around the accessibility of alcohol. Over our 36 years in Appleton and the Fox Cities (the cluster of communities including Appleton as the hub), we’ve certainly seen how to be responsibly involved in that culture and how to avoid that culture. So, yes, if you’re not into it, you’ll be fine.

But just know it’s there, it’s prevalent, it’s the basis for many community events.

In terms of diversity, without doing a statistical comparison of the Fox Cities vs. Sacramento, it’s a safe bet to say this area isn’t close to what you’re used to. That said, when we moved here, Appleton was 97 percent white. Today, that figure is around 89-90 percent, which is significantly different from what it was, but still won’t be what you’re used to seeing.

School systems are great. Community leadership is strong. The business community leans to the right, in my opinion, and the comment by someone else about Wisconsin’s political climate is spot-on — it’s the worst I’ve seen in my lifetime.

Opportunities for sports, academic and cultural growth for kids are major focuses for these communities. Not unlike many communities around the nation, finding a way to prioritize a kid’s out-of-school time is a major challenge. 

When we moved here, I thought we’d be in Appleton for five years, then move on to a major metropolitan area. In short order, we discovered that it really is a wonderful place to raise a family, build a career and live a productive and happy life. 

That doesn’t mean we don’t have issues. It’s not as safe as it was. We do have addiction issues with drugs and alcohol. Wisconsin’s reputation as a political battleground is accurate and deserved, and if you take a ride around rural Wisconsin, the proliferation of Trump signs (for 2020 and beyond) will be an eye-opener.

We probably do not have everything you might be accustomed to in a metro area of 250K or so. But we’re not all that far from other, larger metro areas, and we do have a good airport in Appleton and another one 25 miles away in Green Bay, if you need an escape.

Does it snow? Sure, and I also recommend that a snowblower be among your first purchases. But, like a lot of things in this discussion, it’s relative. Last winter was mild here by upper-Midwest standards, unlike the 250-300 inches of snow that the northernmost part of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula often gets.

Oh, by the way, the influence of the Green Bay Packers can be a bit much to handle. From August to late January, much of life revolves — in one way or another — around when the team plays, how it plays, when it’s on TV/radio, how it’s perceived, etc. I know that sounds weird, maybe, but it’s true.

I’d say you and your family could do a lot worse than making this your home.

"Agree with you on all of the negatives. I’m a native but lived in LA and Manhattan for many years. Quite a few people here are suspicious of the “coastal elites.”  Definitely a lot of consumers of Faux News.

The biggest plus is the variety of outdoor pursuits. Walking, hiking, camping, fishing, birdwatching, etc. A week at a lakeside cabin in the Northwoods in the summer is a must.

The health care is adequate but nothing to brag about. There are some good basic practitioners, but few choices for specialists. Many people go to Milwaukee, Madison, or Mayo Clinic (Minnesota) for specialists or surgery. This is a big negative for me. I was accustomed to having many choices as far as hospitals, docs, specialists, academic medical centers. I knew what I was getting into when I moved back here, but top-notch health care is still one of the things I miss the most.

I have friends here whose toddler has major medical problems. After driving to Milwaukee once a week for 18 months, they finally moved there so she could have the medical care she needs close at hand.

That said, I think it will suit a family with young children very well.

"I'm from a liberal east coast town. I've lived here almost three years with a pit-stop in Milwaukee in between. 

No kids so I can't comment on that stuff, but my co-workers are doing stuff with their kids all the time. 

My impression is that Outagamie County is solidly conservative and Appleton leans liberal but not by much. I've had no issues as a liberal. State politics though is an absolute shit show. Completely ineffective and self-serving conservatives have gerrymandered themselves a lock on power. 

People won't dislike you because you're from CA. That is if you're not what midwesterers think people from CA are like. If you're friendly and down to earth, you'll be fine. 

As others have said, small city. But from Oshkosh to Green Bay there's hundreds of thousands of residents. Other than Trader Joes, I've not really missed anything up here. And if you can't find it here Milwaukee and Madison are both less than two hours away. 

I'm a local defense attorney, and other than some seedier hotels and apartment complexes, I can't think of any really high crime areas off the top of my head. A local real estate agent will know which areas to avoid. At my first Appleton address, I wouldn't have wanted to live two blocks to the south, but, my place was perfectly fine. 

Haven't had a great taco here, but with our Hmong population, there's very good egg rolls and other Asian food everywhere. Mai's Deli and Bowl 91 are awesome. Alcohol is pervasive and part of the culture in Wisconsin, so be aware of that. Lots of bars, great breweries, but some people are proud of their OWIs (DUI).

"So I can not stress how wonderful Appleton is and how it is growing! I grew up in Appleton and always thought that it was this small town with not much going on.....So after high school, I went to the Chicago area and from there I moved to Minneapolis. Appleton can offer you anything that you would get in a big city minus the nightclubs. I feel like you should know that while Appleton is nice our area is more known as the Fox Valley (Everything from Appleton to Oshkosh) Each area is a little different but they are all very nice places and each deserves to be looked at! With that being said the things you are able to do within a 30 min drive of Appleton are as follows....Greenbay Packers, several malls, 2 performing arts centers, plenty of parks, lake Winnebago/Michigan, bay beach amusement park, high cliff state park, massive biking trails, and lots lots more. I guess a good way to describe Appleton is.......Kids ride their bikes to the local corner store with no parents around and then go hang out in the park or down by the river or on the ave!

"Hi!  We moved from chico a little over a year ago to Appleton.  Our son is 2 years old.  I love love all the things we can do with our son, like parks, swimming, zoo, children museum..we bought a house that would probably be over 450g in chico for half the price lol.  We are liberal, so you just have to get used to all the trump signs but other than that, I feel pretty good still being a liberal here…. But here’s what I hate
..no kincare..if my son is sick, oh well, that’s an occurrence..so that sucks (my husband and I both work)
…I hate to say it, but sometimes I feel people aren’t nice here…don’t get me wrong, they are nice, but just sometimes they are mean

….doctors- I had a great one in chico but here, i haven’t found any with great bedside manner who I really can trust…plus, for any reason your in pain..suck it up!  Doctors won’t give you anything out here!   Pediatrician wise, I  have t found the “one” yet but I feel pretty okay about peds out here 
…..people are not laid back as they were in chico.  Like back in chico, my job was laid back, felt super supported by my co workers/friends..it felt great..here I have the same exact job and it’s completely different, not laid back, don’t feel supported, etc..I would say people in wisconsin work hard! Lol

Back in Cali I was see the sunset rise and fall over the mountains…so I thought sunset and sunrises would suck here (no mountains) but they are gorgeous!  I love the sunrises and sunsets here

"Hey there. I moved here from California about three years ago. I attended UC Davis, so I wasn’t too far from Sacramento!

Appleton is a really nice place to raise a family if you ask me, but there are some things I am not a fan of and a couple of things I had to adjust to. Some people may not agree with me on these points. Now, speaking comparatively, these points are (and they are not in order of importance):

1. Not a whole lot of diversity. It wasn’t the end of the world, but it was almost a little bit of a culture shock for me.

2. Having stated point #1... There are not a lot of great or authentic ethnic food choices around. I’m still on the hunt for a great taco. Lol.

3. The area isn’t THAT conservative, but it’ll feel like that at first. I would compare it to the politics of the Central Valley/Fresno Area in case you are at all familiar.

4. I got a lot of shit for being from California when I got here and I still do. Sometimes I’ll overhear others rag on the state. It used to bother me a lot, but now I’m used to it. My biggest issue with the comments was that most of these people have never been to California or they only visited a place like LA or SF. Therefore, I thought a good amount of the comments or opinions were a little unfair and unsubstantiated.

5. This was just annoying. Not a big deal by any means, but I got tired of Appleton being referred to as a big city. Lol. Like I said, comparatively, it’s small. That took some adjusting. On the bright side, given its size, there is a nice sense of community and traffic is non-existent. Even when traffic is at its worse (maybe when the Packers are playing at home), it feels like driving on I-80 after work.

6. THERE AREN’T ANY FENCES HERE. I can’t wrap my head around this. My backyard was private. No one else could see what I was doing back there. I also had a white pickett fence. Very few homes around here have those type of enclosures. To me, it feels like I don’t have a sense of privacy.

Now for the positives:

1. I still lock my steering wheel, but you could leave a purse in an unlocked running car and NOTHING would happen. It’s incredibly safe. I am still in disbelief by how safe it is.

2. As I mentioned earlier, there is a great sense of community here. Lots of great people! Lots of great organizations! I can’t remember the source off the top of my head, but Wisconsin is the state with the third or second highest rate of volunteering in the nation. I would be willing to bet that that is heavily due to the activity in this area.

3. I thinks it’s easy to stay in shape around here! Lots of neat little trails and parks around to stay active outside.

4. The cost of living is super nice. It’s definitely gone up since I moved here, mainly since COVID became a thing. 

5. Say hello to a lower car insurance bill.

6. The schools and hospitals are much better! Say goodbye to long wait times at a walk in clinic.

Lastly, I’d advise you to give some great consideration to the state’s weather in the winter. I knew that it gets very cold and that it snows here, but I was not prepared for what I experienced. I was pretty down my first winter here and I was inside quite a bit (due to a combination of not enjoying the cold and being lonely). I’ve met people that were seriously affected by SAD to the point that they left after their first winter. There are a handful of recreational activities to do in the winter that can help combat some issues.

DrIving in the snow is another challenge. You learn relatively fast and it won’t be hard if you are a safe and attentive driver. I personally despise it though.",t2_gsprlnbc,Siberianiberian,0,1641114676.0,0,t1_hqx0e1x,hqx0e1x,True,BelleCow,t3_ru27xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appleton/comments/ru27xw/thinking_about_moving_to_appleton/,Thinking About Moving To Appleton,/r/Appleton/comments/ru27xw/thinking_about_moving_to_appleton/hqx0e1x/,21,r/Appleton,0,21

"I'd say Appleton is almost evenly split down the line on politics. Maybe just a little to the right. For sure the surrounding smaller cities lean right more. Honestly haven't heard many political issues between neighbors in news or in general. But the area around College ave/Lawrence University is pretty liberal just based on yard signs, I live in that area near City Park and it's great for my toddler kids. I'd avoid the North side or the area around Appleton North Highschool as that is definitely more suburbs with not many shops/activities. I have few friends who live there, so could be younger family if that is what you are looking for. As far as activities go for kids, obviously got the parks, some good walking trails down by the river, Building for Kids and trampoline parks. Obviously not as much as like Sac or bigger cities like in MN. School systems are fine, I think Edison Elementary has it where it's a smaller class size of like 10-15 kids, so more focus there. Heck, my friends and I went through the system and turned out fine lol. All got good paying jobs.

"I visited Appleton recently.  I would move there in a heartbeat.  Clean city, plenty of clean production plants so local economy is good, fantastic county and state parks, etc. They also have the big airshow every year which is so fun..

I don't think it's very liberal as it's historically a dairy farming community at its roots, and there's one of those large mega-church type churches and a subdivision around it so you would probably not want to live in that subdivision, but otherwise I mostly enjoy outdoors and don't sit around talking politics these days anyway.  Wisconsin leans just a ""tad"" liberal but appleton and Outagamie County leans a ""tad"" conservative from middle.

The health facilities are very good as well (hospital systems, etc.)

Only reason I'm not there is the cold. I'm not much for cold weather but people there are very outdoorsy and if you learn to dress correctly (in layers) you and your kids can have a great time.  going out on ice to fish, snowshoeing, hiking, etc.   In summer kayaking, etc.   since it's on one of the Lakes.   I might just end up there after all, since I love nature.

As for being outsiders, that's any town esp. if small, but appleton is *large enough* that I think you will not feel that way.   When I was there before covid there was a great street taco place, and even a few boba (bubble) tea places, there's a birkenstock store, and a wonderful tea company called fava where they have their own blends.   I mean it's still the midwest, so it's not west coast ya know?   University towns like Madison would be more liberal leaning, but that is true even in lawrence kansas (also a LOVELY town if you're looking! )

"This may come across as rude, but why would someone work for that doing manufacturing work?  The damn Walmart warehouse by Beaver Dam pays $25.  Tyson pays $23.  Kwik Trip pays $16.

A $3000 sign on is nice at first, but for a $10/hour wage difference it's only 300 hours, a couple months of work, before you break even and are losing money.

"Oriental food Mart (wisc and Richmond) had candy and snacks and a small selection of dried goods/condiments. Oriental food market (wisc and division) has a different but not consistent selection of dried goods (curry packs, mirin, kewpie, etc). If you need some ingredients, Free Market usually has some things like Kombu and katakuriko, but it might be white people brands. 

If you want kashipan or fresh ingredients, mitsuwa is your best bet, although your butcher might be willing to do thin sliced meats and you can get some close equivalents to Japanese veggies at the farmers market.

Global market in Madison has a bit better selection of Japanese stuff than here in the valley, but not really worth the drive just for that.

If you just need dry goods and snacks, it's probably cheaper to order from Amazon or dainobunyc.com than to drive down to mitsuwa (not that it's not a fun trip...
