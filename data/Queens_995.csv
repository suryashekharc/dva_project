"Queens native that moved to LIC after starting to work - would agree with a lot of the comments here. It’s “young professional” not “young, dive bar fun” (which is where Astoria fits in). I really love living here (subway access is pretty incredible, ferry, parks, views, breweries) but it is a more “tame” vibe. I’ve lived here for a few years and I have noticed the vibe get a little older (early to mid 30s, seeing more strollers and young kids < 5). It’s not EXCLUSIVELY a family neighborhood though (looking at you, Forest Hills). You’ll definitely get a lot of young professionals, less college grads.

"Just to clarify: Long Island City *is* a neighborhood in Queens. Western Queens, to be specific, and in very close proximity to Manhattan.

I know it’s confusing because of the association with Long Island. Queens and Brooklyn are both part of New York City, however, they are both *geographically* located on Long Island. Although, to make matters more confusing, Queens and Brooklyn aren’t really considered part of the Long Island “region” to native New Yorkers.

"Lol. Oh well that’s good then! You won’t have a car n I realized you want to walk around n see things. Westbury/Garden City, NY in LI has tons of bars and restaurants (on Old Country Road) but it’s only conducive to driving. The mileage seems farther but the traffic is much less than going out to Astoria which could take hours with traffic. BUT Since the pandemic I don’t know what’s “popping” anymore out there. So much has changed.

I assume you will be at a hotel right outside JFK? Based on that, go with Forest Hills (Queens). Have the Uber drop you off to 71st Continental. There are tons of restaurants and bars (not just a bunch of chain restaurants but real joints) and the bars are great and everything is in a 4 block radius all together. Plenty of choices easy to walk. It’s like a tiny Manhattan. 

I would not suggest going deeper into Queens than that- Astoria is way to far (don’t let miles fool you. Traffic nightmare. Like LA) 

Forest Hills is a direct Uber drive from JFK hotels. You’d get there with traffic in 40 mins tops and at night you’d get back to hotel in like 25 mins. 

Every cabbie knows 71st continental. For your purposes they will drop you on 71st road and Queens Blvd. Once there walk your down to Austin St…it’s half block and you’ll see all the spots. 

Tap House is my favorite bar on Austin St.  Do a specific Google of Austin St bars. Also, you’ll feel very safe there.

"Townsend harris is probably one of the best schools in Queens and in the city in general. It is ranked #1 best school in the city and #12 in the country according to usnews.com and has consistently high ranking from other websites as well. I went there (i graduated in 2020) and I will say the workload was pretty intense. It definitely prepared me for college though and I was able to transfer my AP credits and college credits from queens college, which every student takes a dual enrollment english class their senior year as long as one elective in the fall and spring semesters senior year. The school is big enough where there’s lots of variety in general elective courses to take and small enough where you can get the individual help you need from teachers. Freshman year you have to take an arts class (it could be string orchestra, visual arts, band, or chorus). Sophomore year you begin taking a classical language either Latin or Ancient Greek, which you continue taking until junior year. The curriculum overall is unique from other schools in my opinion. The one downside is that there is a VERY competitive atmosphere and mindset from a lot of the student body, which at times can be pretty discouraging. 

I think my favorite thing about this school is that I was exposed to a lot of new things. I am also latina but I was never really exposed to cultures from around the world before high school. The school is very diverse and I made lots of friends from a variety of backgrounds. I learned about my friends’ cultures/religions which I had never known about previously, which is something invaluable when it comes to being a well rounded individual. 

There is also a really large variety of student clubs and sports if you’re into that. I might be biased because it’s my alma mater but I think it’s also one of the better schools in the city in terms of safety and amount of resources available for students. High school sucks in general but I would never give up an experience like going to Townsend Harris.",t2_5sm0nzlh,intwillog,0,1646367458.0,0,t1_hz9yn2u,hz9yn2u,True,ayanodaloluwu,t3_t5y13h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Queens/comments/t5y13h/what_high_school_is_better/,What high school is better?,/r/Queens/comments/t5y13h/what_high_school_is_better/hz9yn2u/,8,r/Queens,0,8

"It depends on what you’re looking for, but I recommend Bard Queens. You would get your associates degree along with your high school diploma, which is the biggest selling point, but there are also small class sizes, an insane amount of diversity, and it’s easy to get to from most of Queens. 

There’s a great variety of courses in the college program, and even if there’s a class you want to take that isn’t offered, you can go to one of the professors and ask them to teach it (it’s called tutorials in Bard, not sure what the terminology would be elsewhere). I’m sure this is something you can do in other schools, but it’s encouraged here (and pretty common).

"Welcome to Queens! I live in Kew Gardens so feel free to dm me if you got any questions. I think it's a great neighborhood. I also have a dog and I walk her in Forest Park almost everyday, there are trails that make you feel like you are nowhere near the city. I also walk all over the neighborhood at night, it's mostly quiet. Beautiful houses in parts a well. Welcoming neighborhood (I moved in last year from a different part of Queens and everyone was greeting me it felt real old time NY).

I don't know how the commute to LI would be but the LIRR station is pretty convenient (less than 20 mins to Manhattan). If you can't get a direct ride to Farmingdale we are very close to the Jamaica LIRR station, which almost all trains pass through (except Port Washington branch). You can either take the train from Kew Gardens one stop to Jamaica or catch a bus or the J (which is just over the border in Richmond Hill), the E also goes there, which is on the northern side of the neighborhood.

There are a few restaurants, bars, and stores around but nothing too crazy. Forest Hills has a ton more and it's not far, they also have Forest Hills stadium which puts on concerts in the summer.

Oh yeah it's not far from JFK either (lots of airline workers are in the neighborhood).

"I used to live at 83rd and 118, 2 blocks from Metropolitan and like 3 blocks from Forest Park. It was very rare that I didn’t find parking within 3 blocks. People in the neighborhood are always walking dogs and it’s very family-friendly. Great Halloween decorations 1 block south. Great bagel place and bookstore on Lefferts. I loved walking the trails in the park. Neighborhood is heavily conservative Jewish, and there’s a Yeshiva at 83rd and 117. Most of the time the school is a non-issue, but occasionally they have an event that clogs the streets a little. I got to be a shabbas goy once. People are pretty friendly overall. I still go to that bagel place sometimes now, even though it’s like 20-25 mins away.

"People are hating on Jersey Mike’s here but it’s by far the best chain hoagie spot IMO. I absolutely loathe Subway for context.

Jersey Mike’s bakes the bread fresh every morning - it’s really soft, good bread.  They don’t skimp on the amount of meat/cheese they use either. 

In my experience, every Jersey Mike’s I’ve been to the customer service has been really impressive. Like they go out of their way to train their employees well and they seem to be notably friendly and kind.
