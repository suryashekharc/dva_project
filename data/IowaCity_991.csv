"Szechuan House, 320 E. Burlington St., Iowa City – During a March 4 visit, an inspector cited the establishment for 17 serious risk-factor violations and noted there was no certified food protection manager on staff and that the person in charge at the restaurant was unable to answer questions related to proper cooking and holding temperatures, handwashing and sanitizing.
Employees were observed working with raw meat and then, without washing their hands, proceeding to work on other tasks. Employees were eating in the kitchen; there was mold “on multiple heads of cauliflower” inside the walk-in cooler, and raw meat was stored in multiple locations above ready-to-eat foods.
Also, fried duck and spring rolls were sitting in a fryer basket at 95 degrees and had to be discarded; sprouts, cracked eggs, house-made soups, cooked chicken and other high-risk foods were not being held at cold enough temperatures to ensure safety; racks of ribs and pork belly were discovered hanging from hooks inside the “mechanical room” of the business; raw shell eggs were stored on a cart at 74 degrees and had to be discarded; and none of the food products in the coolers were marked with a date, with the person in charge indicating they were cooked “a number of days ago.”
Also, the dishwashing machine was not able to produce water at an adequately hot temperature; numerous “clean” knives, peelers, and slicers were that were stored throughout the kitchen had excessive food buildup on them; the meat grinder had debris inside it, even after cleaning; one handwashing sink was being used to rinse knives used for raw meats and vegetables, and another handwashing sink had a bag of items and a strainer sitting in the basin.
The inspector also reported that beef was being thawed at room temperature in a tray that sat atop a garbage can; there were no thin-tipped thermometers available for checking food temperature, and there were multiple “sticky traps” used for pest control seen throughout the kitchen.
Also, food items were stored on the floor in the dry goods storage area; there was no chlorine sanitizing solution set up at the time of the  inspection; multiple knives were stored in crevices between the coolers and the walls, with one knife wedged between a drain line and the wall; one cooler that was set at its coldest possible temperature was unable to cool below 48 degrees;  and multiple cutting boards had excessive scoring and staining, making cleaning impossible.
Random items unrelated to the restaurant business, including the trunk door to an Audi automobile, were stored in the server area and dry goods room; there was a buildup of food debris on the floor and walls; multiple missing ceiling tiles had been replaced with cardboard; and the establishment’s most recent inspection report was not posted.",t2_e1lf6c7,PaladinQuixote,0,1648070478.0,0,t1_i1ukqev,i1ukqev,False,Slight-Marketing-637,t3_tl4g3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/tl4g3b/since_china_wok_is_closing_in_iowa_city_what_are/,Since china wok is closing in Iowa city.

A Phase you might hear or see a lot on this or Iowa subreddits is ""Fuck Mediacom"" While I agree, they have in the past had a Internet and Phone Package. They might be worth looking in to.

And just to clarify why I say ""Fuck Mediacom' is from a hardware and billing issues. 

Don't rent their router. For what they charge for rent on one for a year, you can buy your own and use it for years. My router is almost 10 years old.

"the frats are there, sure, but they hardly dominate. What the university really does is literature. Home of the Writer's Workshop and all that.

I used to go recite Dostoevsky with classmates after our evening seminar in Dublin Underground, one of the dive bars, and we weren't even an especially nerdy crowd by town standards. 

Iowa City has been the center of counterculture in this area for a while, having a strong queer community (Iowa legalized gay marriage in 2006) and a history of anti-war protesting in the Vietnam era. Despite the trend of state politics, Democrats are the only ones who ever get elected to local and county office, and sometimes far-left ones at that.

A lot of people have mentioned a lot of great aspects but here are some great videos that capture a lot of what the city is and what the perceptions are. 

The city and surrounding areas are growing fast and have great local leaders plus are reliably progressive. The local retailers are strong and (and growing), good and getting better by the minute restaurants and a great parks system.

"Moved here from midtown NYC ""for two years"".  Still here, some 15 years later.  It's a great place to live, surrounded by intelligent professionals from all over the country, and an affordable lifestyle.  You will find dive bars, a few good restaurants (not enough, but, it's not a big town), and good entertainment that doesn't require pinkies raised nor tie-dye patchouli.  We live on a country road and while I am sure half of our road has opposite politics from me, we're all good neighbors who enjoy sitting around a fire with a beer every now and then, and if someone has a tree down, folks just show up with chainsaws and get it fixed together.

Locally there's a strong running and cycling scene  (in fact Iowa City hosts one of the World championship cyclocross races).  Quite a few hiking trails-- though of course nothing big enough that you'd get lost.  What we lack in mountains we make up with in rolling hills with gorgeous full-horizon vistas and a particularly beautiful quality of light. Hard to explain but somehow the light hits here differently.  [Here's some views from around our property](https://imgur.com/a/sZb7srl)  (we've got an acreage about 15mi out of town, with horses, chickens, honeybees--the kind of place you'd never ever get out east).

ETA: no traffic, at all.  Our house 15mi from town is 15 minutes from town.

Easy drive to Chicago when you need a city fix.  a 1.5hr flight to Denver (or 10hr drive on wide-open roads, totally do-able with 2 drivers) when you need a mountain fix.  Cedar Rapids airport easy to get to, and while you'll have a layover to just about anywhere you want to go, it's really nice to drive up to the airport, park for cheap, and be at your gate in about 10min after enter the parking lot.

Downsides - the bread, pizza, and bagels are terrible. Stock up before you come.  Our governor and state legislature are increasingly and shockingly terrible. It's really disheartening.

"Also spent a few years in center city of Philly before moving to Iowa city. The first thing you'll notice here is that it is generally way safer than Philly (almost anything is). Downtown IC is full of culture.

When I was in Philly, I was part of the Philly film society and I would go with friends to watch music recitals from the Curtis Institute of Music and watch shows in theaters. I would say that the Iowa city Filmscene gives us very good options as far as art films and international movies are concerned. Hancher has decent shows, and UI also has music recitals (check out their schedule).

Philly is known for pubs, but there are a lot of pubs here too. Beer selection may be limited but decent. If you're into restaurants, there are a lot of good places here too - Tribute, Goosetown Cafe, Basta, Baroncini, La Vecina, Webster, St. Burch Tavern, Maggie's Pizzeria all give east coast vibe. If you're missing Reading terminal market, we have the nearby Amana colonies for that. There's no La Colombe here, but Press coffee, Fix, and Tru coffee are probably the closest to high end coffee here. For studying, I'd always get Insomnia cookies in Philly, and fortunately for you they just opened some stores here. Also try Cookies and Dream.

And yes, as far as sports you can never run out of things to do.

The unfriendly and gruffness that comes along with Philly that everybody kind of knows. There is some parts of the city that I really did enjoy. I really liked running on Kelly drive. I’ve been in a number of different cities throughout the world and Philadelphia has the most diverse and best restaurants that we have found. I also really enjoyed the options that A big city brings. That said I don’t think I would ever wanna move back. I like Iowa city way too much to want to go back to a large city where I have to fight traffic, faces don’t have names, getting stuck on 76 because there was a car accident and just all-around craziness that the city brings.

"I would start by saying it's more difficult to compare the 2 experiences with one having been undergrad and the other grad, as the culture differences are biased toward undergrad. However, what I can attest to is Madison is definitely a more urban campus being packed into the isthmus whereas IC is more spread out which I personally prefer. Ignoring that because I was an undergrad Madison had a more fratty/sport vibe, the night life is largely the same and both cities have a good culture no matter what you're looking for dive bars, coffee shops, etc although I'd argue Madison is more ""bohemian"". I do prefer the scenery in Madison thanks to the lakes but I've always felt the faculty and staff at Iowa are a bit more connected/accessible to their students which may just be a grad student bias.

Of course if you were someone inclined to, you could experience those vibes without much effort, but as a grad student aside from when I had to TA or the occasional time I go downtown with friends, I don't interact with undergrads or undergrad culture that much.

"I went to school here and was here for 10 years before we moved to Philly for my wife’s residency at Temple. I have a skin in both games.



Things are much easier here but there is much less of good options. For example finding a good Italian sandwich is almost impossible here. There are no primo hoagies. Another example you can grocery shop in about 10 minutes parking, selecting items, paying and then going to your car. In Philly when I lived in Conshohocken this took sometimes two hours.



As many others have said this is a UNESCO city. Many prolific authors have come in through the city and some of even taught here. Fox head is where all the riders go. It’s a cool little dive bar across the street from a small bodega that used to be one of the best beer stores in the country before the huge beer culture started. There are many frat areas and bro type areas but it is nothing like Center City or Mannyunk. It is relatively easy to avoid you may just pass them on the street as you’re walking to the bar you’re looking for.



The biggest culture shock for me when we moved out there was the lack of friendliness. Here you’re going to see the exact opposite. In Philly when strangers talk to you they almost always wanted something from you. Here people will show a genuine interest in you and ask you a lot of questions about where you’re from and why you’re in town. This is especially true if you have an accent.

All in all I think you’ll really like it here, it is a small town but it has a lot of culture and a lot of different people to meet.

"This question occupies much of my time. Thank you for posting. I have been on the search for eggs with orange yolks in Iowa City for a year now. The brand Happy Egg Co has deep orange yolks and are quite delicious, but the closest store that sells them is a Walmart in Washington, Iowa. I am considering making the trip; this is how serious I am. 

I went to the Coralville Trader Joe's today to try to get their Cage Free Dark Yolks eggs but they said they do not sell them in this region, so I'm not sure where other folks are buying them, if it is around here. I bought their pasture raised eggs and the yolks are bright yellow, not orange, sadly. 

One my friends bought Hyvee Omega-3 enriched eggs and they had flourescent, hot orange yolks (stunning, really), but when I went to buy them myself (not once but twice) they had pale, sickly looking yolks. Theirs were a fluke, I guess.

Many of the free-range and pasture raised eggs I have bought at farmer's markets and coops have lovely yellow yolks, but not that deep orange color that we seek. I plan on continuing to try local eggs, especially ones on Craigslist as other users have suggested, as I know it is about the feed. Please let me know if anyone has found any for sure dark yolks they can tell me about.

"I don't know how widely available are furnished multi-month rentals, but in general Iowa city in general is a very safe place to live. There are no real bad neighborhoods.  

Anything close to downtown will have lots of students who can be noisy and the rentals are usually cruddy &  beat up. (but it's almost summer, so they'll be gone soon)

If you are willing to commute, look into Coralville and North Liberty.  

If you'll be working at UIHC parking is quite expensive, so living near a bus route would be a big cost advantage.

"I can't speak for the property management company who [lists these](https://www.nestpm.com/iowa-city-homes-for-rent), as I never rented from them, but they did buy one of the groups I did rent from. I honestly had nothing of bad experiences renting via multiple of the other different property management companies in the area. A quick search of any potential property management company's name in this subreddit should give you a sense about them.

All that said, It looks like Nest Property Management may have some in that price range and allows for dogs (depending on the size of dog). I'd expect to pay both a pet deposit and monthly pet rent on top of the listed price / deposit.

Also, finding one by April / May will be really tough as most leases run August - July in this area.

"Last time this was posted:

Webster: High end (for Iowa City) with Cote de beouff at market price (upwards of 300 dollars per cut). Mostly americana style food in a new age setting (open kitchen, modern looks etc...)

Rapid Creek: My favorite due to rotating menus and very strong flavor profiles. 1 page menu with unique options. Plus the location can't be beat especially for date night.

Baroncini: Best italian food you'll find in Iowa City. Hand made pastas, great chicken cuts and everything is true to its italian roots. Cocktails are subpar here so focus on wine.

Orchard Green: Go here if you want fish. They do a great job with their fish options and the setting is relatively quiet and datey feeling. Close to downtown so you'll be fighting the undergrads trying to go downtown.

Chez Graze: I've heard a lot of people mention this but I feel it is way overhyped and overpriced. My kobe steak with trumpet mushrooms was 120 dollars and was nothing special. My wife got a risotto that tasted middle of the road even though it was somthing like 40 dollars. I'm not a fan, however, it is very romantic and a unique experience. Look to drop at least $250 here for the two of you with drinks.

Cobble Hill: Yes, I know you didn't want to go to CR but this is our favorite restaurant in Iowa. True farm to table style. Plenty of outdoor seating. Cute indoor seating. Great cocktails.

It seems like there are new restaurants popping up often so there is usually something new to try.
