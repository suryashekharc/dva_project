It depends I suppose. Some people complain about the schools not doing enough against bullying or inadequate curriculum. My kids are thriving there. Currently there’s some childless school board members from out of town making some right wing focused changes. Catalyst which is the alt high school has been a complete godsend for my son. Those board members want to shut that down. They want to shut down our dual language emersion program and our free mental health services.

"Like the person above my comment already said, Eugene, Portland, and Bend are significantly better than Ashland especially if you're awake and want to get food somewhere past 7:00 unless you want to go to a shitty bar for some low quality pizza. Corvallis, Monmouth, and as much as I hate to say it, Salem and Albany are worlds better than Ashland. There's not much to do around here unless you're loaded and can afford to go shopping and eat out every night but other than hiking, there really isn't much. It's definitely a tourist town that also has a university in it which really doesn't make much sense why everything closes so early. Even regular stores are all closed as 5 and fast food places are closed at like 8 of which there's only two, Wendy's and taco bell. I usually don't eat at fast food places but they're nice to have around especially like after work.  Also if you bike you probably shouldn't bike here as people do not share the road well with bikers.

"Eugene/Springfield no doubt!

Many more fun things to do and places to go!  (concerts, performances/other events, local breweries ( Plank Town Brewing in Springfield is one of the best in Lane County!), museums, college sports games for the Ducks!, local restaurants (Ambrosia is one of the best!  Their calzones are out of this world good!), etc.

MUCH BETTER public transit system!

Younger demographic!  

Much more liberal which is good!

"Hey! I am in a similar situation. We moved here at the beginning of the pandemic for a job and have no roots. Here is what has been useful for us: 

* Go on lots of walks, in your neighborhood and others. We have a dog which starts tons of conversations with other people. Stop a person and ask to pet their dog if you don't have one. I have struck up conversations with people based on sports team hats/shirts they are wearing etc. too. Even brands of hiking shoe, type of bike, beer type they are looking at in the grocery store etc. I just try to put myself out there way more than I used to.

* Be forward with other people about giving/asking for numbers, especially if they reveal they have recently moved here. It feels a little weird but they may feel the same way you do and don't want to seem desperate. This is how we have made most of our friends.

It was funny, a couple months ago we were talking to our first set of friends we met here revealed they had the exact same thoughts about us after meeting us (OMG it's a young couple from out of state with a dog in our neighborhood and they don't have any friends yet...and they were worried about coming off weird that they gave us their number right away and said we should be friends).

I have done Meetup in other cities and that worked well...but it was totally dead when we moved here due to COVID, maybe it is better now?

Hope some of that is even a little bit helpful for you...it's definitely not the easiest town or time to make new friends. My spouse and I realized that is the hardest part of not being in an academic program or a job with lots of similar peers, and it's exacerbated in a smaller setting with COVID.",t2_hb142,THING_THAT_CREEPETH,0,1646328294.0,0,t1_hz7fv2z,hz7fv2z,True,Southeast-Transplant,t3_t3qfpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ashland/comments/t3qfpp/recent_move_to_ashland/,Recent move to Ashland,/r/Ashland/comments/t3qfpp/recent_move_to_ashland/hz7fv2z/,1,r/Ashland,0,1

"I would advise against Grizzly Peak because it is probably very muddy on the backside.  There's still snow on the summit.  I would avoid all mountain trails (Pilot Rock, Mt Ashland Meadows, Greensprings Mountain Loop, etc) until May, unless you like mud.

I did Lower Table Rock last weekend and it was great.  4.71 miles, 828 feet elevation gain, and 2.5 hours (includes walking around on the top).  Both Table Rock trails can get quite busy, so the earlier you leave the better.

Closer to Ashland, go to https://www.ashlandtrails.org/.  I like Bandersnatch --> Jubjub --> Lower Red Queen --> Ashland Loop Road --> Witzend.

First they tore down the 10+ tennis courts at SOU and replaced them with dorms. Then they tore down the tennis courts at Helman Elementary in preparation for the construction project there. Then they converted one of the 2 tennis courts in Lithia park to pickleball, leaving only one single tennis court, and then for some reason decided to convert that one too even though a tennis court can be used for pickleball (which it was) but not vice versa.

"> Since then I’ve had an ammonia smell stuck in my nose, and stomach pain so bad I can’t stand up straight.

From what I've heard, this is actually somewhat common after Covid.  You might be getting some big heartburn and acid reflux. Which apparently can also cause of prolonged coughing afterwards (if the acid reflux is the cause, cough drops will make the heartburn worse). Should have hopefully subsided by now.  Alka-Seltzer and other things can help.  I didn't have any luck with the tums chewables and similar at all.

Sometimes anti-histamines can help, and for long covid, anti-histamines are helped quite a few people.

"This was the Ashland Depot Hotel. It was demolished in 1937. The south wing remained and was remodeled into the new passenger depot until 1955, and then as a freight depot until 1985. That building was moved to the south side of A street and Fifth. It's still there.

There's a house across A street from the Railroad Park that is half of the original Ashland depot. It was moved to another location in the railyard to be used for freight in 1888 when the Ashland Depot Hotel was built, then across the street in 1960 (after the south wing of the Ashland Depot Hotel stopped serving passengers and started doing freight). It was partially remodeled, partially built over. I believe an attempt at restoration or conservation is being attempted.

Most often the vehicle had 4wd, they just didn’t know how to turn it on.  That or their solution to sliding in the snow is to jam their foot down on the accelerator.

For the most part, having winter tires (and changing them out with summer tires each year) isn’t necessary unless you visit the mountains or need to traverse one of the mountain passes.  What would best benefit you is to find a snow covered parking lot free of any other vehicles or obstacles, and get a feel for how your car handles in snow or ice.  Learn how to engage 4WD if it is something that needs to be set, otherwise learn how to change to a lower gear on an automatic.  Most cars have anti-lock breaks so you don’t need to pump your breaks, just hold down the breaks and it’ll do a better job.

"Don't live in Ashland. It is expensive. I am a local and I have lived here and commuted to work (in Ashland) the past 5 years. Ashland has the worst rental rate in all of southern Oregon. I recomend looking in Talent, Phoenix, Medford and then drive in to Ashland. Even with gas prices as they are it is still the cheaper option. 

&#x200B;

For the record, a 1 bedroom or studio unit in Ashland goes for \~$1000...I rented an upstairs and downstairs Townhouse (2Bed 2Bath) with a garage unit in Medford for $915.

&#x200B;

Ashland is also not worth the hype. You pay way more in the downtown scene just because of the ""Culture"" and I can get a good beer and a meal in downtown Medford for 20 Bucks.

Then came what was called the ""Heat Vortex"" (or something close), where the temps up & down the W Coast hit upper digits for several days. I watch their weather & I'd never seen it like this, a good 2 months that it fluctuated from low 100's to low 90's, with the higher temps more prominent. There is also a growing homeless problem, but you'll find that everywhere on the W Coast. So....she's been talking of moving, a lot of her friends from there already have so it's not a hard choice. Also, because a lot of people are relocating there, especially from CA, & the recent fires. It's impossible to find a place to live.",t2_3l6jouen,plainlyput,0,1633366045.0,0,t1_hfdb6f5,hfdb6f5,False,Danforth7,t3_q16p15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ashland/comments/q16p15/should_i_move_to_ashland/,Should I move to Ashland?,/r/Ashland/comments/q16p15/should_i_move_to_ashland/hfdb6f5/,4,r/Ashland,0,4

"I lived there for a year.  It's a mixed bag.

Pros:

* absolutely stunning.  If you're into outdoorsy stuff you'll be in heaven.  There were world class mountain bike trails 6 blocks from my front door.  If you're into hiking, cycling, fishing, etc. You're in for a treat

* Ashland is probably in the most beautiful part of the state.  Even driving the green springs/dead Indian (yes, that's a real road name)/shale city loop is non stop eye candy.  Lake of the Woods, crater Lake and the coast are all easily accessible

* great wine, weed and beer (this is most of Oregon tbh)

* punches above its weight regarding restaurants, but a lot have had trouble since they depended on the Shakespeare Festival which has been shut down/limited from a Covid/fires combo

* smaller, tight knit community

Cons:

* absurd cost of living, it's even worse now since half the valley was on fire and adjacent towns burned down.  There's a huge housing shortage and it sucked finding housing even before this

* Fire season is a regular occurrence now and it's unlivable for 2+ weeks a year.  That's the new normal and it's getting worse

* no diversity whatsoever

* town is all college students and bay area retirees.  The dating or social pool for people in their 20s-30s is small

* place is absurdly hippie: white people with dredlocks, crystals, well to do women who probably buy shit from Goop, etc. but go 10 miles in any direction and it's hard core Trumpy Republicans.

The boomers here are mad that the wage slaves aren’t showing up to work in the restaurants. They treat wait staff like shit. So there’s no good dining anywhere. 

The anti vax liberals are united with the anti vax Magas so we have a covid spike that’s not going away. 

There is a huge shortage of rental housing. There are no affordable neighborhoods or business incubators for start ups. The cops primary business here is protecting the landowners from transients and Unhoused. Meanwhile petty theft is on the rise as more desperate people are targeting the safe sleepy community. 

The cannabis farmers are using all the water in the valley, legally and illegally. Theirs is the only booming business in oregon but all the cannabis grows are hyper capitalist top down ownership, no coops or shared earnings with constantly lowering labor rates.

"Hey, I’m active in the local AA community. I’m 41 and considered a youngster at a lot of the mtngs I attend. The hole in the wall mtng, Monday, 7pm at St. Vincent’s in Medford had by far the most young people of any mtng that I’d attended in the area. I do not know if it’s been active since covid began but I’d look into it. I know it can be uncomfortable attending meetings when there’s a huge age gap between you and most the others. But please don’t let this discourage you. There’s such a great sober community in the Rogue Valley. I started my sobriety journey here at age 31 and was welcomed with the most open and loving arms I’ve ever known to this day. Ruch 9:03am on Saturdays is still the best mtng I know of and it’s mtng in person still. Please, please, please pm me if you need a sober friend or someone to go to mtngs with. Old or young this valley has strong sobriety networks. We wanna be there for and with you. Also, check out Recovery Cafe in Medford. It has a lot of young heads. Google it and you’ll find the info. It’s not AA or a twelve step program but it’s great and run by good people with a lot of resources if you need a hot meal, work, help with housing or to see a licensed therapist when you don’t have $$$. Keep at it homie, the best years of your life are ahead of you if you keep reaching g for help from others that have walked the same path.

She enjoyed bike rides up there when she was younger, and still does today. We bring a few simple beach toys and she just goes to town. Maybe keep that in the back pocket for when your kid is old enough to not pour fistfuls of sand into their eyes (been there done that).

"I live in Ashland and I have Covid. I was vaccinated last Spring. So, I’d like to think that I’m having a mild case because I was vaccinated. I’m on day 8 of symptoms. And it’s important to note that not everyone needs help at the hospital. There is a hysteria going on and people are so afraid. Let me say this, from the direct experience of having a first hand seat to observe this disease, out of the 8 of us…. No one has needed any medical assistance. Of those 8, only two of us were vaccinated and then there are three of us that are children. It’s very much like other experiences with a flu or influenza that I’ve had. It comes with such an array of experiences that are respiratory and gastrointestinal in nature. So, first let me say to you all… Stop, take a breath, relax! We are going to get through this. Not everyone has life threatening complications. I don’t mean to minimize the impact of all who have lost their lives but people… there are many many more survivors than those that are dead.

Anyway I’d like to emphasize that masks are a good thing. And that is because I contracted Covid from my grandchildren who were exposed at their local summer camp. And I am deeply concerned about the reopening of schools. It’s going to be an explosive event because of the children bringing it home to their families. Talk about a disruption to the workforce. Young families are going to feel this coming wave. And the ripples will continue being felt. 
Vaccinate if you can.
Be understanding of each other, some cannot be vaccinated.
At least wear your mask!
And I will too.

And as to you, the original writer, Covid is here in Ashland but isn’t it everywhere now?Shouldn’t we all continue to be cautious in our socialization? One question that I’ve asked is, Is there any data that shows that we build up immunity to it? Aaah… I hope I never have it again.
