"I have lived here for 22 years.  It was a mostly okay place to raise a family.  If you have kids make sure you educate them thoroughly on the existence of hard drugs. I personally know at least 3 of my children's peers that have died from Fentanyl overdoses.  I can't speak for the current situation but a few years ago the amount of dealing and using Fentanyl was astounding, but that may not be a uniquely Airdrie thing.  

The daily commute to Calgary is a horrible fucking grind.  I did not realize how bad until Covid gave me full-time work from home.  Even without the commute, I am anxious to get out of here. The kids are grown and and gone and now there is absolutely nothing to do here as an empty-nester.  Have been trying to find the right place to move back to Calgary where there are adult things to do. 

There are pathways but when I compare them to what is available in Calgary, they are flat, bland, and lifeless mostly with a view of peoples back yards.

Airdrie is a bedroom community to Calgary.  It just seems to lack a life of its own.  It has grown to 70,000+ people  but doesn't have enough interesting things to do to keep you from heading in to Calgary.  It just doesn't seem to stand on its own.  It needs Calgary close by.

"One thing I will say for the NW, is that its north west of everything else.

Let your friend know that some parts of Airdrie are a pain in the ass to access highways from, and that longer commutes can come from that.  If they are working from home, or in Crossfield and north from there, NW is fine.  But for a commute into Calgary, you always are held up by a lot of traffic lights and stupid At-Grade rail crossings.

Same can be said of both Airdries East-West thoroughfares currently.

"Lots of nice parks all through the different suburbs, green spaces, nice trails. Couple of dog parks... some better maintained than others. There's also Nose Creek Park which is really nice. The creek goes through it you have a nice loop to walk your dogs and see some wildlife, there's a decent little park for kids, they do nice community things there at different times of the year like weekly live music in the summer, stuff like that. There's Chinook Winds park with a great splash pad, bathrooms, concession. A skate park, baseball fields, a great kids' park, a hill to sled on, a nice pavilion, a big pond full of ducks and geese. I'd say yeah, lots of green space just you have to go into the suburbs to see lots of them.

One thing I wanna tell you is that the greenery everywhere here is super well maintained. I moved here from Evanston in NW Calgary bout 4 years ago and the different was STARK. Garbage cans get emptied here. THERE \*ARE\* GARBAGE CANS. Doggy bags at intervals and they keep them full even in winter. No towering mess of weeds everywhere like in our old suburb. Grass gets mowed and isn't left to go dead. There are flowers, and trees are healthy. It's nice and there are a lot of nice walks around drainage ponds here.

I have issues with Airdrie and all, but not with the greenspaces or maintenance of it. It's lovely that way. You just gotta find out where to go. Go scout out some suburbs.

"In a lot of ways Airdrie reminds me of a miniature Mississauga in the sense that the main retail component of the downtown is a shopping mall, with the rest of the city mostly 1950s and newer suburban style homes. There used to be a strip of historic buildings but they were replaced with the provincial courthouse which in the 1970s/80s were known for a pretty bland style of architecture wherever they were built throughout Alberta.
The city does have an interesting downtown plan but I'm not sure of timelines.

"I moved from Ontario  in 2017, and brought my car.

 You'll  need to get an out of province inspection done, then you have a certain amount of time to complete any repairs needed. If you go past that amount of time, you'll have to pay the whole inspecton fee again.  I think it was 10 days when I moved here.

My passenger side mirror was cracked, and needed new glass, but I had to order it from Japan, so I went past the timeframe allowed by the province. If you can, I'd recommend  trying to repair any safety- related things *before* going for the inspection, that way they can just tick off that it's  met all standards. 


Different mechanics are able to do the OOP inspection, and many will charge different rates,  but not all mechanics are licensed to do it. You have to get an OOP inspection form from a registry first, and bring that with you to your mechanic. (they may have changed this with covid though, tons of services are now available online)


Once you get the OOP inspection completed, you just take the form back to any registry, with proof of insurance and the deed, and the registration costs about $90, but does depend on what month your last name gets assigned to for registration  renewal. ( it's not based on birth month, unlike other provinces)",t2_8w59ru4v,HelloTeal,0,1645511576.0,0,t1_hxxokjk,hxxokjk,True,JSZ21,t3_sy9xzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Airdrie/comments/sy9xzg/vehicle_registration/,Vehicle Registration,/r/Airdrie/comments/sy9xzg/vehicle_registration/hxxokjk/,1,r/Airdrie,0,1

"You'll need an ""out of province"" inspection before you can get it registered with Alberta plates. You have 90 days from when you move to Alberta to get it switched over.

If the vehicle is fairly new it shouldn't be an issue but if anything is flagged in the inspection it will need to be repaired first.

The inspection can only be done by a mechanic in Alberta, as far as I'm aware, so you won't have any way of knowing what it will cost until you are already living here.

"Hey! I bought a place a couple months ago, so the market might have changed a bit. But we were able to put on offer within 6 hours of the house coming on the market, and our realtor put a 6h deadline on it to avoid a bidding war. After a bit of negotiation, we landed at the asking price put didn‚Äôt go over. (3 bedroom detached house).
My recommendation- if you see the place the day it opens - put an attractive offer on it right away with a deadline to avoid the bidding war.

A realtor would be better to ask though - If your looking for a solid realtor that will do same-day showings and has a solid background in Airdrie real estate - check out Derek Woelfle. He usually doesn‚Äôt do retainers either, so no risk just talking to him.

As for locations, I preferred the south due to proximity to Calgary and the school zones. 
Best: Coopers and Kings Heights (more expensive)
Second: ravenswood, Bayside/Bayview (a little newer developments, but less land value)

"If you have children attending Rocky View schools they can request test kits to take home, while quantities last, according to last week's update.

RVS email:

January 7, 2022
Dear C.W. Perry School parents/guardians,
Beginning the week of January 10, we expect to start receiving medical grade masks and COVID-19 rapid test kits from the Government of Alberta for every student and staff member. The availability of enhanced medical grade masks and rapid tests will become valuable tools in addition to our health protocols as we work hard to minimize the transmission of COVID-19.¬†They will be made available to students and staff but are optional to take and use.


In alignment with government recommendations and requirements, RVS mask protocols require all students, staff, and visitors to wear a mask unless they have an exemption under the government‚Äôs process. Students and staff are welcome to continue to wear cloth or disposable masks and are NOT required to wear government-provided masks.
Rapid test kits are optional and are NOT required to be taken or used by any students or staff members. Rapid test use is to be completed at home for individuals choosing to use them. We request that if your child/ren test positive that you please inform us so we are aware and can help support your child‚Äôs learning while they need to be away.


Once these items arrive, they will be distributed to students and staff as quickly as possible. Each student and staff member will receive a box of at-home rapid test kits, enough to test twice per week for a few weeks if they choose. The medical-grade masks will be distributed to students and school staff via the school. Initially there will be a two-week supply of masks for each student and staff member (two per day).¬†Both¬†pediatric (Kindergarten - Grade 6) and adult sizes (Grades 7 - 12 and adults) will be sent to schools.",t2_3gyq1hj,TempestWest,0,1641880807.0,0,t1_hs6a16u,hs6a16u,True,[deleted],t3_s12tnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Airdrie/comments/s12tnm/rapid_test_kits/,Rapid Test Kits,/r/Airdrie/comments/s12tnm/rapid_test_kits/hs6a16u/,1,r/Airdrie,0,1

"Locking this thread. As already stated by other users - the dog should be surrendered to a reputable shelter and not just some random person on Kijiji. Calgary Humane Society or AARCS is your best option as they thoroughly vet potential adoptees. I refuse to believe they are not able to assist. If you call Calgary Humane and let them know you are coming in to surrender a dog I refuse to believe they would take the dog in. These professional shelters ensure the new potential owner has the skill set required to care/love for this dog and provide an adequate forever home.

If you require any assistance getting you and the dog to one of the associations after you call them to give them a heads up you are bringing the dog in - I am more than happy to help. You can DM me if you need help with the transportation process.

I refuse to believe for one second that these particular shelters are telling you they cannot take the dog in.

"We got the new Telus fiber that went in last year and I gotta say it‚Äôs pretty amazing.  I usually try to avoid these threads because people are so entrenched in what isp they hate for whatever experience they have had in the past. 

All I will say is that with Telus 300 I‚Äôm seeing 250+ up and down with no slow downs and I‚Äôve had great luck with customer service and install. 

We pay 118$ a month which is unlimited Telus 300 and our cable package that has 4 theme packs, 3 ala carte channels, and 1 premium pack. They also cover the cost of your wireless tv boxes and 3 boosters we have in the house. 

Granted we had to sign up for two years on a contract for the loyalty discounts that drop it to this price but I couldn‚Äôt name a time in the last 15 years I haven‚Äôt had internet and cable. I can‚Äôt foresee that changing any time in the next two years. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm not gonna get in some argument about who is better or has best customer service, etc, but this is what we currently pay and experience personally.

"I've been here for 13 years and lived in three different spots. Here's what I've picked up. 

On the East side, Kings Heights, Ravenswood, and Thorburn are nice. 

Westside, I don't know enough about Williamstown and reunion. Woodside and fairways seem nice and quiet. 

Canals and Bayside, you hear about it being built on a swamp and needing a sump pump. That said, I heard just last night from someone who lives in that area and they don't have a sump pump or any problems. 

Coopers is nice. Morningside is nice too, but you get train and highway noise. It's that noise which would make me want to live on the west side of Hillcrest if I was to buy there. 

The Windsong area is okay, but I've heard questionable things about Mattamy, the only builder in that community. That said, you can probably hear questionable things about every builder.

Edit -> didn't see the ask about a newer home.

"I lived in two locations in the south part of Airdrie, roughly the same distance from the runways, but right under the seperate ""ILS"" approaches for both the runways. It really doesn't make much of a difference which side of the city you're on. It's rarely loud enough that it wakes you up, in fact, inside you almost don't notice. It's like your furnace fan. Outside you'll notice more, but it never interrupts a conversation if you're out on your patio. The Calgary airport has introduced satellite based approaches that keep the majority of approaching traffic away from the city when planes are landing southbound. When taking off northbound, most airplanes are turned before they get to Airdrie. I find it's probably similar to road and train noise. If it really concerns you, the more north you go, the further away from the noise you are. 

Edited to add that the last two years has seen very reduced flight schedules. It's recovering, but still definitely not above 75% of what it was.

"There's some gems in terms of places to eat, it's a small town, not like the big city of Calgary that people go too if you are into partying and stuff like that. But some good restaurants around, quick drive to Calgary, there are two big malls which are also a drive away (one booming one umm... in the process, if you ever wanted to see a not busy mall, I have exciting news for you!).

Definitely a safe place to walk around. Come in spring-fall (like may to October) if you don't like winter. If you do, Banff is an hour drive away with stuff to do. We do (or did before) have the festival of lights in winter, but not sure if it's still a thing. Also I'll mention Drumheller is a drive away too, because the badlands look cool, and I like dinosaurs, they have Dinosaur stuff (like a whole museum).",t2_6a7oqbnf,butterinthegarden,0,1633642909.0,0,t1_hfs3qwl,hfs3qwl,True,Fun_Benefit_7374,t3_q33zt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Airdrie/comments/q33zt1/want_to_visit_airdrie_canada/,Want to visit Airdrie (Canada),/r/Airdrie/comments/q33zt1/want_to_visit_airdrie_canada/hfs3qwl/,5,r/Airdrie,0,5

"Jam Tart's for breakfast, then Mukluk Magpies Stained Glass Emporium is where I'd start. After chatting with the wonderful owners and checking out their stained glass workshop- maybe even making a piece for your very own souvenir!- off to the very cool antiques mall, Where on Earth Did You Get That? To find fun and sometimes creepy treasures from years gone by. Stop for an amazing lunch (and Canada's best Ceasar, if you're a Ceasar fan) at Sorso, then the local vendor market The Squiggly Pig, a lovely walk through Nose Creek Park, and dinner at Abe's Diner. 

For hotels in town I recommend the Wingate, the staff are amazing and the rooms are gorgeous. Admittedly the view is mediocre, but that's life. Next day you have to go to Your Local Ranch for a tour and some of the best beef you'll ever encounter with a visit from the Hanson's. 

After that, use Airdrie as a hub to dodge around Calgary traffic as much as possible, but definitely hit Okotoks for the iconic 94 take the cake bakery, Birdsong art gallery, and Hidden Gem vendor market. And no visit is complete without the Chinook Honey Company for mead tasting and a bee tour (book in advance!)
