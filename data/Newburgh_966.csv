"You're absolutely right and I am aware of this, I guess I was just being lazy about articulating my thoughts. I feel like it would be pointless for me to elaborate on this because it's not like I have anything special to say, but in short, I guess I can't help still being shocked by some of the things I'm hearing/seeing lately just in passing, having not lived in Newburgh since 2016 and willfully staying as disconnected from it as possible.   


For example, stumbling upon this BS by accident:  
[https://hvmag.com/home-real-estate/newburgh-house-hudson-valley-transplant/](https://hvmag.com/home-real-estate/newburgh-house-hudson-valley-transplant/)  


...and then this:  
[https://www.instagram.com/newburghtransplant/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/newburghtransplant/?hl=en)  


...like some sort of sick joke. I remember back in the VERY early days of business pages on Facebook (so, around 2010 or so), I happened upon one realtor who started advertising his listings there with this general message/selling point of ""let's work together to make Newburgh RISE up again."" For obvious reasons, this made me cringe and roll my eyes a good deal, but the guy was supposedly a local with family there spanning back generations, so it seemed innocent enough, all things considered... or, idk, maybe I just didn't want to believe that even my own ""neighbour"" was capable of doing something so self-serving if given the opportunity, i.e. I was willfully blinding my eyes.   


But even so, this\^\^ BS is on a whole other level, it made me sick to my stomach to see that. And just looking at the sheer magnitude of how much the housing market downtown shot up in the last year alone, when I can't even remember a time in my life when I've \*NOT\* gone down any given street that wasn't at least 50% ""abandoned"" (on paper), I'm talking increases of well over an order of magnitude, really floored me.   


Again, I have no right to feel any type of way about it, considering, and I should know better than to even be surprised by it, but idk, I can't help feeling infuriated by the blatant disregard for human life, and how familiar it is to the people there suffering by the hand of it.",t2_ok8zw,schaumanism,0,1645236142.0,0,t1_hxiztfj,hxiztfj,False,mwar76,t3_sv2t0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/newburgh/comments/sv2t0g/anonymous_gentrification_notices_posted_in/,Anonymous Gentrification Notices Posted in Newburgh,/r/newburgh/comments/sv2t0g/anonymous_gentrification_notices_posted_in/hxiztfj/,1,r/newburgh,0,1

">Shakur has been censured by the council twice for his confrontational and vulgar outbursts aimed at the police.

Let's not pretend this is about the police.  Omari is a moron and fuck-up of massive proportions.  He's confrontational with EVERYONE.  He's only there because his 30 some-odd children and grandchildren voted him in, and general lack of care in voting for local elections from everyone else.

This is why there's a prison to Newburgh pipeline.  This is why Newburgh has the highest number of sex offenders per citizen in the Hudson Valley.

">Skoufis also took Orange County Partnership President Maureen Halahan to task for her comments in support of the project. “**Maureen Halahan could hardly conceal her deep-seated disgust for Newburgh.** For someone in her position, who is tasked with promoting and attracting new business to this county’s extraordinary cities and towns, her belief that Newburgh is a vice-ridden, drug-addicted crime den just begging for developer interest is disgusting, offensive, and flat-out wrong.”

>Skoufis said Halahan’s “comment that Newburgh is a ‘crumbling city’ – when, in fact, it is experiencing significant revitalization – is not only abhorrent, but factually wrong. Ms. Hallahan owes the City of Newburgh a public apology.”

But I don't know about the porn angle.  That area isn't at all pretty from the water side.  Even if they were just docking to shop, that's not a good spot either.   Highland, POK, a bit farther up like Balmville... even Beacon.  That spot is only good or taking shots of the boat from the shore.

"Let’s show the governor and the legislature that we’re ready for a renewable future, free from polluting power plants that poison our communities.

Let’s stop fossil fuel power plants for good. Join us in Newburgh for our May 20 Day of Action!

After years of battles against fracked gas, the New York state legislature is considering a bill that would stop all new fossil fuel power plants. This bill, the Clean Futures Act (A6761/S5939), would prohibit the state from issuing permits to any new or expanded power plant that runs on fossil fuels.

This landmark legislation would stop three fracked gas projects in their tracks—Danskammer, NRG’s Astoria Gas Turbines, and the Gowanus Repowering Project—and send a clear signal that New York is going renewable, and kicking greedy polluters out of our state.

But the legislative session ends in less than a month. If we’re going to stop the Danskammer, Gowanus and Astoria plants with this bill, we need to pass it this year. It’s our people power versus polluters, and we need to up the pressure on our electeds!

Join us for action on May 20th to ban new fossil fuel power plants!

Bring a mask; masks and physical distancing will be required.

>    Omari Edwards was brought to the hospital in a private vehicle around 11:15 p.m. on March 12.

>    Police said the incident has not yet been determined to be a homicide. According to a relative of Edwards, he had a gun in his waistband that accidentally discharged shooting him in the leg and severing an artery resulting in his death.

>    Outside the hospital when Edwards was brought in several fights broke out and two men were arrested.

"Yes, since the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986 the use of lead-containing solders in potable water systems has effectively been banned nationwide. Many installations in areas like ours have been shown to contain lead.  
  
The thinking is that higher water temperatures (in the pipes) release larger numbers of contaminates that exist inside of the buildup in the pipes.   

It works in the same way that higher temps clean your dishes and clothing better.  You will notice the water also tastes and often even looks different.  

Homes that have washing machines and dish washers typically operate at a higher water temperature (around 10 degrees F hotter) making the problem even worse.

"this is bad. i love activists coming together to imporve a community, but supporting an organization that is demanding the political segregation of POC and for their power to be installed everywhere, for it to be illegal to charge a POC with a crime or to jail them, to teach everyone that this country is a horrible horrible place that oppresses POC and they have almost no shot in life because of racism, and demanding all whites pay money for something a small group of white people did 150+ years ago is not just racist, wrong, it is evil.

the purpose of BLM is to AGITATE. to spread lies, misinformation, exaggerations, to teach a worldview to people that is based upon racial power structure. 

teaching young kids of color that they live in a society that makes them second class citizens and they are held back by systemic racism (which is a lie, but the purpose is to agitate, not educate).

it really makes me sick that kids are growing up with so many problems and we are all doing our best to MAKE THEM ANGRY AND HATEFUL AND RESENTFUL instead of TEACHING THEM THE VALUE OF EDUCATION, RESPONSIBILITY, ETHICS, ETC.

I was shocked at how much trash it actually was. My original plan was to clean around the block but it was too much. In any case, I picked up and was at least happy with my little section. I figured maybe some other day I'd get more. Nope, within days there was new trash on the section I cleaned up. Beer cans, nonetheless, so my impression is that some asshole is drinking and driving and just chucking cans out of their window. 
  
I can't stand all the trash everywhere and want to clean up more. But I also have zero motivation when so many people are so TRASHY. Literal definition of TRASHY.

With the benefits of hindsight, anyone can make easy decisions. Making them in advance is the hard part. 
  
As for all levels failing, sure. Early on there are many things that could have changed, but New York has been the best managed state since March. Read up on other states. Look at Georgia, Florida, Texas. Keep an eye out with the knowledge you have. You'll see.

As for the earlier link, it may have been the wrong one from a 10 second search but surely you can deduce that if county officer has that power during states of emergency, the governor has more. 
  
As for the Cuomo's, it's clear you have bias against them. I don't believe they traveled between homes as Chris was reporting from his home prior to testing positive. Also, I don't believe there was ever a restriction on travel between homes or even the homes of family members. Lastly, do I think he should have been out? No, but everyone does their own thing.

"Being frustrated by the government is a life long endeavor for most people. Anyone that isn't is either a government employee or feels the need to live in a nanny state to take care of them.

You really haven't provided me anything. The last link you sent proved my point that the governor doesn't have the power you said he did.

In reference to the 30 seconds it take searching, I meant that it only took me 30 seconds to find that one reference to a lawsuit being filed. Look to California where their governor is just as insane and there are lawsuits being filed at a rapid rate there.

By the way, the Cuomos don't worry about the law. Look at Chris Cuomo. Traveling to his second home when his own brother came down with an Executive Order limiting travel to essential only. He got in the face of someone that called him out on it, so there we go with social distancing and mask rules that were required by an Executive Order by.....wait for it....his brother Andrew. Loved his dramatic emergence from his basement after his battle with Covid19 but as stated before, he never stayed down there. Fredo was just being a drama queen.

I'm pretty much in line with the rules that have come out, at least as it comes to how I function daily. I haven't been anywhere but places for food and medication for the past two months. I always wear a mask in public and feel like I'll be doing it for at least the rest of the year no matter if that rule gets suspended.

I also feel all levels of government failed. Recommendations that changed, opinions that showed to be incorrect. It's a cluster fuck. Many people lost their jobs because of the inadequacies of the government. I'm one of them. I'm up for replacing every single politician we can vote out. They don't lose their income. Hell, the NY legislature will likely not be in session for months and they're still getting paid. For what?

"Lots of problems with this story. Trump was a highly regarded athlete at NYMA. Ted Dobias worked at NYMA a helluva lot longer than Colonel Petrillo and to compare NYMA to The Storm King school as a similarly sized school is ridiculous. NYMA had much larger classes because its campus barracks were twice the size at least of Storm King's, a tiny school. As for editor Bo Gill giving lots of coverage to Storm King athletes. Why sure. He was in the pocket of Stephen Duggan who was President of The Board of SKS for probably 40 years. He was also great chums with Bill Paley of CBS. Don't you think little small town editor Bo Gill enjoyed evening cocktails by the pool with the likes of Bill Paley, a frequent weekend guest of Duggan's? I'll bet he did. 

Lastly, to say that wealthy people didn't send their sons to NYMA is a laugh. Fairleigh Dickinson was a student there. Many wealthy families sent sons there as did the elite of Cuba.

Police need to be on obvious priority for funding, police keep is safe, have the toughest jobs, and need to be supported. That doesn’t mean that art funding is in opposition to that.

">NFA North sounds amazing! How did you get into the North academy?

In your final year of middle school, they will give you a sheet for you to decide what high school you want to go to. The options when I was in middle school were NFA North, NFA Main, and NFA West. Main is where you want to go if you are into the arts such as plays, singing, acting, dancing etc. North is more of a technological school and west is special ed(might not be just special ed but mostly). North has a limit as to how many kids they accept per year but it is possible to transfer from Main to North. There is also the P TECH program(separate checkbox on the high school sheet) which allows you to graduate with an associate’s in Applied Sciences Degree in either Computer Networking or Cyber Security as well as a high school diploma. The program randomly selects those who apply but it favors minorities and people that are economically disadvantaged/have disabilities.  It is 4-6 years depending on which track you go. Fast etc. The fast track requires you to go during the summer for some time(still get time off). As of right now, the P TECH program is only accessible at North campus(if you get into ptech you would go to school at North but in your own classes).

In the end, it all depends on what field of study a student is interested in.

It's the same at all the high schools freshman wise. Once you hit sophmore/junior year everyone starts to take it more seriously because they finally get that they won't just get pushed to the next grade like in middle school.

These jerks don't give a damn about the kids.  They exist to line their pockets and hand contracts to their friends.  This is a population of teenagers that need every possible assist, every chance at getting educated and getting ahead.  

Instead officials buy tablets, probably get kickbacks and stack them in a basement.  Same with the cameras: they can let them collect dust for a year or 2 then sell them on.  ""Whoopsie!  They're gone?  Huh.  Wadda you know?  Oh, Newburgh is a harsh mistress...""

>appropriations were overestimated resulting in an operating surplus of $18.8 million in 2015-16 and that reserves were not used as intended and were overfunded by $7.3 million as of June 30, 2016
