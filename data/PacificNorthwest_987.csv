"So here's the problem. Any health issues relating to vague symptoms such as fatigue, mental state, weight gain or other metabolic issues, memory/cognition/""brain fog"", weakness and coordination, inflammation / auto-immune, general body pains, etc... could all be caused by one or more of a vast array of underlying conditions. 

I'd go to your doctor and bring a list of your concerns. Be sure to request a complete blood panel as well as hormones and vitamins checked. Many doctors are hesitant about this, but insist anyways.

When you talk about the ""pacific northwest"" potentially causing these symptoms, you're probably thinking about less sunlight.  It could be vitamin D deficiency, that's very easy to test. (Although people all over the country are deficient in that.)

Also, benefits to light exposure are far more than just Vitamin D. Research circadian rhythm - artificial light exposure at night, excess screen time, caffeine, and much more can all impact this. Check out this video [about sunlight and health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YV_iKnzDRg&ab_channel=MedCram-MedicalLecturesExplainedCLEARLY) .

So if you are concerned about lack of sunlight, keep in mind that there are many actions you can take to address that. You will probably need to make a more concerted effort to get outside, even when the weather isn't ideal. Overcast days still give you significantly more levels of sunlight than staying inside.

"The Coastal-Class ferries are amazing and awful at the same time. They boast no ferry charm of the older vessels, look like a brick, and the passenger areas are awful. The sun deck (pictured here) is a greenhouse that is so echo-filled that you have to scream to be heard by the person next to you. I would know as I used to deliver Parks Canada presentations in this very spot - despite being some of the biggest ships in the fleet (second only to the Spirit-class), they consistently gave us our smallest audiences because people hated this space so much. The lack of proper seating elsewhere on the deck is infuriating (there is a bit but nowhere near the amount available on other ships), and the fact that the main outside deck doesn't have anything indoor on the same level makes it inequitable for those with disabilities. The promenade decks on the main passenger level are awful.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Bellingham still has somewhat of a small town feel to it if you are looking to get away from the big city atmosphere. Also in its favor is the easy accessibility of so many diverse activities. In the same day you can take a mountain hike in the morning and a sunset sail on the bay in the evening. Yet it is a reasonable distance from Seattle and Vancouver, BC to enjoy museums, concerts, etc. without an overnight trip.

Coming from Chicago our climate will probably be an easy adjustment for you. It rains, but often it is not heavy. Windy though. Don't use the Seattle weather reports to judge Bellingham. They are not within the same system for many weather events (a ridge of foothills that reaches to the bay separates the area from the rest of the state). If you want an idea of Bellingham weather, Vancouver, BC or Abbotsford, BC weather would be more accurate.

I'm sure you have already done your homework regarding socio-political climates, crime rates and schools for the locations you are considering.

You work in health care, so the job market might be easier for you.

On the con side of things - Bellingham/Whatcom County is growing too fast with a not very well outlined plan for controlling urban sprawl. Housing prices are insane. There is contention within the city and county political structure regarding almost everything. There is only one hospital in all of Whatcom County, and it is operated by PeaceHealth (judge that yourself). Bellingham/Whatcom County has been slow in the diversity department but is catching up. Outlying communities/towns can be very different in feel from Bellingham and even each other. Amenities in some places are atrocious (some areas have no major grocery stores within a reasonable distance). Mt. Baker is a non-dormant volcano (although if it were to erupt, it would most likely be towards the southeast).

"Gunna list a few things, lived in CO for 7 years and moved to WA last summer. CO is, by statistics, more expensive to live in than WA, CO doesnt have nearly as diverse of a job market as WA, its been getting a tech boom, and oil is a big market out there, but youll spend just as much for cost of living in WA as u will in CO but WA doesnt have an income tax and has better, higher paying jobs. You can camp wherever and whenever u want for free at any of the national parks and forests in WA, CO is greedy af and keeps it regulated and expensive to ""preserve"" the state parks. Traffic isnt as bad in CO as it is in WA, roads are nicer in CO (outside of major metro areas). Crime is also really bad in WA and Portland, OR. You have a much higher chance of being a victim to property crime in WA than u will in CO. WA is much more culturally, racially, and socially diverse than CO, if ur wanting to live in a state with 90% white people who like bluegrass music, CO is def for u. 

And btw i love CO, one of the best states to live in America by far. But every state has its pros and cons as we all know so i dont mean any disrespect to anyones home state (:

Edit: forgot to mention that it rains 8 months out of the year in WA (summers r beautiful tho). CO really does get 300 days of sumshine a year, itll be 40 degrees and rainy in WA and itll be bitter and cold af, while its 20 degrees and sunny in CO and its dry climate so it feels warm.

"Check out some of the communities in the sound - Port Orchard, Poulsbo are both nice, though Poulsbo is getting pretty pricey. Would say the same of Gig Harbor. Also around that area \~ Bremerton and Silverdale. None of these are too far from Tacoma which has a lot going on.  
Bellingham and surrounding areas are also getting pretty pricey but they're awesome. If you're looking up there and are okay with a smaller town, check out La Conner.   
If you like the coast and are interested in being near Portland, check out Astoria, its a really amazing town in Oregon where the Pacific ocean and Columbia river meet. Amazing food and drink scene, great dive bars, awesome breweries, fishing town with also a lot going on with art and music and not too far from Portland. Also close drive to a lot on the OR coast, and easy hop up to Long Beach, WA. The coastal towns in WA are pretty small/very seasonal and don't have a lot going on and are a pretty long drive to the bigger cities.

Since you were considering Vancouver, WA I'd recommend checking out Kelso/Longview area as well - much smaller, but also less $, on the Columbia river and closer to the coast. Maybe less issues with homelessness there too? Though I haven't been to Vancouver in a long time so I can't say for sure.

If you're at all interested in the Peninsula in WA - its gorgeous - check out Port Angeles, awesome community-oriented town out there surround by epic nature. It is quite a drive though to get to airport/Seattle, probably 2hr45 min or so either driving around or taking a ferry. Port Townsend nearby is more expensive but has a lot going on with the arts and is a little bit closer to Seattle.

I know nothing about Colorado so can't help you there! Good luck :) The PNW is a magical place!

also the weird joke making and immediate leaving of the scene + the fact he went full psycho mode and the lady started crying means those people knew they were potentially f*cked if they ACTUALLY got caught which is exactly why they reacted like that. if one person followed them down and got license plate that could have maybe been one thing, but now that they’re gone there’s no way to prove anything even if all three of you recognize them. cops in Bellingham can’t even (rarely) prosecute thievery caught red handed. 

trash dog owners shouldn’t be bringing their untrained dog on a trail let alone one as popular as oyster dome. only slightly good thing is that most likely those people probably won’t bring their dog on that trail again.

"Invasion? No chance at all. Russia would have nothing to gain and everything to lose by that.

Other attacks? Only if everything goes completely wrong, the US reverses its position on whether to intervene directly in Ukraine, Putin decides to commit the most infamous suicide in human history, and the military that he already betrayed by sending many of its members to die based on an obvious lie decides to commit suicide with him by passing along the orders to turn the keys.

If all of that comes to pass, Naval Base Bangor stands a good chance of being one of the targets because US nuclear missiles are based there.

Naval Station Bremerton and Naval Station Everett might be, but probably not. Hitting those targets only makes a completely insane decision worse. Same for Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base.

If something like that ever happened, at the moment of the flash, you would want to turn away, take cover so the fireball is not visible and you're as protected as possible from any shock wave that might reach you, and if indoors get away from windows and get under something solid. Once the shockwave passes, determine if where you are is safe (not on fire, not structurally damaged), treat any injuries, and immediately prepare to shelter in place or evacuate.

If in doubt, shelter in place unless instructed to leave. Check for gas leaks. Store up water and gather up available food, medicine, and first aid supplies. Cover any broken windows. It is generally a good idea to minimize air movement in and out of the home to reduce radiation exposure. With that said, especially in the case of a limited strike, fallout actually is mostly a problem for long term cancer risk, rather than immediate survival. It's overwhelming the exposure to the blast itself that is likely to cause radiation sickness. For the fallout, though, potassium iodide pills help your body to excrete two of the most significant radioactive isotopes. Since most people don't have those, iodized salt and foods rich in potassium are good (yes, if Seattle gets nuked, hipsters actually \*should\* eat avocado toast).",t2_zy16m,iamlucky13,0,1646453952.0,0,t1_hzeuv1d,hzeuv1d,True,[deleted],t3_t6vffc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/t6vffc/russian_invasion/,Russian invasion?,/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/t6vffc/russian_invasion/hzeuv1d/,3,r/PacificNorthwest,0,3

there's also some great access to public land off of 138, but it's been too long for me to make specific suggestions up there.

"Boise is fantastic, except our real estate market is 80% overpriced right now.

Other than that, it totally depends on what kind of trails you want.

The Boise North End has people/mountain bike trails, equestrian trails, single track (dirt bike), 50 inch (ATV) trails, and forest roads for the larger ATV/UTV folks and Jeep runners.

The forest roads will take you almost anywhere you want to go... **as long as you have a vehicle that's capable of handling rough terrain.**

From Boise, we're about three hours to anywhere you want to go.  Camping, hunting, fishing, forests, high desert steppe, dunes (Weiser and Bruneau), Idaho City, Murphy, Horseshoe Bend, and Crouch are all pretty local.

Cascade is more like a 5 hour drive, but up there it's pretty much God's country.

Lots of natural hot springs.  My wife and I will take our UTV up the trails into Idaho City and make a weekend of staying in the local hotel with access to the hot springs up there.  Tons of trails can take you to some of the higher peaks - Wilson Peak (7837 feet) and Pilot Peak (8128 feet) are both a half day trip from Idaho City.

You can also get to Trinity Mountains (9451 feet and east of Boise/Idaho City) which has a lot of camping and seven small mountain lakes that are stocked with fish - nothing to break records with, but the Rainbow Trout are good eating (if you like that).

We also have Pine/Featherville (east of Trinity, north of Mountain Home) with tons of trails and campgrounds with hookups and dry camping.

&#x200B;

If you do come out this way, I highly recommend a UTV and camping gear.",t2_8upja,BalderVerdandi,0,1645710504.0,0,t1_hy8nih5,hy8nih5,True,schediastic,t3_szwiak,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/szwiak/east_coaster_here_looking_to_relocate_how_close/,East coaster here looking to relocate: How close do you live to the woods?

"totally depends on what cabin you get and how many nights, how many boats (if any) you rent, your food/drink budget (which all has to be packed in, there's no store or restaurant or food/drink to purchase).  Just a quick run down for my situation, family of 5.  

Modern cabin is $250/nt for 2 ppl, plus 18ea extra (x3 ppl for our family) x 3 nights.  = $912 + tax. 

Motor boat rentals $140/day  (we rent 2) x 3 days = $840 + tax. 

plus our food, beer, fishing gear, gas to get there, etc.  We budget about $2100 for our vacation there every year.  Not cheap for a 4 day trip.  But absolutely worth it for us.  

You can find pricing info for cabins, rental equipment, etc on their web page.

"Tillamook is all about cows and farmland. There is a constant smell of...manure in the air. But the surrounding areas are beautiful. Lots of rivers and creeks for fishing. But, I highly doubt Tillamook can be considered a dating paradise, but who knows. Maybe someone more familiar with the area can weigh in. There's a road going directly from Tillamook to Portland, along the Wilson River (known for great fishing).

One thing to mention, and I don't know if you are aware of this, is that Oregon has a state income tax, Washington does not. This can be a legitimate consideration, depending on how much you earn. However, Oregon has no sales tax. If you really want to be thrifty about it, you could live in Vancouver (no income tax), and do all your shopping 10 minutes away, in Oregon (no sales tax).

"It's a long, bumpy drive to get there, but worth it for the big trees! The trail is only \~1.5 miles long and the drive can be 2+ hours from Portland or possibly not even accessible due to closed gates. The trail is an official trail on BLM land, but you may need to navigate a maze of private logging roads to get there. I was lucky in that the main route was completely open when I visited, but I've heard of others trying 2-3 times to visit and encountering locked gates each time. Be sure to check with the BLM before going to make sure the path is clear! If you do make it, be sure to bring a picnic and take time to enjoy this primeval pocket of old growth.

The Oregon coast is generally more populated, but rent is higher. Wherever you are on the northern OR coast, you'll be somewhat close to Portland, there are many roads going from the coast to Portland. The traffic on the 101 is hardly ever congested.

"We took our belated honeymoon this past fall and it was definitely eye opening. 

We flew into Portland, stayed there for the night then drove up to Tacoma. (Highly recommend the Silver Cloud Inn). 

We then spent a day in Seattle hitting all the main spots; Space Needle, Aquarium, Ferris Wheel, Museum of Pop Art, Museum of Glads, Pike Place. Keeping our hotel in Tacoma was ideal because besides being beautiful, the drive to and from Seattle was just the right length. 

From our experience, our flights were spaced out weird so we didn’t have as much time as we initially intended. We booked our flight almost 10 months in advance. Cancellations and what not caused a 12 hour layover in Denver (horrible) and departing Portland sooner than we wanted. 

The highlight of our trip wasn’t Seattle. Though it was enjoyable, we loved the more nature parts of our trip. It can be intimidating to plan long hikes so try to find short ones, they’re out there! 

Edit: Expect to see homeless people. Prepare for that, because we weren’t. I’m talking homeless camps just everywhere from Portland to Seattle. Anywhere there was an empty lot, there were likely several tents. Very sad to see.

"When I hear coastal, I wonder what that really means to you. Using Oregon as an example, there is a world of difference between a ways inland (PDX, Eugene, Corvallis) and an actual coastal town like Newport or Florence. If the actual coast is what you are talking about, you'll need to spend some quality time in the winter there before deciding to do it. SAD is real no matter where you are, and can affect some to a strong degree, sometimes with increasing intensity as years go by.  But, the actual coast is an inherently brutal environment, especially, but not limited to the winter. Think lots of rain, unending wind. It feels bitter sometimes. Plus, some things tend to be very expensive there, like restaurants.

"Over the next few years, you should come out here and do longer stays in different places, at different times of the year, to get an accurate feel for where you'd like to settle down. Things have changed a lot, and continue to change. If you can pull it off, maybe 3 weeks or more each visit, to do the everyday stuff so that you get a sense of life as a resident. Make sure one visit is in the dead of winter (Nov-Dec), and then come again in August when the risk of wildfire smoke is high and sometimes we have to tape windows shut and wear a ventilator mask. The 30-day winter stretches with no sun, and the summer weeks of wildfire smoke, will be realities of living here for you, so it's best to experience it first hand before making a commitment.

I'm from Vancouver, BC, and now I live on the east side of Seattle. I had to live in Chicago all of last year for my spouse's work. We lived in the West Loop; armed robberies almost every week within a ten minute walk of our apartment that were almost *never* reported by local news, being physically assaulted by 4 women when I casually asked them to not empty their car trash onto our sidewalk, insane city governance, and enjoying downtown was out of the question thanks to random shootings even in the middle of the day, etc. My personal opinion is that the PNW is 1000% more appealing than Chicago, even with our exorbitant cost of living, rainy winters, wildfire smoke, and issues with tent camps. I couldn't leave Chicago fast enough and get back to the evergreens, salty ocean air, mountains, and not feeling like I live at risk of armed random violence.",t2_7ohboqtc,Mysterious_Grocery85,0,1643230322.0,0,t1_hucglep,hucglep,True,[deleted],t3_sd8p3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/sd8p3b/retirement_to_coastal_pacific_northwest/,Retirement to coastal Pacific Northwest,/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/sd8p3b/retirement_to_coastal_pacific_northwest/hucglep/,6,r/PacificNorthwest,0,6

"In theory I agree with you. There's the potential for a lot more control over your environmental performance in a RAS than there is in a net pen; so it should be better if done properly. The sticking point in practice though is the 'done properly' part; because that's kind of a weasel word. The assumption is that there's an implementation that solves all the potential problems in a way that everyone's happy with; which is not something we've seen on a large scale yet (and scale is important; because a lot of things you can get away with on a small scale will be a significant problem on the large scale).

I mean, take your own example. Pumping ocean water uphill is not all that difficult to do in theory; and you're not using fresh water (which we'll need for other things going forward). So that solves one problem. But you've created another problem; because water is very heavy. Pumping enough water to run a commercial scale farm will consume a very large amount of energy (even if you're not pumping it very far); which has an environmental cost in addition to the financial one. You also have to worry about the quality of your intake water (sucking up an algae or jellyfish bloom could be catastrophic) so you need some kind of solution to make sure that doesn't happen (marine farms have all kinds of environmental mitigation systems; it's easier to do because you're not dealing with a point source; most of the net pen mtigation systems focus on moving good water around to keep the bad water out. Tricky to do that with a fixed pipe). 

You're also suggesting aquaponics to help with cost efficiency and presumably to reduce the overall water consumption and pollution. You're using salt water now; so that won't work for most crop types anymore but we'll assume you can spin up a more novel type of agriculture that will work (algae or kelp maybe? Although there'd have to be a reason why you're growing this stuff in tanks on land; and I'm not sure if that would work out). You're adding a lot of complexity and constraint by introducing a whole new set of growing conditions and operational requirements along with the new species. Doing that commercially is... tricky, to say the least. The aquaponics outfits I've seen tend to compromise husbandry on one side or the other; because it is very hard to get to work properly. Generally if you're having trouble making something work efficiently the answer isn't to make it more complicated. You'd probably want to see a properly working large scale RAS before you started adding a commercial agriculture operation to the mix.",t2_k2la8,Scalare,0,1642703118.0,0,t1_hthnxsb,hthnxsb,False,Stoned_Ninjaa,t3_s7au7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/s7au7k/fish_farms_they_smell_bad_spread_disease_and/,"Fish farms - they smell bad, spread disease and water around it seemed murky .

Nordic Farms does a pretty good job for the most part! I’ve toured and looked at some of their facilities and I would say they do very well. If you live near the coast buying from local distributors and docks is the way to go but many don’t have access to that. Monterey Bays Seafood Watch does a good job looking at different seafood sources and assessing sustainability in consumption.

"Alexandra is generally pretty clueless. I used to be in the industry (got out of it a while ago); and there were a lot of her claims I could check. Most of what she says is some flavour of wrong. She'll say things very confidently about stuff that's very basic and still be way off base; because she still doesn't actually understand the industry. I've read a good number of her academic papers and the work is sloppy; bad experimental design and unjustifiable assumptions that make the conclusions somewhat meaningless. There's a reason she doesn't get cited all that much.

You don't really get much problem with disease these days, from what I've seen. Vaccination helped with the big nasties; and the rest of it is manageable with a good fish health program. Most losses tend to be from outside environmental effects (mostly algae blooms; which are becoming more difficult to predict. Sea temperatures and nutrient availability are driven by local climate conditions; and recent years have been pretty screwy in that regard).

Sea lice are a concern; especially around the transition to non-chemical lice treatments (there were learning curves the companies didn't really anticipate; although they probably should have. They quite rightly took a big PR hit over that one). The technologies do work though; and so long as the investment's there it should be fairly effective. It's hard to tell how the relationship works (both the industry and the NGO's monitor sea lice numbers in areas around the farms; and their numbers are usually the same although the interpretation differs). A bad lice year tends to be a bad lice year on both wild and farmed stocks; the two are obviously linked but causality is hard to figure out. Environmental conditions generally play a big factor (temperature and salinity tend to play a large role on lice reproduction rates; which has been a problem with the fucked up climate we've been having lately). Part of the problem is the massive data gaps that exist (we really have no idea what sea lice populations do normally; since there's no monitoring program outside of the areas that have fish farms). It's a problem with fisheries science generally; the basic research doesn't get funded which gives both the companies and NGO's a license to say whatever the hell they want because we don't actually know.

Land based farms are a bit of a question mark. There was a lot of interest in the industry generally (it is potentially a good solution to a lot of problems). It's difficult to make work though; companies have tried it and none of them seem to have been doing it very successfully yet. Cost is part of it; and people often misconstrue that as it being 'all about the money'. The thing about cost though it that the dollar figures represent resource use efficiency. Land based systems require a much more infrastructure and physical footprint; more power to run (which usually means a higher carbon footprint), and a metric crapton of water (usually clean fresh water; because salt water typically doesn't show up on land in much quantity). They also have to release effluent into areas that are more sensitive to pollution (yes, you can potentially treat the effluent; but not everything can be cleaned from water so you still have to dump it somewhere. Terrestrial and near shore environments tend to be less good at accepting that than marine ones). Also from the figures I've seen the biological numbers aren't actually as good (you spend more resources to grow less fish).

How a land-based farm is implemented is probably key to it's environmental performance. We haven't really seen a workable implementation on a large scale yet; so it's an open question as to how much environmental benefit there might actually be. No way in hell we'll actually see it here though; the NGO's oppose anything that looks like expansion, the companies aren't going to invest if their accountants can't see a safe bet and the government is just hoping that it'll all work out with as little effort or initiative on their part as possible.",t2_k2la8,Scalare,0,1642659479.0,0,t1_htfdpfn,htfdpfn,False,Stoned_Ninjaa,t3_s7au7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/s7au7k/fish_farms_they_smell_bad_spread_disease_and/,"Fish farms - they smell bad, spread disease and water around it seemed murky .

"Folks really underestimate how bad overfishing has gotten. When I was younger I used to sweat out on the rez with an indian community I was in with. Folks would talk about things going on in their lives, sometimes it was pretty free association.

 I dont know how much of it was bullshit, but the point is that there were so many it was at the very least plausible at some point, and its nothing like that today. People arent using dried fish as firestarters because they are so plentiful. You get out into international waters and its even worse. If we want to eat fish, we need to farm, its as simple as that.

"I’d second this point. I am currently a salmon biologist in the PNW and fish farming, whether we want to accept it or not, is the way of the future. Our wild stocks can’t support a full wild fishery and feed the growing populations of the world. If we want to eat salmon it’s going to have to be farmed salmon and there are some companies that do really well and practice sustainability. There are aquaculture practices that can both limit the environmental impact and increase output of product through multi trophic level farming that include kelp, shellfish, and fish farming. For anyone interest do some research into the blue revolution, it’s a really cool concept of offshore farming that limits environmental impacts. 

Side note as a scientist please be aware of what I like to call “Outrage Science” via documentaries like Seaspiracy that are founded in little science and base claims on outdated and debunked studies.

"I worked on one of those cages for 6 months but north of Port McNeil. The farm I was on was actually not that disgusting, very few fish that died etc whilst receiving daily reports from other sites of mass mortality events losing 4000+ fish.

I can genuinely say, the company I worked for at least appeared to be doing their best, but it was a very odd experience as I've been vegetarian for a couple of decades. I'd certainly not eat farmed fish even if I was not vegetarian!

"Alexandra has good points yes, but coming from fish school, she isn't very accurate with the way she measures. Be very close when you watch how she does things. There are diseases sadly yes, a lot of them (I've seen it first hands in many ways), the key is to get them out of the ocean, and switch to land based farms or sadly.... We won't have fish left (due to demand) 

Edit: so that I don't get another paragraph of why we should or shouldn't have farms: Alexanda is trying to remove all farms in general, she can go f herself, as we will not have any fish left if we don't have them. The key for the future is realizing that and not keeping our problems secret, so that they may be fixed.

"It's less about going straight against currents and more about how to use the geography to your advantage. You're taking shelter in an eddy where the water closest to you is moving against the direction of the current. You'll learn how to cross eddy lines and how to ferry and how handle your boat in moving water. 
I love paddle sports and used to do a lot of sea kayaking, but since caught the whitewater bug. 

 I don't want this to come off wrong, but I hope you're dressed appropriately for a swim, and know how to self rescue should the unfortunate event occur. Hypothermia is a real killer and drysuits are worth their weight in gold. It's also handy to have a handheld marine vhf, especially if you're paddling alone.

"I can't speak for Portland, but Seattle is a unique city because it was built around trolley stops. Every trolley stop turned into an incredible center of a neighborhood. It still is very apparent. 

Downtown is pretty much dead (as far as i'm concerned), but each neighborhood (former trolley stop) surrounding it has a really unique kind of flavor. All the neighborhoods are very different. Best to really zoom in on gmaps and look around. Do you like nightlife and clubs? dive-bars and local music? LGBT scene? Blue collar? International and fusion? 

These are all wholly over-generalized, but hope you get the picture.

My favorite in Seattle will always be Discovery Park, miles of trails to walk and beautiful scenery.

And also if you have never been to the PNW, take a ferry, assuming they are open by then. Only a couple bucks to walk on, and you get to see a bit of the Puget Sound and returning to Seattle, the most amazing views you can get.",t2_8j0vn,xlitawit,0,1642245600.0,0,t1_hsr52vn,hsr52vn,True,Supernova_shark,t3_s4edpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/s4edpk/travel_questions/,Travel questions,/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/s4edpk/travel_questions/hsr52vn/,4,r/PacificNorthwest,0,4

"Literally what makes both Seattle and Portland special is “cities with good food and drink with great access to the outdoors”.  

So, you’re on the right track.

How long do you have?  I’d say for a first visit, you’d need a minimum of 4-days to even get a sense of either city.  If you have less than that, just pick one and don’t try and do both.  

Both are great cities I love to visit.  Portland is a bit smaller, and has a stronger counterculture / weirdness component. Seattle is larger, and has a stronger connection to tech companies. Though, there’s plenty of weirdness in both.

If your goal is just “cool cities with access to the outdoors” it’s going to be hard to pick one over the other.  I’d recommend narrowing your search down a bit if you don’t have time to visit both.  

If you *do* have time to visit both on a single trip, I’d highly recommend the train to get between them.  Flights are cheap and easy too, but the train is very pleasant and will give you a stronger sense of geography.",t2_3gddl,AtOurGates,0,1642237631.0,0,t1_hsquks3,hsquks3,True,Supernova_shark,t3_s4edpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/s4edpk/travel_questions/,Travel questions,/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/s4edpk/travel_questions/hsquks3/,7,r/PacificNorthwest,0,7

"I've lived in both, and they both have their attraction. Seattle for hills and water. Portland is smaller, easier to get around, with rivers at the core of the city, and hills on one side. Both have interesting neighborhoods, which is what the cities are about. Not sure when you plan to visit, but sometime at least after April would be good. Late spring / early summer is my favorite time around here. 

As for the surrounding areas, again both have their perks. Seattle has more interesting mountains, but I think Portland has more interesting lowlands (Gorge, Willamette Valley, Coast). You'll find plenty of interesting places to drive to in either, but you can make more varied shorter road-trips out of Portland.

Some people try to cram in both cities in too short of a time. The drive between the two is 3 hours one way with no traffic (so usually longer) and mostly uninteresting - I've done it more times than I can count.

My dog Brutus got away from me yesterday and was hit by a car.  Took him to get cremated and am supposed to pick him up today, if I can figure it out.

I was going to have a memorial service for my mom, but things went sideways with the program and I was never able to.

I have to honor them somehow and I can’t put it off anymore.  If you’d like to come, please pm me.  I’m going to make some flyers with the time and a donation link for the cremation and stuff and will be putting it out everywhere.  I can forward that to you.

Thinking it will be at 4:30pm, but will update with the specifics via pm.

Thank you in advance, if you’re able to make it.",t2_h6bwdeyy,rainyclowndiaper,0,1641753612.0,0,t1_hry3hir,hry3hir,True,[deleted],t3_rzy7rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/rzy7rw/eugene_or_having_a_memorial_for_my_mom_and_dog/,"(Eugene, OR) Having a memorial for my Mom and Dog this afternoon at Alton Baker Park.

"Take the southern route across the US, and avoid most of the mountains.  Take I5 through Portland and up to Seattle, it stays relatively low in elevation from Portland to Seattle so you won't have to worry about it.

If you take I5 up from California, keep an eye on weather conditions in northern California and southern Oregon, as the Siskiyous can get hammered with snow in winter, and I5 has been shut down before on either side of the border because of it.

If you come over Oregon through Bend, be cautious on Hwy 20/22 as you are going up and over the Cascades on a two-lane highway (more or less).  

You can go I84 through Idaho and into Oregon, but between the Idaho border and about Pendleton can also be dicey going, and ODOT has been known to close the freeway when Deadman's Pass gets bad.  

Keep chains in your car if you don't have snow tires/AWD, and know how to put them on (including which tires, front or rear, to put them on!) and keep a winter kit with water, a shovel, extra clothes/blankets, gloves, hat, etc, plus a tow rope, kitty litter, triangles/flares.  Remember, take it slow and easy in the snow/ice, NO panic braking, NO jamming on the gas, gentle inputs on your pedals and steering.  Steer INTO the skid, don't hit the brakes, and leave a LOT of room between you and the vehicle in front of you.  If it's bad and you aren't comfortable, pull off the road into the closest hotel and stay for the night.",t2_ao7ah8b9,Haven-KT,0,1640813536.0,0,t1_hqgn3jq,hqgn3jq,True,LegitimateQuit194,t3_rqq5nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/rqq5nh/moving_to_pnw_seattle_need_advice_related_to_road/,Moving to PNW (Seattle) Need Advice Related to Road Conditions,/r/PacificNorthwest/comments/rqq5nh/moving_to_pnw_seattle_need_advice_related_to_road/hqgn3jq/,1,r/PacificNorthwest,0,1

"Keep an eye on the forecast and conditions, as it can change by the hour. 

If it's actively snowing at a pass, that's very different than ""it snowed yesterday, but today is clear"". Most major highways are going to be clear a day (or even hours) after receiving a dump. But, the roadway might still be icy. 

try to pick a route that keeps you at relatively lower elevation, avoiding passes. Have some backup routes in mind just in case the weather dictates. 

if you do get some chains/cables, make sure you know how to put them on properly. Also, some cars (e.g. Subarus) shouldn't have chains put on them, as it messes up the differentials. But they have AWD, which means you ought not need them quite as much. 

In some places, you just need to ""have"" chains even if you don't need to put them on you car. 

4WD doesn't help you brake. Just slow down.
