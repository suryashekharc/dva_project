"Kamras is generally team Stoney.  I mean, whether he personally likes Stoney or nut, functionally he happens up team Stoney since he doesn’t get along with the school board.

He just keeps quiet about it and puts on a good face.  One of Kamras’s strengths is that he is good at inspiring trust from parents, teachers and students.  I think he is sincere about it.  He really does care.  That’s really important in a beaten-down and poorly functioning system.  I don’t downplay that at all.

It’s also the case that he is pretty bad at nearly every other facet of his job.  And he has a superhero complex.  And he lies and tries to hide shit.  That’s a bad combination of traits.  But because he comes across as a nice guy, everyone tries to ignore how bad he is.  Which means they have to blame someone else.  

Which in this case is the school board.  It helps that the school board is not good either.  But they are right not to trust him.  I no longer trust him.  And IMO anyone who actually cares about the schools should not trust him either.  I’d be fine with him if we could just check his worst tendencies and make him report on what’s up.  But he doesn’t.

He hid all of the compliance issues with that school lunch contract from the board until he needed the board to rescind the contract because VDOE forced him to re-issue the RFP or we would not get state support and would likely be sued.",t2_12plyx,ttd_76,0,1648270340.0,0,t1_i25qj2n,i25qj2n,False,VCUBNFO,t3_tnm04i,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/,Richmond School Board blocks Kamras from filling chief wellness officer role,/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/i25qj2n/,1,r/rva,0,1

"Doerr and Jones are the two school members that serve on the School Health Advisory Board.  That’s the board that is supposed to provide input on Physical and Mental Wellness.

They are supposed to review contracts with meal vendors and make their recommendations to the School Board.  When Kamras signed his contract with Preferred Meals, he neglected to consult with SHAB.  As the school board members of SHAB, it’s the duty of Jones and Doerr to raise this issue and get the contract.  Neither of them did this, and Kamras signed the contract with no SHAB input.  He actually signed the contract without any Board approval.   By the time it was presented to them it had been signed.

The vendor he signed with did not provide USDA approved meals.  Because these meals were not approved, the federal government was going to withhold reimbursement to the city for providing these meals.  They also never even filled out proper paper work in the first place.  It also failed state guidelines.

Unbeknownst to the school board VDOE was alerting the city of all these various violations.  VDOE calls a meeting with city RPS staff.  The COO is there and promises they will get a response from the mayor and/or superintendent.  VDOE claims the city never got back to them.

And that is big part of why the school board is not so hot on funding the COO and a Wellness Officer.

Because shockingly, the city administration bypassed every procurement procedure, consulted with no one, did what they wanted, and fucked it up entirely.",t2_12plyx,ttd_76,0,1648268190.0,0,t1_i25n2mc,i25n2mc,False,VCUBNFO,t3_tnm04i,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/,Richmond School Board blocks Kamras from filling chief wellness officer role,/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/i25n2mc/,1,r/rva,0,1

"The problem with this argument is that Kamras eliminated multiple positions in central office in the first draft of the budget. He was being praised for this as far back as Jan-Feb. At some point he has to realize if they eliminate this role, there won’t be other people in his immediate team to fill the shoes.

Kamras is a superintendent of a school system with a ton of students. It’s not possible to be a subject-matter expert on every issue that comes forth. A strong cabinet allows him to delegate and have people focus on specific areas. Good cabinet members aren’t cheap.

This isn’t about saving money.

"I think that if the situation were how some people are trying to portray this, it would be a power trip.

But it's not really as simple as the school board refusing to allow Kamras to hire someone that I agree should be his to choose if the position were funded.

There's a $1m discrepancy between what the board wants and what Stoney wants.  There are two positions worth I guess around $400k they can use to try and meet in the middle.

If Stoney wants these positions so bad, he could add $400k to the budget and maybe this would be off the table.  But he didn't.  Not that I blame him because he has his own budget priorities and they go beyond RPS.

But to me, this is just an ugly part of budgeting.  There's always a pot of money that doesn't stretch far enough and hard choices must be made.

The $400k these positions cost takes $400k out of something else that probably also sounds like something we should support on paper.

I think it's disingenuous to be like ""These school board members say they care about school food but they won't hire a Wellness Officer.""

Maybe they do care about school food.  Maybe they just think the money is better spent on procurement staff or cafeteria workers over some $200k suit in an office.  And maybe they are wrong.

It's more than a little rich for Kamras-backers to act like the school board does not care about school lunches or like it's their fault students are getting terrible meals when Kamras was the one who fucked up so bad he had to ask the school board to rescind the shit contract he signed.  The school board was who backed him out of his amazingly stupid deal.  

Do we need $200k to babysit Kamras so doesn't sign contracts with vendors for non-USDA approved lunches and cost us millions in federal reimbursements?

Anyway, to me that's the situation.  There's a budget that has to be met and it calls for some tough calls over seemingly minor sums of money.  Both sides have plenty of ammo to sling at the other because RPS sucks and they are both involved in RPS.

The pettiness and power-tripping is not the actual Wellness Officer position, it's how it is being played out so publicly and with so much hostility and so many people running to their keyboards to slam the other side.",t2_12plyx,ttd_76,0,1648259491.0,0,t1_i256xkz,i256xkz,False,VCUBNFO,t3_tnm04i,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/,Richmond School Board blocks Kamras from filling chief wellness officer role,/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/i256xkz/,1,r/rva,0,1

"My experience with NCJ was pretty so-so. Lots of plumbing issues (not their fault) that they took a longgg time to fix. Raw sewage backed up in my bathroom sink and bathtub and they told me to clean it up myself. I was able to argue enough that Neville himself came to clean it, but I was annoyed that they even suggested I clean that in the first place. This was in the midst of the combined 6 weeks during which I had no functioning bathroom and had to walk a quarter mile to VCU campus every time I had to pee. 

Other than that fiasco they weren’t so bad.

"Her role in the scandal was to alert parents to the fact that their kids didn't have to retake the SOL's. Possibly she encouraged them not to.

I disagree with her stance, but IMO there is nothing illegal or unethical about it.  And it's why she's on the school board.  A lot of parents felt it was unfair that all their kids were being pressured to retake their SOL's when there was no evidence their kids cheated.  

If you ask me who was most at fault for that scandal, it's the teachers.  I wonder whose job it is to make sure crooked teachers aren't involved with RPS.  Sounds like maybe that's the job for the superintendent.

Maybe we shouldn't have hired a superintendent and his cronies who were way more involved in a way more major cheating scandal if this was something we pretend to be concerned about.",t2_12plyx,ttd_76,0,1648257576.0,0,t1_i252yzu,i252yzu,False,VCUBNFO,t3_tnm04i,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/,Richmond School Board blocks Kamras from filling chief wellness officer role,/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/i252yzu/,-1,r/rva,0,-1

"Here is the Freddie Mac survey from this week. Today rates moved for the worse by 77 basis points, so either that rate goes from .8 points to 1.57 points, or the rate goes up and the price down. https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms

When we study mortgage va led securities and therefore rates by extension (what rate we offer is what rate we will be able to sell it for plus markup, so consider you are the wholesale product we sell at retail, in this scenario) - there are points of resistance that correlate to areas where the market tends to pause and the past couple weeks it’s crashed through them like a bull in a china shop. 

I would say right now it’s a function of inflation. Historically mortgage rates are slightly higher than inflation to make it make sense for investors to buy in. All the money printed that went to buying mortgages created artificial demand, so that lowered rates while also creating inflation which should have been raising rates. Then the fed starts to pull out of buying mortgages, and it’s a steep climb back to where it should have been, but it sucks for everyone. 

Obviously to a hammer everything looks like a nail, but at some point monetary policy will curb the inflation and rates will level off or go down, but we don’t really know at what point we fix the housing supply issue. You can refinance and get a lower rate but you can’t go back and time and buy at a lower price. I wouldn’t let a higher rate stop me if I were in the market but I would absolutely bitch about it extensively. To that point I’ve locked rates for 2 million dollars worth of loans for lenders buying their own personal homes this week so I’m not alone in that sentiment. 

I work in several markets and my observation is that the cities that have the worst frenzy/supply shortage (Raleigh is worse than here, Hampton roads isn’t as bad) are the ones where housing cost compared to median income was lower than it should have been to start.",t2_ctxv7,gracetw22,0,1648247389.0,0,t1_i24h6qi,i24h6qi,False,Kindly_Boysenberry_7,t3_tmjk6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tmjk6l/rva_real_estate_ama_dreary_march_edition/,RVA Real Estate AMA - Dreary March Edition,/r/rva/comments/tmjk6l/rva_real_estate_ama_dreary_march_edition/i24h6qi/,2,r/rva,0,2

"It's worse by every metric. We have fewer homes, just as many if not more buyers, and everyone is still scarred from last year thinking they need to bring more cash to the table and bid over. The number of homes I've seen closed *already* that are 100k+ over is fucking mind blowing. Plus you already know about the experience I just went through. 

**HOWEVER**

I still have three people under contract in homes they really love, so it's not like it's impossible. You just have to be smart about where you're going, what you're offering, and where you draw the line. I know firsthand that buyer agents throw the dumbest offers together without any thought and then get frustrated when they aren't accepted. The least you can do is check all the fucking boxes on the contract so that it's filled out properly but even that is too big of an ask. 

So I wonder how many buyers out there aren't being served properly by agents who don't know what in the fuck they are doing, and the answer is just ""throw lots of money at things"" which does shit like triggering crazy escalation clauses for example.

"FFS, people.

Let's go back about a year.  Remember when the initial graduation rates during coronavirus were released?

Kamras touted those figures and certain posters here were all over his knob like ""Yes because he put soooo much work into these visionary programs.  He did it!  That crazy bastard really did it!""

Except then it turns out the final grad rates were not as good as forecasted.  But even more importantly it became obvious students actually struggled tremendously during coronavirus and students were just being waved through to graduation.  

The programs had nothing to do with it, and now Kamras is cutting some of those same allegedly ground-braking initiatives.  And no one is saying jack shit.

BUT ALSO... the school board touted those initial graduation figures as well.  As evidence that they were doing a good job.

No one is doing a good job.  RPS sucks horribly.  These two sides both are happy to claim and share fake victories but when things go bad, they  point the finger at the other.

What size should Wythe high school be?  That's  core substantive issue we should be debating.

"The school board being opposed to Kamras and thwarting his agenda has really only been a big issue since the last election.

Even then, honestly the school board agrees with Kamras pretty often(as they should) because they have a shared interest in public school funding.

Even the contract extension kerfuffle was about whether to extend Kamras for four years or two years.  You're not getting screwed when the debate isn't whether to fire you or not to extend you, but how long an extension you should get.

You guys are constantly trying to rewrite history.  It's laughable.

This is what happened in Richmond.  The schools were shit.  Stoney and Kamras came along and promised big changes.  Because people were so fed up with how bad the schools were, they largely backed Kamras.  He was given a relatively free reign to do what he wanted for a few years.

But then, the school system still kind of sucked and some people decided that Kamras has been given his chance and not done a good job.  So that got fed up with him and elected a new school board, including people who had opposed Kamras in the first place.

Kamras was given the ball.  People don't like what he did with it and now want to take it away and give someone else a crack.

His agenda was not thwarted.  It was carried out and he owns it.  Some people don't like the job he did.  Some do.

"RPM - They have an office in the Bottom and were fucking awesome when I initially leased from them. Super easy to deal with, very transparent about everything. Any issues I had they'd respond to same day with a real response, even maintenance issues where someone needed to come out. 

Even had a sewage backup into the apartment once and they offered to put me in hotel and have a cleaning service come out. Had already cleaned everything by the time I contacted them and they reimbursed me for all the cleaning supplies and some stuff that had gotten ruined without me asking. Had a plumber out the same day to make sure it didn't happen again.

"The people who are opposing Kamras were elected from districts who were unhappy with the job Kamras was doing.  They ran on a sort of anti-Kamras platform and they are representing the platform they ran on and the voters that elected them.

Do I agree with them?  Not always.  In fact there's at least a couple I think are bozos.  But I also know Kamras's record as an administrator is decidedly spotty, to say the least.

These school board members, whether you think they are on a power trip or not, do represent a decent chunk of the population, and that is why they are winning.  

It's entirely possible that two sides with a limited budget and differing viewpoints, can disagree on  whether to hire a position or not.  

That's not really what's happening here.  What's happening here is a pissing contest.  But it's a pissing contest that is not helped by people shitting on the school board for silly reasons and acting like Kamras is a super hero.

It's an administrative staff position.  There are legit pros and cons but it's probably not all that high stakes either way.  

We can talk about whether to accept this hire and why.

They are small with limited properties. If you are lucky enough to rent from them, then I highly recommend it. My girlfriend and I had a fantastic experience with them.

"The 9th St. and Lee bridges can definitely handle the increased vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The biggest impact, though, will be for those who relied on the Mayo Bridge to walk/bike to work and/or Farm Fresh.

ETA: The new traffic circle on Maury St. makes that intersection and exit from 95 sooooooo much smoother. I've used it a handful of times between rush hour and non-rush hour traffic and barely needed to wait for an opening to get in the circle. That, in addition to the two other nearby bridges, should hopefully make the Mayo Bridge closure a lot less disruptive.

That said, there isn't much of an option here since they can't do a partial closure and work on one side at a time. That bridge is going to have to close and be replaced no matter what.

They'd be foolish to cave to community pressure and keep it open while it continues to degrade; the optics of a car or person falling through the bridge or a complete collapse because they kicked the can down the road would be terrible.",t2_5lgfb,fusion260,0,1648237090.0,0,t1_i23so7p,i23so7p,False,doittojulia,t3_tntwcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tntwcu/mayo_bridge_may_close_for_2_years_while_being/,Mayo Bridge may close for 2 years while being replaced,/r/rva/comments/tntwcu/mayo_bridge_may_close_for_2_years_while_being/i23so7p/,7,r/rva,0,7

"Strange... [right around this time in 2019](https://www.wtvr.com/2019/03/06/mayo-bridge-safety-concerns/) (emphasis is mine):

>A DPW spokesperson said the city has secured federal funding to further “rehabilitate” the Mayo Bridge and alleviate some of those structural deficiencies. **The $8 million project is scheduled to begin in 2021, DPW said.**

Now in OP's linked article (emphasis is mine):

>With Warner’s $5 million, the city now has $14 million for the project. **The total cost is expected to be around $80 million.**

There's no mention of a start date in the latest article, so it sounds like they're still planning it and nothing is final yet.

I don't think I recall seeing work done on the bridge last year, so I'm guessing the ""rehabilitation"" didn't actually take place in 2021 and they shifted the plan to a full replacement project? Or are we talking about that original project with just significantly increased costs?

Edit: Yes, I realize the title of this article says ""From rehab to replacement,"" but since the article doesn't mention prior plans at all, I figured it was colloquial phrasing.",t2_5lgfb,fusion260,0,1648236538.0,0,t1_i23rbkl,i23rbkl,True,doittojulia,t3_tntwcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tntwcu/mayo_bridge_may_close_for_2_years_while_being/,Mayo Bridge may close for 2 years while being replaced,/r/rva/comments/tntwcu/mayo_bridge_may_close_for_2_years_while_being/i23rbkl/,8,r/rva,0,8
"You're not wrong.  But tbf it does kind of go both ways.  Most of left-wingish Richmond has been a total shit show starting with the Floyd protests.

It's filled with people who have taken too much critical theory and are convinced the way to do things is to ""control the narrative"" via social media.

It still wouldn't be that bad if there were more people actually sincere about their politics.  Like, they're fighting a bit dirty but they at least have core principles of some kind, even if I disagree with some and agree with others.

But instead it's a lot of power struggles between assholes and damaged people with massive personality flaws.  

You have large segments of SJW type people actually taking up rather moderate/status quo positions but recasting it as taking up for minorities or underrepresented populations.  Like white, affluent Northsiders acting like those who oppose Kamras are racist when in fact a good amount of the opposition to Kamras is coming from the black community.

On the other hand, you also have a BIPOCs who claim to speak for all BIPOCs and using their minority status as a shield abd a sword.  When really it's like no people don't dislike you for being black or gay or trans, they dislike you because you're a raging asshole.

Everyone is trying to out-woke or out purity test everyone else.  No one wants to admit they were wrong about anything.

And all that friction ends up centering around Kamras and the schools because Kamras rode into town with a ridiculous set of utopian left promises that he is not going to come anywhere close to delivering on.  

But we never really should have expected him to.  It's hard to turn a school system around.  

But now, everyone who backed Kamras can't admit that.  They come up with every excuse in the book, because it's not palatable that Kamras portrays himself as strict accountability guy who by his own standards should be fired.

But then those opposed to him kind of do the same thing.  Kamras's accountability standards were stupid.  We shouldn't hold the fact that he didn't miraculously turn RPS around in four years because that was impossible.  Regardless of what he promised.

Not enough people are able to get a clear picture of the incremental changes (good or bad) that have happened in four years.  They just refuse to accept anything other than the picture Kamras painted, or they cannot get around the fact that the reality is nowhere close to the painting.  And those are the two viewpoints being pushed by the astroturfers on both sides.

The school construction was a MASSIVE fuck up.  And the school board had nothing to do with it.  Those are just objective facts.

Now going forward, we have to decide whether to forgive Kamras his fuck up because we just need Wythe built ASAP or we don't trust the school board to do better.  Or we take the power away from Kamras and Stoney.

But somehow we are arguing over whether the school construction projects were fucked or not.  And if they were, why it was somehow still the school board's fault.  

And anyone who disagrees with the other side is of course, racist.",t2_12plyx,ttd_76,0,1648236516.0,0,t1_i23r9lr,i23r9lr,False,VCUBNFO,t3_tnm04i,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/,Richmond School Board blocks Kamras from filling chief wellness officer role,/r/rva/comments/tnm04i/richmond_school_board_blocks_kamras_from_filling/i23r9lr/,3,r/rva,0,3

"Came here after graduating high school at an American school in Brussels, Belgium. VCU was the only university that paid attention to the instructions to send all communication by air mail (think mid 70's) and they were the first acceptance letter I received in time to start the fall semester in 1977. Two months after my arrival 2 other acceptance letters showed up at my parents house in Brussels. Fell in love with the city even back then before it went boom.

"Nah.  He redid the executive structure to get rid of people and positions so he could hire his own very high priced crew of people from DC, consolidate power, and have more control over things.

"Here's the reality:  From a structural perspective right now, there is no data supporting any slow down.  Too little supply being chased by WAY too much demand.  There are certainly differences across the market.  Not every neighborhood is commanding 143% over list price.

But we don't live in a vacuum. Look what's going on in the world.  Could the situation with Russia and Ukraine completely change the real estate market?  Probably.  I don’t know how and I don't know when.  But it could do something. What about a resurgence of Covid?  Inflation?  A recession?  Four interest rate hikes, like the Fed just announced?

"I pretty much vote for every project near me, which isn't all that much now.  But I used to do it in the Fan, too.

I think that if people were really that into urban environments, then downtown would not look like it is.  Like, is Scott's Addition truly ""urban infill?""  Or isn't it kinda more like we just created a new semi-urban environment out of an area that was previously not urban?  The area that passes for a ""city center"" or inner/urban core in Richmond has fared worse than the outer core of Fan/MD/SA.

But I'm not trying to pick on any one group.  I just think it's human nature to romanticize things, plus most of us probably come out as bigger assholes on social media than we are in person.  I'm also kind of a cynic and contarian by nature so I freely admit I have a bad tendency to zone in on any perceived hypocrisy.  

I feel like the Fan has gotten a little too rich and blah.  I miss the old days of VCU having a smaller campus and there being some cheap, crappy rental living throughout.  It has lost a lot of its edge and does not have the same energy.  But also, I was happy my house nearly tripled in value, I don't miss random people passing out on my front porch once a month, or crust punks breaking into my backyard constantly, or getting held up, or the crack house down the street, or getting blasted by music because every other house is someone's band rehearsal space (and I did it, too).

I always say this, but if the Fan were like it was back in 2000, many of the people who now clamor for more development there wouldn't actually want to live there.  Like you and I both remember when Richmond was not really such a coveted place to live.

Richmond has gotten more populated, dense, and urban in the last decade.  But it's also upscaled tremendously as well.  I find it hard to draw the line between people wanting to live in an urban area vs people wanting to live in an upscale area.

Going back to voting/supporting on things.  If they tried to build a public housing development near me, I'd vote ""yes."" But also, if that resulted in many of the problems that often come with public housing... I have enough money to move and probably would.  So I am aware that it's easy for me to vote for certain things and pat myself on the back because I can shield myself from the consequences if it doesn't work out.  The way the housing market is, I can't really shit on someone who had to stretch their finances and take a risk buying a house not wanting to take a 10% hit on like 70% of their net worth.",t2_12plyx,ttd_76,0,1648229319.0,0,t1_i2398co,i2398co,False,1975hh3,t3_tmwlij,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tmwlij/i_immediately_thought_of_this_sub_when_i_saw_this/,I immediately thought of this sub when I saw this.

What I HOPE is going to happen is that a RIGHT sized school is going to be built and done soon for the growing population on the southside. That’s what the community wants and what I want for them. What I think is going to happen is a few more rounds of arguing and then I really hope they (SB/CC) will compromise on an 1800 seat school with the ability to add on to and get it built by the end of 2024. In the meantime I’m working WITH the Wythe community to cook up some *right now* changes the broader Richmond community can help with to let them know they have not been forgotten. Once I know what is needed I’ll certainly post here.

Keep an eye out for ones run by people from Spanish speaking countries aka heladerías. They don't get the love that all the ""cool"" places get, but food place suggestions become an echo chamber fast in Richmond IMO. La Michoacana and Dulceria Minilandia are my favorite. They both have my favorite flavor in Richmond, vanilla with crushed up [Gansitos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansito) in them. Minilandia is the better one in that flavor, but in general they're both good ice cream. They're also cheaper than a lot of places that are more on the radar. You shouldn't have a problem speaking English at one.

"This starts to become a discussion on fair housing prices and who deserves to be able to buy. Even with a conventional loan with only 5% down plus closing costs a buyer would need $10,000 in cash plus a reserve of at least $3,500 (2% annual budget for repair and upkeep), not to mention that houses in the $175,000 range will likely need *some* work AND they likely have to have waived all inspections just to get into contract. 

For clarity I agree that housing costs in RVA and surrounding areas have historically been repressed and an adjustment was always on the way, regardless of covid.

"To be clear I do have an obvious bias against them and there are people who are far more capable of explaining this than I can on Twitter, I'd suggest searching for ""Richmond For All"" in Twitter search and looking at some of those posts.

But from what I can tell they call any sort of collective organizing against their interests ""big money"" when they themselves are essentially a dues collecting professional lobbying group. The most recent example I can think of is RPS parents coming together and paying for printing posters (something like a 100 dollars worth) and RFA called them out on that.

And while I'm not the biggest fan of Chelsea Higgs Wise, I do have to agree with her on calling out RFA (her former employer) and how the leadership co-ops movements in a pretty gross way.

"House on Park that went for $2M?  Don't know that one.  There was a house on Stuart - the 1900 block fronts Meadow Park - that listed for $995,000 and went for $1.25M.  At the time i thought that was crazy, but now it just looks ""normal.""  And one next to it listed for $1.15M, sold for $1.4M.  Who the heck knows anymore. 

The very recent one that sold immediately on Park I'm still pissed off about. I don't know what the deal was with that seller.  But in this market selling your house off market is dumb, because no one knows what the top of the market is.  Put it on the market for 3 days, for Lord's sake!

Now it is obviously the seller's right to do whatever they want to, and if they want to take an early offer they can. But it's usually not to a seller's advantage to do so.  It's like dual agency - if the buyer and seller are correctly advised they would never do it.  Wonder if that seller on Patterson is kicking themselves for taking an early offer when they see what recent Museum District listings close for.

"Re-posted from the last B/S/T:
Selling a mint condition, 7 day old, [2022 iPhone SE 3rd Generation.](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/)

This model just released last Friday. I pre-ordered it because I wanted to give it a spin to see if I was ready to jump to iPhone yet. If you are on an older iPhone and want to stick with touch ID instead of face ID, this is a good one to upgrade to. The phone is quite small, with a 4.7"" screen. Small and light enough to use one handed easily, which isn't something you can say about 90% of the modern phones out there. It very much reminds me of the older iPod touch, except you get:

* An A15 Bionic chip, hands down the fastest cell phone chip you can buy right now.
* 5G LTE.
* HDR4 and Deep Fusion camera.

I'm so used to bigger phones that it was harder than I thought to switch to a smaller one. My loss is your gain. The phone is mint, no scratches and to be completely honest I have only charged the phone 3 times, the battery life is pretty good for it being as small as it is.

Though I suspect it had everything to do with the quality of salmon used, and not necessarily a reflection of my cooking skills.
