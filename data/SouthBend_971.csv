"Last year they'd said they planned to get the bridge repaired ""in spring,"" but I haven't seen any more updates.  Right now, the leg of the trail from the race's end up to North Shore is also closed, since they're still working on that separate transmission line project, with most of the work focusing on the dog park area.  Originally the transmission line work was supposed to be done by last fall. 

You could though just cut over to Niles Ave. from the race's end, then once you get to the Niles/Leeper/Napoleon intersection, turn left onto Leeper and take the staircase up to the north end of the bridge, from which the trail is open.  Inconvenient, but could still be worth it if you're running the full trail starting from Veterans Memorial Park, or if you wanted to continue on past Angela to ND, LaSalle Trail or Riverside Trail.

"No, there's not a large British population but there's a couple handful, most of which work at the University. No one really cares where you're from.... It's an interesting conversation starter but that's about it. Just like most Universities in the states, there's a fairly diverse international population working/teaching there. 

There's a few options for food if you get homesick. Most of our UK food in South Bend will be ""Irish"" meaning you can get a fry-up or pub grub like fish and chips, scotch eggs, shepherd's pie, Carlsberg/Strongbow/Stella at places like Fiddlers Hearth (Irish-themed pub). They're the only place in all of South Bend that actually will have vinegar set out believe it or not. 

This stall at our farmers market supposedly sells English treats but haven't tried. https://www.facebook.com/thegbtreathouse/

Shops like Bambers are a bit dear but sell UK food.

In general English media, and obviously BBC content has been particularly mainstream in the states the last 5-10 years or so. Downton Abbey, Bake Off, Sherlock, The Crown, Doctor Who, Doc Martin, Peaky Blinders, Blackadder, Top Gear, Inbetweeners....shit too many to type.

"... I'm not sure why that would help him?

Edit: so It didn't seem like an empty dickish comment

1) They're different countries. Sure N. Ireland is part of the UK but that's like telling a Scottish expat that we have a soccer team called the South Bend Redcoats.... if that helps. 

2) The depth to which ND is Irish is pretty much limited to our use of a Leprechaun mascot (which Irish people typically view as tacky American tourist crap) 

3) Something something....colonialism, potato famine, N. Ireland, Brexit, the troubles, new calls for a unified Ireland... can make your comment a bit tone deaf to some.

Bonus Trivia: 

""One theory associates the popularity of the nickname to the visit from future President of the Republic of Ireland, Éamon de Valera, who had been part of the 1916 Easter Rising (insurrection against Brits where 485 died) and was imprisoned and sentenced to death. He was given amnesty, elected to Parliament and arrested by the authorities again. He escaped and slipped off to America to avoid recapture.

Mishawaka is extremely affordable, is growing, and has just about everything you'd need to feel comfortable. SBN airport can get you anywhere you want to recreate pretty easily now. It was a tiny regional airport when I was a kid. 

Notre Dame is a large part of the area's revenue growth and different economic areas are obvious. There are so many folks from all over the world that come to UND to study or teach, you will not have a problem finding a social group. MeetUp.com will be your best friend I bet. I saw Christopher Hitchens debate Dinesh D'Souza at UND years ago.

I visit my goddaughter in Mishawaka every summer and it's always a wonderful trip. The summers are beautiful. Lake Michigan is your weekend haven. No salt water, no sharks. Even my wife (an 8th generation Texan) loves visiting so much we went 3 times last year.

Wheelchair hockey is an amazing sport where athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities can competitively play together on the same floor!

Outside of these basic requirements, we will work with you to maximize your abilities, and get you in the game! 

Whether you are looking for a new recreational opportunity, a competitive outlet, or a sense of community, this is a great opportunity to find all of that and more!

Registration is open now until May 14th!

"Sure. One on the corner of Chapin and Washington st. A stone house, big, was turned into apartments. It had 8 bedrooms. Somebody bought it, and started to renovate it. They knocked a bunch of holes in the wall, tore out all of the plumbing, then pulled the furnace, (Or furnaces) out of it, because it's 8500 sf. Someone before, had shoved in some electric baseboard heaters into it. So it must have cost a small fortune to heat it. It's got a fieldstone basement. ( Not unusual for a house of that age) To me, it looks like it's built with decorative concrete block. Just like my basement walls, that are exposed below my siding, and above ground. I can find some houses with that feature around town, which makes me believe it's all constructed with that. (And the color is too even.) It's exactly the same color as concrete. I'd bet, a tape measure, a couple minutes and you'd find out that all of the block are the exact same measurement. One concrete drill, one hole would tell me if I'm right, or wrong.

Yeah, it's in a historic district. And two blocks over, you can get the chance to get shot at. (Or sit on the front porch on a summer evening and listen to the crickets, and driveby shootings.) The name associated with it, is Kizer. What he's famous for, I don't know. Somebody bought the place, and dumped a bunch of money into the exterior of it. Outside, it looks good. inside is trashed. And they want 350K for it. It's been for sale for four years, off and on. Park a nice car outside of it, it won't stay nice for long. Oh, and it sits on a postage stamp sized lot.

Another one was over on North Main in Mishawaka. It was an old rundown building, with a couple stores in it, and some apartments above it. It got bought, and demo'ed. People hollared about it, because at one time somebody shopped there. It looked crummy on the outside, it probably looked just as bad inside.

State theater is another. That, people thought it would get fixed up. But nobody was willing to dump one mil plus into it.

Another one I saw personally, two blocks east of Michigan st. And old church. That was ONE HUGE FIRETRAP! They wanted me to work on it. It was a black hole, everything needed fixing. Busted plaster on the floors everywhere. Hot electric wires laid on the floors! Broken windows, Electric service, I don't know how the hell they managed to get it turned on. A roof was leaking directly on the main service panel. It was supposed to be some sort of mission. They begged to get a couple of Pellet stoves from TSC in it for heat in a couple rooms. I talked to the.... owner, I guess. It felt like if I worked on that mess, I'd NEVER get paid. When I walked out of that, I STAYED OUT! I wasn't going to be held Libel for anything I'd do in that joint. I was even glad I rode my Motorcycle there. If I drove my truck, I'd be short all of my tools. (It's surrounded by SB's Homeless population)

Some houses, yes I could see putting money into them. But where is the line drawn? Harrison's down on No. Miami street. Some tenant got mad because his girlfriend was seeing some other guy.  He took her clothing, threw it out on the roof, and set fire to it-And it gutted the building! The walls are still standing. Someone bought it last year, and started to rebuild the insides of it. Obviously without a permit. The floors are in it, a roof, and a red tag sits on it. A stop work order on it by the building department. The outside was rather unique, a little porch on the second floor on the streetside. With the price of lumber right now, I highly doubt it will ever be finished. Provided they can get a release from the building department. (Which I doubt. It's a commercial building. That needs Engineers Prints, State approval, and I don't see ANY engineer willing to risk his state licence over that.)

... Every class warrior loves to bring up gentrification in South Bend and shoehorn it into every conversation. Things getting better in South Bend is not always gentrification for christs sake. 

Having your 70 year old apartment building demolished because they kept rent down the last 3 decades by deferring maintenance. No they can't build a brand new building in this economy and keep your rent at $500 a month. If they had been doing the larger capital investments in it that would have prevented it from being torn down, you wouldn't have been able to afford to live there either.

"The problem is that other landlords in other parts of the city and county thought that meant they could jack prices up too. Just because rich Domer kids' parents are willing to shell out that kind of money for a single room in a house doesn't mean all the landlords across the county should be following suit. 
  I lived in that county from August 1991 to August 2018. Housing was not always this expensive. 
   
  Hamilton County is not only a suburb of a big city but is one of the most affluent counties in the state with great schools. It is a very desirable place to live. These are things that tend to make housing far more expensive. 


I also said the last apartment we rented up there was by Costco. It had a Granger address. Rent was still more per square foot and the complex had far fewer amenities than what we got in Fishers.

"We moved to the area (Granger) a few months ago and just signed a contract on a house a few weeks ago. Everyone has different expectations for housing, of course, but like you, we wanted something in a nice neighborhood, with decent schools, for $250K. 

We spent MONTHS online researching housing costs in the SB area and figuring out which neighborhoods would be ideal before we relocated. We had all the data, and we thought we were going to buy a nice little home in a historic neighborhood, pay it off quickly, and start saving for retirement. The reality was quite different.

If you have looked at used cars in the past 6 months, expect to find the same thing in the housing market. People are selling absolute junk, and they're selling high. In nicer neighborhoods, the price per square foot rivals larger cities (eg, Chicago). Near Notre Dame, the prices are absolutely baffling. We had to double our budget before we found something that checked most of our boxes. We didn't find anything that checked them all.

Our rental home is in the southern part of Granger, where it becomes Mishawaka, and we like the area. Traffic can be a little heavy, but the drivers are mostly courteous. It seems to be safe, and it is close to healthcare facilities and shopping. We actually tried to find a home in the immediate area, but nothing came on the market--at any price--while we were actively looking. 

Our youngest child is attending PHM schools; they're good schools, but WOW, we were not expecting the out-of-pocket costs to be so high. (It was something like $150 in fees for the semester just for books and ""technology licensing"" for a middle schooler.) Maybe all public Indiana schools are like that and we just weren't aware?

I'm slightly familiar with the Georgetown area and the area over toward 933 (not sure if it's also considered Georgetown).  It seems to have pockets of older, smaller homes interspersed with pockets of very large, very new, very expensive homes. The area zones to South Bend schools; the district changes to PHM on the east side of Gumwood Rd. Indiana allows you to apply to send your child to any school, as I understand it, but only magnet program kids at public schools receive bus transportation outside the usual attendance zone. 

Be forewarned that a lot of the houses north of the toll road have well/septic instead of city water/sewer. (Some people are fine with it, but I had poor experiences in the past and didn't want to deal with well or septic issues again.) From what I have seen, most houses in Mishawaka have city water/sewer.

I don't have a specific realtor recommendation, but I do recommend interviewing a few of them before settling on one. Buying a home is a big investment, and it's okay to be picky when choosing an agent. Ask them to send you a few listings via email and see if they understand your wish list before you commit. None of the realtors I have contacted have been remotely surprised that I wanted to give them a ""test run.""",t2_82szrzjm,squirrelsatemyphone,0,1647048924.0,0,t1_i0bfoml,i0bfoml,True,Fireflyy85,t3_t6pvz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/t6pvz7/best_realtor_and_areas_to_live/,Best realtor and areas to live,/r/SouthBend/comments/t6pvz7/best_realtor_and_areas_to_live/i0bfoml/,3,r/SouthBend,0,3

"Yes those three neighborhoods near Notre Dame have been gentrified in the traditional sense of the word. But they make up 6% of the population of the city. One of those - Harter Heights - has been a top 3 neighborhood in terms of cost for basically it's entire 100 year history. It's always been on of the most expensive in SB.

Is Mishawaka gentrifying? Is Granger gentrifying? Is Edwardsburg? 

They all have seen large price increases - larger than SB - over the last two years but it's not gentrification. Again just using that word for any price increase is reducing the topic of housing to not make any sense.

Like gambling? We have a casino in South Bend, another in Michigan City (to the west, accessible by the South Shore Commuter train), and a major one in Michigan (45 minute drive).

Zoos! The Potawatomi Zoo is on the east side of South Bend, just recently opened for the season. The Washington Park Zoo in Michigan City (again, accessible by South Shore train) is an okay zoo as well.

"I'm a building contractor who does quite a bit of problem solving for my customers. Traveling from job to home centers and back can add a lot of miles to my day. Come spring, and warmer days, I'll revert back to what saved me money, when gas went through the roof in past years. 

Motorcycle + utility trailer. Sound nuts? Not really. Tools dropped into the trailer, a ladder strapped to the top, off I go to work. Most of the time, I can get away with using a six or eight foot ladder for work. Supplies can be hauled that way. ( up to ten feet)  A bike becomes more visible going down the street hauling that around. ( I know that just from the comments I get from drivers at stop lights!) An average 3-4 days a week by bike, with a trip or two by truck, can really add to your bottom line. Customer calls, doing estimates, or just chasing around on two wheels for small stuff doesn't dent your wallet. I'll even do groceries with mine. (A big touring bike can stow away two weeks worth of that, easy) A trailer behind a bike becomes a necessity in times like this. ( Why I own a couple of them.)

What is GOING to make me flinch, is dropping $20 worth of gas into my big touring bike.

"Oh good luck with that! I just watched my friends, son go through that. Now, the son was a rock through it all. His father wasn't by a long shot! I became his go to for griping about it.

The son's wife, was a real BUM! She screwed around on him, did drugs, would vanish for days, she was quite the ugly person to all concerned. She even accused both grandparents of abusing the kids. (IT DID NOT HAPPEN!) She is a real nutcase.

Of course, I do know there are always two sides to every argument. My suggestion- think slow, don't react with emotions. Work your problems one at a time. Show that you are the stable party. Keep in mind that kids can be rehearsed and coerced into saying the wrong things at the wrong times. Another friend of mine's, brother, got into hot water over rehearsed lies about him sexually abusing his son, which he did NOT do.

What you HAVE to do, is sit back and wait for your soon-to-be-ex, to hang herself during your proceedings. It will be exasperating for you. Much like what my brother-in-law's EX did to him.

What you need, is a conscientious contractor that's willing to do the correct job. And, its not a union, or a licenced contractor. In this county, enough money can buy anyone a contractor's licence.  It doesn't matter if you know everything, or nothing about it. They are supposed to pay you back for unfinished, contracted work. You won't get it until put in a claim in on their bond, and sue them.

Contractors come and go in this town. I've seen too many that looked conscientious, had regular business offices, advertised a lot, and bailed in five years or less. Some, no, they are very good and reliable. Your best bet, is hire one that has referrals up the wazoo from former customers.  ( Or in my case, Constant customers.

I was impressed at the service, I was comfortable with the doctors (the other doctor who owns the practice came and took a look and talked to me too). I also felt the price they charged me was extremely fair, not just for the circumstances but in general. They charged a small fee because it was an emergency, but even with that fee, the xrays, and the new filling, it was less than $500.

"It's the fucking DailyMail. You know what? You're the personification of the Daily Mail. 

1) As we've discussed, the mayor doesn't award construction contracts. 

2) Even that term awarded is bullshit. Highest on the list is The  Cascade who didn't get a 5 million dollar contract. They got 5 million in TIF on a 38.5 million project because the city really wanted the east bank investment. Do you know who awards TIF? The Common Council, definitely not the mayor's ""inner circle"". Goes completely against your conspiracy theories then right? 

The article is cherry picking, trying to find donors from among hundreds of million of dollars of work between city projects and TIF recipients. 

That's the biggest ticket item on there and you're trying to tell me someone's $3,000 campaign donation got them 5 million in TIF? Well shit that makes perfect sense Veritasplum.

"For your budget and wanting to be close to Notre Dame, the Near Northwest Neighborhood sounds ideal especially the properties between Portage and the River. 

It's a beautiful neighborhood five min from ND and has been improving a lot over the past two decades. Some of the most beautiful housing stock too. The neighborhood organization is very involved and done much to stabilize the neighborhood, building new homes and rehabbing old ones. 

As for buying old homes, I'd be more comfortable buying an old home with a good inspection than a brand new home. I own a 1930s home and it's built like a tank. Way over engineered and has been great. Everything with houses older than 20 years begins to need replacing so at some point doesn't really matter if a house is from the 80s or the 20s.

"It's crazy right?  You're looking for a 200k house in South Bend, and all we can recommend is places like Near Northwest, River Park, and Mishawaka.  Harter's Heights was a great spot in that price range 18 months ago, but it's probably way out of your price range now.  Same for Swanson Highlands/East Georgetown (especially south of cleveland), which would have been my first recommendation.  Insane where prices went.  $200k was pick of the litter 2 years ago.  


Near Northwest, and really a lot of spots along the river on the west bank, are really neat neighborhoods.  Drive through and check them out.  I've seen some amazing homes there for $200k in the last 6 months of shopping myself.  Those neighborhoods are changing, and will continue to do so as prices skyrocket.  But still check the crime maps on Trulia and other sources, as (as others have said) this town's crime is street by street, especially along the Portage Ave. corridor.  Drive up Portage and make circles through the neighborhoods, you'll see for yourself it changes fast.  


On the fringes of what's acceptable, I'd recommend looking around the tiny home neighborhoods north of Dragoon Trail, say around North of Marian High School.  They're absolutely lower than your budget, and smaller than I think you imagine.  But driving through in summer I've always thought ""What a cute 1950's neighborhood.  If I was a budding family, my kids would have adventures and friends here--befriending an Extra Terrestrial, or fighting an evil clown.""  Just drive through, especially in the spring. You got nothing to lose.  You'll see quick--small, but cute.  Children thick like flies, so watch your speed.  


Keep an eye out and play the long game--but be ready to pounce.  You WILL find some real beauties out here for $180-200k if you're fast.  So don't get discouraged.  Over 6 months of shopping (at the <$150K range) I know I have.  But I've seen some awesome homes come on the market and go to someone much faster than I am.  Don't get discouraged, your home is here somewhere!  


And as for flipped homes, I have a litmus test.  if there's one of those god-awful bowl sinks in the bathroom, or a barn door with no godly reason for existing, I pass it up as a cheap flip.

"Wow. Ok ok ok. Where do I start?!?! 

I was born here in SB then lived on the west coast, then in Mexico, and somehow found my way back here to the 574, or the dirty 71, or whatever u want to call this town, for a number of reasons. But I appreciate you doing your homework and I’m surprised that you’ve gotten a few of these answers / advice. But here goes nothing:

First of all, for $200k you can get a BALLER house. Do you like never talking to neighbors? Like big quickly built homes with septic tanks and wells? Want WASP neighbors? Then granger is perfect for you. The only thing cool about Granger is Barehands brewing. Other than that…well, there’s a reasons townies and locals dog it. It is a zip code full of Karen’s and Chads. 

I recently bought a place in River Park neighborhood…I got a 3 bd 2 ba house with a huge garage and a yard, a block away from Adams HS for $82k. The place was turnkey perfect. Built in 1900. I had help from Rocky Verteramo, a local realtor who I went to school with as a kid. He is Deep South bend blood and is honest. I can’t recommend him enough. 

Now in my opinion the top neighborhoods in SB for first time home buyers are river park / sunnymede area, near northwest neighborhood (Leland, all the way to park avenue and the neighborhood near leeper park / memorial hospital (the historic district), the clay high school area (juniper/Cleveland area up to Auten)…harter heights is awesome, but spendy, and the north shore triangle rocks for great homes which are well built and cared for with cool neighbors. It’s close to nd and the river. 

Look, my dad worked his entire career at ND and the bubble thing is true, but existing in a neighborhood where people do other stuff is all it takes to pop the bubble.

"Happy to chat privately but here’s my 2 cents:

1.  Neighborhood crime can be extremely localized.  Granger is the default answer but most of the area is relatively safe.  Any recent crime map will show clusters that correspond with the “bad” neighborhoods.  

2.  I’m assuming you want a 3 bed/2 bath.  At this price point you’ll be in competition with  a ton of buyers.  If you’re willing to lose a bed/bath or basement your search becomes much more doable.  

3.  Flipped homes can be great or a nightmare.  Ask who did the work.  Are they licensed?  Do they have a portfolio?  A good realtor with minimal construction knowledge should at least be able to steer you away from a nightmare house.

"I've gone through the process with both and I guess I'd choose to work with a team again. It was nice because if our realtor couldn't make it to a showing then someone else on her team would. Plus, she had a team of people in the office to help with all the tasks required of homebuying.

Those companies you mentioned are huge and have so many realtors that you could have vastly different experiences just based on who your primary realtor is. I would set up some interviews. Remember, you're a valuable commodity here so, interview at least 3 realtors and pick the one you liked best.

Keep in mind this is a competitive market so having someone that is a good negotiator will be helpful but also remember that this is your first time so having someone you can trust to guide you through the process is important too. We went with McKinnies Realty in Mishawaka for our home purchase. They were great negotiators but a bit hands-off on finding a house--we had to be the initiators to see all of the houses from the portal.

As far as neighborhoods go, the only place I've really heard of to absolutely avoid is the west side of SB. Other than that, I would take the advice of another commenter and drive around the neighborhood before buying. Be sure to ask your Realtor too because they have a ton of knowledge on this.

Price point is reasonable but, by far, the most competitive. Like, you'll likely need to pay 10-20k over asking for a nice house and you won't be the only offer. If you're up against a cash offer it's over.

I bought a flipped house previously and honestly, it just depends on who did the work. When you walk through a house, check behind, under, around everything because sometimes the improvements are just surface level, and other times you get lucky and a decent contractor did the work the right way.

As for Realtors, that depends on your style. Do you want a team or would you rather work with a single person? There are pros and cons to each so I would consider that before you decide which direction to go.

"Its a neighborhood aesthetic thing. The original plan was to keep downtown separate and distinct and for East Race to be its own thing. The two districts have kind of blended together though, and IMO it makes sense to allow tall developments in East Race due to its proximity to DTSB and the Eddy Street area, it kind of allows it to be a bridge between DTSB and Notre Dame. Hopefully they will revisit that eventually. 

Ideally they would remove the height restrictions completely, but a good reform, I think, would be to designate a certain area (all or part of DTSB) that has no height restriction, then say you can build as tall as tallest building in a certain radius of your building site (1 mile would allow building anything as tall as Liberty Tower throughout all of East Race, 0.5 mile would allow to about 300E Lasalle, but then that would enable the rest of East Race to build as tall as 300E Lasalle). So at first you would need to build tall buildings close to DTSB, but gradually the high limit would rise and expand as things got built up. Residential zones would largely still be low, but if you have a church nearby or something, that might raise things to allow a 4 story condo building or mixed use building on the corner.

""Some officials and business owners became concerned...""

And

""Opponents of the plan said they learned about 30 people have already been living at the building, some of them for months""

"I moved here from Chicago (I'm here to be with my family).  I'm old, but I was young when there was a [major balcony collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Chicago_balcony_collapse#Investigation) in an apartment building.  I was shook because I lived in Chicago and it was incredibly common for everyone to hang out on a balcony at every single party.  This could have easily happened to me.  Read specifically this:

\> it was ultimately determined that poor construction was to blame. In 1998, a permit was issued to owner LG Properties to install furnaces, air conditioners and water heaters in the building, but not to build the balcony.\[5\] The balcony jutted out eleven feet from the building, one foot farther than permitted by city codes, and had an area of 231 square feet (21.5 m2), 81 square feet (7.5 m2) larger than permitted.\[5\] The balcony also had inadequate supports,\[5\] was floored with undersized lengths of wood, and was attached to the walls with screws that were too short.\[1\]

&#x200B;

Yes, the article gives doubts, but this piece is crystal clear, ""The balcony was not built to code; that code was written carefully by engineers to make sure people weren't hurt.  The company cheeped out and didn't build to code"".

&#x200B;

So when I hear that a building isn't built to code, I would want to know what those violations were and why.

"There is a very good chance that this veto can and will be overruled by the County Council who originally unanimously approved this funding 8-0. If you support this vital housing project the best thing you can do is write to your Council member and encourage them to overturn the veto, or to the County Commissioners to voice your displeasure.

In regards to the Matthews building. I personally don't know all of the specifics as to the zoning and what has led up to where we are now, I do know that no federal, state, or local funds are being used to pay for units in that building. The formerly homeless individuals living there are paying their own rent.

Homelessness is a complex issue with a large number of contributing factors but one of the major problems we are facing in South Bend and the greater Michiana area right now is a massive shortage of affordable housing and new housing options and units will need to become available if we are going to make progress. Even when service agencies are able to secure Section 8 or Housing Choice Vouchers for clients it is very difficult to find housing to move them into. There are a large number of homeless on the street or in shelters right now on disability and receiving SSDI and there are just no affordable housing options available to them.

No, you just said outlined the problem itself. They are usually (almost always) appointed lackeys to simply do the bidding of whoever appointed them. This applies to Mishawaka and the County as well.

Literally the three people you point out technically have no business on that commission (as it is intended to be) as they each represent a massive ethical conflict of interest.

"TL;DR I 100% agree with both of your posts on Elkhart and South Bend! ESPECIALLY Elkhart! It's a craphole!😅


First of all, sorry for the long rant. This has been building up inside me for awhile and seeing someone with the similar opinion is great!
Have to say I agree with your comments on Elkhart.
I unfortunately live here (born and raised, moved away and I regrettably came back 4yrs ago). South Bend sucks but Elkhart is a nightmare. 

It's always been a sh*thole but when I got back I realized how much worse its gotten. I'm ashamed and embarrassed to even admit I am from here🤣.

So boring. There is nothing to do. Indiana in general is mainly corn fields and factories. Ahh, let's not forget all the banks, gas stations, and car lots! All they ever seem to build is banks, gas stations, and freaking car lots. 
Like we don't already have ENOUGH of all of those😂.
We have no big cities. 
Indianapolis is nothing compared to cites in other states. There isnt any good shops. Everything in Elkhart is cheaply made, over priced BS. All we have near where I am located that doesnt take over 30mins to get to(usually more depending on traffic)is a freaking Walmart. I hate that store. 
UP mall in Mishawaka doesn't even have that much anymore. I was so disappointed last time I went. Cheaply made clothing at inflated prices that looks like it'll fall apart after the 1st wash🙄

Unfortunately the factories(especially RV manufacturers) pressure their employees so hard to ""kick a**"" that many turn to using substances just keep up the daily grind. Sadly it's breaking down their bodies at the same time and adding an unhealthy amount of unnecessary stress. 
I knew a lady that actually had an aneurysm due to the stress her supervisor put on her. Shockingly, despite her Dr's advice to never return to work there, she did! Never heard much about her since.
But the ""breed"" of people in Elkhart (not all, but a good majority) are the types you can't trust. If they try to be friendly, it's only to try to scam or steal from you. Usually drug addicts. Not to say that all addicts are that way since addiction is very complex and depends on the person, but there is a ""type"" here in Elkhart I've noticed when out in public. Otherwise, most people are cold-hearted, entitled selfish and rude. 
It's so refreshing getting friendly service anywhere and I always appreciate it. I try treating others the way I would want to be treated. 
Due to not wanting any drama, I stay to myself. I am an introvert and love it that way. Nowadays I only go out when I absolutely have to.

"It’s not to crazy but I’ll tell you what happened. Well some friends and I a few months back decided it would be good idea to end the night with some drinks and cheap greasy food at Gs. We walk in and sit at a booth and wait for the waitress to take our order. Well here comes this 5 5” bald mid 50s bouncer with a handle bar mustache and shitty prison tattoos showing from his sleeveless leather vest. “Let’s see some IDs”. No bid deal we get how it is. He takes like 5 minutes to look at each one and at each of our faces while the waitress stands awkwardly behind him the whole time waiting. 
“You guys better not start any shit tonight”
“Oh don’t worry about us haha”
“We have a lot of veterans working tonight and we just don’t know when to stop. It’s how we’re trained. They’ll need the cops to pull us off one of you guys” 
I start laughing because as a veteran with PTSD the last thing I would do is go around bragging about being fucked up but hey maybe this dude is just really badass? We all start playing along and saying things like “wo! We will be careful then!” And the what not. The guy took that as us being interested and just started blabbing about his life in the 82nd airborne and how he doesn’t sleep at night and will just “fuck someone up”.  we were so impressed and said about a dozen “wows” and “that’s crazy man” hoping he was like a normal human and would get the social cue, this was a mistake. He finally walked off to the door with his chest puffed out. We finally get some drinks and are food comes out and before I can even bite into my tendies this dude walks back over and starts talking about how his wife grew up Catholic.
“Okay….”
“Well then I got with her and now she does whatever I tell her hehe. Gets on all fours and let’s me give it to her however I want hehe. You know then Catholic girls will get really nasty when you teach them”
Half the table is either high or drunk at this point and the utter confusion and panic had set in at the realization of this dude advertising his wife’s ass to us. He then points over to the bar where a woman looking a tad on the “rough” side is staring at our table. The bouncer is at this point placing his hands on our tables and leaning in breathing heavy and talking about the dirty shit his wife let’s him do and how bad of a girl she is. Usually I get if people are messing with me but this dude was honestly dead serious about sharing this shit. Lmao it was just so freaking weird man.

Simeri’s: it’s on the west side of south bend. Best music venue imo

Zullys: in ‘old’ Granger. Mainly an older crowd, I’m usually on the much younger side as a 38yr old. 

Brothers: it’s got a younger crowd but best specials. Will get a bit sketchy on its busy nights

Linebacker: I find enjoyable to get a beer on the nights students aren’t active, nice to go to in the summertime. 

ORourkes: another campus bar. Much preferred when it opened. I can’t stand it now. Beer lines always give funky taste.

Bar Louie: if I was looking for a divorcee, 40+ women, I’d head here.
