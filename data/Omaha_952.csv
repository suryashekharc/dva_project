It'd be nice if you could make a day/evening of a game by having the stadium somewhere where people could get drinks and a meal before/afterward, then walk to/from the stadium. That's more the issue of plopping down a stadium in the middle of a cornfield. It's another game day atmosphere killer to drive into a mammoth parking lot to walk into a mammoth stadium that feels far less than full. It'd be nice to have it in a place where it feels like the whole area gets a little pumped up by the event of a game that night: other fans in the bars, people in team gear just walking around, etc. 

I know this kind of experience is somewhat foreign to sports fans here who drive to Kansas City whose baseball and football stadiums are islands in a sea of parking lots (not so for Children's Mercy) or to UNL's on-campus stadium, but other cities have done well to make their stadiums the center of a larger entertainment area.

"I can watch a live soccer game at UNO or Creighton and be closer to the action, not have to drive as far, and not have to pay as much. I want to go to support the local XI for the atmosphere more than just the sport. 

Admittedly, some things probably just cannot be fixed. The field itself is pretty distant and sight lines aren't great. There isn't much that can be done about that. 

Setting that aside, the fans are too spread out. The Parliament is literally behind a wall distant from many of the other fans in a very difficult place to see the game or be seen at the game. While I might not want to be a part of the supporters group, having them animate the crowd and the game is so important to the soccer experience, yet it's like the club wants to keep them away from the regular folks. (Or maybe they chose to be where they are?)

Move the Supporters in. Focus on getting a crowd to fill certain areas to keep the excitement close together rather than diffused across a giant baseball stadium. 

I want to celebrate as part of a community. Pump up the in-game atmosphere from random-night-out-in-the-suburbs and youth-soccer-group-tickets to unique-fan-experience. It doesn't feel like the club is doing anything to foster that kind of atmosphere.

"It’s my concern because one of the main arguments for this plan is that the streetcar will be a positive economic stimulus because it will increase traffic brought to downtown via commuters. But based on what I know about corporate culture here in Omaha, people who work down here are commuting from out west, which means this is only adding an unnessecary step to their already long commutes. Which means I don’t foresee it actually being used by commuters. I see it being used by people who already live here. In which case why does it need to circulate around the MoO building? Why can’t we convert the Dale W Clark into a transit station or some other public work (sponsored by Mutual) and move the MoO tower over a block?

I think that’s where we’re disconnecting. I don’t believe people who commute to work will be interested in this service (I could be wrong! But once again I feel like that’s something that should be better researched before this plan is finalized), in which case we’re only appealing to people who are living downtown. So if this service is for everyone who’s interested in living downtown, then why center it around Mutual? Why link all our bus routes around a private office building if this transport system is truly for the good of the community? 

I apologize again if you think I’m backtracking. What I’m trying to do is not argue with you because I can tell we have similar values (strong urban core, strong public transport) while also making clear where I stand on the issue.

"There was a good article in the New Yorker about her:

[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court)

Here's a quote from it:

When Clarence Thomas met Ginni Lamp, in 1986, he was an ambitious Black conservative in charge of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—and she was even more conservative and better connected than he was. Her father ran a firm that developed housing in and around Omaha, and her parents were Party activists who had formed the backbone of Barry Goldwater’s campaign in Nebraska. The writer Kurt Andersen, who grew up across the street from the family, recalls, “Her parents were the roots of the modern, crazy Republican Party. My parents were Goldwater Republicans, but even they thought the Lamp family was nuts.” Ginni graduated from Creighton University, in Omaha, and then attended law school there. Her parents helped get her a job with a local Republican candidate for Congress, and when he won she followed him to Washington. But, after reportedly flunking the bar exam, she fell in with a cultish self-help group, Lifespring, whose members were encouraged to strip naked and mock one another’s body fat. She eventually broke away, and began working for the Chamber of Commerce, opposing “comparable worth” pay for women. She and Thomas began dating, and in 1987 they married. As a woman clashing with the women’s movement, she had found much in common with Thomas, who opposed causes supported by many Black Americans. At Thomas’s extraordinarily contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings, in 1991, Anita Hill credibly accused him of having sexually harassed her when she was working at the E.E.O.C. Ginni Thomas later likened the experience to being stuck inside a scalding furnace. Even before then, a friend told the Washington Post, the couple was so bonded that “the one person \[Clarence\] really listens to is Virginia.”",t2_3kju6kmx,astrashe2,0,1648219558.0,0,t1_i22k6xq,i22k6xq,True,bengibbardstoothpain,t3_tnewzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/tnewzt/today_i_learned_that_clarence_thomas_wife_is_from/,Today I Learned that Clarence Thomas' Wife is from Omaha,/r/Omaha/comments/tnewzt/today_i_learned_that_clarence_thomas_wife_is_from/i22k6xq/,15,r/Omaha,0,15

">I don’t understand what you mean “choosing to spend more for something they like less”? The point I was trying to make is that if the commute is hell for Mutual employees then they will just quit or not come to work, which will mean that the office building will not be performing at a productive capacity, which means it’s not a good investment. 

And how is any of that your or my concern? People are smart and do what's best for them, but moving a building from Midtown Crossing to downtown is hardly a change.

>Do I want that? No. I live downtown a block away from my workplace, but whenever we do company lunches, events, etc. All of those events take place in boys town because it’s “closer to everyone”.

"I am not say opening a dialogue is wrong, but Mutual of Omaha is business and their going to make business decisions. And to assume that the City did not get some input is frankly ridiculous. With just about any development, especially one of this magnitude you can guarantee the City and MoO have been working and negotiating for months if not longer. 

If by city you meant the citizens, then I would add that there is process by which citizens can express their view, which it sounds like you will be doing. How much swing they actually have is up for debate, but their was success in the past of blocking the tear down of the building near the the Holland.

"I don’t understand what you mean “choosing to spend more for something they like less”? The point I was trying to make is that if the commute is hell for Mutual employees then they will just quit or not come to work, which will mean that the office building will not be performing at a productive capacity, which means it’s not a good investment. 

I think our conversation is out of step with each other. I suppose what it comes down to is that based on my lifetime living in Omaha, the corporate culture here is you get a good paying job then you move out west where you can buy/build a house with all the space and parking you want. 

Do I want that? No. I live downtown a block away from my workplace, but whenever we do company lunches, events, etc. All of those events take place in boys town because it’s “closer to everyone”. Is it logical, not in my mind no, but that’s the culture I’ve seen in Omaha. And while I agree it should change, I don’t think it’s going to change because people will be forced to come into work downtown, because in my experience that’s not enough of a motivator.",t2_34s4ygmb,rebelmary16,0,1648215670.0,0,t1_i22azxj,i22azxj,False,rebelmary16,t3_tmhf3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/tmhf3o/the_city_council_public_hearing_to_discuss_tif/,The city council public hearing to discuss TIF funding for the Mutual skyscraper is on Tuesday @2pm.,/r/Omaha/comments/tmhf3o/the_city_council_public_hearing_to_discuss_tif/i22azxj/,1,r/Omaha,0,1

"Phrasing was terrible there, my apologies. There are more people living in urban areas (population), yet the rural areas make up a much larger percentage of the state so far as area/land-mass. That was the point I am trying to make. Beyond Omaha, Lincoln, and maybe Grand Island/Fremont/Norfolk type towns, the entire state is rural.

When I own .25-1 acre of land for my home, and they raise taxes on property only, then urban tax payers would see minimal increases, while rural tax payers would see massive increases. If farmers/ranchers see massive increases, those get passed on to consumers. Or, so, I imagine the argument from law-makers would be. Otherwise, I am confused on how land value isn't also increasing.

Not only that but we enjoy much nicer amenities for what our taxes go to vs where I'm from. Roads are better, cleared faster, parks are nicer, and schools are better.

Like I said, it's perspective.  No one likes tax increases, especially me, but we're still paying lower taxes and getting a better bang for our buck so to speak than other places.

"You mention giving the phone to the police, but did you actually file a police report? If so, the lead officer likely gave you their contact information, along with the case number. If you don't have that information, you can try calling the [Victim Assistance Program](https://countyattorney.douglascounty-ne.gov/victim-assistance). But since you already recovered the car, this is going to be extremely low on their priority list.

Also, there's no way this ever gets charged as a felony, let alone a Class II felony. If this results in charges at all, it's much more likely to be something like [unauthorized use of a propelled vehicle](https://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=28-516), which is a misdemeanor. Since they're kids, my guess is this would go to diversion, which could involve the kids (that is, their parents) paying you back, but I wouldn't count on the criminal justice system to get you restitution. You don't get to choose their punishment, and you don't really participate at all in the prosecution.

You *could* sue the kids and their parents for the value of whatever was lost or damaged, but I'm guessing that would cost you more than you would be able to recover. Most lawyers will give you a free consultation, but I'm guessing most of them will tell you you're unlikely to get much out of a lawsuit in a situation like this.

"I work for a siding and window company and unfortunately windows have gone up in price a lot the last 2 years. Be careful and definitely shop around to compare. Make sure you ask what you're getting as well, a lot of companies sell new windows but will actually sell you inserts, which is just cutting the glass portion of a window and leaving your jamb, then putting a new insert window inside the old jamb then cover the old rotted wood with aluminum. We run into home owners all the time having no idea they didn't get new windows jamb and all. They are cheaper and can be quicker to do so the company can charge you less than brand new windows but make more profit for them. They are fine if that's what you want but just make sure what you're getting is what you want. I've installed many different brands of windows and Pella is a great window but you do pay a little more for the name imo. We use a window called Hayfield often that are really good for the price. I'm not a huge fan of Anderson as an installer but never really heard much about them if people like them in their houses or not. Marvin is also a great window but a little expensive for the name. When it comes down to it just do your research, which seems like you are, and shop around and ask questions to be comfortable with the company and with what you're getting. It's a big investment these days and you should feel comfortable with who you're using knowing you're spending your money well.",t2_hlog6uj,bjeezy10,0,1648173041.0,0,t1_i20g1ed,i20g1ed,True,mercipourleslivres,t3_tmdp3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/tmdp3o/window_replacements/,Window Replacements?,/r/Omaha/comments/tmdp3o/window_replacements/i20g1ed/,5,r/Omaha,0,5

"Not to be pedantic, but it's not ""hurting"" farmers. It's getting them to pay for the public resources they have benefited from and will benefit from in the future. 

In simple economic theory, yes it could drive up costs elsewhere, but the way the USDA uses federal tax dollars to incentive crop insurance and conservation programs makes the analysis much more complicated. 

There are other ways to offset an urban-rural food economic system and that is to grow food in urban areas. This is a relatively new idea where food is grown in hydroponic vertical structures, using much less water and chemical fertilizers. Shifting to a tax regime to incentive this production could offset those costs.

I saw a graph the other day that showed that Texas has higher taxes than California for basically every income bracket less than $216,000. So the idea that conservatives lower taxes is a myth in reality. It’s only true on paper unless you are not just well off but stinking rich.

Edit: Conservatives are masterful at tricking people into thinking they are getting a tax break. See Trump’s “tax break” which was really just an under-withholding of taxes people ultimately had to pay when taxes were filed, reducing or eliminating tax refunds many people received prior or leaving people who previously got small tax refunds now owing additional tax at filing time.

"Allowing property owners leniency in taxes while property values rise removes any of their motivation to care about the housing crisis, something they already benefit from, and punts its negative effects to the people who can't own anything in this current market; i.e: people who are already poorer than them.

The one state I can think of that currently implements this proposed cap on property tax increases, California, currently has this problem. They are in the middle of the worst housing shortage in the nation, and yet time and time again, their neighborhoods vote against allowing new units to be constructed, since the people in the neighborhood already own a home, and therefore have no reason to care about the skyrocketing housing prices.

I understand that higher taxes are nauseating, but the correct response is to demand the money be used for constructing affordable housing, which will lead to lower property values, and therefore lower taxes.",t2_165yhp,60hzcherryMXram,0,1648150195.0,0,t1_i1yxnqs,i1yxnqs,True,Nythoren,t3_tmnuxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/tmnuxq/property_value_increases/,Property Value Increases,/r/Omaha/comments/tmnuxq/property_value_increases/i1yxnqs/,5,r/Omaha,0,5

"They dd the same thing in Lincoln as well.  I checked with a lot of homes sub $500k and it seemed most of them went up 15-20%.  Only checked one home much higher than that (around $700k) and that house went down a few bucks.

The more concerning thing to me... if people are not familiar with how this works with their escrow they could put themselves in really bad situations if they can't afford to pay the shortage.  If your payments if going up $150 and you don't realize the timing on everything, it could be going up to $300 a month to catch up your escrow if you can't cover the shortage.

I completely agree with your comment about controlling the amount the assessment goes up.  It makes no sense that the county can choose to not adjust assessments for 5 years because it is a lot of work and then suddenly raise the assessment by 20% for most of the city.  If they raised it by 4% every year, then at the 5 year mark it would be more than 20% (slightly) and it doesn't drastically affect the home owners.",t2_kftlu,-ixion-,0,1648149809.0,0,t1_i1ywp5x,i1ywp5x,True,Nythoren,t3_tmnuxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/tmnuxq/property_value_increases/,Property Value Increases,/r/Omaha/comments/tmnuxq/property_value_increases/i1ywp5x/,5,r/Omaha,0,5

"As a Nebraska boy, born to a mother who loved to read, I was often pressed and did read almost the entire catalog of both Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder. Some of the most depressing scenes are centered around the harsh and grueling homestead/farm environments, and they were all written from those women's experiences (Specifically, Mr. Shimerda's suicide before the winter is over in My Antonia or where the father is missing for four days in a blizzard in The Banks of Plum Creek).

This life wasn't unique to these women. The books didn't sell because these were far-fetched anomalies, but rather because they reflected the average lives of common people on the prairie. These tragedies - short life spans, child labor, starvation, freezing to death - were something we have collectively worked hard to defeat. There was o factual question about these horrors because most had family that could make personal reference to them.

What the fuck is up with the book report and what does this have to do with property taxes you ask?  Well, this is just a theory, but it seems as though most politicians who espouse this conservative ideal, and lust for a simpler time, have no fucking clue what would befall them in such a situation.

The farmer has taken all the knowledge provided to him by the public intellect (the University)   advanced irrigation, efficient heating, efficient transportation of goods, advanced farming equipment, building developments, and has almost completely banished those greatest plagues. Yet, at the same time has developed a large contempt for the same urbanization and academic development that has empowered them.

Agriculture is one of the largest, if not, the largest campaigning and political force in the State. Until that changes, they will continue to dominate the political arena. There needs to be a force or social mechanism to shift the power sphere or else they will continue to politically starve the cities because now they don't need them as they did before.

&#x200B;

Firstly, yes I am an Omaha transplant. I'm also a huge data nerd, and an ""urban planning"" hobbyist. Jobber's Canyon and that debacle I am well aware of, this isn't that. Not remotely.

Working back a bit, the median age here is \~34, that's about on par for cities I would consider our peers. The USA median is about 38. Ignoring that you are completely guessing on the demographics of the average MoO employee:

The new MoO building is roughly the same drive for West a lot of ""West O"", Gretna to the current building according to Google Maps is 26 minutes. Gretna to the new location: Still 26 minutes. 

MoO has said they expect to continue hybrid schedules indefinitely, and are still providing 2200 parking stalls in the pedestal of the building. That fits all of the parking needs they expect to need, but they intend to use MTC as overflow if required for busy days.

Just to work for Mutual? Probably none. In general there are a ton of reasons. They can bike / walk to events, parks, and have a better sense of community for example. My kids *love* the downtown lifestyle. I have split custody, and they do part time doing the suburban thing too, and hate it.

"THATS the problem. All the stuff you’re saying is banking on the fact that the mutual employees are going to suck it up and come into the office. But they aren’t! They aren’t coming into the office now! The “vast majority” of them are working from home according to the most recent OWH report, and as we’ve seen in the last 2 years people are wayyy more productive and wayyy happier working from home, so why would they come into the office. 

At the very least we can postpone TIF funding until we get these metrics. Actually talk to MoO employees! Who is currently working there? Where do they live? How do they feel about the tower? Will they want to commute? Will they want to move into midtown? How often will they be in the office? If mutual requires them to be in the office will they just quit (as many have been doing recently?). 

Omaha has a very small young adult population compared to other cities of comparable size. And I’m willing to bet that the majority of Mutual employees are people who already have or are planning to start a family, in which case why on Earth would they want to live downtown, in a cramped apartment with no yard, just to work for Mutual, when there are a myriad of opportunities?

A single car on an LRT can get hundred of cars of the road ([random graphic](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/06IjfbqdnNM/maxresdefault.jpg)), and as density increases the benefits get better. More people can not own a car at all, and bike / take transit instead.

&#x200B;

>and would be incredibly inconvenient for any commuting from west Omaha

At some point, we don't all get everything we want. The benefit the line provides for helping to build a better city is worth it. They can move back to the part of the city that isn't a drain on the cities coffers, and helping to kill the planet. If being a good citizen of the planet is too much, then they can live with the inconvenience.

"The MoO tower is going to literally cast a shadow over the riverfront project the city just spent millions of dollars on. Blocking any view of the sunset and darkening the space for half the day.

It’s also going to be the center of Omaha’s current bus layout, which means all public transport will start and stop around mutual, and remapping the bus layout will cost the city another pretty penny. 

The streetcar plan they currently have proposed would increase traffic in midtown a substantial amount, and would be incredibly inconvenient for any commuting from west Omaha, as there is limited parking downtown so they would be expected to leave their cars (in parking spots they pay for), wait to get in the streetcar (which will likely be incredibly packed before and after work), take the streetcar down and do the same thing at the end of the day.

Given more time, and not choosing the start of the pandemic as the time to replace our windows, we probably would have done more shopping around and in hindsight probably overspent some by going with Pella. We've been very happy with the new windows regardless.

Both of these restaurants also sell wine, so if you find a spot for your picnic that allows adult beverages, you can grab a bottle with your order :) have fun!

"I mean...they are.  The Oliver Stone documentary more than spotlights it.  However, they are making positive progress towards modernizing and unfucking their government.  Russia obviously didn't want this and walked into a massive MASSIVE trap.

I'll paraphrase a summary I saw.

>In 2014, a group of primarily hard right militia groups effected a marginally popular putsch to oust a pro-russian government and replace it with a pro NATO one. Those groups were funded and trained by NATO and by NATO, I mean the US. The threat of isolating Russia from its last warm water seaport in Crimea led to the 2014 invasion. Since then, literally billions of dollars have been funneled into arming Ukraine for war with Russia while progressively more pro-western governments were propped up.

>Ukraine is like a piece of meat that has been hung out to bait the Russians since then. More and more noises about joining NATO have been made. If that should occur, not only will more deep radar stations and potentially medium range nukes be brought in (Trump pulled the US out of INF treaty) but the Russians would finally be pushed out of Crimea since there's no way an occupation would be permitted in a a NATO country. The game is playing out and Putin walked right the fuck into it because his interests are Russian Oligarch interests and he's willing to trade Russian and Ukrainian lives to get what he can out of this, as expected. What he didn't plan on is just how big a trap had been laid for him in Ukraine.

>Anyway, Zelensky and his predecessors knew this from day one. They've always been aware that they were a chess piece in a game for the balkanization of Russia but maybe they never thought they were going to be sacrificed. Or maybe they did and are playing their part even now.

>In any case, working people don't want to get vaporized in the battle over who gets to sell natural gas to Germany.

"TLDR: minimal pain, $1200 out of pocket, should have done it sooner. Went to 107th an Pacific Surgical Center. 


Same as the others, though I had mine just last August. Saw Dr. Bruce Lundak at Adult Pediatric Urology off like 105ish and Pacific. 
First appt is just talk and fondle. “How many kids you got? Married? Sure you want this?” Yes, yes.  Drop your pants, they make sure your plumbing is in the right place and set you up a time to come back. 

I had a long vacation planned which bumped my appt out 2 months. But compared to someone else’s comment, it seemed like they were a minimum of 4 weeks out. 

Day arrives, they give you some rock’n grippy socks and a jock strap made of floss. (Really, it was lightweight, if you have your own, bring it, just make sure there is room for some ice packs down there) 

Procedure: 
Lay flat back on a operating table, they open your robe for everyone to see. (I shaved before hand enough that they didn’t do anything extra but were otherwise preparing to) iodine up your treasure purse and start to work. I think they had a fingertip pulse reader as they asked shortly after if I was nervous, so must have been running a bit fast. 

This doctor did an incision on each side, an inch(?) down from the shaft base and an inch away (from the body) into the scrotal sack area. Maybe half and inch long? Yea there was the needle stab, you don’t see it, it’s quick. After incision there is some fishing around inside for the tubing, you still feel a slight tug- a feeling that was unpleasant and new- but not painful. Snip snip he’s done before you know it. This guy said he clamps it off with a metal ring? So maybe I need to ask next time I go through airport security if can see those things on there. I’m guessing it’s the matching to folding it back and sewing it to itself. He didn’t have a cauterizer, which I know some dudes complained the smell was the worst part. He sewed the sack back up with maybe 4 stitches. Took like 5 minutes per side. They showed the sample bottle with the section of tube cut out. Gave you a pad with ice in it to jam down your pants. 

I saw another guy limping out the door. Maybe I’m just lucky, but walking with the diaper was more work. I took it easy, sat on ice for 24 hours. Really wasn’t that tender. Tested everything 24 hours after that with the wife, everything still worked. Stitches on one side disappeared after a week. Other side I think the threads got mixed up as they never dissolved after 10 days. I snipped the knots and removed the thread myself. Not terrible at all. 

Within a month it looked like nothing had happened all healed up. For me the height of pain was the tugging. At home was sore but like pulled muscle sore not kicked in the junk sore. 

Using Aetna my deductible wasn’t met yet so was close to $1200 out of pocket. 

Dr. Lundak did great, was personable, gave time to ask questions, I didn’t feel rushed or worried about what he was doing. 

Now if only my first sample post-op didn’t have some straggling swimmers, I could tell you it was a success. Working my way through clearing the pipes another 20 times. 

Good luck, I put it off for years cause the wife was on something. I should have done it sooner to allow her to be free of the hormones quicker.

"Poor Dude. It wasn’t God that was talking to him. It was the creep that got tossed out of heaven who exists to “kill, steal, and destroy,” and enjoys sending underlings to torment the extremely vulnerable like this guy.

It does make you wonder if this poor dude was a Vet that was experimented on and the drugs they used (in combination with possible combat
trauma) pushed him over the edge. Very sad. He would probably benefit from an exorcism to remove entities that are attached to him making it all Worse. 

A question for the Neighborhood Peeps. What decade is this guy? Gulf War or older, would you say? Or younger? My daughter’s fiancé when he was serving in Afghanistan was leery of the immunizations for malaria (it’s not all desert, apparently) and he refused. It turns out that some of that batch of vaccines did cause brain damage to some people who took it. So the moral of this is even the “good” health measures the military provides can spell Unmitigated  Disaster or Life Ruined for Good. Poor guy is clearly mentally off and tormented by dark forces. 

Which are real. I also used to live in that hood. There was a Viet Nam or Gulf War Vet (his hair was long and blonde) that used to walk along Center Street east of 63rd all the time. There used to be a mobile home court where Baxter Arena is, and when I would shop the HYVee at 52nd and Center I would see him buying food and beer. This was almost 20 years ago. He was around for several years. And then he just up and disappeared completely. I was always worried about him as it seemed he was always by himself, alone in the world with no visible support network. Once we moved out of AkSarBen to a larger house miles almost exactly due west I found out what it was like to live in a haunted house. No wonder all the previous owners had moved out after a year or two. 

I think the land was messed up, like a bunch of people (innocent) had been lynched on the trees  lining the hollows or killed in the area right around there when they were building the UPRR in the 1860’s with its own Hell on Wheels and a sketchy or nonexistent Justice system. Nebraska was barely a State when they were laying those tracks which  abut the neighborhood. That’s what a few of us with Second Sight got when we prayed about it. We saw lynching trees. Also, that area isn’t very far from tributaries including the Papillion (a creek runs into the neighborhood) of the Elkhorn River where peaceful Omaha Indians used to hunt bison in the summer. THE Elkhorn River was the western edge of their hunting grounds. I wouldn’t put it past a warring tribe from the south like the Pawnees killing off Omaha women and children using the streams in the neighborhood. 

We sold that house almost 3 years ago. When we had moved out and were just going there to work on it to get it ready for sale you could hear footsteps coming from the second floor. We’d come back the next day after to do more work and find cupboard doors had been opened after we had left for the day the night before. Once something threw a phone book past my daughter’s head when she was home alone watching TV. The phone book hit the off button on the tv. That happened within a few weeks of moving in, August of 2005. The house was built in 1986. There was just Bad Energy around the West Side of our lot, and definitely in the vicinity of the house next door that was empty but the owners wouldn’t sell it after they moved up the street. My point is that malevolent forces can occupy places where bad things have occurred, even if 150-200 years ago. Certain parts of the house (4,100’) were worse than others. My theory was whichever part of the house was over the tree roots from that tree had larger concentration of dark energy or whatever you want to call it. 

I just hope wherever the Vet guy lives is “clean,” in a spiritual sense, and not contributing to his suffering. Sheesh. He needs spiritual assistance as well as any other kind he’s getting.",t2_1m0byt8p,greatplainsskater,0,1648074968.0,0,t1_i1uvwce,i1uvwce,True,beacy,t3_tktxo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/tktxo2/preach_brother_leavenworth_50th_or_so/,Preach brother (Leavenworth & 50th or so),/r/Omaha/comments/tktxo2/preach_brother_leavenworth_50th_or_so/i1uvwce/,-11,r/Omaha,0,-11

"I have not played 3.0 but I have played a lot of Pathfinder 1st edition which is 3.5+ or 3.75 as some people call it. 

The big difference is that 5e is designed to be streamlined and much easier to run and easier for new people. Feat chains are no longer a thing, you do not have a dozen different combat modifiers to worry about.  I.E. Sickened, vs. nauseous, dazed, vs. dazzled, flat footed vs. touch AC etc.  5e encourages DM's to be flexible vs. having a specific rule for every possible scenario. 

In Pathfinder building a character would take a lot of time because I would want to plan out things like feat chains, and trying to build for spell penetration, or crit focused builds.  

With 5e that is largely gone. You pick a class, a background, and as subclass. Your class and background let you chose a few skills to be proficient in.  Your class and subclass give you specific abilities.  You can get feats but they are much less common and some characters may never take a feat or only have 1-2 feats even when they hit level 20. 

As much as I enjoyed Pathfinder as player and miss its synergy at time 5e is so much easier to run as a DM.

"The law basically changes 2 things:

1. CC would be legal without a permit.

2. Cities/counties can't make laws restricting buying/carrying/owning firearms (might be handgun specific?).

This results in 2 small changes:

1. CC would be treated the same as open carry is now.

2. Cities like Omaha will have to drop any additional restrictions on buying/carrying handguns, like Omaha's law that states you need a CHP to open carry in Omaha.


Things that don't change:

1. You would still need a purchase permit to buy a handgun, so you would still need to pass a background check.

2. If you are considered a prohibited person now, you would still be considered prohibited.

3. If it isn't legal to take a gun into a specific type of place/building now, you still wouldn't be allowed.


There currently isn't a training requirement to purchase or open carry in Nebraska. So this law would mostly only change your ability to carry a handgun in Omaha specifically. Since it restrictions open carry. 

Right now anyone that owns a handgun can walk around with it as an open carry with no training required. They can even go get a purchase permit without any training, go buy a handgun without any training, and then open carry almost anywhere in that state (except for restricted locations) without any training, except in Omaha, in Omaha you need a CHP (training) to have a handgun on you at all.",t2_2th3tvnk,Corym2001,0,1648053109.0,0,t1_i1tasvq,i1tasvq,False,GettingItOverWith,t3_tk5u8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/tk5u8o/due_to_a_single_incorrect_word_in_the_previous/,"Due To a Single Incorrect Word in The Previous Post's Title, Coupled with An Inability for Conservatives to Look Past Minor Formatting Errors While Arguing in Support of Silly Legislation, This Post Has Been Remade and Resubmitted to the Appropriate Platforms with the Correction.",/r/Omaha/comments/tk5u8o/due_to_a_single_incorrect_word_in_the_previous/i1tasvq/,4,r/Omaha,0,4
