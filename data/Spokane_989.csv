"Blame the refs? What BS! The officiating was consistently inconsistent from the tip. The terrible calls when both ways and they threw in some ridiculous make-up calls for both sides. It’s part of basketball. Great, we’ll coached, teams adjust. Every officiating crew has their quirks but ultimately, it’s on players and coaches to make the right adjustments.

As long as Gonzaga recruits the way they do, they’ll keep getting this result. A few people said it earlier … they struggle against hard nosed, athletic teams and have done so for 20 years. They don’t recruit those types of players and when you get off the west coast, you’re going to have to play that type of ball. Just the way it is. I honestly think Gonzaga would have a hard time attracting the players they need even if they wanted them.

The team is full of some of the best recruits in the country but half of them are premadonnas that haven’t been taught how to take adversity. And part of that stems from not developing bench players. Normally we put in two maybe three players from then bench that are essentially placeholders for the starters. We need to develop these guys, what happened to the days of having a whole second unit that was dangerous? 

Few doesn’t have the balls to bench young hotshots when they’re playing rat ball against Tarleton State. We wonder why no one on our team rises to the occasion when they’ve never been disciplined for making shit plays.

Next is Timmie, he’s good but inconsistent. He’s a total black hole with the basketball. You’ve got three guys on you PASS THE BALL

Also where the fuck does Nembard go? He never gets taken out so it’s probably a bit of a shock to hear our starting point guard had two points until the last three minutes of the game. 

Zags play with zero guts, they play rec teams all year and get smashed by teams with energy. Honestly I’m tired of it, it’s an embarrassment to watch. 

We should honestly be thinking about canning Few. Years of underperforming, a DUI, and now he plays nepotism with his kid on the team.",t2_34jdu0f5,jameskile,0,1648221793.0,0,t1_i22pry8,i22pry8,True,Impossible_Diver_385,t3_tnawnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tnawnr/that_was_the_worst_called_game_i_have_seen_in_a/,That was the worst called game I have seen in a while.

"The game plan for the Zags is clear - it’s always been scrappy, hard-nosed teams that give them problems. When they hit these hyper athletic teams that are also gritty and impose the pace - it’s always tough.

I thought they found their scrap in the Memphis game but I think Arkansas was just a more disciplined team defensively, and that + active hands and scrappiness is always the Zags kryptonite. They’ve got to start grabbing those types of guys to fill roles on their team.

"Sorry I haven't seen your cat, but just some information if you weren't aware:

Displaced cats will frequently hide in the nearest place they can find until very late in the night (even midnight or later), and then try to find their way back in the usually calm cover of night. This can be made easier for them if you can manage to leave the way they departed available to them, and preferably even be present as much as possible. Your cat could be incredibly near, and even hearing your calls, but might not come out again until night. If there's a sound (tuna can being opened or tapped with a spoon, feather toy flickering, etc.) that you know your cat is crazy for, it's definitely worth a try every now and then throughout the day, but their ability to hide & completely tune out everything for long durations is well developed. At some point they come out of hiding, and at that time most likely they only need access to their home or your presence.

Do a physical search if you can. Look in every space a cat could be for several blocks. Knock on doors.

Here's some more information from SCRAPS:

[https://www.spokanecounty.org/DocumentCenter/View/855/Lost-Pet-Behavior-PDF](https://www.spokanecounty.org/DocumentCenter/View/855/Lost-Pet-Behavior-PDF)

“*The number one method that was the most successful in recovering a missing cat was conducting a physical search of the area.*

*The median distance found (how far the cats traveled) for missing outdoor-access cats was 315 meters (344 yards). This is roughly a 17-house radius from their owner’s home.*

*The median distance found (how far the cats traveled) for displaced / escaped indoor-only cats was much less—it was only 50 meters (54 yards) which is roughly a 2 ½ house radius from their owner’s home.*”

"Spokane Valley is a car-centric city, although in my opinion, in terms of biking and walking, it's slightly better than Spokane. Slightly.

I've had people yell shit me while passing close to me, which is hella scary, especially since I have sensory issues due to autism (please don't decimate me for saying that)

Maybe because cars give people the sense that they own the roads, which in terms of taxpaying, I guess they do to a point. But even people without cars pay taxes, and they don't get the same use out of it as drivers.

I get honked at, yelled at, passed closely, had things thrown at me, and engine-revved. I think all of this is because of the sense of entitlements. This entitlement is not limited to the city of Spokane Valley but it's where I've experienced the most of it.

It's a big enough city that it requires a car for most trips since everything is spread out. The STA busses don't have a great influence within the city like they do in Spokane.

I got hit with a bottle of piss last year while riding my bike, supposedly because I was in the road, even though I was in the road's bike lane. The bottle was thrown from a car moving at 35 miles per hour, and when it hit me, some of the piss inside the bottle got all over me. The speed of the impact made me crash the bike.

I ride a dark-green Novara Randonee with a blue taillight and turn signals I bought on Amazon. My helmet is blue and so is the handlebar extension where I mounted the headlight and two of the four turn signals.

"Well there's also challenges here that are greatly different than Houston and/or Dallas.

In the case of Houston, there's no zoning (or next to no zoning), so its relatively easy to build, build, build. Also, in Texas, the land is flat, largely barren, goes on for miles and miles, and is comparatively cheap. We have rivers, hills, forests, state parks, etc., that greatly hinder our ability to build.

Along those lines, we have an urban development boundary to encourage density over sprawl. This makes sense as we only have one highway - in TX, all those cities have highways upon highways and state and local government that happily pays for it. Olympia views us as afterthoughts - case in point - the N/S corridor taking decades to finish.

If you look at what's happened on the upper South Hill, the developers got sweetheart deals to develop giant apartment complexes while not having to pay to increase road capacity (as is common practice), so that part of town is heavily congested for a good chunk of the day. This bleeds on to I90 with the daily traffic jams at Thor/Freya.

We do have a mayor whose election was largely funded by developers, so I think that whatever can be done is marginally being done already. But as you intimated, these things take time, and that's something we don't have.

It is also worth noting that new construction has become much more expensive due to supply chain issues and increased labor wages due to low supply of workers. This drives prices up (in addition to people on the coast finding out about us), which is passed on to buyers/renters and the cycle continues.

I would think its pretty much impossible at the moment to make low income housing that makes a profit such that a bank would lend the money to build it, which then requires subsidies that I'm not sure government is willing to do at this time.

I'm not educated enough on the topic to propose solutions to the problem. I believe we are going down the same well-worn path as other cities with growing pains. Sadly, there will be losers to this town growing and the homeless population are externalities of this process.

I would think rezoning for higher density with low income quotas would be the simplest, albeit not the most effective, solution that could buy us some time to come up with a more comprehensive master plan for the explosive growth we are expected to experience. Lax ADU regs in other cities seem to have been an effective way to tackle housing shortages and increases in housing costs.

"Agreed! I was one of these people pre-pandemic in Spokane. I had been staying with friends while I transitioned to a new job but they ended up moving in with other people so I had nowhere to go. I used my gym membership to the Planet Fitness on Northwest Blvd. for 24-hour access to a shower/toilets. I cooked food in the company fridge and kitchen during the day so I had food access after work and didn't have to spend money on fast food and then went to the public library with my laptop to charge my phone and work on projects. At night I slept near the Gonzaga campus because I knew they had security patrolling the neighborhood and my car looked nice enough it just blended in at one of the many apartment complexes until I finally managed to save up enough for the deposit to get into a place, which was around $1,500. It might not seem like a lot but I also had other bills like my cell phone, which I need for work, my previous student loans, gas to get to work, car insurance, etc... so it took a few months to save up.

At some point, I tried to get a space at a shelter during the night but that was like a full-time job in and of itself. You have to be there at a specific time to be on the waiting list and back again or forfeit your bed, which meant that anyone with a full-time job was just out of luck. If you worked nights you were boned because they were only open during the day. I grew up around a lot of people who just fed me the line that homeless people were homeless because they were lazy. The whole experience really changed my view. It made me realize that if someone with a job, a 730+ credit score, not so much as a parking ticket to my name can have be forced to live on the street, what kind of hope do people with zero support have? I met GU and SFCC/SCC students living in their cars/vans/RVs too! 

I've since moved to Seattle to finish school and have interacted with some homeless people there who live similar to the way I did around the University but it was much harder during the pandemic (Obviously). They have groceries delivered to their cars or RVs because some of them do have jobs/income but they just can't afford rent or the cost of securing a place nor have a way to get out of the city. For some perspective, I live in a 120 sq foot apartment that goes for almost $1000/month and required over $2000 to move into with the security deposit, first/last rent, background check, etc... In Spokane I rented a room in a 9 bedroom house for $500/month and it's now going for close to the same as what I'm paying in Seattle.

"You can’t build more housing and also implement rent control. Rent control leads to developers completely abandoning markets where such policies are implemented, making the issue far worse.

I’ve read articles in Salt Lake about the planning commission denying projects for things like, “the sidewalk around the building would be 1” too narrow”, “the color of the building won’t fit the neighborhood character”, “There are too many studio units”, “the building is too long, it looks funny”, and many other arbitrary NIMBYism bullshit reasons.

Either the anti-development planners need to be done away with, or this problem won’t be solved in our lifetimes.",t2_k4f05pty,jblair819,0,1648150451.0,0,t1_i1yyauu,i1yyauu,False,DizzyMajor5,t3_tmjqm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tmjqm4/is_increasing_rent_causing_more_homeless/,Is increasing rent causing more homeless?,/r/Spokane/comments/tmjqm4/is_increasing_rent_causing_more_homeless/i1yyauu/,20,r/Spokane,0,20

"Yes, with a family.  The average American home size in 1950 was around 950 square feet, 1500sf in 1970, 2400sf in 2005, and now its starting to finally go down.  Compared to the UK, with an average still of 950sf, so yes, it's doable.  1400sf in Denmark and they're the happiest rated country on earth.  This is also a great example of having a big family and not being able to afford big family housing then complaining about it.  Personally,  I can't afford a big family because we'd like more space, and space costs $$.  I  never heard of condo markets being notoriously boom-bust before.  There's less equity earned, for sure, and 2008 hit the entire market hard, but some of the worst hit areas are now record markets (example PHX).  Just looking at this one on Zillow, you'd make an easy 10-15K more reselling just by clearing the clutter in the pics.   And the majority stays in their first starter home for less than 5yrs, it's a fact.  At least 2 to clear PMi and Capitol Gains taxes, and usually 3-5 to see your equity used to trade-up.

"OP, I just looked at your post history, and it's a lot of ""Rent shood be free"" and ""collidge is stoopid"" posts.

There certainly are reasons to argue that rent is unfairly expensive and the need for a college degree are overblown, but even for people who believe those things, your takes are wildly inaccurate, juvenile, and ignorant.  Before you start such arguments, please take the time to read more from verifiable, unbiased sources, and have informed opinions.  If you cannot tell the differences between Los Angeles and Detroit that cause a differentiation in housing prices, you do not have the ability to credibly comment on economic forces that affect the housing market.

Second, you need to work very hard to improve your spelling and grammar.  Even if you eventually learn to form educated, nuanced opinions, no one will take you seriously if you can't present it in a way that comes across as being articulate and grammatically correct.  True or not, someone who cannot grasp the difference between affect and effect, as your titles show, will not be trusted to grasp more difficult concepts like the economic forces that cause homelessness.",t2_1691o0,spokanetransplanted,1,1648144293.0,0,t1_i1yin3d,i1yin3d,True,DizzyMajor5,t3_tmjqm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tmjqm4/is_increasing_rent_causing_more_homeless/,Is increasing rent causing more homeless?,/r/Spokane/comments/tmjqm4/is_increasing_rent_causing_more_homeless/i1yin3d/,1,r/Spokane,0,1

"We're both pretty chill, and we're the type of people to find fun in any city or place we live, so moving away from family wasn't hard, and finding new places that are affordable has been easy as long as you can find work. Before Spokane I was slated to move to Cleveland, but the job fell through. Spokane was still affordable in late 2018, so I jumped. Previously I had lived in New Orleans pre-Katrina and a 3 bed 2 bath home right of the Mardi Gras parade route was $130k if you didn't mind working on it.

One other thing to consider is that you will be locked into an HOA. 

I will say that some of my neighbors had some serious issues with the grading of their lots causing some serious drainage issues in spring.

"Lowest rents to expect:

$650-700 for a room in shared housing 
$700-800 Studios
$800-950 1BRs

Competition is fierce. Come prepared for a long slog and high degree of scrutiny regarding criminal history, rental history, credit, debt, and income. ""Looking for work"" is not going to get you in the door. Most properties are looking for 2.5-3x the rent as income, which you should be prepared to prove with documentation. Expect a good search to take a lot of your free time and a few months.

With that said you should be able to find a decent place but it'll take a lot of pestering and phone calls. Don't stop when they say ""we don't have anything open."" Ask about waitlists and call back frequently. Put in the most intense effort from the 1st to 10th of the month when people are putting in notices to leave, and ask about units becoming available, not just what's available now.

The lower South Hill, West Central, and Hillyard are the most affordable. Certain areas in Spokane Valley are the same. Property crime and drug crime is a concern and you'll want to be cautious with your neighbors and in general keep your guard up and stay aware.

"If an area in the US has a really low cost of living, there are reasons for it, and they are not often good.

There are lots of cheap areas in Arkansas for example. The not-so-cheap area(NW Arkansas) is really the only place in the state where there are good-paying jobs and decent education. It plays out like that all over the south and midwest, and actually every state.

If you look at the entire tax picture + cost of things like energy, states like Washington, and even California (this state has a lower property tax rate than WA), are generally better than average.

The average property tax in this state is about the same as North Dakota. Of course, that doesn't tell the entire story as there is a wide range of property tax rates throughout Washington. People mention the midwest. An example is Kansas, which has a higher property tax rate. Home prices are lower on average so that might even it out.

If I were going to move, it would be out of the country. Likely to SE Asia or Costa Rica. Safe, warm, and inexpensive. I am fortunate that I could do that without impacting my income at all.

One is acceptable to most and obviously abortion is a hot button issue. I really don’t ever get a straight answer from those opposed to abortion.

So on one hand a couple trying to have a child are praised even though there can be / regularly is an outcome similar to abortion by choice, and on the other hand a woman who makes a choice with the same outcome is demonized. It is hard to see it as anything other than a punishment for women who are pregnant and don’t want a child.

"Exactly! 

I was just playing with some numbers about my current rental. The landlord bought the place (2 unit duplex) just a few weeks before I moved in. Using average down payment and interest numbers, he's probably paying a mortgage of somewhere around 1.5x my monthly rent. The other unit has required some repairs and doesn't have a tenant yet. He's literally losing money on this duplex renting only one side at a fairly average or even slightly generous price (given it's more spacious than many duplexes at the same price point and same bedrooms). 

He told me most of his applicants need 4 or 5 people to make rent. Doesn't want to do that to the neighborhood, and doesn't want to take on the risk of ""what if tenant a and tenant b break up and can't make rent anymore"". Of course also has to avoid all the renters that will just not care and trash the place. 

When he does get a tenant in the other side, if it's at about the same price I'm paying, he'll probably be making about $1000-$1500 per month on the property (depending how much he had to mortgage and at what rate). Part of that has to go into savings to cover maintenance and repair and improvements to the property (of which he's already done several nice things to it). So if he pockets 75% (don't know how reasonable this is) he'd be making about $750-1100 per month  (which will go down if the value of the property, and therefore its taxes, increase).

I don't know about you but I'd make more than $750 per month if possible. 

Operating a rental, *and* renting one, are business decisions, not personal favors.

"Take a close look at what is taxed and at how much of a higher rate in each state you consider relocating to.
No state tax in Washington, but there is one in say- Iowa.  Higher property taxes.  And medical/dental is taxed in some states. 
It goes without saying (But I’ll say it, because we tend to overlook things that we typically wouldn’t when we’re stressed/in fight or flight mode) to look at the whole picture if you have to relocate. 
The homes in the Midwest are rising as well, though still cheaper, per the many real-estate companies’ websites.   
Also- Location.  My mother lives in an area of WA that over the past few years, has become uninsurable due to fires.
Areas prone to flooding (Midwest) may have a similar problem.   
Then there’s the question of whether or not a location will still have plenty of access to fresh water (Arizona) over the next decade.   

Lot’s of things to consider.

"Housing is going to be a problem whether renting or buying. Mentioning crime ridden neighborhoods stirs up cope commenters, so look out; people that will tell ya ""Oh, every city has \_\_\_\_ "" When we are regularly [among the highest crime rate](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/wa/spokane/crime#:~:text=With%20a%20crime%20rate%20of,here%20is%20one%20in%2018) per capita of any city in the nation... Usually property crime, vehicle theft... TONS of junkies that ride bikes all over stealing anything that's not bolted down. The neighborhoods those happen in the most are with very few exceptions what's considered the ""north side"" but that's a large area, with plenty of pockets of neighborhoods that are just fine.   
Lower South Hill can also be super sketchy. Seems like I often hear about drive by shootings, murders, and rapes happening there more than anywhere else.   


With all that said, for spokane, I would say:  
**Lincoln heights** would be an excellent affordable area  
**South Perry** (south of 9th)  
Anything south of 15th is excellent actually.   
Northwest part of **Shadle**  
**Indian Trails**  
**Five Mile**  


**Hillyard** can be real rough, but I know a lot of really cool, down to earth, genuinely good people there, with pockets that are just fine. Same with **Garland** actually.   


The east side of **the valley** has some nice open areas, but the Valley in general just feels completely fake, and cultureless, unless you consider shopping to be the most interesting thing in the world. **Liberty Lake** is more the snooty kinda upper middle, to upper class folk. Not a lot there, but is clean, and super safe, the lake is decent, and has some excellent trails.

"Thanks for sharing, and I read it

One part from that Inlander story notes:""When the Seattle Times dug into the ""Loving Homes and Families for Orphans"" organization, which Shea had portrayed to the Polish government as an agency facilitating adoptions, they couldn't find any evidence that Loving Homes and Families for Orphans was actually licensed for adoptions.""

Can't find the source where Shea states the agency facilitates adoptions, but you can help to facilitate adoptions(make (an action or process) easy or easier.) without actually being the licensed entity that legally does the adoption , and this is what The Seattle Time's quotes Shea as saying “It is a hosting organization that hosts Ukrainian orphans in America with Ukrainian families with the intent that ultimately that ends in adoption,”  on a Poland tv show. “It’s been doing this hosting program for several years.” Which a lot of organizations do without being adoption agencies.

I feel like there is a slant that is trying to paint a picture that somehow Shea is trying to illegally traffic the children into the US when there is no evidence of that. And unless Shea is going to falsify documents so that a licensed agency gets Visa's  for the kids, or he is going to try to hide the kids in a suitcase on the plane ride, or some other very illegal act, he is not going to just be able to bring the kids in. The Time's headline includes his accusation of domestics terrorism which was in 2019 and as far as I know, no charges were ever brought.

I don't agree with most of the things Shae willingly champions and admits we wouldn't be able to keep a civil conversation over a night at the pub, but it feels like folks are looking for this to be something nefarious when it may be that a very religious person married to a women originally from the Ukraine may be just trying to help some orphans.

Again, my brain also screams, ""even if they are looking for something, there is a good chance  they are not wrong.""",t2_6hotliba,gregbl333,0,1648076105.0,0,t1_i1uynn1,i1uynn1,False,BanksyX,t3_tkut7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tkut7l/why_is_sr_endorsing_shea/,Why is SR endorsing shea?,/r/Spokane/comments/tkut7l/why_is_sr_endorsing_shea/i1uynn1/,1,r/Spokane,0,1

"I am a landlord and have been for 20+ years.
We started out altruistically, borrowed the down, husband worked his ass off after his day job, I raised kids and fed everyone.
We were determined to help young couples like ourselves, but who maybe didn’t have the backing we did.  Fast forward to the last few years - we aren’t so naive- we have had houses sublet behind our backs, houses destroyed, one house was turned into a brothel complete with a red light and tents in the back yard.  We have been lied to and taken advantage of….no more.
Our rents are now set above what HA will pay.  We run all our apps through Zillow so one fee gets a credit score and background check.  We still pay w/s/g so people will maybe wash and throw away garbage.   We like these houses and we want to like the people in them as well.

"I'd say the country. Democratic promises that they run on never happen. Conservatives are a big reason for that, but things just don't get done in this country. Conservatives are always backpedaling this country into the dark ages. 

Democrats will probably lose seats in the coming midterms and then republicans can stone walk time and again. I mean we have to fight to get a perfectly qualified and squeaky clean judge on the Supreme Court. The Republicans got a judge, likely a rapist, on almost no problem. 

This country is screwed because it has two viable political parties. There is nothing in-between the two parties that run the systems. They don't have to work together. Just wait every 2-4-6-8 years for majorities and then they get little petty things done that piss of the other party. 

You will never convince me that conservativism isn't an era defining danger to the world, but there is just too much support for it to go away.

"It’s a little scary for Washington women. Of course I’m all for providing safe legal abortions to women from Idaho who need to come here to seek one. 

On the other hand if our clinics see an increase in service the waiting times could increase for WA women and we could end up facing a situation where we are waiting for too long as we inch closer to the point where we might not be able to get one in time. We only have 19 weeks 6 days. Normally plenty of time. 

Most women don’t even know they’re pregnant until the 4-6 week. Hypothetically you could find out at week 6 and then only have 13 weeks to get one. We could reach a point where appointments are coming in in so fast that we do encounter a multi week if not month waiting period. There are only two places in Spokane county that provide abortion services. 

Those who can afford it can always fly to seattle or tri cities if needed. Again rich women will always be able to get an abortion. I’m more concerned about the people who don’t have those kinds of options. 

19 weeks is a long time so it’s unlikely - but the more states that pass these laws the more these desperate women need to seek care elsewhere.
