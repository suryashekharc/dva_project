"Looks very nice and probably safe. It's in Muhlenberg Township, but separated by Rt 222 and the river so it feels like a different place.

Appears to only be one road access. River level is well controlled, so flooding is unlikely, but possible. Something to be aware of when building, including higher ongoing insurance costs afterwards. Not a showstopper, but something to budget for.

Hospital is somewhat nearby, so you're good there. School district is so-so, but many are fine with it. Not terrible, not great. Private school would be worth looking into, but not essential.

Property taxes will be high most anywhere in Berks County. Especially in areas with good to even mediocre schools.

The school portion of the property tax is generally the largest by far and residents have little say over the amount. Electing different board members sometimes help slow the increases, but with the state and federal mandates, it's going to be high regardless. The municipal and county portions (the tax bills recently sent out; school is sent at end of June) are generally reasonable for what one gets.

Building new is a good way to get around lack of housing availability, but comes at a steep cost. Figure on the actual cost being 25%, 50%, or even more of the estimate.

In extreme instances, builder may attempt to sell to a different party (assuming one doesn't already the land) at the last moment, if one doesn't agree to paying considerably extra. See many new homes going up, so probably not a big issue around here.

"I mentioned this to someone and they suggested maybe it no longer met the standards of the Radisson brand.

Makes sense based on posts I've read indicating it appeared dated and needed work. Their parking lot is in horrible shape.

It's a shame, but not overly surprising. Also, I wonder if they've lost a lot of banquet business to the newer hotel downtown. Speaking of hotels, there are a lot more now than 20 years ago.

What amazes me is how the Inn at Reading has survived. Never thought they'd last this long. Wouldn't be surprised if they abruptly closed too. Employees there would be wise to keep their resume updated and be prepared. The hotel has a decent reputation, but it's facing many of the same issues. It's large and dated, but I digress.

Also, the closing itself appears very sudden. Were they cited for serious code violations? Seems something drastic happened, but as usual, the so called journalists don't ask the real questions.

Granted to be fair WFMZ kind of tries and makes their content free (via ads), but they can do better. That hotel has been a fixture for decades and has large banquet facilities. Never thought I'd see it close. Though, most likely will reopen, maybe in a downsized form, eventually.

"If this happened at my house, unannounced at 2am, my first call would be to 911. ""Hello, there's a suspicious person banging on my door at 2 in the morning.""

I'd have other cops at my door in minutes due to my house having been formerly frequented by LEO prior to our purchase a year ago (we suspect due to drug-dealing). As an aside, fun facts to find out via the new neighbors. On one hand, it's awesome gaining neighborhood appreciation, but also kind of off-putting at just how many of our new neighbors have vocally welcomed the new calm. It's been over a year and we're still hearing it. (#humblebrag, i guess)

I live just north of Reading. Really hoping that place can get it's shit together someday. Such great potential for renewal, if the cops could just stop fucking over people of color. I guess that's everywhere, really. Sadly.

"How can this be the exact same force that responded to my friend's apartment burglary?

* He knew his upstairs neighbor was a broke addict recently fallen off the wagon
* The point of entry was an obviously broken window latch from their shared fire escape
* He provided a list of serial numbers of stolen electronics, and insurance photos of items without serial numbers
* The *nearest pawn shop to his apartment* had video footage of the neighbor coming in with those items, identifiable on tape, and selling them, the day of the break in.
* No one ever went to that pawn shop except my friend.  To buy his property back. With his own money.
* The detective never returned a single voicemail after taking the statement & the list of serial numbers & photos of property.
* They dropped the charges. He ended up being arrested for something unrelated immediately after.

I concur. Obviously that car belonged to some VIP. Personally, I don't care if someone keyed POTUS' ""Beast"", if you come banging on my door at 2 am pertinent to a crime *not involving me*, and it's less than rape or murder?

"Grew up in Reading, moved to Lancaster.

Berks County is cool.
The city doesnt have much to offer outside of Penn St and a few hole in the wall bars. Youre better off looking for something in the suburbs, West Reading or near by. 
You will have to drive everywhere and parking sucks. 
Public transportation is unreliable.
Violent crime is a non factor if you keep to yourself. 
Architecture is fantastic.
Overall few redeeming qualities, still love its charm.
a great place to move if you want to watch a city revitalize over the next 10 years. 

However
Lancaster is Walkable Bikable and has a train to Philly and Harrisburg. Lots of work co-ops.

"Well street parking isnt the worst. I come out of work at about midnight when everyone is already home and parked and only occasionally have to park a block away or more, typically I park within the block. May be different in other parts of town. Safety wise it really depends, I reside on the south side of town which is generally regarded as unsafe but haven't seen or have heard of crimes near me.
The public transportation is only okay, doesn't take you all over the city but usually gets you close enough.
As for getting to Philly, there may be a van transportation available but theyre really small business with one or two vehicles so you have to keep an eye out, they usually have a big sticker/decal stating transport. other option is drive to a nearby town like Lancaster and take the train. There is a plan to bring Reading into an Amtrak line but that's a few years down the line.",t2_17zzlj9y,GhostNThings,0,1636942925.0,0,t1_hko4z74,hko4z74,True,dinotanapoli,t3_qqpg02,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadingPA/comments/qqpg02/hello_im_thinking_of_moving_to_reading_and_i_have/,Hello!

"Thank you. I'm not sure how to answer ""how safe"". Obviously high chances of violent crime would be bad. I'd like to be able to be outside after dark.  If I need a cage for my catalytic converter it's a negative but not necessarily a deal breaker.  

The house I'm looking at right (online as I'm not in PA) is on Windsor between N 10th and N 11th.  

Parking is an issue in that I'm from Florida and would have to learn to street park. We have parking lots and driveways everywhere! We don't even have to parallel park to get a license. So that's a learning curve, and obviously so is winter driving. But I'd learn if I needed to. I actually have looked into parking garages but I don't want to pay for that if I'm not getting regular use out of my car or if its fine on the street.  I do work from home, so I don't need a new spot everyday, which I'm sure helps.  Unless they make you change sides of the street when they clear snow?

Maybe an uber or rental car as needed would be cheaper, with the bus for the day to day. How much I can afford will depend on my mortgage, and I also just like being practical. 

I did find a few ways from Philly to Reading via Septa, Lanta, Barta, and a few taxis lol. But its convoluted and takes like 4-1/2 hours, or else kind of pricey.  Do you think the busses are cut down because of covid or more permanently?

Again thank you so much, it's so hard to get an idea of whether it's worth the trip to go look from searching online.  I have family in Philly so I've spent significant time there and I've been to the Philly suburbs and Allentown but I've never been to Reading (yet). I would live IN Philly or NYC if I could but housing and taxes are nuts there so proximity is my next best option.",t2_ejyjh2tw,dinotanapoli,0,1636868609.0,0,t1_hkjyijy,hkjyijy,False,dinotanapoli,t3_qqpg02,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadingPA/comments/qqpg02/hello_im_thinking_of_moving_to_reading_and_i_have/,Hello!

"Depends on your definition of safe, in general the south side of the city is more rough. My fiancee has lived here for a decade and has never been the victim of a crime. Whereabouts near the school if you don't mind me asking? The public transportation exists and if you're living IN the city you don't NEED a car, but it would likely be useful as there are suburbs nearby that aren't walkable.

 Furthermore, parking is a huge issue in the city, so if you have the means, I'd see if you can find a private lot nearby and pay for it. There definitely used to be a bieber bus to philly and NYC, but they really cut that stuff down in the last couple years so I'm not positive anymore. 

There is a lot of negativity focused on this city, and IMO there's a not small part of it that's racially charged. The city declined in the late 20th century and there's a lot of people who try and blame that on the Dominican and Puerto Rican communities that have moved in from NYC and PR for the more affordable housing. 

Reading has been undergoing a lot of public works projects recently, and have had several colleges move into campuses in town, so I think Reading is on the Rise‚Ñ¢.

 To be truthful I have lived through neighborhood crime waves, some serious, but like all things, they pass. With a city of this size, one can engage and involve various levels of our local officials to rectify issues. Patience and perseverance changed things for the better every time.

"Great place to live. 
 Of course there are the usual problems that go along with a financially depressed city of this size, but in my opinion, the pros outnumber the cons. 
 Affordable housing. One can buy a three or four bedroom home for less than it costs for a new pick-up truck, or even a new Subaru.
 Diversity. I live next door to an apartment building that housed throughout the years; an Italian immigrant and her adult son, a white guy and his family, and immigrant Mexican family, and now, an older Cuban gentleman, and elderly Mexican guitarist and two elderly Puerto Rican gentlemen. They are all awesome and fun to talk to. 
 Great take-out food within easy walking distance. 
 Churches so numerous that one's choices are bountiful. 
 Pretty decent fishing within easy walking distance. ( but don't eat the fish)
 Two excellent Catholic elementary schools. 
  Rich culture. 
 Good fire departments. Decent police coverage. 
 Goggle works. The civic center and the Rajah. 
  Good Restaurants: Judy's, Doubletree, Casa de Chimi...and even Marvel Ranch.
 Good quality, cheap weed.
 A handful of good paying, local jobs within the city.
 Architecture. History. 
 Schuylkill River trail, Neversink Mt. trails, Mt.Penn and all of her trail and an incredibly challenging mountain bike trail.

"Hi!! I‚Äôm a local Wedding Photographer, so I might be of some help! I have worked with lots of really great venues, so I‚Äôm happy to offer some suggestions you can reach out to! 

Most venues have a hefty price tag due to things they include that other venues do not. (Tables and chairs, linens,etc) But I‚Äôve found that there are still a good amount of reasonably priced venues as well! 

Here are a few you can look into and see if they work with your budget: Wrennie Ruth‚Äôs, The Barn at Flying Hills, Bern Farm, Reinharts Barn Weddings, The Abraham Lincoln, The Gables at Stirling, Goggleworks, Ridgewood Winery, Rocky Top Lodge, Raddison Hotel.

"Extremely bad! Inconsiderate neighbors who like to play Reggaeton and Merengue late at night at incredibly high decibels, including from their cars.

High-rate of mentally unstable people walking out and about. The sort you don't want your kids to be near.

Apt buildings being used as pimp/prostitution houses  ""11th and walnut"", drive-by's by rivals drugs dealers common on that block too. Domestic abuse very, very high. Women's shelter/homeless shelter nearly always full. Multiple incidences of actual corruption by elected officials. Public school system is a mess. High dropout rate. Many kids part of street gangs and generally being unproductive. Many cases involving firearms brought into the schools, or found in some kids locker. Random strangers caught prowling the school buildings, usually gang related and the school has to be on lockdown till the issue is resolved. Sometimes a quarter of the police department is in the school cafeteria for a few days after these incidences.

Creeps, drug users and drug dealers prowl outside nearly every bar downtown. Downtown is a mess! Roaches, mice everywhere. Don't ever order pizza from downtown, especially from Maria's Pizza and bar. ""Just read the Google reviews"", unless you like roaches as extra toppings :)

">Police busted a number of speeders on Route 422 in Exeter Township Wednesday. Some drivers were clocked at speeds of nearly 100 miles per hour during the aggressive driving enforcement.

Oh, FFS.  They can't even refrain from lying about it.  Who here has EVER seen anyone doing 100 mph on 422?  That's when you're doing 50 and they pass you like you're standing still and they're doing 50.

"If there's a common denominator to why Reading is worse than any surrounding communities, in Berks or elsewhere, it's got to be city management.

* The school district sucks down tax revenue and spits out worst case scenarios where teachers starve, students don't learn, schools aren't safe, classes are immense, and things like music and other programs get cut down or cut out.
* Despite the above, taxes are ludicrous.  I pay more in property taxes for my 1,100 square foot turn-of-the-century fixer-upper than someone with a 4,000 sq foot mansion somewhere else in the county pays.
* And that's just property taxes. The way they extort cash for the privilege of working in the city should bring shame to everyone involved.  And they wonder why the city's economy flounders?
* Parking enforcement will simply rob you.  I'm talking about street cleaning signs put up within the same hour as the tickets are issued, instead of the day before as they were supposed to be.  Now they want to run meters on the weekends?  Why not shoot ourselves in the OTHER foot?

Reading was always going to have a lot of problems when the big industries melted away and the railroad slowed to a crawl.

"More than a decade ago, I routinely knew - and, once, was - the victim of the oft-rumored ""Lying street cleaning signs"".

That's when Public Works puts up the ""No Parking This Side After 8 AM"" all along one side of the street, to do sweeping, right?  Except the signs go up at 8:30 AM, and the tickets are all stamped 8:31 AM.

If the city has been willing to literally rob & extort us like that for decades, I'm not holding my breath that they'll do anything different anytime soon.  They'll get what they want.  If they're going to run the meters on the weekends (blasphemy, besides being outright stupid), and you can't trust the meters, I will simply not do business in the city if I have a choice - and I usually do.

"Avoid street numbers in the single digits.  Get a roommate if possible.  Suburbs are a crapshoot.  Parts of Shillington and Mt. Penn are every bit as bad or worse than some parts of the city proper, but most of them are OK.  Trust your eyes.  If it looks run-down, it's less safe.  Make use of Google Street View if you are too far to scout in person.  Shockingly high rent = safe neighborhood, I'm afraid (which is why the suburbs are a crapshoot; that's where you may find the affordable, safer spots, but it's hard to spot from the outside).

Moreover, don't make yourself a victim.  I've lived in Reading for 25 years now and this is 99.9% of not having crime happen to you.

* Don't assume that your car is visible enough to get away with leaving bags or electronics visible inside.
* Don't walk alone at night in poorly lit and deserted parts of the city, especially near bars.  Your dog likely doesn't count as ""not alone"" unless it's a giant rottweiler or something.
* Don't leave anything on a porch or lawn that you can't stand to have stolen.  Always lock your doors.

I know this sounds bad, but it's just common sense for a place as poor as Reading.  We are not the sort of place you can leave your door unlocked, but also not the sort of place you really have to fear anything insane like home invasion.  Again, 99.9% of the time none of this will matter, but you will be happy for the 0.1% of the time when it does.

The overwhelming majority of violent crime in Reading is gang-on-gang, so if you don't live in any *really* bad sections of town (those really small-numbered streets, anyplace run-down enough for you to flinch when you look at the houses), you won't get caught in any crossfires.

The overwhelming majority of property crime in Reading is fundraising by the gangs (mostly car theft & car break-ins), and burglary by drug addicts (anything pawnable).

"Reading Resident 25 years, Albright staff 18 of those, Albright alumnus.  Information could be a few years out of date, however, but not much.

The campus itself is quite safe.  I can't say it's well-patrolled *per se*, since Public Safety's weekend & evening staffing usually runs to all of 2 officers and a student dispatcher.  On the other hand, there is decent camera coverage and the campus is small enough that not much gets past them.  The only violent crime I ever heard of in all those years (and there's really only 1 incident, a mugging at gunpoint, that gets worse than ""drunken fistfight"") was perpetrated by an Albright student and not a local, IIRC.

North Reading in the neighborhood (walking distance) of the College isn't bad.  The rents are a bit high owing to the expensive houses & taking deliberate advantage of college students, though.  Get as many roommates as you can to split it down to something reasonable.  And be nice to your neighbors; they will rat you out to anyone who will listen - Public Safety, the cops, the friggin' FBI if they can - if you make too much noise or mess.  And Public Safety will respond to reports of problems - yours or your neighbors' - at private, off-campus housing, as a well-established, long-standing agreement with Reading PD.  I would not recommend living anywhere else in the city, however.  Anything affordable is going to be in a bad area and unpleasant (noisy, run-down) at the very least.

* Avoid walking alone at night off campus.  The neighborhoods adjacent to the College are fine, but any further out - especially the popular 10th street bars about 3 to 4 blocks away - is not, at least not late at night and alone.  Travel in a group and stay to well-lit major roads and you'll be fine.
* Avoid parking your car on the street, unless it's a street bordering campus.  If you must, do not leave anything tempting (bags, boxes, envelopes) or a flashy car stereo (detachable faceplates are recommended) in your car.  Stereo theft and car break-ins are still one of the major income sources for Reading gangs, but they stay away from the campus because it's watched.
   * EDIT:  I forgot, this is an issue for new students, as Albright used to not let freshmen obtain parking permits *unless* they are local commuters (i.e. went to a local high school) and don't live on campus.  So keep this in your mind.  If you feel you can't live without the car, one way or another you're going to have to put effort into finding safe places to park it, since they won't let you leave it in any campus lot (and they will fine the hell out of you).

Follow these common sense suggestions, and you're more likely to get hurt or robbed by your drunken roommates or housemates than people in Reading, so long as you avoid that solo drunk-walk home from the bar at 3 am.

Reading has a bad rep for crime, but 99% of it is gang-on-gang, car-related larceny for gang fundraising, and the usual drug addict & homeless theft of unattended property from yards, porches, sheds, etc.  Stay away from the low-single-digit street numbers and you won't get near the gang-on-gang stuff, and the rest of it can be avoided by not making yourself a victim and taking care to watch your stuff.",t2_5knbjz,Or0b0ur0s,0,1622301943.0,0,t1_gzvndnc,gzvndnc,True,New-King6459,t3_nnhzym,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadingPA/comments/nnhzym/albright_college/,Albright college,/r/ReadingPA/comments/nnhzym/albright_college/gzvndnc/,6,r/ReadingPA,0,6

"Growing up my dad was a pizza driver. 1995-2008 in Reading. He got robbed multiple times. Using knifes not a gun to my knowledge. Taking his wallet. Cash from work. Taking just the pizza. 

Someone tried to take my uncles car as he left it unlocked and running, but the thief didn‚Äôt know how to drive stick shift. 

My dad is a big dude who grew up in Reading, but in every scenario he was heavily outnumbered. I remember him having to call all the credit card companies and getting a new ID. Once a bunch of kids/teens tried to rob him and he smacked the knife out of his hands and told them to heck off.

"You've no idea, OP.  My elderly relatives just wanted to search local obituaries, but they kept getting browser hijacks from mis-clicking on deceptive ads, directly on the Reading Eagle site.  I'm talking 2, 3 times a week ""it says our computer was locked by the FBI until we pay..."" phone calls.  Just to read obituaries.

It got to the point that I outright blocked the entire URL so they couldn't go there, forcing them to use [Legacy.com](https://Legacy.com).  They weren't happy, but I couldn't keep running over there to un-hijack their browser every damned day.

No, they wouldn't use any browser I could load up with uBlock or other protections, either, or that's what I would have tried.  Still, the site was SO bad (lots of other non-infested-ad-related calls about why they can't find anything or the site doesn't load making them think their internet was out, etc.) it was the #1 generator of support calls for me, all the time.

"In my opinion, a reading public transportation railway is a terrible idea. Nobody around here uses public transportation, the public busses are completely empty 24/7.

" Hello everyone!

This is a fictional rail network map I have created for the Delaware Valley region of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. I was inclined to create this because I felt that the Philadelphia area could still use some better connectivity and frequency of rail (although it is still quite good under general US commuter rail standards), especially across the Delaware River itself to give more southern New Jerseyans rail access other than PATCO and the infrequent NJT Atlantic City line. I also noticed that there are a decent amount of urban centers in southeastern Pennsylvania such as Allentown, Reading, and Bethlehem that would surely benefit from connections to-and-from Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs.

The ""Suburban Lines"" listed in the bottom left are the commuter rail services which serve a lot of what SEPTA already does today, yet with added lines branching out to other underserved areas that could use the rail equally as much. The ""Regional Lines"" extend out further distances than the suburban lines, skipping many of the stops along the way in order to make for quicker journies between high demand cities and suburbs. I intentionally did not include one of these regional lines on the Northeast corridor since Amtrak would most likely be taking on that intercity-connector role. Stations served by Amtrak are indicated by the logo next to the station name. The thin, light grey lines are services ran by other operating companies, which in this (fictional) world would have their own maps, trains, rights of way, etc.

I made this map entirely out of pure enjoyment. I am totally open to constructive criticism and/or suggestions on what I could add, fix, or change on the map (especially if you are from the area represented in the map), but please do not take this \*too\* seriously as I am just a teenager with a wandering imagination :).
