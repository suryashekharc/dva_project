"Ok your ideological solution to what you think is the capitalist thumb is to take the bus.  That only works for people that work and live in Norman.  If you work in north Oklahoma City, taking the bus would literally take you 3-4 hours, plus walking from whatever bus stop is closest to your work.  That is not a viable solution.

Further, OKC was founded in 1889 and a massive chunk of OKC, and *especially* the surrounding area used to be farm land.  That's large, spread out areas with little infrastructure in-between.  Oklahoma isn't spread out because Henry Ford wanted you to buy a car.  It's spread out because that's what used to drive our economy.

The real ideological solution to traffic and commuting is self-driving vehicles.  Remove manual human operation from the problem.

"I agree that it's far-fetched to try and alter the national hyper-capitalist machine.

"I absolutely agree, while I've never been homeless, I've gotten close but somehow managed to keep my head above water so far.  


The changes I'm saying that I want to see would involve a massive change in public transportation funding, infrastructure spending, and public perception of buses.

In my vision of an improved Norman, there would be a bus stop on nearly every corner and it would be paid for by the money we already put into taxes (instead of just being used for artificial wars that generate profit for corporations) because it would just be how everyone gets around town.

The reason I posted that was out of frustration for the political climate of Norman. Norman is by far the most liberal area of Oklahoma. However, liberal parties exist to act as a fake left wing that ultimately just agrees with the right wing; the only difference being that they want the world to be ran by a small minority of rich racially, sexually, and gender diverse people rather than just white males.  There does not exist a political party in the United States that is left wing in any global sense of the word.

"I was homeless in Norman for a long time (2013-2017), and I used the bus during that time.   


During that time, it also occurred to me that overwhelmingly students and poor/homeless people use the bus. Due to the hours that busses ran, they were useless as a mode of transportation for working adults. If I had a job that began when busses ran, most days there would be no bus to take me back to where I was sleeping.  


The only way to increase the adoption of busses is to make them more practical and appealing to use. For that we would need to increase funding for public transportation, which won't happen because the prevailing thought is, ""Only students and poor/homeless people use the busses, and I am not a student or poor.""

"Because capitalism.

You are a commodity, not a person.
The end goal of capitalism is to maximize profits for shareholders, not necessarily improve happiness.

Our politicians only care about what you think during an election period. Even then they only care about your perception of them, not your actual wellbeing.

In order to set public perception, you need marketing, which costs money (additionally you want money for yourself). By working with lobbyists, you can aquire money from businesses that want to influence politics in the region.

Working with lobbyists means you have to pass legislation that pushes their agenda.


If workers have securities in place, from anti-discrimination laws, to unions, to any other form of government oversight, the labor market becomes more elastic. Elasticity is bad for employers because their main goal is to pay you the minimum possible amount that still keeps you selling them your labor.

Furthermore, legally required breaks directly effects a company's bottom line, which means it is in their interest to lobby against them.

Oklahoma has also historically been a right leaning state. Right wing politics follow the belief that capital ($) and business are higher priority than citizens themselves. This stems from their strong belief in rugged individualism over social safety nets and collectivism.

Its also worth noting that to become a politician you cannot be enslaved by a 9-5 that you need to survive, simply because you need time and/or money to get elected. This results in nearly all politicians being from higher wealth backgrounds which generally means you have personal ties to businesses in the region.

"Cars in general are inefficient. We should be focusing on making our city walkable/bikable and improving public transportation.


Traffic will always increase in congestion unless the city loses population somehow from a tragic event. Gas prices also continue to rise despite historically low oil prices, showing that the trend will likely continue as gas companies are setting prices arbitrarily (because it is an inelastic good)

Next time you are on HWY 9 with a line of cars stetching farther than you can see, imagine all of those cars reduced to a handful of busses.

Or just consider that there is essentially no such thing as traffic in a pedestrian city. 

I like to imagine what Norman would look like if you just deleted the roads and highways and smushed the city together.

">  Even if it’s not state mandated you could argue that it’s federally mandated.

It is not federally mandated that you get break, unless you are a minor.

Dept of Labor:

>Federal law does not require lunch or coffee breaks. However, when employers do offer short breaks (usually lasting about 5 to 20 minutes), federal law considers the breaks as compensable work hours that would be included in the sum of hours worked during the workweek and considered in determining if overtime was worked. Unauthorized extensions of authorized work breaks need not be counted as hours worked when the employer has expressly and unambiguously communicated to the employee that the authorized break may only last for a specific length of time, that any extension of the break is contrary to the employer's rules, and any extension of the break will be punished.

>Meal periods (typically lasting at least 30 minutes), serve a different purpose than coffee or snack breaks and, thus, are not work time and are not compensable.

"Oh I see it’s a charter. Their website has a link to the Okla Report Card but I can’t find any data on the school. It’s not a federal ASTI school but it may not go by the same standards idk? Im an educator but come from another state & from my 3 years experiences here in Oklahoma the public school system in general is years behind to say the least. Main 2 issues I see are 1. Teacher salary is so low that it does not attract and retain certified and talented teachers who practice research-based best practice no matter the grade level 2. The amount of emergency cert teachers that are not properly trained is sky high so the at a minimum research best practices are just not happening plus administration does not want to piss off teachers bc nationwide shortage so there is absolutely zero accountability. It’s hard to teach the right way & do the right things for students when all the other teachers do whatever they want + as a teacher you get asked to do more and more and more especially data analysis/synthesizing the data to create intervention with zero raise ever. Teachers have no incentive to stay past the exact minute of the end of their contract hours which is typically a few min after students leave/teacher after school duty. They have about 45 min during the day for a planning period which is 99% taken up by meetings and things of that sort. There is rarely a teacher planning period where teachers plan esp as a collaborative team which is best practice. Schools have to get creative with covering classes and ensuring that teams meet and also have proper PLC time which is something different. This would actually help veteran and new teachers to collaborate and start using research-based best practices however that doesn’t happen here that I can see so student lessons are always going to be not what they could be if teachers actually had the time to align lessons to the state standards (mandatory), create more hands on & authentic (real life) lessons in a meaningful and purposeful way that would actually impact student learning/growth. I don’t like it but totally understand. So if LeMond is one step above any of this I say go for it.",t2_2gn7qtnp,appleorangebananna,0,1647804611.0,0,t1_i1furq4,i1furq4,False,NotASleepyOwl,t3_tin84v,https://www.reddit.com/r/normanok/comments/tin84v/is_le_monde_prek_good/,Is le monde pre-k good?,/r/normanok/comments/tin84v/is_le_monde_prek_good/i1furq4/,2,r/normanok,0,2

The panels are guaranteed to be producing at 80% capacity at 30 years, so lifespan is amazing.

"No, but I would rather buy one than purchase another vehicle from Big Red. 😀

I bought a new vehicle last month from Bob Moore Nissan in Norman. It was purchased nearly 100% online, with only the signing day, completing financing at the dealership and receiving the car in person on the day we got the car. It was overall an easy, painless process, as far as buying cars go. 

For Nissan, if purchasing a new vehicle, it is taking 3-6 months to get the vehicle depending on specifics. We lucked out when we were getting quoted the exact vehicle we wanted was about to be placed on the truck headed to the dealership. My husband has driven a Nissan for 10 years, which he acquired at Big Red. It has been a great car and he has used Bob Moore service department over the years.

"As my wife says about Landers Chevrolet... ""The sales department won my business, their service department has lost it forever.""

We had two great experiences buying vehicles from Landers. One used and one brand new. The service department is likely one of the most ironically named departments in existence, as service is absolutely the last thing on their minds. If you go look into them, I advise that you don't sign any deals that offer incentives to use their service department, such as free oil changes for a couple years when signing up for a warranty. My truck has sat in the lot for 1 week before waiting on an oil change, even after scheduling an appointment. I finally had to go in person and raise hell to get them to pull it into the shop, then it was another day and a half before the work was done. Similar experience with my wife's 2022 Traverse when we had a warranty issue that the service department tried to blame on us and decline to repair, despite our salesman vouching for us that the issue was there before we even purchased.",t2_ey9qbwuu,Fig_Bucking_Fella,0,1647447190.0,0,t1_i0wf51i,i0wf51i,True,Proper_Article_3637,t3_tfi3re,https://www.reddit.com/r/normanok/comments/tfi3re/anyone_know_of_any_decent_car_lots/,Anyone know of any decent car lots?,/r/normanok/comments/tfi3re/anyone_know_of_any_decent_car_lots/i0wf51i/,7,r/normanok,0,7

"I'm confused by your comment. My argument is that ""critical race theory"" is a red herring. The teachers / professors do not have some kind of hidden agenda. They are simply seeking to teach actual facts. Further, ""critical race theory"" is a course taught at 1 Ivy League LAW SCHOOL. It's not something that democrats conspired together to teach kids how to be gay or whatever the argument is against it.   


US History is filled with atrocities that we have committed against the world. Since we give our military all of our tax money instead of paying for OUR education, healthcare, and retirement, our politicians only motive is to feed the war machine and not take care of us.   


The ""anti-critical-race-theory"" bill is nothin more than performative within the meat of the bill. However, the GOP base gets fed the idea that they are stopping some kind of communist/gay agenda by supporting these measures. On it's face, this is nothing more than a culture war. That is, republican and dem voters aren't really that far apart on what they want for the country, but these bullshit bills and ESPECIALLY the mainstream media on both sides profit from our division.

"""Right to work"" in the states just reminds the worker they should not be forced to join a union. It's already illegal under federal law to do this. 

A union is only as strong, effective and powerful as the members who participate in its operation and activities.  Some of the ""fuck you got mine"" attitudes in the state do not mix well with union organizing, as it involves solidarity among workers and realizing that everyone deserves a fair shake when it comes to safety at work, pay, and benefits. 

There is a saying you are not ""in a union"" you ""are the union"" (and this applies to many forms of organizing, if your group names itself and does nothing what is there?)

"Turnpike money is a big part of funding for the DOT. In other states the tax money you pay on your tag and title go to the DOT, but in Oklahoma that’s not the case, at least not fully. The DOT only gets a small portion of that and the rest goes to our underfunded schools. So the DOT needs more funding, they aren’t getting it through the tag and title tax, and wouldn’t try to (can you imagine someone from the DOT trying to lobby for money to be taken away from the schools and given to them instead? It’d be career suicide and they know that, it’s why they don’t do it) so they have to find other ways of funding themselves and pretty much their only options are turnpikes. You know it’s not coincidence that the biggest turnpike is between OKC and Tulsa and to get around it take a lot longer time. That’s by design, so that the DOT can use that money to fund projects.

I think also what we’re seeing now is a result of the last few years of our state legislature not approving funding packages across state governmental organizations. DOT was technically operating without a budget for a couple years there, and it led to a huge disruption in the processing of road projects. So the DOT gets hit from all sides with funding issues, basically, and turnpikes are a way to try and alleviate that.

"Despite your demeaning manner, you don’t address the substance of the evidence I provided. The Durham investigation is just beginning with the indictments and it has been digging since 2017. There is going to be a lot of high level indictments.

It’s the unwillingness to consider anything that contradicts your loyalty to a party that has lost its way. I’m actually a big fan of the original Progressives, like Teddy Roosevelt. Since Vietnam, the Dem party has been the catch-all for every hate-America lobby. It’s anti-family, anti-God, and now, provably authoritarian. I’m no fan of the GOP because it has been compromised, too. Trump was very much a Teddy Roosevelt-like populist. That’s why I supported him. His own party hated him, too.

The sad part is that you won’t engage in dialogue that considers the possibility that your party is filled with communists and criminals. Hillary is a other Boss Tweed. The party screwed over Bernie so Hillary could win. If we can’t actually address the “facts of the case” and consider evidence, America is done. If people like us can’t talk civilly and reasonably, civil war is inevitable.

You will see that your gloating was premature. It’s so ironic you call me manipulated when you get your news from the MSM exclusively. Try reading. I mostly read international web sites from Britain, France, and Germany. Heck, I read Al-Jazeera and Haaretz. I can prove every point I made without resorting to a US news site. I’m open to dialogue, but if you’re not willing to consider opposing views, it’s a pointless exercise.

"Hi, I haven’t been on Reddit for months. I got the notification that you replied.

Let’s see.

We had the media admit that Hunter Biden’s laptop was the real deal and they suppressed it because Trump would have gotten re-elected.

We have had evidence of improper, fraudulent, and illegal activity in the counting of votes in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Wisconsin just announced that Facebook’s Zuckerberg-money to influence the election there may be prosecuted as bribery.

We had New York Gov. Cuomo forced to resign for sexually harassing women. His brother on CNN got fired cor covering it up.

We have indictments by Durham of a lawyer associated with Hillary’s campaign.

We have indictments showing that Hillary paid a contractor to spy on the Trump campaign, Trump Tower, and the White House.

We have Dem-sympathizers in social media suppressing free speech.

A crooked Dem prosecutor tried to sabotage his own case in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial. The MSM also tried to doxx the jury and intimidate them.

Facebook this week allowed users to praise the Ukrainian neo-Nazi group, the Azov Regiment, but only because it’s fighting Putin.

I could keep on going, but it would do no good. I don’t expect you to acknowledge any of these things. The wheels of justice turn slow, especially when liberal justices slow things down and appeals have to be made.

Yes, prosecutions are going to happen. Your impatience is a sign of youth, relatively speaking. Democrats are cheering on suppression of free speech, sabotaging the economy, silencing critics of masks and mandates. Gas prices, inflation, Afghanistan,  etc. November is going to be a red wave. Biden will be impeached. Hillary will go to a cell in Gitmo, Podesta, Adam Schiff, and others will face charges for child trafficking, and many more will be exposed. Obama will claim Kenyan citizenship to avoid treason charges.

"Defund The Police is the worst choice of phrasing since Black Lives Matter. It gives an opening to semi-literate people to misinterpret the intent. BLM means Black Lives Matter Too, which would have been hard to refute without revealing racist intent. 

Similarly Defund The Police makes it sound like you are removing all funding when the intent was reallocate funding to facilitate a change in duties, i.e.: let armed officers focus on actual crime rather than diverting them to less urgent calls such as mental health issues which they are not trained to deal with.

Instead we have a hot button for hot heads to rage about without understanding. The Norman police budget was never CUT. A portion of their budget increase was reallocated to other policing resources.

This was a quote one of the founders made in an online speaker forum about 15 years ago:

""I can provide the information you are looking for because I was one of the founders of Norman Labs. The company was started in 1971 by myself and Leonard Bernstein (not the former music director of the New York Philharmonic). I was an engineerng graduate of the University of Oklahoma but was not a student at the time we started the company. I graduated in 1965 and worked in the audio field for a few years, including a stint with Altec, before we formed Norman Laboratories. I handled the engineering and production and Leonard Bernstein handled sales and marketing. We sold the company to an investment group from Ft. Worth, Texas, in about 1981 and I left the company in about 1984. Until I left the company I did all of the design work (including the Model 10 that was mentioned above). The company was sold again a few years later and was closed down about 8 or 10 years ago.

"Hope you enjoy your time in Norman!

Some of my favorite places are:

The Garage- Neat sit-down burger place. I would suggest parking in the back off of Grey St. (Main St. in Norman can be very frustrating). Hal Smith restaurant, not exclusive to Norman but it is good!

The Mont- I honestly haven't eaten here in I don't know how long but it has a neat vibe and has been on campus forever. I know a lot of people like the food. 

Penny Hill- Burgers, sandwiches, and a little bit of everything else. I love penny hill! I lived right down the road for a couple years so I frequented this place and any time my friends are in town that is the place we go to grab a beer. 

Midway Deli- The Vulcan is the greatest sandwich on Earth, it will change your life. I would suggest midway as my first choice. It's just a small sandwich shop tucked away behind campus corner but it is so stinkin good. It's pretty small and a little pricey but it is totally worth it.

"When people travel from south of Norman there is only one way to the Okc area - I35 or Sooner Road 🙄. Traffic the last decade has slowed significantly - especially when reaching Moore. This will allow traffic diversion in Purcell, and in two directions before reaching Moore. I am sure that by the time this is finished it will be a much needed traffic diversion. One of the best things about this metro is how our traffic is mostly pleasant compared to other metros. A big part of that is due to our interstate/turnpike “grid” system around Okc. Our government agencies don’t do a lot well but traffic moves well compared to other metros I’ve lived/visited. I’d like to keep it that way. 

As an added bonus, east Norman will expand and create revenue so all the Karens west of the interstate will have to share.
