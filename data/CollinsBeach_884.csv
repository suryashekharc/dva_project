"Both beaches are public, so they are both good and bad for what you are asking about.

Collins Beach is managed by Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife.  Parking permits are required to park in most wildlife and beach areas on Sauvie Island.  Permits can be obtained at a few places, the most common one being the store right as you cross the bridge onto the island.  An annual pass is also an option.

Rooster Rock is a state park, and thus managed by the State Parks division.  Parking here is fee based.

There are transit options to Rooster Rock from Portland metro, but for Collins the best you can reach is the island's park & ride, again by that store and bridge.

There are no regular security sweeps, again these are public access beaches so expect minimal interaction with parks services, sheriff departments, etc.

Alcohol is prohibited at Collins Beach starting in May.  So.. though you may not expect much policing of the beach, DO expect some booze sweeps from time to time.

Because the beaches are public, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy and thus nothing directly unlawful for picture takers to get their fill.  That being said, little of this activity happens.  I haven't personally seen it, at worst I was on some old dude's cell phone from the WNBR in 2019.  Yay?..

Creepers and those who want to engage in sexual activity are both somewhat frowned upon.  While some have a ""if you are not harming somebody and such, do what you want"" attitude, I'd rather not see things close or get weird because of poor choices of what to do in a public place.  They are illegal activities, so there's that.  The community is helpful in stepping in where needed to self-manage things if needed.

Since they are public places, it is pretty much first come first serve.  Parking at Collins can and will end up full, particularly on the hot days.  Earlier arrival helps your chances.  Occasionally the police will set up a stop and turn people around the island instead of continuing towards the beach when it gets full.  Rooster has a significantly larger parking area, though also serves for parking for all kinds of state park activities.  To date I haven't been able to not park at Rooster.

Check in as the weather turns better and both beach and post activity will pick up.",t2_gu9wx,headcrap,0,1638047163.0,0,t1_hmbho1x,hmbho1x,True,doomhalofan,t3_r3mj9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollinsBeach/comments/r3mj9j/never_been_but_i_might_be_going_with_a_friend_for/,"Never been but i might be going with a friend for the first time in summer, so i have a few questions regarding security and whatnot",/r/CollinsBeach/comments/r3mj9j/never_been_but_i_might_be_going_with_a_friend_for/hmbho1x/,4,r/CollinsBeach,0,4

"It might also be wise to add questions that discourage behavior that ruins the beach for everyone, like questions about sexual activities, being a gawker/creepy, etc.   


Wording on gawking could be something like:   


""Everyone looks at others on the beach, but there's a fine line between glancing in someone's direction and being creepy. Don't be the person who causes another visitor to stop visiting Collins. We want this to be a welcoming and comfortable environment for everyone.""  


On sexual stuff, we could also make the point that this kind of activity increases the chance that we'll have the beach taken away. There are very few official nudist beaches in the USA, and it's often hard to keep them.  


Controversial though it is, I'd support language that explicitly makes it clear that families are welcome, though I've seen comments from people here suggesting otherwise. So maybe that has to be left alone, idk. But the presence of families does reinforce the idea that this isn't a sexual thing, which I think is good for the culture of the beach and pushing out creepers.

"That's great! Thanks :)

I think it would be good to provide information about gate numbers in there since it gets asked a lot. This is what I've picked up, but please edit/correct anything incorrect:

**Gate 1:** The only clothed portion of the beach.  
**Gate 2:** Large areas of sand (going further back from the water), often more families and younger people. Lots of space to spread out.  
**Gate 3-4:** Less sand, but more trees with shade lining the back of the beach.  
**Gate 5:** Boaters, regulars, often older crowd, tends to be more social.  
**Gate 6:** Area with more trees/bushes breaking up the beach. Typically more gay guys/LGBTQ in general, but this may vary.

(\*Can't vouch for this myself, but based on other comments.)

Also just the basic idea of gates:

"Wow, folks, I didn't expect all the replies here, thank you, this information helped.

We ended up going out yesterday and it was SO much better than our experience at Rooster Rock -- more women, some kids, etc.  My wife even went full nude this time because there were more women/couples which was awesome.

&#x200B;

A few observations from a newbie which may or may not feed into the nascent FAQ:

1. People talk about ""Gate 5"", etc.  We stopped at the first park signage that said ""clothing optional"" (which I think was second after the road turned to gravel) but I didn't see anything like a ""gate"" or a any sort of ID for the entrance -- just a very short path through the ""woods"" and bang, you were on the beach!  Much closer to the car than RR so in the future I now know I can take more/bigger things easier (lugging a cooler down to RR would be a huge slog!)
2. The clothed/unclothed ratio there was about 50/50.  We didn't walk around too much but my impression was there were more unclothed as you went North (eg. ""deeper"" into the nude beach area, away from the normal beach).
3. The water this time of year was maybe 200-300 feet from the trees which made for a really nice size beach.  We made our ""camp"" in the shade of some outlying trees and had a nice short walk to the water
4. The water was a really comfortable temperature and nice for some swimming.  Beach didn't seem to have any steep drop-offs as far out at we went (maybe 30' from shore and in about 4' of water)
5. There was someone kayaking out there (naked!) and seemed to be having no problems going up-stream (we didn't feel any significant current when swimming).
6. We did walk up one of the ""normal"" beach entrances (the stairs) and I noticed they have numbers painted on the steps (I think we checked out number ""7"").  But, the other side was a crazy steep concrete embankment to actually get down to the beach (and no stairs on that side).  Makes me wonder if a lot of the ""textiles"" on the nude beach are just there because it's more accessible?
7. I just happened to check Google maps while we were there and noticed ""The UFO"" on the map so we had to go check that out.  The graphitti art on it is top notch and the fact that someone has made a ramp to get up inside is awesome.  Also super glad someone put the laminated sign telling a bit about its history.

Anyways, thank you all for the info.

"-Water levels, it's super close. No long hikes to the water.

-The nude part starts after you get across the street from the gravel spot you park in. 

-Parking is next to a gravel road and you need to buy a parking pass for less than $10 for the day at the local store. There's tons of parking. An Oregon day use does not work here. Parking is always park at your own risk. Do not leave anything in your car.

-There are no defined areas for anyone. However there used to be a a time when the gay guys would go towards the end of the beach. Towards the beginning you'll still see families at the clothing beach.

-No areas to really avoid. I've actually never seen sex going on there after years and numerous visits.

-Would it work for kayaking? The current is very strong and there's a nasty undertow with a very steep drop off. I don't see kayaks out here. 

-Don't forget the sunscreen and most important do not forget the bug repellent. When the sun starts to go down the hungry mosquitos come out in droves.

I usually start at gate 5 (there are little numbers on the corners of the signposts, leading into the beach area).

There are typically several boats on the shore, in the gate 5 area, as well, but don’t let them deter you, either. Pretty much every boater, in the gate 5 area, will also be participating in nudism.

"Today, I went back to Collins, for the first time in over ten years. I was at gate 5, but it was actually fairly mellow, and not overly crowded, with a good mix of beach goers. Hardly anyone passing through, or on the beach remained clothed, and I didn’t witness any lewd behavior. I was actually quite surprised, because I was expecting worse.

It felt like what a clothing optional beach should be like; a friendly and open atmosphere, where everyone is actually choosing to go without clothing, while enjoying the weather, beach, and company of others…….Just wish my wife could have come along, because it would have made the day even better.

It comes down to behavior, really.  ""Textile"" behavior is shaming those enjoying being unclothed at the clothing optional beach.. or over-enjoying their visit by staring, catcalling, etc.

If somebody shows up and wants to chill.. I'm fine with that.  Chill is why I come here.. if you want to wear board shorts and a tee and chill.. I'm fine with that.  When you want to bitch about us or behave poorly, I'm not fine with that.

"I had a pretty negative experience at CB yesterday too. Not as bad as this but still made me leave early. Everything was great in the first hour but soon after:

1) what I would call some “influences” came out. He got naked, she stayed in her bikini the whole time. They proceeded to take dozens of photos including what looked like one panoramic which I was in without my permission. Not a fan of people taking excessive photos at a nude beach. Just seems selfish. I saw a couple of guys photobomb them naked. 
2) Two clothed Hispanic guys walk by way too close with plenty of room to go around me. I kind of brushed it off until I watched them drive to a different gate and go back to the beach. Clearly there to gawk and I suspect looking for women to stare at. 
3) A group of 12 textiles posted up 15 feet from me with plenty of beach and shade to be had, talking loudly. One of them eventually got topless but many ran down to the water in full suits. They could have gone to 100s of other places and chose instead to sit within earshot of me instead. Totally ruined the quiet vibe I was having and I left early as a result.

"So there’s some terminology trouble here. Some people may describe a cock piercing as a “cock ring” (ie a nose ring). And a cock piercing is pretty much just jewelry. 

But a cock ring, as in a silicon ring worn around the base of the penis to strengthen or prolong an erection is objectively not “just jewelry”. It’s literally a sex toy, with a specifically sexual purpose. I also don’t understand how you can view a butt plug as anything but a sex toy. You’ve got a dildo up your ass. That’s not just an aesthetic statement piece. 

I actually commented this same thing in the debate mentioned in the comment you’re responding to, but I think it bears repeating here: 

I’m not even all that down on sexual activity at the beach. If you want to sneak off someplace then have fun. It’s like banging in the changing room at the mall; yeah, it’s probably kind of rude but it’s got an element of discretion (ie it’s behind a barrier) and it plays into “we might get caught” kinks that I think are actually pretty common. “Where’s the riskiest place you’ve had sex” is a conversation that basically any group of friends are going to have. 

However, there is a big difference between banging in the mall changing room and emerging from that changing room with your tits out and sporting chained nipple clamps, or with your dick hanging out of your fly with those same cock rings we’re talking about wrapped around it. You’ve just gone from “risky sex” to “public flaunting” making absolutely no effort to conceal the sexual nature of what you’re doing and, indeed, openly displaying it to everybody else. 

Having sex, discreetly, in semi-public spaces is pretty normal (if, again, somewhat rude and arguably trashy). Waving your sex toys around openly with the expectation and desire for other people to see them is a step beyond that.",t2_gklb1,Pseudoname17,0,1628118497.0,0,t1_h7qkre8,h7qkre8,False,Sunrideror,t3_oxgmzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollinsBeach/comments/oxgmzt/i_think_i_just_saw_some_poor_lady_get_run_off/,I think I just saw some poor lady get run off.,/r/CollinsBeach/comments/oxgmzt/i_think_i_just_saw_some_poor_lady_get_run_off/h7qkre8/,3,r/CollinsBeach,0,3
"It's quite opposite for me usually. A few years back I was somewhat known as the woman who puts up the *Do Not Disturb* sign. LOL. I show up, lay my things out, strip down, and start reading my book. I would guess that 3/4ths of the time that I visit I get at least one of these: The ""Bros"" that like to throw their ball/frisbee in my area to strike up a conversation, the couples that have the woman approach me to ask if I need protection from the gazers, and the guys that set up next to waiting for me to make eye contact and when I don't, they start eating to offer me a bit. Headphones on, dark sunglasses on, and I just ignore them. 

The jewelry argument goes out once you think about their purpose and with the cock ring: to ""engorge the penis to an erect state"". Jewelry does not do this. The buttplug, is debatable and in *most* cases could easily be hidden from view but I guess it depends on the wearer and where they are at. Piercings, at least not that I am aware of, are not there to erect the penis or provide sexual stimulation *at that moment*. I don't see why those would be an issue.

"Sadly, this is pretty normal for me (single woman, often by myself). 

Speaking for myself here, if this scenario would have happened for me, I would have appreciated you walking up, preferably with shorts on (see below), and hinting that you know me and either telling or hinting for the other guys to leave. ""Hey Kim, I didn't see you here. Guys, how about respecting the woman and leaving her alone?"" Then, when you are able, and as quickly as possible, tell me that you will be leaving as soon as I say that I feel safe. Expect that I will have you leave and know that I appreciate you. 

Often times the ""hero"" in these scenarios becomes the annoying creep just as fast as Mr. Erection or towel dude because they then feel that I owe them. It's trading one creep for another. 
 

So, why shorts on? First and foremost, this is probably just me. But to me, it's telling me that at this moment you are possibly the least creepiest of these options. Also, in my experience of trading one creep for another, the guy with the shorts on has almost never been the creep.

"> Does being a single old man, walking around the beach make some people uncomfortable?

Not in our book. 

However, here are a few that have qualified for us - some are repeated in similar ways, some are more rare:
______________

* First, let's call this guy, ""Jim"". Jim walks between us and the river: no biggie, **0 of 5** in the creep factor. 

* ""Jim"" then proceeds to pace and stare at us for the next 10-15 mins until we turn towards each other and my wife covers up a bit: **3 out of 5** in the creep dept. 

* First smile at us by ""Jim"" is okay, subsequent others every 20-30 seconds, while pacing and staring earns a solid, **4 out of 5** in the creep dept. 
______________

* Next, we have ""Rian"". ""Rian"" goes out of his way to walk by us and then stare as he passes. Hard to blame him but since his boundaries are clearly in question: **2 out of 5** creepy. 

* Rian on his next pass goes out of his way to walk up to us and start talking. Usually depends but averages **2 out of 5**. Admittedly, this is deeply subjective but rarely does our body posture, location, or anything about us in these particular scenarios say, *please approach us*. Rian is just being no boundaries creepy Rian. There is a difference here between just being friendly and approaching hoping to score better seats.  

* Rian not leaving when we politely keep the conversation short or flat out tell him, ""we're here just to enjoy the beach with each other"" or even the rarely used, but used nonetheless, ""time to go Rian"": **4 out of 5** creepy


______________

* Next up is Todd, I loathe Todd's. Todd, likes to go straight to 5 out of 5 creepy. First we have the 'wait in the bushes or nearby for male partner to leave woman alone'. Todd usually waits until I'm 20 yards away before beginning his almost sprint to my wife who is now all by herself. He then proceeds to ""annoy the shit out of her""; **5 out of 5** creepy. 

* Todd also likes to circle around us a few times, staring, grinning, and stroking and touching himself: **5 out of 5** creepy. 

* Todd is also the same one that often times, after the aforementioned 'circle and jerk', go into the bushes and itch himself violently. **5 out of 5** creepy. 
______________

Then we have a bunch of others that are more general:

* Fauxtographer Carl: the closer he gets and more obvious it is that he's taking pictures of others without permission and he goes from **3-5 out of 5** on the creeper scale. 

* The duo of Flirty Stacy and Filthy Frank who like to work as a team. Stacy is led off to approach us, get to know us, and gets comfy under the guise of avoiding creeps and is looking for safety of couple, when out of nowhere, ""OH, Hey! It's my husband/boyfriend/partner Frank!""... And suddenly the friendly chat is tried to turn to couple swap talk. **4 out of 5** creep. Note: it's not the swinger angle or any of that, it's the approach of putting the woman forward then sending in the tank all while lying about it all. 

* In-Your-Bubble Barney Rubble: Barney sees a wide open beach with few people around and decides to set up 15 feet from you.... Doesn't stare, smiles occasionally, but makes you think why the 100 yards to the left and right that are open weren't good enough for him: **1 out of 5** creepy but still creepy. 

* Pistol Petey: You know him, the ""Salesman"" with the towel... Harmless but what the fuck is up with him? **4 out of 5** creepy. 

* Honorable mention: Cock Ring dude... This was debated over on RR subreddit and I usually stay out of them but apparently there are guys who are totally okay with wearing Cock Rings near families. Maybe I'm wrong here but that is definitely a **5 out of 5** creepy for me. 

* The-one-that-some-say-is-creepy-but-I-disagree, known as ""The Greeter"". I haven't seen this at Collins but there are a few guys at Rooster that hang out on the main trail as you walk to the beach that set up facing everyone who enters. He just lays there wearing a smile and is usually the first bit of nudity you run across as you walk down.

"For this case you described - this single old man walking the beach should not be considered a creeper if that is all he is doing. Seen that plenty.

"There used to be a Friends of Collins Beach group, organized through Yahoo Groups (RIP), that organized and coordinated efforts to help women feel safe with volunteer beach stewards, organized beach clean up efforts, and worked as liaisons to the Rangers and other authorities, helped remove gawkers and the like. 

I was just thinking about this. It may be time to resurrect that group again. One of the best things about the beach was the Yellow Flag system. Volunteer stewards would post a yellow flag at various places along the beach and people knew they were safe places to go when anyone felt uncomfortable and needed to remove anyone being creepy. 

It's been a few years since the Yahoo Groups things went away and i don't think anyone has picked up the mantle since. 

We need to build up the nude population or we'll loose this beach by attrition and I fear it will be hard to get it back if it's gone.

I can totally see how for some people other parts of their life may be at risk if photos get out that they didn't consent to. (Although for me it wouldn't make a difference).

I don't think my naked form is any more remarkable then my clothed form. If other people (who aren't creeps) are at the nude beach and laughing at me for being nude that's not my problem. They chose to be at a nude beach so they get to deal with the reprocusions of seeing nude people. People who are dumb enough to get all the way out there and do that don't bother me cause they are just so dumb. If I could choose I would of course want only nude people on the beach and for these kinds of people to fuck off, but given I'm never gonna be able to magically make that choice, I personally can deal.

"As much as it goes against my tendency to just be left alone to chill.. it may be time that we make friends with each other and ""organize"" a bit more.  Strength in numbers is about the best I can think of.

Aside, we may need some legislation around an expectation of privacy when it comes to photography.  While in general photos of other people in public places is generally legal, it certainly goes without saying that taking photos of other people in general, especially at a clothing-optional beach, without consent is at least rude.  It should be reasonable to consider a consent law for nude beach photography.. seems that common sense and good etiquette is lost on some.

Aside.. I don't understand how the selfie crowd gets off by taking pics of themselves, and us, at a nude beach without taking nude selfies of themselves.  It just seems kinda dumb to me.. but maybe others get off from it (they probably do...).

It may be up to us to ""guide"" others about being a good neighbor at the beach.. which means we need to generally be on the same page about it.

"I've been going to Collins pretty regularly for the last 6 or 7 years. This is just my perception of the gates. 

Gate 1- NOT clothing optional. Either overflow for Sauvie Island Beach on crowded days or people who want to see naked people but not be naked themselves. 

Gates 2-3- a good mix of young and old, families, singles, couples, etc. Can be more active and loud/music on busy weekends. The volleyball courts used to attract a large crowd of regulars, but I haven't been out on the weekends too much lately. The UFO attracts all sorts of people, clothed and nude.

Gate 4- again a good mix of people but this gate seems to be a bit more chill.

Gate 5- tends to be the boater gate. This crowd knows a lot of each other and are regulars at Collins. Drinkers/partiers/lifestyle types. 

Gate 6- people seem to go up here for privacy and for rendezvous away from public eyes. The north end of Gate 6 used to attract an LGBTQ crowd, but I haven't been up that way in a while.

"In my experience (and I'm not really a regular yet, so take it with a grain of salt), Collins is more consistently beachy, and I feel safer alone at it as a cis white woman.  I like stretching and walking the beach, and the openness of Collins, with mild cover, tends to make me more comfortable, even when I occasionally get the ""guy in the bushes near me.""    


Collins does tend to be majority white or white passing folks, in my experience, unlike Rooster Rock, in my experience, so the safety feeling might change for non-white individuals.    


Both have perks, both have downsides, and both vary by day and who is actually there, so consider going to both a couple of times?

"During high beach season (summer proper), 9-10am weekend arrival means you’ll probably have your choice of several prime sandy spots. This is an ideal window for sure. 

With a 10-11am arrival you maybe have a chance to snag the last “desirable” spot. 

After 11:30am you’re probably mostly fucked until 4pm or so unless you want to get cozy with your neighbors. Which I guess is fine, too...but I’d rather be the one already there and set up with a comfortable estate instead of being the ones having to do the complex social triangulation needed to calculate an acceptable distance from your nearest neighbors before awkwardly committing to a humble square of second-rate sand in what is probably actually too close for COVID-safe comfort, anyway.

This weekend, though? Who knows! This is the preseason and anything goes. Going to still be rather chilly until noon or so this time of year, but I reckon it will be the actual first beach weekend since last year so peeps may be out in droves? But get there by 11 and you’ll be fine. 

Also note that the entrances closest to the end of the paved road tend to get filled up faster (due to the more desirable shade/sun situation and not having to drive too far down a gravel road, I guess). If you’re looking to commune with the gays, go to the last entrance, walk all the way to the beach, and then hang a left and walk for a bit until you sense that gays are near.

Also, if you’re feeling a bit anxious, the earlier you get there the longer time you’ll have getting adjusted to the clothing-optional lifestyle with relatively few people around. 

Also! The alcohol ban I think doesn’t start until Memorial Day again this year? So that’s a preseason bonus. 

So, get naked!

"i appreciate your point of view, and thank you for your comments.

about location: some of it was personal bias (the song is “happy” and when i think of being happy, i think of collins). but a lot of it had to do with the location itself and the flexibility it affords in the editing process. that little “cove” between gates 3 and 4–close to the ufo was ideal for this video.

we went early, when there was almost no one there to begin shooting. as people arrived close to us to enjoy their beach day, we informed them outright what we were doing, and offered to let them review all the footage we shot while they were there. these are the people i’m thanking in the post.

anytime anyone walked thru a shot, filming was stopped, that take deleted, the camera lens clearly covered by me, and an explanation given to the individual on what we were doing. further, all video was taken facing the water, not the beach. 

generally speaking, i agree with you about people filming on the beach. which is why i was actively transparent with everyone we encountered, gained their consent, gave them the opportunity to view what was filmed, and respected their privacy.

"619 KQL - Silver Hyundai Accent

[Creaper-619KQL](https://ibb.co/mvXTwjw)


As a solo male who has experienced this same behavior both while I was there by myself and with a female friend. We had a solo guy follow us around the beach twice, two days in a row. The second day he followed us out of the beach, to the parking lot where he was parked a few cars away from ours. We got in our car immediately, and waited to see what he would do. He then proceeded to stare at us through three car windows away. Instead of getting in his car right away, he stood at his door looking directly at, i proceeded to stare back and lock eye contact with him multiple times. To which he tried to duck down lower then his car window so I couldn't see him. After he did this multiple times and realized I was actually still staring at him for a reason, he got in his car and proceeded to backup slowly.  I immediately started to backup until he could see us leaving the spot... But then I stopped because I knew he was waiting for us to leave first so he could follow us out. I shutoff the car and just sat there, letting four or five cars go before us. He didn't like leading the pack of cars out of Collins Beach. He turned into the first residential street he could, I noticed him making a random left, to which provided the perfect moment to get a picture of him and his license plate - 619 KQL - Silver Hyundai Accent. The man was wearing a blue collared t-shirt, pink shorts and a sun hat on this Wednesday evening.  We had been there all day, so taking mental notes of who's shadowing you all day isn't an issue. I believe we also saw him doing the same thing on Tuesday.

"Good luck with your first time.  The biggest first-time hurdle I had was dropping trow after setting up.  That awkwardness dissolved in about two seconds after that when I noticed that nobody cared.. at all.  Hammock guy was swinging, the older couple were lounging in their lawnchairs, that solo lady kept sunbathing, and that mom of two was casually keeping an eye on them.

People generally will feel more comfortable seeing other partially/completely nude people at the beach.  It gets iffy when you look around and see nothing but textiles. 

For what it's worth, this year I have noticed much more bleed from the non-optional side.  If they feel awkward looking at a bunch of saggy asses et al, that's more on them.

"Ugh. I (woman) quit going to Collins because of this. I was told by a sheriff that by the time they get there for calls about creeps, the ""Perps are are finished and gone"" by the time they get there.  

It's so frustrating. I have been tempted so many times to run up on them with my phone and record their asses to blast all over but I'm way to small to risk that. 

Now I go to Rooster Rock. It still has the occasional creep but it's nowhere near as bad at Collins has gotten the past few years. Rooster has the advantage of having the Ranger station there and in speaking with them, they are exceptionally eager to make sure it was a family friendly atmosphere, free from creeps. I was warned years ago that the sandbar is difficult to get to for them but if it's bad enough, they'll get there.

"I'm a little jaded, admittedly, but all single males at this point at Collins are creepers to me. It's a defense mechanism learned from experience.

The best you could do as a single male, is:

Scenario 1 - a lonely women and creepers nearby: ""Hi my name is addingmachinepdx, there are some creepers out here and if you feel unsafe, feel free to use me as an escape. We don't have to talk, I won't even look at you or speak with you unless you want to. If you just want to lie near me, that's perfectly fine. I will head back to where I was and leave you alone now. 

Scenario 2 - a lonely woman who is trapped by a creeper: Let her know through visual clues that you are available for a safe spot. I had a guy once just point to the sand next to him with a nod and that was enough for me to move over to him. Most women that are there alone are tough but sometimes it's just too much. 


I used to love Collins but the past few years it's become creeper central. I used to not mind the occasional ogler but they've turned creep up to 11 there. Single woman means, *please come sex me*. I used to enjoy grabbing a book and laying out in the sun for an hour or two when I could but even with a book, it got so bad that I couldn't even read without someone coming up to me.",t2_1ufc61o4,3IDontknow,0,1597258669.0,0,t1_g18ssbp,g18ssbp,False,Tasteecakes1980,t3_i7m7w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollinsBeach/comments/i7m7w8/best_approach/,Best Approach?,/r/CollinsBeach/comments/i7m7w8/best_approach/g18ssbp/,0,r/CollinsBeach,0,0

"This is why I, as a woman, rarely go to Collins anymore and never alone. 

Thank you for at least considering what was going on, I often wondered when I was being approached by creeps if anyone would help me. Very few did. 

In this situation, I always found it really nice when the woman of a couple would notice and just say, ""Hey, if you need anything or any creeps are giving you grief, feel free to look at us or join us and we'll help you out"". I did that on a few occasions and even made a friend or two out of it.

If you want to have sex at least go someplace where no one else can see you especially kids.

"As the OP, I feel super grateful for the community input on this matter. The majority response definitely resonated with my gut feeling on CB culture. Interestingly, it really ruffled some feathers! To the poster who has such a strong deplore of families with children at CB, it's you with the problem. Just because this sub is NSFW does not mean CB equates to a ""adult only place"", that's just plain silly. Unfortunately, nudism is still inherently NSFW because of our societies outlook on it, which you are perpetuating. Sure, people use this sub for non platonic activities just like anywhere else...movie theaters, malls, ect. Please stop hyper sexualizing nudism, this train of thought is why there is a long standing stigma against nudism and it really fucking sucks you're still carrying that through to a new decade. I'd like to touch on a few other notes you mentioned before your posts got removed(thankfully)
First, not all who remain clothed are gawking. Personally as a nudist, I've went through some huge body changes that I am still processing and haven't gone unclothed recently due to my own shit. My children however love being naked by water and deserve a place to do so. They would get chastised for being only in their skin at the clothed beach. We ALL deserve a place like Collins, not just the sexually charged who want to use it for that reason.
Secondly, it's not just families making the garbage on the beach...it's everyone! Our whole family lives by leave no trace and the take initiative clean-up. That's right guys, kids are cleaning Collins! 
I guess what I'm saying is stop the nudist bigotry, blanket statement's, sexualization, ageism, and littering (because fuck we all love those eagles!)",t2_4ksao530,achyachyeggsandbacy,0,1596272657.0,0,t1_fzyw0x8,fzyw0x8,True,[deleted],t3_hgotys,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollinsBeach/comments/hgotys/collins_beach_cultural_view_on_public/,Collins beach cultural view on public masturbation?

"I've been going to Collins for 6 years now and I find that weekends, especially on hot weather days, attracts a crowd that may be coming out for their first time or in large groups of friends and I've noticed that they often don't get naked. I prefer weekdays if I can get out there. Plenty of parking, more space on the beach (especially when the river is high and beach space is minimal) and not your loud, obnoxious weekend gawker type. Just the regulars. Collins is technically a clothing optional beach, not a nude beach, so you have the choice to take off your clothing or not. Semantics, I know. But I agree with you.
