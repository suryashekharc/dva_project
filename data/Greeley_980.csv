"UNC university is left leaning, but the county is definitely right leaning. The city is somewhere in between, but more right. There's an overall gradient of red to blue as you come from the plains to the mountains. Since Loveland, Fort Collins, Longmont, Boulder, and Denver are blue, but the Midwest is red, it makes for a bit of a clash. I feel like that clash happens right in Greeley. I think it makes both parties more radical and loud, which is annoying (edit: the loudest voices are the patriotic ones)

I'm somewhere in the middle personally (edit:center-left). There are plenty of things to do and business to support on either side. Close to the college, there's an amazing left leaning coffee shop that I enjoy. The next door over is a right leaning barbershop that I'd recommend. Politics are overrated.

"Man convicted of murder in 1991 Grand Junction pipe bombings seeks new trial through Innocence Project

By SHELLY BRADBURY | sbradbury@denverpost.com | The Denver Post PUBLISHED: January 24, 2022 at 12:04 p.m. | UPDATED: January 24, 2022 at 3:50 p.m.

‚ÄúNearly three decades after James Genrich was convicted of planting a series of pipe bombs in Grand Junction that killed two people and terrorized the community for months, the now-59-year-old returned to court Monday to argue that the guilty verdict was based on bogus evidence and should be overturned.

Attorneys for Genrich, who is serving life in prison for first-degree murder, argued in Mesa County District Court that the prosecution‚Äôs most critical piece of evidence in the case ‚Äî an expert‚Äôs opinion that tools Genrich owned made marks on the bombs ‚Äî was flawed, and that Genrich should be granted a new trial.

‚ÄúThat might have been enough to convict Mr. Genrich 30 years ago‚Ä¶ but it is not enough today,‚Äù said Tania Brief, an attorney with the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to exonerating wrongly convicted people.

During Genrich‚Äôs 1993 jury trial in Greeley, an expert for the prosecution matched tool marks on the bombs to three tools owned by Genrich, and told the jury that the marks on the bombs must have been made by Genrich‚Äôs tools. The expert said his analysis excluded the use of any other tools.

But a 2009 report by the National Academy of Sciences cast doubt on the expert‚Äôs methods, finding that the practice of tool-mark analysis was not scientifically validated and could lead to incorrect conclusions.

The tool marks were the only physical evidence tying Genrich to the crimes, and his conviction was controversial from the beginning. The case against him involved prosecutorial misconduct, tactics by law enforcement that a judge called ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù and a contempt-of-court charge for the prosecution‚Äôs tool-mark expert because he refused to turn over evidence to the defense despite court orders.

Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein said Monday he believes the tool-mark analysis that tied Genrich to the bombings was accurate.

‚ÄúI stand by the conviction, and I stand by the reliability of the tool-mark evidence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe experts that we have consulted with and intend to call at the hearing, we believe will support that this is reliable.‚Äù

The Colorado Court of Appeals in 2019 found that Genrich was entitled to a hearing to determine whether he should be given a new trial because of the potentially flawed tool-mark evidence. The hearing, which began Monday, is expected to last through Wednesday. District Court Judge Richard Gurley then has several weeks in which decide whether Genrich should be given a new trial.

Genrich has maintained his innocence since the 1991 attacks. Then 28, Genrich was living in downtown Grand Junction and working at the Two Rivers Convention Center when a bomb went off in the center‚Äôs parking garage on Feb. 14, 1991. A man was injured but no one was killed in that bombing.

In April 1991, a family got into their van in Grand Junction to go shopping and a bomb under a wheel well exploded, killing 12-year-old Maria Delores Gonzales. Just weeks later, in June, Henry Ruble, 43, and his wife were driving home from dinner in downtown Grand Junction when they spotted a strange object in the restaurant parking lot. Ruble picked it up and died when it exploded.

Investigators at the time faced immense public pressure to identify the bomber, and Genrich became a top suspect when he went to a bookstore after the three bombings and asked for a book that included instructions on bomb-making. Prosecutors relied heavily on circumstantial evidence to build the case, including notes Genrich wrote that were found in his apartment in which he expressed a desire to kill women and said he might harm ‚Äúinnocents.‚Äù

Genrich had been seen in some of the areas where the 1991 bombs detonated, and lived within walking distance of two sites. He‚Äôd studied electronics, and investigators found two fuses in his apartment that were the same type as those used in one of the bombs.

Investigators did not find any gunpowder, schematics or bomb-making tools in Genrich‚Äôs apartment. They did seize some of his tools, which the expert later matched to marks on an unexploded bomb that had been discovered in Grand Junction in 1989.

However, Genrich lived in Phoenix in 1989 and was at work in a bookstore there when the first bomb was placed in Grand Junction. (During the trial, prosecutors suggested he may have worked with an accomplice, but never named anyone.) Additionally, a white vehicle was seen at each of the 1991 bombings, and Genrich did not own or have access to a vehicle.

A witness also testified that he saw a ‚ÄúSpanish-looking man‚Äù handling one of the bombs; Genrich is white.

Genrich never admitted to the bombings, even when investigators followed him round-the-clock for months and his parents secretly wore a wire and tried to get him to confess.

In a 1993 interview with The Denver Post, Genrich said the homicidal notes he wrote were a practice he picked up in therapy ‚Äî to write down what he was feeling instead of going out and ‚Äúlosing his temper.‚Äù

Genrich quickly appealed the 1993 conviction. The Mesa County district attorney who prosecuted the case, Steve ErkenBrack, told The Post then that he had ‚Äúno doubt‚Äù about Genrich‚Äôs guilt. He declined to comment Sunday.

Months after Genrich‚Äôs conviction, The Post reported that enough doubt lingered in Grand Junction about his guilt that, even months after the verdict, some residents still checked their cars for bombs before leaving their driveways.‚Äù",t2_3snimuxh,SnackSize_,0,1643159923.0,0,t1_hu8f0du,hu8f0du,True,SnackSize_,t3_sctfnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greeley/comments/sctfnn/man_convicted_of_murder_in_1991_grand_junction/,Man convicted of murder in 1991 Grand Junction pipe bombings seeks new trial through Innocence Project,/r/Greeley/comments/sctfnn/man_convicted_of_murder_in_1991_grand_junction/hu8f0du/,1,r/Greeley,0,1

"I see your logic! The important thing to realize is that there is a vast difference in how big virus particles are versus how they travel.

Covid doesn't randomly travel in the air (unlike smoke particles). It travels out of your lungs and throat in the moisture from your breath. So while the virus is super duper tiny, the moisture particles are pretty big, because water particles like to clump together.

Because of this, masks are highly effective at stopping those water particles from exiting your body and splashing on the person you're talking to. Which is also why it's more about wearing a mask to protect others from yourself.

As far as biohazard disposal goes, it circles back to how it's traveling.

I think the city is changing but it's slow-going.

Aims is a great school with a great community and the Center of Diversity and Inclusion is a great place to hang out and do homework.

There are a number of apartment complexes and trailer parks on the east side of Hwy 85; I wouldn't live in any of them if I have any other options.

Years ago, the apartment complexes just south of Hwy 34 and west of 11th Ave (so across the street from the Sunrise Clinic) had a fair amount of students, also the apartments at the corner of 11th Ave and 32nd Street. Come to think of it, the apartments along 17th Ave have student populations (though I'd avoid the apartments across the street (to the south) of the Greeley Mall.

It is cheaper to live in Greeley than any other city in Northern Colorado. Lots of people in Greeley commute to other communities for work.

The closest LGBT friendly city is Fort Collins, which is a 30-40 min drive. I wouldn't recommend living in Greeley if you can help it.

"I believe one can find problems or happiness wherever they are. Greeley gets pooed on by other towns on the front range. As a rule of thumb the lower the income in a neighborhood the higher the crime. The area you are looking at can generally be considered a lower-middle-income neighborhood. At different times Greeley has been near the bottom of the list for income in 'large cities in Colorado, which is largely due to the lack of industry while agriculture continues to be a major employer.

A couple of things to consider regardless.

1. I agree with others' opinions about your choice of location. Mainly try to NOT to LIVE on 10th Street. >>>It is quite busy plus there can be a fair amount of just traffic noise<<< I twice I have lived near the intersection of 10th street and 14th avenue.
2. Greeley has a pretty good bus system and where you are looking is near bus stops and a short walk to the Lincoln Park transportation hub.
3. You will be just a short walk from Downtown, the Union Colony Civic Center, and the Greeley Rec Center.

"I would argue that your ego is just as big or larger than mine if you can pull clearly thinking highly of yourself out of literally saying that I have a low self esteem. I don't think highly of myself, I compensate for a low self esteem by learning facts. If other people do not know as much as I do and can't come up with a reasonable argument to what I say, that's not my fault!!! That doesn't mean I have a huge ego! It just means that I learned something and someone else didn't!  There's billions of things other people know that I don't, so I don't see how that makes me have a large ego. 

It's easy to put people who think they know everything, and have it all figured out, down. My perspective is that I know almost nothing. We, collectively as a species, know almost nothing. For every one thing we know about our bodies, the world, space, other animals, plants, there's are multiple billions of things we don't know. This is how I live my life, under the full knowledge that I don't, can't, and won't truly ever KNOW anything beyond physical knowledge of the limits of ourselves because there is no reliable information to actually learn. Old facts are proven wrong with new information all the time. And if you don't update your beliefs based on the information you have, then you aren't learning anymore. It's easy for me to put down the people who think they have it all figured out. It's easy for me to put down the people who oversimplify so much they think they can describe me in a sentence. I have absolutely nothing but respect for anyone who holds the similar belief that we don't really know anything, only what we're allowed to know, because then, and only then, is when you can start to open your mind to new possibilities.

My ego is large, I will admit that, just like everybody's. Definitely not the largest ego on this thread so far though. I think you are confusing confidence and self worth with ego. I'm confident enough to speak on my beliefs because I know what I'm worth and I know exactly why I believe what I believe. I can articulate my beliefs to amyone with reasons, hypothesis, and experiences. If other people can't, it's not my fault just like what I said before.

"Not at all! I feel like an average guy, nothing special about me at all. I guess I have just made a few better choices than most people my age? Not sure. Saved money instead of getting hooked on drugs? Got a job and bought a house instead of trying to sleep with 100 people? That seems pretty harsh, but the things we've heard come out of some people's mouths are fucking crazy, and lots of the reasons why we have no friends.

I didn't want to claw and struggle financially and mentally through my 20s, why does that make me a bad guy? It doesn't.

"That's actually funny that you're projecting in every comment on this thread so far. 

I'm plenty bitter towards unintelligent, closed minded morons like you who think your own shit doesn't smell. Plenty angry too, at a broken society, and people like you who continue to make our problems of constant mental illness worse and worse. 

But never hateful, all I do is pity people like you. You literally aren't smart enough to think for yourself so you adopted someone else's set of views completely and fully. You don't have a single one of your own opinions as far as I can tell, just a bunch of bullshit society has crammed down your throat because you aren't smart enough to think for yourself. I feel terrible that most of the population; people like you; are being used as puppets because you are SO REDICULOUSLY easy to control. I just feel bad for you. You're a brainwashed puppet and you'll probably never see it. 

And lastly, lonely, no! I have the most wonderful, compassionate, loving, intellectually stimulating person that I have ever met to share every moment of free time with. We have more stimulating conversations when we are half asleep than you've probably ever had with anyone. Never lonely on my own. We feel lonely together being in a world full of idiots like you. It's sad to see. 

And yes, it's SUPER embarrassing that people like you are so obviously wrong, obviously hypocritical, obviously operating COMPLETELY based on your manipulated emotions, and COMPLETELY ignoring fact, logic, rationality, and possibility. I think your entire social movement should be extremely shameful for that, because you people have caused the highest rates of mental illness in human history with your lies and manipulation. 

Did you know that psychopath is not a medical term? It's again, a term that uneducated people like you throw around to try to manipulate and tear people down. The correct term is ""antisocial personality disorder"" More bullshit, more hypocrisy, what else you got?

"It's pretty easy to see through a fake personality that was directly copied from the modern day fake feminist movement. I don't have patience for people who are so unintelligent that they can't think for themselves. By the way I was not the first one to make any assumptions. They were. I posted for my wife and I looking for friends, and this bitter person decided they wanted to be shitty and make assumptions about me. 

I only told them the truth that men and women can both do horrible things, and ANYONE who doesn't believe that's true is a complete and full moron. Assuming they are dumb enough to believe that ""women can't do harm"" because of their comment on my last post about us ""not being friends to women,"" simply because I am confident enough to be honest when almost all women seem to lie about their intentions in almost every situation in society, I took a hostile stance with this person because they were unnecessarily talking shit on a post of two people who were looking to make real, compassionate friends. 

So yes, it is very easy to assume that the person who I made the assumption towards is very bitter, angry, lonely, hateful, brainwashed, controlling, manipulative, and not anyone who I would ever want to surround myself or my wife with. And that holds true for anyone with that belief, I'm assuming you too since it was so easy for you to be toxic when I just said ""all people can be horrible."" If you can find a way to twist that into me being toxic, then I bet you anything I could describe your entire personality to a T out of the ""fake feminist handbook of 2021"" just as easilyüòÅ

If you're not very stupid, it's easy to read people like a book, everyone's ego is so overinflated that everyone puts everything on display but they still only pay attention to themselves.

"Fair enough, that's been the usual attitude that I've seen around here too from my few coworkers and people I've heard talking in stores and stuff. I don't really pay attention to politics, whenever I do I just get mad that I can't help people the way I want to. So I just stay out of the whole thing, better for my mental health in so many ways. 

Oh that's really cool, you got there a little before the big population and price boom too! Greeley was the only place we could afford to buy at the time, other than commerce cityüò¨ and who needs to get their car stolen every week? So Greeley was the clear choice haha. It's a nice city, about the same as Loveland where I've spent most of my time. Just a much different attitude than any other city around here. But I think the attitude is slowly improving, they're really trying to make it a cleaner more fun city with less crime and violence. Just slow progress because it's been so cheap for so long that a lot of really shitty criminals own houses and that's really tough to do anything about once they already own the land. 

But nevertheless we go for walks around town all the time, it's really beautiful all year, there's not very many people out and about these days, old town is usually dead empty all through the weekend. We have tried going out and meeting some people that way but there aren't many out, and we're not too into social drinking really, so hence this post.

"1.) As having never been to Greeley (or Colorado), how is the general life there? Is it about similar to that as Hays?
It's like 5 times the size, in terms of population. There are also lots of Latino people here, which I'm guessing isn't the case there (but I could be wrong, I don't know much about Hays). You will have a hard time getting by without a car, although the city isn't all that big. It's also a little different (I'm guessing) because you're relatively close to Denver, Boulder, and Fort Collins, so bigger cities are nearby. I think the biggest change for you will be the price of rent. It's gonna be a shocker. People expect it to be cheaper here than it is, so just remember a lot of people choose to live here because it's a lot more affordable than Boulder, Fort Collins and the like, but that does drive up the price compared to other cities like Greeley that are more isolated.

2.) What is the general culture like at the University of Northern Colorado? Is it generally very welcoming?
I think you'll be just fine. It's a nice blend between a larger university and a smaller one. Some of your huge lecture hall classes will be there, your Psych 100 or whatever, but by your final two years you'll be in much smaller classes. I found it very welcoming. It's also not overly into sports bullshit where the football team or whatever are like gods among students, so that's a nice change from other spots. 

3.) How are the medical/mental health services in Greeley? What about at UNC?
We have two very large hospitals in town. One about 3 minutes from UNC. I can't speak to the on-campus medical care, but I can't imagine it's needed a whole lot just because the major hospital is so close. The other hospital is further west, but it's just a couple years old and is excellent as well. 

4.) How interconnected and deeply woven is the UNC community on-campus?
Barely at all. The university and the city are like two islands for the most part, and I say this as a lifelong resident AND UNC grad. I don't think the university has much interest in connecting with the city. A lot of staff and faculty don't live in town (and even when they do, I sort of get it, who wants to have their workplace be their entire life?). It'd be nicer if things were tighter, but I don't see it causing major problems. More of just missed opportunities. I'd love to see more classes available at reduced rates for residents, better library access (you can't park anywhere near the library currently), and maybe more events that are open to the general population. I think the city could certainly do more to this effect as well. But I wouldn't say there's an antagonistic relationship between the city and the university other than perhaps the city generally being more conservative than the overall university student body (although I think this is true in most places). But there aren't clashes in the streets or anything. 

5.) What types of non-partisan, community-based civic engagement opportunities does Greeley have?
There are several boards and things like that you could sit on. The library has frequent openings on their board and foundation board. There is some volunteering opportunity here and there, but not a lot. 

6.) How accessible is Greeley? Either through just driving from different parts of the city or even to public transportation.
Public transpo is not great, and the roads are getting quite crowded at busy times. It's not horrible, just a little annoying. There IS a bus that runs from Greeley to Fort Collins now, which is pretty cool. I'm not mega optimistic about this changing anytime soon, and if you can avoid the intersection of HWY 34 and 35th ave, or really HWY 34 and anything, I'd recommend it. 

7.) This is the selling moment -- out of any city in Colorado, what makes Greeley the most desired? What about it makes it an obvious choice as the one city to settle down in after university?
For me, it's price and crowdedness. Honestly, the Greeley I knew is starting to slip away, but I still think it's a quality spot for WAY less than you pay to live in Denver, Fort Collins, and I would include Boulder but that doesn't seem realistic unless you're making mid 6 figures. I like living among different people with different backgrounds and views, and people here are a real mix of blue collar, conservative, liberal, different cultural backgrounds, all that stuff. As everywhere else gets more expensive, this is less and less true in the cities. I guess I think of Greeley as a mix. It's not like a major city, but it's also not the place to live on a parcel of land off a dirt road.

"They never even pulled into the main range area though, which had plenty of open stalls. Just crept by slowly to watch... I understand wanting to shoot alone, but after shooting I decided to do the bird watching trail. That whole part seems to be no shooting allowed from what I can tell. And this guy turned around deliberately to follow me. I'd seen him parked on my way in and didn't think much of it til I passed him on my way out and he turned around to follow me. Each time I stopped at a pull-out spot, he stopped several hundred yards behind me in the middle of the road and just sat there until I started moving again. Each time I stopped (4-5 different places) he would get closer and still just sat there. By the time I reached the main entry pull-out he was just at the edge of the parking lot, so maybe 30 yards away at max. I made it obvious I was getting my gun out and he still didn't leave from that... The fact he peeled out and fled when the cop pointed at him tells me he was planning something negative.  If a cop points at me, you bet your ass I am not gonna run away and make myself look guilty. I'd love to believe this was some big misunderstanding,  but every fiber of my body was screaming that something wasn't right.  Very thankful for whoever did call the cops about this person (I didn't actually call them, cop just happened to pull in which also seemed unusual to me.) 

If it was a big misunderstanding,  I hope they can explain to the police why the decided to peel out and flee rather than answer some questions to clear things up.

Glad this isn't a normal occurrence out there.

"I'll agree that Fort Collins and Boulder can be a bit snobby (that's frankly Colorado in general, wait until you see Steamboat Springs or Aspen), but I feel like people in both cities are alot warmer than Greeley in general. It's not a bad city, just not interesting by any means.

Greeley is more affordable than other places in Northern Colorado, and it's best feature is that it is an hour from north Denver, 40 min from downtown Fort Collins and Boulder (houses are like 200k+ cheaper in Greeley, so it's not a bad place to buy into the market).

I'm not sure what you are looking for in terms of nightlife, because there really isn't a night life in Greeley, it really is a tired old town. Half of the businesses in downtown are vacant, and have been for years. It is the sleepiest college town I've ever lived in.

You will need a car in Greeley as it's not very bike friendly (we are used to biking around alot and make it work, it certainly is doable, but can get sketchy depending on where you live).

Greeley really isn't a bad town, it's an affordable area to break into the housing market, there are alot of jobs within an hour drive, the area is alot more diverse than Fort Collins and Boulder combined.... But in terms of going to college and get that whole experience, I wouldn't call Greeley a fun or interesting city.",t2_5yhpeum3,Con5ume,0,1633444232.0,0,t1_hfhe7ij,hfhe7ij,True,RepulsiveYogurt,t3_q1m1f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greeley/comments/q1m1f9/questions_about_greeley_and_unc/,Questions about Greeley and UNC,/r/Greeley/comments/q1m1f9/questions_about_greeley_and_unc/hfhe7ij/,2,r/Greeley,0,2
"1.) As having never been to Greeley (or Colorado), how is the general life there? Is it about similar to that as Hays? 

*I don't know much about Hays, but I grew up in rural Nebraska, so  . . .* 

*Greeley overall is conservative, but around the university and downtown you can find about any politics you'd like. Decent restaurants, fair entertainment, ok shopping. Not Boulder or Berkeley, but not the pumpkin patch either.*

  
2.) What is the general culture like at the University of Northern Colorado? Is it generally very welcoming?

*Surprisingly diverse and quite welcoming. UNC actively recruits minorities and students from the rural plains. They have a number of programs to shepherd students along, and there are tons of extracurricular interest groups.*   
  
3.) How are the medical/mental health services in Greeley? What about at UNC?

*Two hospitals, both quite good. Lots of doctors and specialists. UNC health services are fine.*  
  
4.) How interconnected and deeply woven is the UNC community on-campus?

*Marginal. There is some town and gown crossover, but much of the populace barely acknowledges UNC. And vice versa. Lots of faculty commute into work from Ft. Collins.*  
  
5.) What types of non-partisan, community-based civic engagement opportunities does Greeley have?

*Typical volunteer organizations. I'm not really knowledgeable with this. Google?*  
  
6.) How accessible is Greeley? Either through just driving from different parts of the city or even to public transportation.

*Driving is fine, bus services is so-so. Parking at UNC could involve walking a few blocks depending on the day. But winters here are easier than in Kansas. Snow comes, but it generally warms up and melts away in a few days.*

  
7.) This is the selling moment -- out of any city in Colorado, what makes Greeley the most desired? What about it makes it an obvious choice as the one city to settle down in after university?

*Growing pretty fast, job market is strong. Diverse economy: Insurance, oil, agriculture, food production are all big. There is also some tech, but not the big names. Techs here are niche and tend to supply to other companies. Housing prices are a bit high but much better than other front range cities. Increasingly diverse population: Hispanic, Somali, Burmese . . . It's politically red but not outrageous. Pretty tolerant overall. Easy access to Denver, Ft. Collins, Boulder, mountains, skiing, hiking, etc. We've been here for decades and haven't found any reason to leave!*",t2_o02bj,bureaucrat47,0,1633410297.0,0,t1_hfg2pf5,hfg2pf5,True,RepulsiveYogurt,t3_q1m1f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greeley/comments/q1m1f9/questions_about_greeley_and_unc/,Questions about Greeley and UNC,/r/Greeley/comments/q1m1f9/questions_about_greeley_and_unc/hfg2pf5/,10,r/Greeley,0,10

"I should take a moment to clarify for the mountains:  You should have at least snow tires and chains, OR some form of AWD or 4WD (and proper tires, still) for snowy mountain driving.  The difference being that out here in Greeley, it's mostly flat so traction usually isn't going to be an issue.

But when you're in the mountains, you're going to be on an incline.  Chains + snow tires, or AWD/4WD will get you the traction you need to stop better or gain momentum to get going up there.  Still, slower going = getting home in one piece.  

Since you're from the south, you're not going to be used to the conditions so my advice would be to try driving in the snow around your neighborhood first to get a feel for how much differently your car behaves when it can only get about 20-30% of the traction you're used to.  Once you feel that, then think about a 3-400% difficulty rating increase driving in the mountains.

I've been driving on Continental DWS06 tires for the last five sets of tires, and my VW GTI gets around just fine in the snow.  The weather around here in Greeley doesn't really warrant winter tires as the snow on the roads usually melts fairly quickly.


Now, if you plan on taking frequent trips to the mountains, a separate set of winter tires is recommended, and you should probably carry chains.  AWD is not really needed, but is a plus when you're driving up there.

The Terry Ranch deal will allow a large water demand to be created without a permanent supply.  Recharge of the aquifer will not be possible. Most knowledgeable water folks know that to recharge Terry Ranch sand with water will require a surface supply to be developed.  As municipal demand increases over time, there will not be an opportunity to develop a surface supply for recharge.  This kind of water planning mistake will no doubt push us closer to draconian measures such as the Public Trust Initiative which will spell doom for agriculture in this region and our excellent water rights doctrine of prior appropriation.

"The amendments requiring special elections are not in the best interest of City of Greeley citizens.

&#x200B;

As cities grow, it makes sense for them to convert the water from the agricultural land that they grow over into a supply for the city.  It‚Äôs hard enough to do that without having to hold a special election every time the opportunity arises.  That was made clear just this year when the City of Aurora bought Whitney Ditch shares out from under the Town of Windsor.  The Whitney Ditch flows through Windsor.  If Greeley had to hold an election, using taxpayer money no less, every time they have the opportunity to buy or lease water, they would simply get outcompeted for water that will ultimately be bought up by metro area and south metro area entities.  That‚Äôs not to the benefit of anyone in Northern Colorado and definitely not in the best interest of City of Greeley citizens.

&#x200B;

John Gauthiere may have 50 years of experience in the water industry, but the City of Greeley didn‚Äôt do any projects even close to as big as the Milton Seaman reservoir expansion in the time he was in Greeley from 1979-2001.  In fact, the city hasn‚Äôt constructed any reservoirs of that size since Milton Seaman was originally built in the 40‚Äôs.  Gauthiere is quoted in the article saying ‚ÄòYou have to be a bit of a bulldog‚Äô when referring pushing projects through the environmental permitting process.  That used to be the prevailing attitude in the water world decades ago, but it‚Äôs out of touch with where we are at today.

&#x200B;

In this day and age, a project as large as the Milton Seaman expansion can take decades and cost tens of millions of dollars just to get the federal permit.  Part of that process is evaluating alternatives and the determination of the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA).  In cases where the proposed project is likely to be the LEDPA, it can be worth it to go through the permitting process and build the project.  In the case of the Milton Seaman expansion, it seems likely that the Terry Ranch project would be determined to be the LEDPA and the City of Greeley wouldn‚Äôt get a permit to expand Milton Seaman.  So, at this time, it‚Äôs a waste of taxpayer money to continue to pursue Milton Seaman expansion permitting.  If those circumstances were to change in the future (seems unlikely at this point), the City could always take a look at the project again.",t2_csxxbji0,infiniteelev,0,1629900238.0,0,t1_haal18m,haal18m,True,waterguru02,t3_pazhgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greeley/comments/pazhgw/the_nocooptimist_article_on_terry_ranch/,The NoCoOptimist Article on Terry Ranch,/r/Greeley/comments/pazhgw/the_nocooptimist_article_on_terry_ranch/haal18m/,6,r/Greeley,0,6
