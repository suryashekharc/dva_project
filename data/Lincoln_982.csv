"As a conservation photographer, I’ve learned rare things don’t often get a second chance. From virgin prairies to old-growth forests and all the species in between, it takes just one wrong move to erase things forever. This is what drives extinctions and how the world loses its heritage.

Today we stand on a similar precipice here in Lincoln, where an object of great beauty awaits her fate.

Oh, she’s been easy enough to overlook these last few years, tucked away on a block that’s so lightly traveled. But as you round the corner onto 15th Street, the Pershing Mural takes your breath away.

At first glance and from afar, ""Lincoln’s Picasso"" looks like an abstract painting. Get closer though and you can see it’s not an abstraction at all but rather a detailed depiction of what we humans were up to in the late 1950s. Clearly this is from another time, but it’s no ordinary historic artifact.

She’s grand: With some 763,000 tiles displayed 140 by 38 feet, we see the great events held inside Pershing Auditorium. Literally millions of memories were created under this community icon.

She’s towered above thousands of high school graduates, conventions, circuses, state tournaments, rodeos and entertainers. Johnny Carson stood under her at the very beginning, and Louis Armstrong played for her when she was young. Elvis and Bob Dylan came along in midlife, while Snoop Dogg and Ke$ha sang to her towards the end.

She’s irreplaceable: At one time she was the largest mosaic tile mural in the Western Hemisphere. People just don’t do massive tile murals anymore, especially set vertically. They’re expensive and require more time and care than our hurried world now allows.

She’s valuable: Money matters, of course, but she’ll pay us back and then some if we choose to save her. The value of having something this grand, relocated to another venue, would be well worth the price. Perhaps at the Lancaster County Event Center, she’d be reinstalled lower, at eye level, serving as a backdrop for countless outdoor gatherings. Imagine a million selfies sent out to the web, each one showcasing the history of Lincoln, for all the world to see.

But time is running out. Now that the auditorium is being readied for demolition this summer, we’ll have one last chance to save the largest public artwork this city will ever know.

A valiant effort is underway now, headed by Lincoln’s Art Doyenne, Liz Shea-McCoy. Her vision, along with many others, is to see this mural’s tiles removed, one at a time, and reassembled at her new home.

But we all better hurry.

The price tag is $3 million, and the deadline is May 1.

The good news is that we humans can do anything we like with this work of art. Private donations are needed right this minute, but it would make sense for some city and county money to be added as well. Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird and the Lincoln City Council could grant funding and extra time, but only if enough of us care and then speak up immediately.

In the end this is a test of all of us. Do we not only rise to meet challenges, but run to them? Or are we apathetic, satisfied to sit still in a dark room, roam the internet and watch others do big things?

To save Lincoln’s Picasso, or not? That is the $3 million question. Better hurry though. Lincoln’s grandest of artworks awaits your decision, just a step away from extinction.

“Siren Testing for 2022 - Updated 2/8/2022

The first Routine Monthly Siren Test for the 2022 season will be at 11:00 AM on Wednesday, March 2, 2022. The monthly tests consist of a single sounding. Routine monthly testing of the Outdoor Warning Siren System will also take place at 11:00 AM on April 6, May 4, June 1, July 6, August 3, September 7, and October 5, 2022.

There will also be a system-wide Special Siren Test on March 23, 2022, at approximately 10:00 AM as part of the National Weather Service Severe Weather Awareness Week.  This special test will consist of a single sounding.  The actual time of the sounding will be formally announced by the National Weather Service.

Testing of sirens is on a weather-permitting basis and will not be performed if threatening weather exists.

It should be understood that beginning in February of each year, individual sirens may also be sounded throughout the year as part of general maintenance activities.

Plus, 100 of what you pay every month for the first couple years goes into a fund that you can through against your mortgage costs. It doesn't appreciate interest, but still, nice to have.

We bought our house near Lincoln SE HS from them last year. We had rented for 5 yrs- 1 3 yr rent to own lease, we didnt buy due to issues (ours), we re-did the lease to own contract with a new amount (basically what taxes went up), and were able to get a loan two yrs later. Our house was built in 1961, full cement basement and first floor and joists, finished basement doubles the sq footage. 4 bdrm, 2 bath. Because of the contract when you make your payment (with your loan) you are paying the price in the lease from when you signed it. SO, we paid 184,000 at 2.75% because the price was already in the lease from 2 yrs before. The interest rate will be at whatever is current- we managed to just slip in before they started going nuts, and we have a VA loan.  400,000 dollar duplexes are going in on South street a few blocks away- when we closed we ended up with something like 10,000 in equity because of the current house prices, and its gone up  some almost every month since. 

United Equity's website looks pretty simple- and it is- but they are great to deal with. Even though we were buying they paid for 2 major issues that occurred while we were renting to own (a split cast iron pipe behind a kitchen sink, and a garbage disposal that died). Most other repairs other than major major are on you, BUT if you want to paint something, change carpet, whatever- you are renting to own, so if you run it by them they are usually okay with it.

We had a really good experience with them, and working with them to buy the house or get things fixed was as simple as an email or two or a phone call.",t2_51le1,alathea_squared,0,1648048686.0,0,t1_i1sz3as,i1sz3as,False,JamesKPolk-on,t3_tkgquk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lincoln/comments/tkgquk/i_bought_a_house/,I bought a house!,/r/lincoln/comments/tkgquk/i_bought_a_house/i1sz3as/,3,r/lincoln,0,3

">But I do want to present the facts without any fear mongering.

I think you did a fine job, and that's coming from someone who supports a reasonable permitting process, and nominal fees and taxes to purchase handguns.

I do believe my liberal friends need to come to terms with our unique culture in the US when it comes to guns, but I also believe my conservative friends need to come to terms that reasonable regulations are necessary, especially in urban environments.

"Agreed! Her stance on mental health as a priority, focusing on policing *employers* instead of targeting and deporting undocumented immigrants like Pillen wants to do, and especially legalizing pot - Those all sound like extremely rational, moderate positions that could greatly improve Quality of Life for the average Nebraskan. I don't love that she's pro-life, but I also get the impression she won't be an extremist about it - and to win as a R in Nebraska you *have* to be pro-life, I'm no dummy. 

Her academic background gives me the impression she actually has some capacity to distinguish political priorities from one's personal religious convictions.

"A number of large corporations are buying houses in the thousands to either flip or hold and resell at a higher price. Write your representative about this will help.

Unfortunately it's also some boomers who have bought to rent out, the huge wave of millenials who have accumulated enough wealth to be looking for their first home and will only build. 

The new houses that are being built are 200k+ outside of starter range for this area which doesn't help. Also even if builders were trying to reach a lower price target the lack of labor and the increasing costs of materials makes this is impossible. Just 2-3 years prior the housing market was very different, it's just the perfect storm of conditions to make it a total seller's market.

Perhaps further subsidies for first time home buyers/ older homes would help as well. Or higher taxes for those who own over x amount of real estate. Or a combination of both.

It seems like people are looking at home values being a better holder of wealth than other investments, I shouldn't need to explain how badly that can go.

"Why would you not want to make the move?

&#x200B;

I like both cities, although I live in and prefer Omaha. 

&#x200B;

Commuting Lincoln to Omaha though:

You are commuting with traffic.

You will be driving into the sun both ways most of the year.

Even when gas prices are low, that's a lot of money to throw away on gas.

Additional wear on vehicles should be a consideration. I mean, it probably gets your annual mileage to 15k - 20k /year.

Don't forget the planet, it isn't exactly good for it.

&#x200B;

There are reasons to do it of course, like a SO you would still be making the drive for, for some time. Or forever if they work in Lincoln.

&#x200B;

$950 - $1k for a one bed gives you a ton of options in Omaha, even in some of the best areas like Blackstone, Midtown, not so much downtown to my knoweledge.

&#x200B;

I also feel that once you take a job in Omaha, you probably will be working in Omaha for a long time, as even the next company would likely be in Omaha.

&#x200B;

"I grew up in Lincoln, moved away. I lived in SoCal, Colorado, Las Vegas and moved back after 15 years. The pandemic has made everything a little up in the air. Lincoln has made some efforts to feel more modern/urban and I think downtown Lincoln does feel more that way than before. It still suffers from downtown flight. Most of the money is on the periphery and people tend to shop close to home so the nicer stores are not downtown. They've built a lot of condos and apartments downtown but there's no grocery store, etc. That makes different part of town feel a little disconnected from each other. North Lincoln has a working class feel and South Lincoln has a country club feel.  People are typically friendly but not warm.  It's a slight majority blue island in a red state. They love college and high school sports. Unlike big cities service jobs are held by young people, not adults.

"Kind of grew up with Jake,  the “frontman” of the band. We had drifted apart somewhat when the band got going and became his obsession, but we were friends and fellow troublemakers for years. I credit him with introducing me to lots of great underground music, and we discovered a lot together as it was our hobby to dig up new and/or obscure art rock, noise, punk, industrial, postpunk, experimental stuff. 

I didn’t hear much about him as we’d both moved away, but I heard he died in LA of an overdose sometime in the early 2000’s, not sure on the year. Edit , early 90’s, is when he passed, I didn’t hear until later 90’s, was confusing the dates with others who have passed…

I can’t offer that much insight on the band itself, as I say, it’s about that time we had moved onto different circles. I do recall when Steve died, but I don’t know how long they continued after that. Rumor was, he was still going with it out in LA.

Definitely a weird and obscure band! Pagan punk death metal? Anyway I second the suggestion to check out Capitol Punishment ‘zine, and the Brickyard Facebook group, been a while, but last I looked there was a wealth of great old photos.
I assume you’ve done the google thing, so you probably saw this already but:

"So after reading through the other comments - first, I feel your pain. We recently purchased a house in Lincoln (moved in from out of state) and we had similar concerns. We were even buying with only being able to tour via FaceTime/zoom.

Our experience wasn't as bad, partly because the market was a little better last fall and because our real estate agent and mortgage broker where \*amazing\*. 

We knew would could be approved for much higher than we could comfortably afford (almost everyone can be). In talking with our broker, they asked what we wanted to pay and they said okay and did all the paperwork at that amount, not a penny higher.

Our agent was also amazing and was very helpful in finding within our price range. If you agent is showing you things that push your budget, I'd jump ship.

I'd recommend the people we worked with to anyone. If you want their info I'd be happy to share it.

I am sorry it is a sucky process. You (and others are totally right) that inspections shouldn't be able to be waived, ever. I hope you find a home you are excited about that is just right like we did.

"The fact that waving inspection is something *sellers* can effectively demand in this market is so screwed up.

I don't mind the crazy bidding wars on prices because that's how markets are intended to work, but waving inspection shouldn't be part of that market dynamic.

Inspections are buyer protection and when sellers have authority over them the incentives are aligned for corruption.

This is one of those things I never thought would be an issue, but sellers really shouldn't be allowed to demand inspection waiver. Inspection shouldn't be part of the offer at all. Inspection should be assumed to always happen. Sellers shouldn't even know if the inspection will be waived until accepting an offer, and if they're caught attempting to influence inspection waiver that should be punishable.",t2_3ep8i,spoonraker,0,1647618529.0,0,t1_i15zoam,i15zoam,False,b_nut_z,t3_tgrgoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/lincoln/comments/tgrgoc/housing_apocalypse/,Housing Apocalypse,/r/lincoln/comments/tgrgoc/housing_apocalypse/i15zoam/,7,r/lincoln,0,7

"Hi, I’m trans and I’ve been living in Lincoln since 2003. I can’t speak to the binary experience but, I came out in high school back in 2013 and my friends and found family were so incredibly chill about it. Of course there’s a very conservative element in this state, but I work at a queer owned and operated salon now and I think this town is my long term home. We only have 1 gay bar now, but there’s a lesbian owned bookstore around the corner from work, a board game cafe that’s is an unapologetic safe space, bars and gallery’s and so many little communities within our larger queer community if you know where to look. 
But I’m going to be honest with you. No matter how “safe” a place is, or how loudly some places say that we are welcome, the *world* is still not safe for trans people. 
You can never truly know, that is what it is to walk through life as a marginalized person. 
Having a supportive family is so much more than a lot of us had growing up here, I didn’t until very recently, but times are changing and the queer community here would be happy to welcome you and your family. 
The facts are that hate exists in cities like Portland and New York and LA too, but I love my gay little island in this red ass state and I refuse to leave until things are better for the kids in my chair every week.

"Not sure how old your son is, but I do know that there's at least one trans teacher in the district. I think most high schools have a GSA or equivalent club. OutNebraska is a fantastic resource if you want to reach out for more information about specific schools. LPS also recently hired (or at least is searching for) a full-time LGBTQ advocate for their administrative staff.

Speaking as a trans man myself, I can say that if your son is/intends to medically transition, there are plenty of affirming and respectful doctors, therapists, etc. in town. We also have one of the best top surgeons in the country in Omaha. Not sure how applicable that is to your son's needs, but I figured I'd mention it!

The politics of Nebraska as a whole can be very disheartening. However, my general impression of Lincoln is that people are by and large either affirming, or have a ""live and let live"" mentality.

Lincoln as a whole has been an incredibly friendly, relaxed, accepting place for the 6 years I've lived here.
