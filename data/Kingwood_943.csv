"Some good cultural places, or non-traditional American food:

Vn Wich for banh mi sandwiches (grilled shrimp one is damn good), also get their Vietnamese iced coffee. 

My favorite Chinese restaurant in Kingwood is Hin's Garden. No one makes sesame chicken like them. Also home to damn good Vietnamese eggrolls and Singapore noodles. 

Tex Mex is spotty in kingwood. Used to love El Charro but since it changed to Hacienda Palomas, it's gone downhill. An El Tiempo recently opened up on Northpark though I haven't tried it yet.

For cajun, you may want to try The Catch in Atascocita. A BBs Cafe also opened up off Northpark.

"I've been living around here for the last ten years. Here is my advice:

Avoid the Deerbrook Mall area (1960 and Hwy 59).  Theft is rampant.  The west side of Highway 59 isn't great in general.  Neither is ""downtown"" Humble.  Usually you have to get some distance from the freeway before things get better.  

Kingwood and Atascocita can be nice (closer to West Lake Houston parkway).  Summerwood is nice (West Lake Houston and Beltway 8).  You're looking at about a 20-30 minute commute to IAH from most of these places.

I don't really party or drink either so living here is a blessing. Tachus is coming to Kingwood which I'm looking forward to because Suddenlink is about as bad as everyone says it is. I love the scenery, I love all the trees, seeing the lake, etc. 

I think the only thing I don't enjoy are the bugs. I had a tree roach jump out at me when I went to check my mail.

Mine does mowing, edging, trimming and bags up the leaves and trimmings and leaves them at the curb for the garbage. $25 a week. They're in and out in about 15 minutes.

Some pros though-

Churches here imo I feel are more of a social gathering, so if you do happen to get into the dating scene maybe a nice gal can be found there. 

Tons of family friendly events in town center & at the harbor. They update their social media accounts frequently so be on the lookout. There's even FB pages per village too. 

Farmers market every week in town center & I think the mall parking lot in humble started again too.

Parks in town- based on your response I think you'll really enjoy Rivergrove & East End Park. Don't stick to the trails and it's more of an adventure. Still safe though! There's more to Rivergrove than you think if you start wandering around you can actually get to the other side of the river . 
And FFA has its animals in the mini Park before Rivergrove, it's nice to just sit with the horses there sometimes . Tons of turtles at that mini Park too at the back of the pond.

"Thank you for taking the time to list all of this out. 

I have a buddy that lives in Porter and he says it is trailer park ghetto. 

I do drive a full size truck so that usually helps me out all of the time. I still don't go through water that seems ridiculous though. 

I like that HOA's are serious. I don't mind paying if it is being enforced. 

Nice to know about the toll way. I was looking at my drive to work and it consistently says 20 minutes or so without tolls. 

Not particularly after older woman but nice to know I guess. Not really an active dating person so that's not a big deal to me at all. 

I graduated in 2012 myself so we really are close in age.

"The ghetto-est it gets is the back roads that connect kingwood & Porter . 

Be mindful about the flooding, streets get flooded pretty easily throughout town. If you have a higher vehicle then you should be good for the most part. We're in NWH village and neighbors often have a hard time getting out after a half a day of heavy rain .


Cell reception gets dropped on kingwood dr for a bit but that's near khs area.

4thb of July & new Year's = fireworks sleepless nights

Take the HOA rules seriously, they aren't kidding around about that grass 

59 traffic a bit better than 45 but traffic is traffic either way. HOV/TOLL option you get on & off at Townsend near Target


Not a really popular dating scene for ppl our age. Most are already settled or in HS or 55+ unless you're into that ? Botox goes long way around.

Tree nuts always falling on rooftops. Birds chirp you awake at sunrise . Squirrels can be pretty cruel . Oh and those frogs at night  are croaking on purpose.


Left after HS back in '12 but came back a few years ago, lots has changed many more establishments . A lot more people too.

"Kingwood flooded very badly during Harvey, from what I understand, it was from the dams on Lake Conroe being opened. 

I live in Atascocita, but I can say, unequivocally, that since Harvey, the water is different. Our street never flooded before, but it does now. Last week, during those storms, my street had water on it half way up the cars. I know that also last week, KW at KW Drive, North Park and 69/59 @ 249 were flooded and unpassable.

One other thing to note is that our home was built in 1992, before Kingwood became part of Houston.

"We lived in Mills Branch for 12 years and loved it.  We moved right before Harvey, and our old house did not flood.  Great neighborhood, great schools.    Wish they didn't have the overzealous HOA there, but everywhere has an HOA nowadays.  Personally I would look for a home that has a new roof, new AC, updated kitchen and bath, no foundation issues and double paned windows.  They'll sell you a large home for a very small price, but maintenance and updating is very expensive.  Buy what you can afford now, not what you can grow into.

"We live in GreenTree in the back towards the Mills Branch side.  We like it, the schools all seem to be good in Kingwood, and we‚Äôve been very impressed with Humble ISD‚Äôs management of the district through the pandemic.  Traffic can be a little frustrating on the weekends, especially Northpark.  But, you still have 3 other ways to get out of Kingwood (WLH, KW Dr, and Mills Branch).  

One thing to consider is the trails.  If you enjoy walking a dog, riding a bike, or have kids that will be using the trails to get to school, consider where the access point of the trails are relative to the house.  Houses on a culdesac have an immediate access, where others might have to go down the street to get to them. The trails connect everything to everything, including all the neighborhood pools and parks.  

Request 6 months water bills from the seller.  Some homes have old water meters, and the city will ‚Äúforecast‚Äù water usage, and often do so incorrectly.  Some people have had enormous water bills that they have to fight, only to receive a credit on future bills.  Our neighbors got a $1700 bill the month after they moved in.  Our water meter didn‚Äôt work at all for years, and we had to practically beg the city to come replace it.  I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll come for their pound of flesh at some point, but our meter is at least accurate and reasonable now. 

Definitely do your homework on flooding during Harvey, Imelda, and if looking in Elm Grove north for any flooding due to the new development.  

Kingwood does have its petty crime, cars broken into, bikes stolen, etc., but nothing violent.  I think it‚Äôs people from outside Kingwood coming in, and the occasional teenagers getting into trouble.",t2_y5eat9n,txbluelacy,0,1608384126.0,0,t1_ggcufp3,ggcufp3,True,Reddicini,t3_kfzpl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingwood/comments/kfzpl2/wife_and_i_love_kingwood_we_enjoy_pretty_much/,Wife and I love Kingwood.

"Bear Branch is in that ballpark, and has lots of trees. The back section of Greentree is also beautiful, not as ‚Äúwooded‚Äù feeling but newer than BB (but still established).

"With all due respect... What did you expect the answer to be here?

Let‚Äôs start here:

Most parents aren‚Äôt actually blind.  They just play stupid to appease their conservative church-going peers and their own sanity. 

Believe it or not, all of the parents were once teenagers too.  We, too, experimented with our naughty bits and ingested some things that weren‚Äôt medically or legally sanctioned.  Most of us survived the experience and have a bunch of good life lessons as a result.  

Teenagers have discovered and experimented with their bodies since the beginning of human history.  They‚Äôve tried all the plants.  They drank all the things that made them feel funny.  And most of them have survived their worldly explorations. 

As the parents learned their life lessons, so, too, will this generation learn theirs.  As will the next generation and the one after that.

And, believe it or not, this is a good thing!  Because on the other side of adolescence is adulthood.  And, unless you want your kid living with you until they‚Äôre 30+, some independence and practice at independent decision making isn‚Äôt a bad thing. 

Again, with all due respect, I fail to believe you don‚Äôt actually know this already.  

And since you got me amped up, here‚Äôs a parent‚Äôs ramble:

Love your kids.  Support them in their successes and failures.  Allow them the space to try things, make mistakes, and grow up into adults that respect the people and world they live amongst. 

Look, I‚Äôve got a thousand concerns about my kiddo.  Haven‚Äôt done enough to prepare for a changing economy.  Self-discipline waxes and wanes with the moon.  

But for all my worries about how she‚Äôll find her way, she‚Äôs a smart, empathetic, kind person who really kicks ass when she puts her mind to something.   Maturity and drive will come with age.   She‚Äôs going to be OK.

Through it all, mama and I had a rough - if not absolute - idea of what she was doing.  There‚Äôs been communication of I tried this or we‚Äôve started doing that.  The conversations were about physical and mental health, safety, law and building a framework about how to make those decisions for herself.  I‚Äôm pretty proud of everyone involved for how that played out.

"Would you be willing to consider that there might not be a a specific policy or institution that is racist but that how those in charge of enforcing those policies and running those institutions may be doing so with some bias?

As an example, there may not be a policy that explicitly states that a police officer should pull over minorities with more frequency, but if a police officer does have the power to pull over whoever they choose and in turn does use their authority to pull over more minorities, then you have the beginnings of a problem.

Now we could look at this one officer and say this is an isolated incident of a bad actor, but what happens when rules are put in place that make investigating these sorts of abuses more difficult or even making it difficult to reprimand this officer if they are investigated and found to have been abusing their authority?

I'd be willing to bet that the rules that protect that officer from unjust treatment weren't put in place to help them abuse their power, but as a matter of course that bad behaviour is protected so it happens more and more.

All this is conjecture on my part but I don't feel any part of it is unreasonable. If you don't disagree I'd suggest that you consider that this small scenario playing out over and over again is what people are referring to when they claim there exists some sort of systemic abuse of power by police.

That all being said, I do have a study linked below that does attempt to analyze the frequency that people get pulled over and their skin color. This is by no means conclusive but I believe its a good starting point.

Its entirely reasonable to risk COVID exposure and transmission to join protests against racial injustices, while also thinking that bars are needless risky to the community. I mean if you look at the risk/reward from the general public's view: the reward for the one is a change to the nation and its institutions and the reward for the other is jello shots and hangovers.

First and foremost, Tachus would like to thank you for your support. With Kingwood being the largest master-planned community in Harris County and the second-largest within the Houston metropolitan area, Tachus looks forward to offering its residents a new, fair and local Internet option. Tachus‚Äô goal has always been to bring a simple solution to a convoluted industry of existing broadband providers. Kingwood residents should have access to the fastest, most reliable home Internet possible with no strings attached. Tachus offers no data caps; our pricing is guaranteed never to change; and residents receive symmetrical Internet speeds ‚Äî this is our promise to you.

As a reminder, Tachus relies on each neighborhood to meet a $20 deposit goal before we can build out our extensive, enterprise-grade 100% fiber-optic network to your area. We rely on you to help us spread the word about Tachus, so thank you for your grassroots help and support ‚Äî and please keep it up!

Tachus has, however, seen a tremendous amount of support from one neighborhood in Kingwood in particular, King‚Äôs Manor. In response to this demand, Tachus will begin building our network to the nearly 1,200 households within this neighborhood. To be clear, currently this network buildout will be limited to King's Manor ‚Äî but upon the deposit goal being met, we look forward to being able to expand our network to your neighborhood and rest of Kingwood very soon.",t2_w0w9r,hungryamericankorean,0,1590094087.0,0,t1_frdpnjt,frdpnjt,False,hungryamericankorean,t3_go0qw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingwood/comments/go0qw0/for_the_love_of_ending_suddencentury_link_please/,"For the love of ending Sudden/Century Link, PLEASE REGISTER!",/r/Kingwood/comments/go0qw0/for_the_love_of_ending_suddencentury_link_please/frdpnjt/,5,r/Kingwood,0,5

Elm grove has a lot of homes for sale right now due to the flooding. Even homes that didn‚Äôt flood are for sale and their value is very low due to the fear it may happen again.

"First off all - I'm sorry to hear of the loss of your wife.  I know I'd be pretty lost without mine.

I'm not going to defend this company.  But I did want to say that it's often the case that our material possessions are not worth to others what they are worth to us.

I had a similar conversation with my mom a year or so ago.  My dad passed, leaving her behind.  And my mom, being herself, was trying to make use of the goods they've accumulated that she had no need for.  It was mostly guy things - tools, yard equipment, audio/visual equipment, etc.

And the reality is that neither my brother nor I really wanted these things.  As we're both over 35, we have our own TVs, mowers, and tools.  Other than an item here or there that we took, she was able to gift some of it away to friends, acquaintances, people who knew people she knew... But the rest ended up in a dumpster - there just wasn't anything valuable enough for her to bother going through, organizing, cleaning and putting up for sale.

When my paternal grandparents (whom I was very close with) passed when I was a young adult, there was a lot of *stuff* that my parents didn't want.  My dad was an only child and so we did the same thing - a few items were taken by family, but much more was given away and the rest basically dumped the rest into a donation service that would haul it away and sort through it all to sell, donate or trash.  Their possessions were not in the current style, they had different bodies than any of us.. very little of what they owned fit into our lifestyle.

Again, I'm not defending this company, but if I were doing that job, I would see that I have a limited time to move a set of product that I'm sure most people feel very similarly about - a lot of *old stuff* (absent any personal attachments) that people just want to get rid of.  Even the rule of keeping you off-property is designed to prevent you from getting in the way of a sale of some item for a price that you deem unacceptably low.

Does that create a situation where it's ripe that you could be stolen from?  Yes.  And I'm sure the people who do this have an eye for finding the gems amongst the rocks and quietly taking stuff on the down low.  But this is effectively a liquidation sale.  And this is how things go in a liquidation sale - you take whatever you're offered for product that you're about to junk.  You get what you can and move on.

All of this to say... I know my mom took it really personally that nobody - not even her own kids - valued her things that she and my dad worked their whole lives for and I knew it killed her to get a cubic yard dumpster and get rid of my dad in the trash, as it were.  It took a lot of reassuring her that we didn't love him any less even if we didn't have a need - or a want - for his things.",t2_16jlrw,PapaDuckD,0,1590002780.0,0,t1_fr9s4an,fr9s4an,True,Inthenextlife,t3_gn254k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingwood/comments/gn254k/warning_blue_family_estate_sales/,Warning Blue family Estate Sales,/r/Kingwood/comments/gn254k/warning_blue_family_estate_sales/fr9s4an/,3,r/Kingwood,0,3

Driving accidents that occur each day don't grow based on how many driving accidents happened the day before.  I really hope you can see the fallacy and utter idiocy of your comparison there.  It's not just old people either.  Healthy young people who have had this virus now have respiratory issues that will stay with them the rest of their life and most likely contribute to their death later on.   Testicular issues have also been confirmed so this virus may also contribute to people never having children that they desire.  Who's fault is that? It's fucking morons like you who refuse to take this seriously who WILL be responsible for the many many deaths we will see in the next few weeks.  I have a pregnant girlfriend at home and if someone spreads this shit in my neighborhood we are going on lockdown even harder.  One trip to the grocery store and then hunkering down.  Oh and just so you know if you wanna keep calling me a little bitch let's see who the real little bitch is.  Meet me in the HEB parking lot at 10 pm tonight off of W Lake Houston.  I'll be more than happy to fuck you up if you agree not to call the cops.
