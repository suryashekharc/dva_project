"I posted this to someone else below you but here was my experience:

I had a similar experience. That place fucking sucks. I called and they told me they don't take walk-ins and I need to set an appointment. So I did.

When I got there I couldn't even find an employee to talk to. It took like 10 minutes before someone came out of the back and he was already helping another customer. Okay fine. I tell them I made an appointment for this time and they don't even know what I'm talking about. Finally someone else comes out of the back and starts helping me. He's huffing and puffing the whole time he's taking my measurements. Like I'm some huge inconvenience for him. Then he goes to show me what's available and is just kind of looking at me while I decide. Doesn't bother to really explain the suits to me or anything.

"Woah, I'm surprised so many people had parking issues at Bacarra. My building was tucked away from everyone else, so maybe that's why I never noticed.

However, I still can't say I'd recommend it. It was not the worst, the front office people were nice, it was well-priced (or was, at least, when I first moved in), and the actual apartments were really nice.  They also didn't rip off our deposit - the fees were totally reasonable.

But we had an appliance break and they didn't replace it for four months. They told us they'd send a maintenance guy to check it, he never did, they told us they ordered it and it would take two weeks, we called back three weeks later, they said the order was never put in and they'd do it now, a few days later they said the maintenance guy had to come try to fix it before ordering, etc.

When we first moved in, the cool stuff like the theater room and the summer kitchen were free to use, you just had to reserve them. That was a big reason we chose the complex. A year later, we sign our lease to stay another 14 months. The next time we tried to get the theater (we hadn't used it in a couple of months), they said they'd changed the policy and it was now a $100 deposit. I was like oh, that's no biggie, we always clean up after so we'd get it back... no, it was a non-refundable deposit and it had to be paid EVERY use. Like, that's not a deposit, that's a fee. They added it on without alerting the tenants (I asked if an email had been sent) and no indication in the lease renewal.

I also had a roommate and when we moved in we both *swear* they said renter's insurance was included in the rent. I very specifically asked, because it's only like $10/month, so if it wasn't included then it wouldn't have been a big deal. A couple of years later I call for the insurance information and they said they've never provided insurance. Idk, just seems sketchy.

The AC would suddenly stop pumping sometimes and we'd have to use a vacuum to suck water out of it. There was a part to fix it. They just never did it. 

Anyway, there were a handful of other things were frustrating or that seemed a little weird. It wasn't terrible.

Raleigh/Cary were Legends Cary Towne, Bacarra, and Windsor at Tryon. The three were within a comparable price range with one another.

"see that's interesting because the actual firemen for the first one said it happened in an attic that is not resident accessible.  yet the apartment complex employees keep blaming it on a resident.  i'd personally like to see the investigative report.  which, when i asked, the apartment complex told me was ""confidential"" and not something that would be allowed to be seen.  

i live in the apartment directly next door to the first fire.  i was evacuated for several hours that day and now have panic attacks when i hear sirens- because the fire trucks actually come through here very very frequently.  seeing about 10+ trucks blocking the way when i came home today was terrifying.  but the actual damage was worse.  i feel so bad for the people in that block of units.  

other residents told me that a baby/toddler was given cpr, a man jumped from a third story balcony and broke his shoulder, an older lady was on a gurney, and i'm not sure about the 4th person.  people were everywhere, there was a lot of crying.  the fire apparently started at 230 and i got home at 5 and they were only starting the very beginning of the process to close up some of the trucks.  i really hope nobody loses their life. 

dasmen ignored this place and all the issues that happened to us residents for the two years i've had to live here.  a new company, harbor group, bought it a week before the first fire.  this place needs to be investigated for all of the many code violations, flooding, mold issues, electrical issues, etc that they have just ignored for many of us for years.  

thankfully i'm going to be able to move out at the end of this month, as my lease was up right at the right time.  if i had renewed and then this happened i'd be so much more anxious.

"Asian-American, been in NC for over 25 years.  Cary has undergone a serious transformation from sleepy farm town (with literal farms) to sprawling suburb in the time that I've been here (all of those farms are now strip malls or housing developments).  I don't have demographic data, but Cary does have at least three Asian supermarkets (two Asian, one Indian) along with a handful of other smaller Asian/ethnic markets and a shopping area with a confluence of ethnic shops and restaurants (Japanese, Szechuan, Tibetan, Mexican, Jamaican, Korean off the top of my head).  I've seen at least one Chinese and one Korean church, and the local Hindi temple (possibly technically next door in Morrisville) is building a large new tower.  Boba tea has ""recently"" become a thing in this area, so there are a number of relatively new shops.

The town of Cary does have several annual Asian celebrations (run by local organizations), including a Dragon Boat Festival and a huge Diwali celebration.  There's also a Chinese Lantern Festival during the December/holiday period but it's primarily (photogenically elaborate) lighting displays and a few Chinese acrobatic demonstrations.

The Triangle area as a whole is tolerant of Asians in general.  I'm not aware of any incidents directly towards Asians in the area akin to the ones highly publicized during the early months of the pandemic.  Almost everyone in this area is a transplant (not a lot of generational NC natives -- I think I can count the number I know on one hand) so questions about ""where are you from, no, where are you really from?"" don't happen much any more.

That being said, while there are a lot of Asians in population, you probably won't find a ""core"" of Asians in the area.

">Are there any Seattle transplants in the area that could draw up some comparisons?  

No but I've visited Seattle albeit 6 years ago. You will find the area hot and humid almost unbearable. You'll find a new appreciation for air conditioning. The average annual rainfall in Cary is actually higher than in Seattle but ours occurs in many higher intensity storms than long drizzly periods. Both Cary and Apex are in final approach for RDU so you'll likely have planes flying overhead. We also have trains running through the middle of town which you'll likely hear. The areas is relatively quiet though. You won't find lots of people out at night in the streets like in Seattle. Cary has a master plan for development and pretty good transportation standards so you'll find the area interconnected with greenways and parks. 

>Is it an accepting area for minorities?  

I want to say, generally yes, but I'm not a minority. Hate crimes aren't really a thing here. I have Chinese neighbors who literally live across the street from me and their daughter has come over a few times to play with my kids. But from observations out shopping and just being in public spaces, people are friendly to minorities or at least neutral.

"I’m Asian American (Korean) who moved here (Cary) from NYC.  Don’t feel like the East Asian community is strong here.. but there are lots of good Chinese / Taiwanese shops scattered around. Still haven’t found a Korean restaurant that I like.. at least we have H-Mart! 

Duke, UNC, NC State has a sizable International Student body and lots of Asian American students, so plenty of opportunities to meet other Asian people if you want.

When I moved here 7 years ago, was told Cary stood for Centralized Area for Relocated Yankees.

As for living in Cary, I feel extremely safe. There has been an uptick in car break-ins recently, but I don’t ever feel like I’d get attacked for just being Asian. Not sure how Seattle is, but I worry about my friends in NYC all the time these days..

Unfortunately, people like myself.. and all the other Northerners have brought their snobby entitlement here.. they complain that the South doesn’t have the same view points as them. Same for politics. This is a Red state. Lots of co-works are / were from either New York or New Jersey. Handful of my clients as well. I don’t feel sympathy for them when they complain.

"This area is no where near as liberal as Seattle. It is changing and evolving. In general it leans liberal because there are a ton of educated people in Wake county. But, if you drive 30+ minutes in any direction you'll leave the liberal bubble.


That being said, most people are extremely nice. There are quite a few Asian markets and authentic restaurants. The dominant Asian population here is Indian but there are other communities as well. 


Not to scare you but it will be a culture shock. The south is very different from the west coast and you don't totally escape that in the Cary bubble. Different doesn't mean bad. 


It will feel more suburban/rural. Our population is far smaller and Cary is pretty spread out.



64% of the population is married. It's a family oriented town and community. Places close early. Events and breweries have tons of kids and dogs. 



It's more ""purple"" politically. 1/3 of people voted for Trump in the last election. In general, I try to avoid politics unless I'm with friends.



Housing is way more affordable. This topic is contentious with locals who blame people moving here for skyrocketing the housing costs. Average income in the area is around $45k for an individual. 


Crime is extremely low. The most common crime here is property crime, mostly car break-ins.


A lot of these things are both pros and cons. Some people label Cary boring for its family focus. Some people praise it for the same reason.",t2_etk1uv4b,DipDodgeDuckDive,0,1646648731.0,0,t1_hzosmfq,hzosmfq,True,EndlessMOA,t3_t8fst0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cary/comments/t8fst0/moving_from_seattle_to_caryapex/,Moving from Seattle to Cary/Apex,/r/cary/comments/t8fst0/moving_from_seattle_to_caryapex/hzosmfq/,7,r/cary,0,7

"I’m Korean American living in Wake Forest for about a year, but I go to Cary a lot. There are a ton of Asians living in the area, especially Indians. I’m not sure about Apex because I don’t go there. 


Honestly, if I didn’t hate that the housing is crowded there, I would live in Cary. There are tons of Asian restaurants, boba shops, markets, and people. There isn’t too much variety of Asian cuisines, but you’ll get the basics- hot pot places, Korean restaurants, pho, sushi, etc. I find that people are very friendly in Cary- NC in general.

"I'm white so I can't give you the best advice but this is a relatively slow subreddit so I'll chime in.  First, Cary/Raleigh/Durham is a very liberal bubble of North Carolina, as is anywhere in our state that's educated.  I can tell you that Indian-American seems to be the dominant minority here in Cary.  The Asian American population doesn't feel particularly large from other places I've lived in, but we have plenty of Asian grocery stores and restaurants that I'd imagine you could find the community you're looking for pretty easily.

"I don’t live there, but I live about 2 miles from there and can comment on the location. Plus I'm a runner so I understand wanting to be outside with sidewalks and away from major street crossings.

The complex is right on a main road, Cary Parkway, and near a major intersection, Cary Parkway and High House. They're not highways, but they are busy, 4 lane roads that can be annoying to cross as a pedestrian. They do have sidewalks though. They do look nice as far as big roads can...they plant a lot of trees and shrubs in the medians. 

It's close to a lot of nice housing developments you can walk through. Bond Park is nice, but you will need to cross a big intersection to get there. You're also close to Umstead State Park and Lake Crabtree, both have great hiking trails. They're about a 5 minute drive. There's an amazing Greenway system too, but I don't think those would be within walking distance.

You're right by a grocery store, Lowes Foods. Definitely walkable. 

As far as noise goes, avoid the units against Cary Parkway and you'll probably be fine. There is a train you'll hear. It's pretty unavoidable in Cary, but you get used to it.

It's very safe. I'm a female and go running alone all the time with no issues.

Overall I love the area. It's not the most walkable, but it's not bad for a suburb. It's the most convenient place to live...parks are close, shopping is close, I40 is close, the airport is close.

My husband lived in the Audubon Parc apartments a few years ago and it was nice. It had a lake behind it with a one mile trail. From there you could walk through Lockmere which is a nice housing development. Or hit the Greenway and go to another lake.

"I very recently moved and I would suggest The Park at Crossroads. The complex itself is good to walk in but it also backs up to a lake loop trail with links up to two greenways. It’s in a safe area—kinda nestled on a quieter residential street but between two busier main roads and shopping centers. Price for a 2/2 is less than $1600 and less without a pet. Haven’t had any noise issues although obviously that would be dependent on having particularly loud neighbors. I rarely hear the people above me. The kitchen is updated and big enough to cook in regularly. Definitely walking distance to a grocery store, using the aforementioned trail, but that also depends on how much you want to carry back. It is owned by a company so I’m not sure any company is going to be particularly better than others regarding decency—I’ve had good experiences with the leasing office and the maintenance team has been super responsive.",t2_10ocn3a2,kmc0202,0,1646538875.0,0,t1_hzjasjr,hzjasjr,True,[deleted],t3_t7phwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cary/comments/t7phwl/opinions_on_cary_greens_at_preston/,Opinions on Cary Greens at Preston?,/r/cary/comments/t7phwl/opinions_on_cary_greens_at_preston/hzjasjr/,3,r/cary,0,3

Thanks so much. I’m moving from NY. So it’s a bit tough to get an idea outside of reviews. So far the reviews do mention the issues you mentioned but I found a lot of positive ones as well on apartmentratings dot com.. so I felt like it was like not amazing but a good place. I also compared it with other around and seems to be doing a little better then those.

"no experience with it, but from the recent google reviews i definitely would NOT consider it a worthwhile place to live.  i'm moving out of aurella cary this month, which has a ton of the same ""unreachable/maintenance never done when asked"" issues.  aurella just got bought last month, so that could change, but they have a huge uphill battle getting the place caught up.  i definitely would not move to the place you're looking at.  

always always read the reviews on multiple sites. if all you can find is super friendly reviews from people who visited or claim to have lived there a few months, talking about how great the *specific names of* office staff are, consider those to be astroturfing.  

there are a ton of super shitty places to live around here and i don't want you to get yourself trapped in a lease at one of them.",t2_dnhb6,wildweeds,0,1646225665.0,0,t1_hz1kopx,hz1kopx,True,jafridi2387,t3_t4zaif,https://www.reddit.com/r/cary/comments/t4zaif/any_experience_with_harrison_grande/,Any experience with Harrison grande?,/r/cary/comments/t4zaif/any_experience_with_harrison_grande/hz1kopx/,6,r/cary,0,6

"It has the same problem as other houses in that area: way too much home for the land. This house would look beautiful and more appropriate if it was sitting on a few acre estate. But if you look at the aerial photos, it’s like on a typical subdivision cul-de-sac and backs into the office park (and I bet there will be more construction by those offices). 

We live not far from that area (in a much “poorer” subdivision) and a few times drove into those Regency subdivisions out of curiosity. The houses just look so weird. The plots must be 0.5-0.75 acre and then you have some Tuscany villa literally next door to Tudor style or something. It’s like a shelf at a villa discount store. :)

And on Halloween, the kids were like “oh, these rich people must be giving away full size candy!” LOL! No candy at all, everything dark. Felt almost depressing. I don’t mean to hate on those people and certainly anyone is free to buy a Tudor castle on 0.5 acre lot in Cary if they wish.

"i think aster was the worst place i ever lived. but i also think apartments are only as good as your management. i left the state and like where i live better now because the management is not incompetent and actually gets shit done unlike the aster. there was someone good at the aster named tiffany but she is no longer there i'm like no wonder no shit gets done anymore bc she left. also once when i was there the trash compactor was broken for like 2 weeks and it was hella annoying. maybe it's better now. i mean there are people who like the aster a lot. i enjoyed the pool there most. then a long time ago i used to have to drive to RTP for work and it was a short commute  from aster so that was convenient. you are also near all the groceries but for me idc. i never met the people i was looking for there. like you can literally walk to whole foods if that matters to you.

umm. are you looking to stay in cary? there is always cortland cary across the street. it's more expensive than aster though. for me if i stayed, i was going to try to go to north hills. i thought it would be better there for what i was looking for. cary did not have much to offer for me but i lived there almost my whole life. also knew people in lantower weston corners. idk you just have to pick an apt and go with it. expectations cannot be very high for apartments. a lot of them will suck i have rented for years. i don't want to buy a house. i noticed a lot of people in the aster were there and eventually bought houses and moved out.",t2_dg088q2j,Free-Comfort-6606,0,1645889325.0,0,t1_hyiua2z,hyiua2z,False,locolocust,t3_t1o7ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/cary/comments/t1o7ao/opinions_of_the_aster_apartments/,Opinions of the aster apartments,/r/cary/comments/t1o7ao/opinions_of_the_aster_apartments/hyiua2z/,1,r/cary,0,1

"I mean, just take a quick look at the recent reviews. where do I even start. 

but, ive lived there 2 years and I'm finally leaving next month (fingers crossed). 

it wasn't that bad when I moved in back in Jan 2020.  a few months into the pandemic, most of the staff had quit due to lack of support. there was one maintenance worker, who was great. office staff round 2 got replaced with one guy named Doug, around July 2020. he tried to be everything for everyone, working nights and weekends, making maintenance calls himself, etc. there were now one or two maintenance staff, and the good one was gone. emergency maintenance only was slowly replaced with normal maintenance, but they were 400-1000 work orders behind and struggling to catch up. after Doug left, the worst round of office staff arrived, with a rotating cast of maintenance borrowed from other dasmen complexes. most of the worst downhill trajectory of the complex came during these few months. they were replaced after three to six months, and the current office staff arrived. One caveat being that I'm mainly talking about the leasing manager, as the front office staff change somewhat more often. 

during the time the complex really went downhill, they were remodeling the leasing office and gym. the office staff didn't have basic supplies like paper or ink in their printers though. when the really bad mgmt team stepped in, the office mgr at the time harassed people on eviction moratorium daily through email and phone calls. she constantly messaged my ex who was home sick with covid and who she knew wasn't on the lease anymore. she lied and held up my covid rental assistance that would have paid for me in full until it almost got canceled right before the moratorium ended, and I had to get the district manager involved to push it through. she sent out eviction warning emails during the moratorium with a signature suggesting that people apply to that rental relief at the same time she was ignoring sending mine up for a signature bc ""this company won't participate in anything like that."" she sent these emails out en masse, with a cc instead of a bcc. one angry person replied saying that they were withholding rent until the light pole in front of their balcony stopped strobing. it's been strobing for 2 years. 

in the set of 4 apartments in my quad, we've had several issues between us with pipes bursting, flooded floors they never replace, clean, or handle mold growth that comes up for. my apartment filters are never replaced and they have to be bent and shoved into a weird spot that isn't made for them anyway. the breakers in a few of our places have been popping repeatedly over the last few months. my apartment is so badly insulated that with the heat at 75 you still have icy hands and feet, and my visitors have remarked on the cold. half the outlets are unsafe to use. 

it took several months to replace the broken heating element in my oven. I've told them many times my oven smells like mouse pee when it's turned on, and I've found a mouse in my apartment that my cat caught. they did an emergency repair to a broken pipe that was flooding, but in 1.5 years have not replaced the damaged floors or drywall, so I have two holes a foot big in my bathroom, that makes it smell like a sewer sometimes. my bathroom collects mold like nothing else and I have to keep up with it constantly. 

the water heater is dying and they know I barely have hot water anymore but have done nothing. actually that's how they are overall. they will close several work orders in a row without doing the work. there was a drip in one tub the day I moved in and it took a year to fix it. my other tub pours half the water down the drain instead of routing it to my shower head, so I lose half the pressure and all that water. this has cost me so much overall in heat and water bills. last year I was paying 230 a month in electric until they fixed that leak and it went back down to 80 or so. that tub is ruined from the constant leak but they never fixed it. I've not been given any assistance with those high bills even though it was their fault. 

I had to stop my work from home job I got in 2021, bc they had loud landscapers out way too often for way too long, leaf blowing the same areas over and over, but never trimming bushes that impeded sidewalks. Doug said once that they had a contract that caused that issue and he wished he could fix it too. he also mentioned once, that all of the apartments on the ground floor that weren't on hills has bad mold issues. mine is on a hill, but still does have tons of mold issues. a neighbor that has thankfully left, used to do mobile car washing with his super loud generator every night and weekend if there was good weather, for about a year. not only did it drive me crazy and make me keep my sliding screen closed when I'd want to open it, but I lost the remote job due to the constant noise and had to scramble to find a local one, right as the moratorium was ending, and I was trying to renew my lease and set the rental assistance in action from the missed rent. 

after I got my local job, the office started closing earlier, and for a long time nobody answered if you called or emailed, so going into the office was the only way to contact anyone. I took off work more than once just to reach them. they also started taking off tons of days during the week. and nobody in the office wore masks during the entire pandemic. 

the complex was just bought by harbor group management two weeks ago, which when I googled, showed a mix of good reviews and ones similar to what I've described here, from employees on glassdoor. 2 Saturdays ago, the apartment in the next quad over, upstairs but directly next to my bedroom, caught fire. we were evacuated for several hours and the firemen said at multiple points that it started in an attic with no resident access. 

my lease is up, and they were raising the rent (with all these repairs needed???) so I took off last Monday and ended up talking with the new company's district manager, since the leasing manager was still out with covid. she immediately tried to cover the company's ass instead of making me feel safe, heard, or valued as a tenant up for renewal. she said that the fire inspection results would be confidential and not available to residents, and that the fire was caused by a resident. I do not trust her answer. 

she was also cold toward me as I described what I've lived with and how I wanted it all fixed and not to pay a higher rent if I renewed. I tried my best to hold back my frustration, but I was likely unpleasant to deal with. but she is a district manager and should be able to handle customer issues better. I had very valid reasons to be that fed up. and I had just been evacuated and spent hours coughing from smoke inhalation, holding my scared cat in a cold car, with a neck injury from being clawed up by my cat when firemen rushed at him while evacuating me. that same day I'd had a lot of issues with my breakers. I was understandably rattled.  she was snarky and cold, and repeatedly focused on the fact that it wasn't her company that let it go to hell, instead of giving any empathy or being proactive about making me whole and fixing things. she also refused to lower the new rent price if I renew to reflect the state I've been living in. while I was there, I heard a gentleman and his very pregnant wife begging someone else to please fix the leak in their apartment or let them out of their lease, because they were standing in water for weeks now. 

she did initiate a couple of work orders for me, ignoring my request to be given 24 hr notice of entry (and those work orders were messed up). aside from legally being required unless it's an emergency, I have ptsd, which I shouldn't have to disclose to her, and told her verbally and in the email she requested I send with a listing of all the issues in my place, that I wanted notice for all entry. she also left comments in the work order notes that seemed to suggest she thought I was making up how bad it was. 

the place is super dirty, with garbage everywhere. teenagers have loud late night parties/fights on many weekday nights until 2 am, at the park by the leasing office during summer months. 

I will say, the new company has rolled things out weirdly and with no notice, so it was not a smooth transition. they have made the office by appointment only, citing that they are abiding by government restrictions regarding covid (though they weren't wearing masks regardless when I went in last Monday). they changed the website, email, and phone links without telling anyone for over a week, and the new phone number didn't say what apartment complex it was for, when I called last week hoping to reach the right people. we suddenly had to pay rent with money orders last month, but the office was closed. they sent an email today stating that valet trash service will be starting up again this week, so we will see how that goes, and if the district manager will honor that she told me she'd let me out of my lease with no penalty for not giving 2 months notice. and if they will make it hard on me over all the repairs (i have copious email exchanges over the last 2 years backing me up). I'm going to reach out to city code violations once I'm safely out of their grip. 

It's sad, bc I love the area. it's convenient to a lot of places and the neighborhood is pretty. but I don't trust the new company enough to give them a year. I've been scrambling to find something that isn't a bait and switch or several hundred more a month (or really far away). 

know that many places here somehow are getting rid of bad reviews. you can tell, bc all you see are many reviews from people who seem very happy to feel ""like family"" to [specifically named employees in the office] with no real mention of what the pros and cons of living there longer than a month or so would be. they read like ads.",t2_dnhb6,wildweeds,0,1645051052.0,0,t1_hx8f1dg,hx8f1dg,False,[deleted],t3_stw733,https://www.reddit.com/r/cary/comments/stw733/moving_back_to_the_area_soon_looking_for/,"Moving back to the area soon, looking for apartment suggestions",/r/cary/comments/stw733/moving_back_to_the_area_soon_looking_for/hx8f1dg/,3,r/cary,0,3

"There are not many people in this sub, so I’m not sure if you get many replies. Regency Pkwy is in a residential / office area, there aren’t many salons nearby. I’d suggest to check out Sola Salons on Kildaire Farm Rd, which would be just 10 min drive from Regency. It is sort of a coworking space for the stylists where several share a location and rent individual rooms. 

I’m not sure anyone would be willing to go to a hotel but you could check the hair stylists there and contact them. My hairstylist is also in one of those locations (there are several in the area) but she’s booked solid, especially on the weekends. I suspect you might not have many choices because it’s a short notice.

"Depends on what you are looking for. Costco or Publix have decent cakes but those would be typical American “dry sponge + tons of super sugary buttercream”. These can be decorated up to wazoo though. 

La Farm has fantastic bread but cakes are not their thing IMHO. Taste-wise I think Grand Asia bakery makes great cakes. They’re light and much more to our preference but not everyone might like if they’re used to traditional buttercream stuff. Our kid didn’t care much for them as he loves buttercream.

Whole Foods is a solid choice too. For the little kids, I’ve also ordered mini cupcakes from them before and they were nice. 

I also recommend Asali Desserts in that odd shopping plaza at the corner of Hwy 1 and 64. Their desserts are excellent and they sell cakes by the slice (might want to place a special order for the whole one). And there is a small vegan bakery in Apex called Bonafide Bakeshop, across from Beaver Creek area. Their Oreo cake is very nice (kid approved :) ) and they have good reviews.

"Tips for obtaining a license in North Carolina: 

Don’t use turn signals. Ever. 

If you’re in a single lane behind a car waiting to turn left don’t exercise patience. Drive onto the shoulder to go around them because you shouldn’t have to wait. The closer to the ditch or sidewalk the better

If you’ve missed your exit on the interstate, don’t take the next exit and come back around. Reversing on the interstate is always the best option. 

When on the interstate and needing to take an exit, its best to wait until the last possible moment to get over. Multiple lane changes here are preferred, use the shoulder if need be. 

If on 540 near RTP drive as fast as you want, it also makes an excellent drag strip in the evenings. 

All jokes aside, just take your time. Check your mirrors and blind spots often, use your turn signals and be mindful of your speed even though everyone around you will be going 10mph over.

"I think there is a distinction between best grocery store and the one you will actually go to for most of your grocery shopping.

Wegmans is great. They have a fantastic meat selection and very good produce. But, IMO they are too expensive for day-to-day grocery needs, and they only have 2 locations in the whole area so it isn't really convenient. Some of their prices are straight up ridiculous if you aren't careful ($5 for a slice of cake??). They also have a very disappointing international aisle. I'll only go to Wegmans if I have a particular need for a certain cut of meat.

Meanwhile, I guarantee you that there's a Harris Teeter within 5 minutes of 99% of houses in the area. While not the best quality you can find, they still have very good meat and produce, with great prices. For example, you can regularly get chicken breasts at HT for $1.99/lb. You will be paying $6-7/lb at Wegmans. I use HT for almost all of my grocery shopping.

Trader Joe's is Trader Joe's.

Lowes can have some really good stuff. I've found better produce there than HT and their meat is great quality, albeit very expensive and they always have a limited selection. They also have a good bakery and some god damn delicious muffins.

Publix is good too but I don't find myself there very often because it doesn't have much that I don't find at closer stores. If I lived closer though, I would certainly use it as a primary store. They have the best international selection in my experience, at least for the country I'm from.

Aldi and Lidl are also around and I've heard they are good for cheaper shopping, but the few time I've been I've been very disappointed and I haven't been since.

The only store I'd actively avoid is Food Lion. There are actually some more upscale ones around, but generally they are a low tier.

tl;dr - you probably are best served shopping at HT/Publix with trips to Wegmans, TJ, Whole Foods as needed.",t2_oy8ef,ShittyFrogMeme,0,1644171244.0,0,t1_hvu85ax,hvu85ax,True,ljoly,t3_slq6o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cary/comments/slq6o6/whats_your_grocery_store_chain_ranking/,What's your grocery store chain ranking?,/r/cary/comments/slq6o6/whats_your_grocery_store_chain_ranking/hvu85ax/,3,r/cary,0,3

"Aldi isn't my thing but I know people who shop for families who swear by it.  I don't get the obsession with Wegman's lots of people seem to have.  Yes they have lots of premade food but my impression is prices are higher than average there.

My go to is Harris Teeter off of Tryon and Trader Joe's off of Kildaire.  It is probably the only Trader Joe's I've been to that has ample parking, lol.

I agree with your take on Whole Foods and meat.  Same goes for their cheese selection.

Don't forget you can get groceries at Target and Walmart also.  I've been surprised by some of the things I find at Target of all places.

"Say what you want about Walmart but I'm a huge fan of placing Walmart Grocery orders online for pickup.

You shop online and schedule a pickup time.  They pick your order for you and notify you through the Walmart app that your order is ready for pickup.  You pull up outside the store and they load it all into your car.  You never step foot in the store.  It saves me tons of time that I can use for things I actually prefer to do instead of grocery shopping.

The actual process of shopping online is really fast since you can either pull up a list of purchases from a previous order and just pop them in your cart or you can create custom lists of favorite grocery items.

I generally stay away from Food Lion, as they tend to have cheaper products all-around, less organic produce, and a smaller selection of beer and wine.

We generally eat organic fruits and veggies, which can be tough to find in North Carolina this time of year. Trader Joe's and Whole Foods generally have the best selection, but it's hit or miss until Spring.

"I live in an older neighborhood, but the homes aren't super far apart. The reasons we've kept this rooster are myriad. I 100% agree we are in violation of ToC's zoning ordinance about roosters, but here's my explanation. 

&#x200B;

1. We got Popcorn (his name) in a straight run purchase of a couple Silkie chickens. Bantam breeds are often sold are straight run, meaning the sexes are mixed, and you don't know what's a hen or rooster until a few months into their development. Turns out Popcorn is a roo. 
2. We got Popcorn in February of 2020, just before the pandemic began. My 7yo son has some anxiety diagnoses and had an incredibly difficult time the first year of the pandemic. With virtual academy and being unable to see his best friend next door, he was a mess. This rooster was his best friend during this time. He spent hours every day with Popcorn, carrying him around the yard, feeding him treats, even swinging with him on his playset. Taking the rooster away during this period would have had a significant and negative affect on his mental health. 
3. We keep Popcorn and the hens in their coop until after 8ish in the AM. The coop is well insulated and his crowing is audible as a muffled noise. You don't hear it inside the house.
4. Since he's a bantam, his crowing is dramatically quieter than a standard breed rooster. Also, since he's a silkie, he doesn't really crow nonstop throughout the day. Mostly in the morning, then a few times around 3-4PM. You can hear him a block or two away when outside, but it's infrequent.
5. Previous neighbors in the houses directly adjacent to us have had dogs that were kept outside and would bark persistently for hours. That was orders of magnitudes worse than this rooster. Both in terms of noise level and total duration. I'm not saying this excuses our violation of the rooster ordinance, I'm just giving you a point of reference.
6. Lastly, we haven't had a single neighbor complain. Most people find him whimsical or folksy. If a neighbor started to complain we'd begin finding a new home for him.",t2_6kdoa,Dont_Call_it_Dirt,0,1643203288.0,0,t1_huagop1,huagop1,False,macemillianwinduarte,t3_sbomsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cary/comments/sbomsn/what_the_heck_is_with_all_the_roosters_right_now/,what the heck is with all the roosters right now,/r/cary/comments/sbomsn/what_the_heck_is_with_all_the_roosters_right_now/huagop1/,6,r/cary,0,6

"Guessing something about it being flavored exempts it from the regulations? Or being apple based? TW doesn't seem to carry regular unflavored soju. But still a nice resource! Price is better here, too. So thank you again. =)

This Good Friends brand is a mystery to me, I never saw it in Korea and when I spotted it at H Mart and showed it to my husband he was like ""that doesn't look like a Korean company."" We checked the label and it says imported and made in Korea so idk. Seems like it's 14% ABV (pretty reg for flavored soju) and made from apples, whereas basic unflavored soju is anywhere from 17% - 21% and made from rice/potatoes/sweet potatoes. So maybe some part of that makes it okay to sell as wine?

I went in there to have some issue with my alternator and timing belt fixed, which I should have been able to do at home, but they had the part available and they could do the work while I slept between night shifts.

They kept my car there all day, with me napping in the waiting room, and told me that the delay was because the tension arm on my timing belt had been stuck or bent and was therefore very tight and they couldn't get it off. 

Mind you, it only got bent because they bent it while trying to get it off, then tried to bill me $1,400+ for replacement and repairing the damages, for damage they did on a repair I didn't consent to.

"I've had it since August of 2020. No problems whatsoever and no downtime. Running all Ubiquiti gear (AP, router, switches) and easily get all the advertised speeds. My wireless speeds vary slightly depending on where I am in the house (and device capabilities), but getting 480 down / 625 (on my phone) up in my office where the gear is and about 1/2 that on the other end of the house. Definitely faster than the Google wifi pucks they supply. Highly recommend the Ubiquiti gear if you are technically minded!

The only issue was when they did the install (you can specify exactly where you want their Fiber ""modem"" wall wart installed), they ran the fiber up the middle of the siding on my house instead of off to the side. Not a big deal, as I will get around to moving it myself at some point (there is an internal run inside from crawlspace up to attic I had forgotten about), but just be aware.

Our biggest issue was in the trenching of the lines. They ran them in the street right at the edge of the sidewalk concrete and the pavement of the road. We had our driveway re-done and of course, it messed up the line, even though our guys were being extremely careful (didn't cut it, but its fiber optic so it doesn't take much to break it internally). Guy came out from Google Fiber and said ""oh yeah, they realized after the fact that they shouldn't have run them that way"". The expansion and movement of the pavement in the heat, etc. is breaking the fiber lines frequently so they will eventually probably need to be re-run in yards (which is how everything else is done and we had no issues with any of those when we had the work done, and the new fiber line is run that way in our yard).
