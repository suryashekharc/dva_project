"I grew up in Chatham, and while it's gotten better, it's still pretty limited in activities that are open to everyone. Sorry this is going to get pretty rambly. I put a TL;DR at the bottom.

The first time I was back as an adult was for about a year in 2012-2013. While I was home, there was an article from a new writer who had moved here to work for the Chatham Daily News, basically saying the exact same thing as you. I can't find the article, but the writer especially lamented the lack of sports or group physical activities that wasn't catered at children or seniors, given we were the heart disease capital of Canada (and we're still one of the worst areas of Canada). The comments on the article lambasted the writer, saying you just need to know where to look, and need to make your own fun. I personally experienced this frustration, when I was looking to play volleyball and hockey and found out by word-of-mouth that there are adult sports leagues, but they're almost all privately organized. You need an in with the commissioner, which is their right since they are renting the gym/rink and taking on the liability, but it's annoying that the municipality doesn't have *any* adult sports leagues. TBF, the municipality has run pilot leagues a few times over the last 20+ years, but I think they were all the initiative of summer students and fizzled out when the students went back to school. The municipality does have some lane swims in Wallaceburg & Blenheim, free skates and shinny, so that's something at least. I definitely agree with u/dotdaver that the Chatham Granite Club is great and very welcoming, especially to [new players](https://chathamgraniteclub.org/leagues/adult-learn-to-curl/).

I moved back last year and agree with others that areas like downtown Chatham have become much more open and accepting. There are a lot of interesting new businesses who are welcoming to everyone vs some of the stuck-up old-stock businesses. I've only been to Turns & Tales once, but it was really great. I need to check out a bunch of these new places this summer!

Now that I'm an adult with a car, I'm excited to check out some of the attractions in the area, like the [corn maze](https://imaze.ca/) and [Uncle Tom's Cabin](https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/properties/uncle-toms-cabin).

One area I haven't seen mentioned yet is events and festivals. [The Municipality's page](https://www.chatham-kent.ca/visitck/doandsee/eventsandfestivals/Pages/default.aspx) hasn't been updated since last summer, but hopefully they'll get on that soon. The return of [RetroFest](http://downtownchatham.com/events/retrofest/) should be fun, I have hope for the first [Crowfest](https://crowfestck.com/), [WAMBO](https://www.wambo.ca/) is pretty big in Wallaceburg, and I hope [Thamesville Threshing Festival](https://www.facebook.com/thamesvillethreshingfestival) is back on this year, because I've never been able to go and it sounds like a blast. [Ribfest](https://www.chathamribfest.ca/) is pretty similar to those held in other cities, and there are other special activities in Tecumseh Park like Art in the Park (being held concurrently with Ribfest this year), and I thought they used to hold outdoor movie nights, though I can't find any evidence of that. The library used to have the occasional author-readings or speakers, some of which were pretty interesting.

**TL;DR** A lot of activities in Chatham are only discoverable by ""word of mouth"", or are just ""make your own fun."" I'd suggest starting with the activities you *can* find, and see if you can make contacts/friends with similar interests to find those hidden activities. Getting involved through volunteering, etc might also help you build up those contacts.

"As someone who grew up here and has lived here for most of my adult life, this is the best list of things I’ve seen so far! 

I’d like to add checking out the local farms when it’s spring-fall season as well. We are super blessed to have amazing fresh produce every where in CK. Most places will provide a map of local farms you can visit for different items.

A lot of Chatham entertainment is food-based IMO. If you’re into breweries with great craft beer, Sons of Kent downtown is a great spot, as is Red Barn Brewing Company in Blenheim. Both have live music events and I think Red Barn has trivia nights as well. Both are worth looking up on Instagram/FB for details. 

Sam’s Percolator is a wonderful cafe down town that has delicious treats and drinks. Taste is a new restaurant that’s also downtown and has done really well. I’m a foodie so I have a list of great places to eat 😂 just message if you need a recommendation 

There’s a new place called Smash’n’ Dash which is like a rage room where you can smash plates and beat furniture. I’m excited to try it 

There are lots of interesting boutiques around CK as well. We also have the Wednesday and Saturday flea market on Long Woods Rd. 

For trails, there’s Paxton’s Bush in Chatham. Search up Salvation Army church, you can park there and follow the trail along the fence to get there. There are other entry points but I don’t remember off the top of my head. Mitchell’s Bay has some trails, and it’s a nice shallow water beach.

"I just moved here and haven't gotten out much bc covid, no money after moving, and too busy from moving (thank you, 150+ year old house), but my plans for when that isn't the case is:

Turns n Tales bookstore and board game cafe ($5 to play all day).

Barnettis Arcade (pinball fun zone with adult only times and drink specials).

Van Zelst flea market is WILD- it's massive and you can spend hours looking around.

Maple City Wellness has flotation therapy and I'm so excited to be able to go. I've only been to flotation therapy once and it was one of the best naps I've ever had in my life.

Capitol Theatre has $5 movie showings or you can pay $40 for unlimited movies all year. The theatre is BEAUTIFUL, snacks are super cheap, and the staff are lovely.

Check out downtown. There are some really cute places. We got cookie cheesecake cones at Sweet C's Cookie Creations and they were divine.

Tecumseh park is cute. Not great weather, but nice for a stroll, throw some rocks in the river, smoke an herbal cigarette (preferably before the cheesecake cookie cone).

If you go to hibid (online auction website) you can find estate sales and other auctions in the area. Bid on something weird and travel to a new little area to pick up. We got an antique ice bucket and barometer for $5 and went to Ridgetown to pick up. Cool little road trip!

Go to the Moravian reserve and hit up the greenery boutique at Peter's Petro, if you're into smokable or edible relaxation. They have some great mushrooms if you're up for the trip, wink.

Walk along either Victoria Ave or King St W to check out some of the beautiful homes. Some incredible architecture on both streets.

Maple City Bakery. So good.

There are some art galleries downtown that have exhibitions at the moment. Haven't gotten to check them out personally but excited to do so at some point.

Satellite Diner invented (yes, not a myth) Hawaiian pizza. So even if just for the story, an interesting place to hit up.

"That sounds in the ballpark of what I've heard to have gas piping installed to a new location.

Just get an induction stove (not electric coil) instead. It heats faster, more gets to a more consistent temperature, and it's better for the environment. Plus, it's safer because instead of an exposed flame, the surface isn't even being heated (only the cooking vessel).

"Chatham offers two unique benefits to the local winter murder of crows you experience. 
Firstly Chatham has abundant and protective nightly roosting areas for the birds along the Thames River. 
This tree cover situated by the water “usually “ is somewhat of a micro climate in the winter. Just warm enough and not too cold to go further south on their migration. 
Secondly yes the farmland. During the day they migrate out of the city and feed in easily accessible fields whatever they can scavenge the noisy buggers.

"I took the test years ago.  I haven't lived in Chatham in awhile, but I think I remember most of it and they don't change the route very often.  I remember looking for a route back then and someone online described it exactly from years prior as well.

Back into the parking spot before you begin.  That way you can just signal and pull out, make sure to make all of your signals in parking lots just like you normally would driving.  We then went right out of the parking lot by the casino onto Keil drive (make sure to noticeably be checking all intersections of roads you're passing and checking your mirrors every so often).  Then you'll hang a right on the street before subway or right after subway, left on Orchard heights to riverview, left onto riverview back to the lights then left onto Keil again, make sure to switch lanes into the right land once you've made the turn and signal and check your mirrors and blinds spots properly. (Might've been a 3 point turn somewhere back at the end of one of these streets around Orchard heights/ riverview)

Then you'll head all the way down Keil all the way to Park Ave.  Left on Park Ave and on Park  make sure you adjust for the speed change from 60km/h to 50km/ that's part of the test. (right around/past St Pauls).  Next you'll hang a right down O'neil street just before Sobeys.  Then ahead to Tweedsmuir and a right on Tweedsmuir.  Then up and through that new subdivision I'm not really familiar with kinda near Chatham Christian, did my parallel park somewhere there.  Then ahead to a roundabout I think and right back onto Keil, then back to the drivetest centre and parked the car and finished.

To pass you mainly just need to avoid going over the speed limit, show that you're being aware of cars around you by checking the intersections that you pass and checking your mirrors, as well as your mirrors and blindspots on any lane change.  I just drove this route a bunch before my test and I passed with a couple marks off no problem.  There might be a three-point turn, but I can't remember where.  Oh and an uphill downhill test after the parallel park (where to point your wheels on a hill when parking, remember to engage your ebreak after putting it in park and disengage of course when told to resume driving).  Make sure for the three point turn you're signaling and move your head around checking all possible directions someone could be coming from.  Be hyperaware of pedestrians too, you don't want to make a left turn at an intersection even if you have all the time in the world if a pedestrian just entered the crosswalk.

Pretty sure the test used to have a highway component where they basically just check to see if you can merge properly speeding up to 100km/h before merging, but I don't believe they do that anymore.

Don't stress too much, if you've taken drivers training and kept up with all the habits they instilled in you you'll do fine.  I'd just make sure you have your parallel park and 3 point turn down properly, you can fail the parallel park and still pass especially if all of your head movement and signaling were correct during it.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  I found the old post that I found years ago and practiced and its very similar to the route the test took.  It even has a map ! Good luck.  Actually two differences is I didn't go right on Richmond to Bloomfield and back to Park, we just went straight to Park like I said and left off Keil onto Park.  Also went right down Tweedsmuir back up to Keil.  Did not loop around Indian Creek to Queen and then back to Park, but I did practice this route originally.  Indian creek you have to watch out for the 30km/h school zone around Mcgregor.  The route they took me on is shorter than this one, but couldn't hurt to practice.

You've been lied to about what is going on in Ottawa.

There is a huge need for rentals there. Tons of low-paying jobs and growers are desperate for workers, but there is also a need for skilled trades.

Kingsville sadly is getting a bit twee and housing is expensive, but it is a pretty town. Or you could try Wheatley which has NOTHING since the explosion, but houses are cheap, even waterfront houses, and it's a short commute to Leamington or possibly Chatham. It's growth is slower because the province hasn't extended the large-scale utilities to the area that greenhouse growers need, and you can still see the night sky.

We just retired to a house on Lake Erie in Wheatley and absolutely love it.

"We are definately going to disagree because you are not reading what I am saying. I literally said people who are anti mandate or anti vaccine are not the real issue, it's that associating with this trucker protest movement is problematic.

 There is a German saying that goes...if there is one nazi sitting at a table with 10 people, there are 11 Nazis. In a democratic society it is very dangerous to accept the ideologies that these organizers espouse. Look up Pat King and see for yourself. No one in Chatham is a foaming at the mouth nazi, but they are not removing these people from their cause, they are tolerating it and allowing these extremists to think their behaviour is okay and acceptable.  Look at downtown Ottawa at all the bullshit happening. The police doing nothing to stop the vandalism and threats to people of colour. It's disgraceful. It's not a peaceful protest at all. You say you're very left leaning- but I doubt it. You don't hold the values of someone who would be. 

Should there be consequences for your decision to not get vaccinated? Of course there should be. You realize these people complaining the most about lockdowns are causing more lockdowns by not getting the vaccine right? It's moronic. Sure I respect their right to disagree, but I can also think they are selfish for doing so.

I wouldn't be ok passing on covid to someone who might get seriously sick and die from it. It's about concern for the collective instead of the individual. It's what's wrong with this anti mandate bullshit.

"I'm not saying you don't have a right to move to Chatham,  I'm just saying that it's comical that so many are moving here and then surprised at how right-wing much of Chatham can be.  Look at our MPP, an antivaxer that came out publicly saying that creationism should be taught in schools on par with evolution. Chatham thumps a fuck ton of bible.

You say that I'm oversimplifying things, but in another comment you claimed that all of these people that are part of the protest are ""racist by association"", the movement clearly has leading members that are not part of any alt-right supremacist groups whatsoever, but according to you if these fringe groups also support the movement, then the entire movement must be fascist and racist by association?  Don't you see the irony there claiming I'm oversimplifying things when that's literally labelling the entire group for the actions of an overpublicized few?  There really aren't fascist nazis and white supremacists at every street corner frothing at the mouth like your ""woke"" ideologies would love to believe.  Sure they exist and they're disgusting human beings, but like I said people are being ideologically weaponized against each-other and I think this idea of fitting complex groups into the same box is downright idiotic and lacks real wisdom or understanding of humanity.

We're definitely going to disagree here, you think that fair consequences for not getting the vaccine include losing your job and livelihood and I think that's is a truly fascist attitude, get the vaccine or become homeless.  I'm not a huge fan of government ultimatums for citizens and there are many reasons people could choose not to get this vaccine regardless of how effective other vaccines that have been around and improved for the last half a century are.

How do you know these people from Chatham that were a part of this movement were white supremacists?  Did you go up to them and ask them their opinions and did they tell you outright that they were white supremacists? Or are you again just oversimplifying the matter and labelling the people of Chatham based on the white supremacists in Ottawa?  I know loads of educated, non-religious, secular agnostics and atheists from Chatham that trust science and doctors that are not racist and are upstanding members of the community, if you're having trouble finding ANY like you said, I'm pretty convinced you're looking for that which you hate and finding it at every turn.",t2_ei76cvhv,TreeWeiner,0,1643762128.0,0,t1_hv7k0d3,hv7k0d3,False,Meghanlomaniac,t3_sgr4n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/chathamkent/comments/sgr4n0/anyone_else/,Anyone else???,/r/chathamkent/comments/sgr4n0/anyone_else/hv7k0d3/,0,r/chathamkent,0,0
"I disagree with a lot of your points. They're incredibly oversimplified.

 First of all, while it may be true that the mass exodus for housing is raising the cost here, you can't blame millenials at this juncture for leaving Toronto. As someone who lives in BC, I'm sure you can understand that it's absolutely impossible (unless you have an incredible amount of wealth) to  become a homeowner. 🤷🏼‍♀️ If I didn't move to Chatham when I did, I'd have been forced to rent forever. Despite the fact that my husband and I make great money, it simply didnt matter. I hardly think that some people moving to Chatham are the cause, rather we are simply the effect of this incredibly fucked up housing market.

I actually don't have that much of an issue with people who don't want to get the vaccine (but if you want to bring up abortion, I think it's hypocritical that these same people screaming ""my body, my choice"" are also against abortion).

 I do think they should suffer the consequences of their choice (whether that means no access to crowded places or losing their job) and ultimately, I personally think it's incredibly selfish. We all got multiple vaccines as children. I really don't see the difference.🤷🏼‍♀️

I do take issue with the *extreme* right wing groups using the mandate to attract people to their cause, and those who chose to follow saying nothing when faced with the reality that the organizers are incredibly racist, white nationalist, and yes, fascist. I stand by that definition. 

But yeah I'm certainly willing to accept the area is more right wing, for sure it makes sense in a farming community. Never said I take issue with someone voting conservative. Simply that I'm finding it hard to find anyone in this city who believes in science and common sense.

"I'm extremely left leaning and have moved out of Chatham and live in BC now and I'm under 30.  I find it hilarious though the hordes of people moving from bigger cities to Chatham driving up the cost of housing and that are then surprised there is such a strong conservative presence in an area surrounded by corn as far as the eye can see LOL. Unfortunately you can't have your cake and eat it too lol.

Growing up in Chatham for 18 years, I never saw any fascism, white nationalism, or Nazi supporters.   I saw racism, lots of homophobia, and bigotry though.   I don't associate this movement  with Fascism and I think that association is totally ignorant and throwing around a common buzzword these days to try to censor anyone with a right leaning opposing viewpoint.  I'm vaccinated and have followed all mandates since day one and still have to at work here in BC, but I don't understand what is so hard to understand about people not wanting to be forced to get the vaccine or lose their employment especially surrounding trucking where you would come in minimal contact with the public as it is.

I just support people having the right to choose what to do with their own bodies, the exact same reason I support abortion.  I truly don't know how anyone could support abortion and be pro-choice for women, but then also want people to be forced to be vaccinated as well.  The mental gymnastics that takes is absolutely unbelievable to me.  The death toll is extremely low since 80% of our population decided to get vaccinated, at this point it's really only the unvaccinated that are ending up in ICUs (and putting increased pressure on the healthcare system and exposing how weak our health care system is and needs more funding not budget cuts thanks to Ford) still from covid and they have made their choice and will have to live or die with the consequences.  They should have the right to that choice however, and shouldn't take priority over people in hospitals who need immediate surgeries or care in my opinion.

I really think people need to go back to at least trying to understand opposing viewpoints, instead of just labelling people and dismissing their viewpoints.  Conservatives and liberals alike love nothing more these days than to label each-other and then disregard their viewpoints before even trying to understand them, because that label means more than trying to understand them.  The current political herd mentality on both sides is stronger than its ever been, and its very difficult to see a world where we could actually get decent change happening when people are so weaponized into continuing the polarization of people politically into one of two boxes.

It was a whole violence in the workplace situation, the folks here are so extreme. I wish you the best of luck finding more logical folk here.
Personally, I find there is an old adage with the Chatham community (not including the hamlets surrounding) for kicking and screaming to get their way. Quite a bit of entitlement here from my observation. I grew up in Blenheim, moved out West in 2009 when the recession hit. Lives there for 12 years, moved here over 2 years ago for family - the only benefit is being close to my family, but Chatham has a real drug and homeless problem nobody wants to deal with since we’re so close to the border. Not to mention the community has had 3 murders in the last 2 years. Chatham is basically a “Little Detroit”. The affordable housing and rental properties that once were abundant here are being bought up by the Torontonians and foreign investors.

"I appreciate your insight! And I agree Chatham is the Florida of Canada!!

I also agree with u/torontotoronto1 that if you keep your expectations in check that this is a lovely place to live - especially with the nature surrounding us. 

Your grievances for the city are founded, but with the perspective of staying at home (and making your space entertaining to do so), car trips for fun or shopping, beaches nearby, and the “new normal” creating potential for Work From Home (opportunities might have to be in new industries, see anti-work/big resignation: employers can’t expect status quo while forcing people to work less than a livable wage AND not give pandemic relief e.g. time to isolate when covid positive) 

I see this as a future hub for people leaving the expensive big cities and bringing their money with them. I agree Industry doesn’t yet exist but that the pace and price in this city is so refreshing coming to Chatham FROM the GTA whilst still having infrastructure (ie getting a plumber or electrician in an emergency vs an even tinier town). 

Also for “means to exist vs live” - again, coming FROM GTA people there are priced out of existing and therefore haven’t been able to pause to breath let alone have time or space they can enjoy to themselves. They might be living but it’s at the cost of traffic, commuting, dense population, outgrowing their home, can’t afford to move, no backyard, and basic existing becomes painful (vs “living” and “we don’t have fun experiences”)

It might be slow but I (wishfully?) think that Chatham will develop well and that even people under 30 can love it here. 

I do understand you’d probably want to have lived a life in a bigger city before “settling” to a small city like this (but damn, settling in my big city would’ve meant renting a tiny spot and not able to find a bigger one without denting my savings/down payment/emergency fund) and don’t regret it and actually recommend it to others with the “setting expectations” caveat.",t2_ke9y8o3,PochinkiPrincess,0,1641325696.0,0,t1_hr94zeu,hr94zeu,False,since-92,t3_rvnx7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/chathamkent/comments/rvnx7r/best_thing_about_living_in_chatham/,Best thing about living in Chatham?,/r/chathamkent/comments/rvnx7r/best_thing_about_living_in_chatham/hr94zeu/,7,r/chathamkent,0,7
"Yeah I disagree. I’m from KW, and also lived in Ottawa, and Mississauga.  

Chatham Proper has Gigabit Internet, warmer temperatures (often 2-5 degrees warmer than GTA/KW), less snow, waaaay less traffic, and most stores. Yes we are missing a mall - the one we “have” is pathetic, but the downtown area feels like a hipster revival waiting to happen - especially after the 3rd St Bridge is finished. If you’re missing any store from a proper mall is 1h away, either London, Windsor, or Detroit. 

We have an influx of people who need mental health/addictions support due to this being a city centre for surrounding towns, but shiiiii the people here are way nicer and I feel safer than Windsor, St. Thomas, and London (which all have their own issues). 

My main concern (haven’t lived here long) is the Thames River causing flooding - but that’s small compared to Tornados + in Windsor.

I’ll add that I’d been house shopping for KW and surrounding area for over a year before I started looking at Sault Ste Marie, Windsor, Leamington, St Thomas, and Amherstburg. In Chatham I have a beautiful 3 bd home, with a front and back yard, a deck, a garden, and a pool.

Firstly Chatham Kent is diverse.

Settlers of farmers from diverse backgrounds and regions French Canadians in the PainCourt and Tilbury area, not to be undone by the Dutch and Belgium’s and Swiss and Italians, Scottish etc,,,sorry if I left anyone out lol. 
Many shops in town run and purchased by Asians, and other ethnicity. 
Mostly Chatham Kent people hate to see just anything new. It’s so sleepy some people see new residents as threats to their income more than anything else. Violence or threats are possibly out there, however if it is there is no population or group mentality behind those words. 
It would likely just come from one lone person and most people would know who he or she is. 
There is strong sense of neighbourly protection in this area. However please reach out to your neighbours get to know them and they will have your back.

"I'm not sure coming from Guelph and the GTA area that the poster would consider that Chatham is ethnic. Sure it may consist of many Dutch or European origin people however I'm more inclined that the posters version of ethnic and therein the reference to racism refers to the non white population. Chatham is certainly very ""vanilla"" in diversity and ethnicity. There is definitely no Vietnamese or Chinese ""section"" to speak of as you correctly mention. Yes, a real estate agent can be helpful but the best advice is to walk the neighbourhoods morning, night and weekend of anywhere you might be inclined to buy.

"Prices continue to make new highs down here so affordability continues to decline as is the case across all of Ontario. Not sure what your budget is. You can have a new build in the Southwest of Chatham for $540 000 detached bungalow at 1400 sq ft or pay $670 000 on the North side for a higher grade of builder and bigger lots. Rentals for the new properties are horrendous at a minimum $2000 plus utilities to average of $2300. North of Park Street East to the river is a little more of a run down area with older homes without garages where it will definitely be a fixer upper and you likely wouldn't choose to start a young family there. It's definitely akin to downtown Hamilton. Homes abutting the railway tracks are also in this category. As for diversity, sorry it's not here. Lol, you will help add to it if you move here. Overwhelmingly white and in my opinion not overwhelming receptive to change however that's what keeps the city slow paced, slow growth and off the radar for many which is fine with me. You might think therefore the population may be racist however far from it. People are super friendly and more likely to be curious of you due to the succinct lack of diversity. There is more of a knock against city folk moving here driving prices up in real estate and unrealistic expectations of city standards than racism. There is limited ethnic choices of food with many of the ethnic restaurants definitely gearing their menus, food preparation to the taste of their 98% white clientele. ie Chinese restaurants serve hamburger and fries, chicken clubhouse and such along with the oh so authentic chicken balls and chop suey. In my opinion, if you are respectful, don't have the high standards of life and service expected in the city, adapt to a slow pace where you never have to worry about traffic or speed of getting anywhere, Chatham is a great city with almost everything you need. Missing a Costco, Metro, shopping mall and a bubble tea shop and ruefully for ourselves, a Vietnamese restaurant. All of which are 45 minutes away in Windsor. Living in Guelph, you probably like ourselves, who moved here in April having lived in Acton and Brampton, don't consider that a long drive. It's an unhindered drive even on the weekend and you can even avoid the highway if you so were inclined. I actually chose Blenheim just south of Chatham by 15 minutes to reside as it was even cheaper, even sleepier and even more friendly. You want diversification.... hah, my wife is probably one of less than fifteen individuals of Asian heritage. No worries though. We bought brand new and discovered the neighbours were Chinese too and their family is in Windsor with Vietnamese connections so we already have hooked up to do monthly Pho, Asian supermarket and casino trips. Up to you if you want to integrate or keep to your own ethnicity and do your own thing. We don't worry about fitting in but have no problem being welcomed and do fit in. If you have any other questions drop a line or swing down for a visit to Chatham to see it for yourself. We're a little older but certainly the wife and her friends would love to help anyone of Asian heritage get motivated for a move down here. The people, change in pace and emphasis on our friendships and relationships versus keeping up with the Jones's in Toronto reflect the correct decision relocating down to Chatham-Kent. Hell, I even bought my first truck in a long time. Now icing on the cake would be if you were moving down here to set up and run a Vietnamese restaurant.

Chatham is a good place to live and settle down in.  I would say we are an ethnic community. Most people can trace their roots to family settling in chatham.  There is a smaller Vietnamese community although spread out there is not one section.  The city is separated by the river. I’m partial to south side of the city living as it is slower pace.  North side is more commercial with newer homes and development. Make sure you get a good real estate agent in chatham area.

"My wife was sent to Chatham on a placement about 9 years ago at the hospital. I begrudgingly followed along (we weren’t married then) we lived in an apartment, I always thought we were going to move back to London or KW. I travel the country for sales so being away from an airport was a burden at times 

Over the span of the last 8 years, I’ve severely come to change my tune. We bought a house after we got married and live in a great neighborhood and got in at a spectacular price. We’re now actively looking at building a new home in the spring and are 6/10 steps down that road

Chatham has all the amenities that you need, people that tell you otherwise are lying or just trying to shit it on CK cause they don’t know. You’re close to the Detroit under normal circumstances if you’re a shopper or sports fan. You’re 45 (Windsor) and 60 mins (London) from regional airports and only 2:30 to Toronto if you really need too. We have all major shops if you’re needing brand names. But if you don’t there’s a spectacular Pizza joint (PieZanos), great Bakery (Maple City) awesome local grocery store that’s new and amazing (Mercato) having grown up in a grocery store family expectations are high and they meet it. One of the better butchers I’ve been too (Schinkles) great access to gyms. If you’re into higher level fitness (Peak Athletic) there’s 938 Tim Hortons if you need your fix. We also have a Starbucks if you want that approach. There’s local appliance, building, flooring etc. 

Additionally we’ve recently upgraded our trail system so there’s awesome places to walk and see the Thames or parts of Neighorhoods. Access to healthcare is fairly readily available and even though I have any children I hear that the schooling is quite good here and there’s many options. 

All in all, I call this home now with my wife and dogs and I’ve come to love it. If you’re planning on moving here next summer, I might just have a house for you to buy! Ha!

"Up until a few years ago it was worth moving to Chatham because of the price of housing. The area has really caught up to the higher priced places in Ontario over the last couple years. If you are active people and enjoy the outdoors, active transportation, etc. then Chatham-kent is probably about the worst place you can be. Fewest trees in Ontario, no trail systems.. Avg house price in Chatham in sept 2021 was $463,000. If you spend less than 350,000 in Chatham, expect to live in a fixer upper in a less desireable neighbourhood.

In Jan 2018 avg house price sold in Chatham was $175,000 where as in London it was $310,000 so the avg in London was 43.5% more than Chatham. Now, as of Sept 2021, he avg in London is only 22.3% more than Chatham.

People are super welcoming and friendly and pace of living is slower. Less fancy restaraunts, shopping and such will keep more dollars in your pocket for housing. Insurance down here is way cheaper too. Make some more sacrifices and u may come up with a bigger budget to buy the cheapest house in the best neighbourhood you can find.

I have noticed the drug intelligence unit is trying to clean things up; it seems like the situation is way out of their control.

"Here's coming from a person that lives in Wallaceburg:

1. Pretty poor. With the way Chatham-Kent is laid out, people typically come into Chatham from the smaller surrounding communities if they need to buy something that is not available there. Chatham and Wallaceburg are not very walkable towns, with a large distance between the residential and commercial areas, but the other small towns can be very walkable, like Dresden. Our bus system is pretty poor too, and I have been cut off and almost hit by some of our interurban and accessible busses on occasion. Essentially, if you want to live in Chatham-Kent, you'll want to buy a car.
2. Most of the more urban centers have no mall but have some strip mall type area. Chatham has a strip mall area up near their Walmart, and the same is located in and around the Walmart area in Wallaceburg. Chatham does have a small mall downtown, but nothing is really there anymore, and it is slated for some kind of renovation or re-do at some point as it has just got new owners. 
3. It depends on what you mean by 'vibe'. Downtown Chatham has become pretty gentrified as of late, with many new stores, and nice restraunts and it has a cohesive building theme that looks quite nice. Wallaceburg's downtown is pretty poor with little shops, and not very nice architecture, with most of our major shopping being done in chain stores that have moved up near the Walmart. Some of the smaller communities like Thamesville, Dresden, and Blenheim having very nice little downtowns, including a bakery, small shops, restaurants, stores, among other things, and most have a nice building style which I am a fan of.
4. If you want a community that is not Chatham, but still has amenities, Wallaceburg is your best bet as it is the largest population center in Chatham-Kent besides Chatham itself. From someone who has lived in Wallaceburg almost all of the 18 years of his life, it is not so bad. We have shops, nice people, more urban amenities, and in my opinion, Wallaceburgs issues are greatly overstated. There are some not-so-nice parts of Wallaceburg, but no parts that I would be particularly scared to walk down at night. Dresden is also a nice community, being near both Wallaceburg and Chatham, and is also starting to build a new subdivision there soon. Tilbury, Blenheim, and Thamesville are also nice, but much smaller and would likely not have the urban amenities you would be looking for. If I had to make a recommendation, however, I would say to stay out of Chatham, even if you are looking for a midsized city. In my opinion, Chatham is too busy and not nice enough to warrant how many people are there, and overall has little in the way of character that would make me want to move there.

If you are ever in the Wallaceburg area and want a tour of the 'burg or surrounding communities, or even just want to ask more questions, let me know, I'd be happy to let you pick my brain for all the knowledge I have about Chatham-Kent.",t2_i5wfpp1,Cjmcgiv,0,1624547391.0,0,t1_h2w57bt,h2w57bt,True,True_North242,t3_o6k9qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/chathamkent/comments/o6k9qv/researching_chathamkent_ontario_community/,Researching Chatham-Kent Ontario Community,/r/chathamkent/comments/o6k9qv/researching_chathamkent_ontario_community/h2w57bt/,1,r/chathamkent,0,1
"1. Buses 6:15am - 7:15pm routes, 7:15pm-12:10am Ondemand service. 
2. We don't really have a mall, we have a shopping area northwestern part of the city and a sizable stripmall along the river on Grand Ave. 
3. Its a smaller city, theres a bar and a nightclub and a strip joint downtown. Chatham isn't a young person city. 
4. Personally, Blenheim is nice, Ridgetown is a very pretty community but its a little further off and smaller than Blenheim. I havent been to Tilbury in ages, for some reason never really cared for it. 

Chatham is in a great location to better places, we're 1 hr away from Windsor and London, can be at a beach on Lake Erie or Lake St Clair in 20min. Its has some good food, low traffic and very basic amenities.

Lately has seen an uptick in homeless, crime, drugs. Not a bad place tbh, not amazing either. Not much hustle and bustle as you get in larger cities which is nice.

CK transit does go to the smaller communities but not as often throughout the day, so you’re also limited to that if you choose one of the smaller towns. 

But I also have to say, and I cannot stress this enough, stay clear of wallaceburg if at all possible. So much crime and drugs and theft in that town, I lived there for not even a month before moving back to Tilbury because I felt so unsafe there.  Chatham itself also has a fairly bad theft problem as well, as there are several areas within the city that are plagued with drugs... but there are also a few neighbourhoods within the city that are very nice, but that of course will cost significantly more to live in those particular neighbourhoods.",t2_9qwhzhwr,TiggyPiggylord,0,1624506754.0,0,t1_h2uk7vw,h2uk7vw,True,True_North242,t3_o6k9qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/chathamkent/comments/o6k9qv/researching_chathamkent_ontario_community/,Researching Chatham-Kent Ontario Community,/r/chathamkent/comments/o6k9qv/researching_chathamkent_ontario_community/h2uk7vw/,1,r/chathamkent,0,1

"1. Buses are the only transit available, and only run from 6:15am - 7:15pm. 
2. The mall is pretty much non-existent. There is only a handful of stores, mainly Dollarama and Hart. The last time I was there, there was only Subway still open in the food court. 
3. Downtown is slowly cleaning up, but as someone who has lived here all my life, I would avoid the area at nighttime. King St is slowly starting to fill up with Businesses, but there isnt much of a vibe at all, except for when times are normal and the cool events (Retrofest, Canada Day events) are happening. 
4. Ive only ever lived in Chatham, as opposed to the other smaller communities that makeup Chatham Kent, but they have even less amenities than Chatham proper.

"I cannot say enough about amber Pinsonneault from royal Lepage Peiffer. She also works with Kristen Nead who is very kind as well. 
Amber really helped us as first time home buyers in the area. She's kind, responsive, knowledgeable and she acts with great integrity. My partner and I are both lawyers so we place great value in competence and honesty. Amber went above and beyond to help us find the perfect house. She knows the market so we'll and made sure our offers stood out. We had ana offer accepted quickly because of that and received counter offers otherwise ie we were in the running, which is so important in this market. She made sure we were comfortable at every step. She is a broker so she has detailed knowledge of deals going through in Chatham and will give you a really accurate picture of what a reasonable offer will be. She doesn't push people past their limits either. I think she really understands that you will be her neighbour too after you move into your new house and she will treat you as such!!

They have an office in Blenheim and they are very knowledgeable about all of Chatham Kent. We even looked at places in Windsor. We wanted a heritage home and we got a really great one. So I'll add that amber really appreciates the special things people want and she's great at finding listings that really respond to your hopes and dreams.

"Peter Allaer if you’re looking in Chatham/wallaceburg and Blenheim. He is the most honest realtor I’ve worked with. He will tell you if there are issues with a house you’re looking at and what you can expect for repairs, he is amazingly thorough. 

There are not many newer properties for sale here, unless you’re willing to pay upwards of $400,000. This is a very old community, so the majority of the properties are going to be ones built 1950s- to early 1980s, meaning a lot of work and money will need to be invested to update them. Please be prepared, you will be surprised at how low the bar is here for a reasonable home, not to mention it’s a bidding war for these less-than-stellar (sometimes) properties. But if you hale from Toronto, then I imagine you will have no issue with cost.

"2 cases (I mean positive tests, which equate to infections, not cases - which involve a medical professional observing you for signs and symptoms). With the cycle thresholds used by testing labs in the PCR process, false positives are very high. The WHO sent out a directive on January 20th of this year stating exactly that. Further testing in Manitoba showed a false positive rate of 56% (the subjects were not infectious). Using that number, since we have not been diligent enough in Ontario to do our own follow up tests, CKHA has .88 infectious individuals. If they are not showing signs or symptoms, it has zero cases. But it sure made the headlines didn't it. Very convenient for continued house arrest.

"Legit difficulty? I don't know what that means.

If you mean that by having to wear a mask at all, some people have their health negatively affected to a debilitating point, then my stance is simple. Those people, the actual 0.001%, should not be mandated to wear a mask. That's cruel to those people to force a mask on them that will significantly worsen their health.

Now can we talk about the fact that there are a lot more than 0.001% of people out there protesting against and refusing to wear masks? They can't all have medical reasons as I described above, so I assume they are protesting their right to not wear one for other reasons. I have a strong feeling, informed by the evidence one collects by being able to read and see what's going on in the world around me, that the large majority of these people, like you, who are anti-mask are not actually in medical danger from wearing one. They are overstating the imminency and severity of their difficulties in wearing a mask, much like a child who gets lightly bumped into falls to the floor and wails in agony. They know the power of this. Even though it's plainly clear nothing is wrong to everyone else, the child is content to keep up the fantasy because it serves his narrative and allows it to be maintained even in the face of empirical evidence.

"Since the beginning of the pandemic we have instituted a number of policies in the interest of keeping both our customers and staff safe. At the beginning of this year we took a hard line stance in regards to adhering to our mask policy and even hired in a security guard to assist us in enforcing it. Upon doing this, compliancy increased dramatically, to the point where having a security guard became unnecessary. We put our trust in the community and largely that trust has been respected.
But unfortunately, it seems that there is a group that would like to test our resolve, and so we must reiterate that our policies remain in effect and will be enforced without exception. 
NO SHIRT, NO SHOES, NO MASK, NO IN-STORE SERVICE. 
For those who can not wear a mask, we are happy to offer curbside pickup or free local delivery.

"Hi. My wife and I have 2 kids, 8 and 5. We moved to Chatham from windsor in 2016. We like Chatham. A lot better than Windsor. It's safe here. We've never had any issues except for a stolen bike here and there. Violence is mostly domestic. No matter where you live it won't be perfect. Drugs can be an issue here but just stay out of the sketchy areas and you'll be fine. Every town has drugs. We have a nice casino here, which everyone here failed to mention. So the nightlife here isn't too bad. Ordering food passed 8 you can easily do with Boston Pizza, and numerous other restaurants and fast food chains. Not sure why the guy mentioned it here that you can't order food passed 8. Lol. For the most part Chatham has nice people. The quality of life here is very good. Schools are fantastic! Join the Early-On centre. I used to take my kids there and it is great! Such a fun place for the kids to learn and play and I honestly miss it. I cant go now since my kids are older. Kingston Park is beautiful. A great park and it is huge. It has a huge splash pad and other awesome activities for the kids. We have all the stores you need here. I find Chatham to be a calmer/relaxed city. You won't find it crazy busy like windsor or other bigger cities. We have a good hospital here. The population here is growing though. Chatham was recently ranked 27th in best cities in Canada. It was ranked over 100 just a few years ago but it has jumped up and improved. I think you'll love it here. If you have any questions let me know. Btw, I'm originally from Detroit, born and raised. Been a Canadian citizen for 6 years now. I'm Arabic myself and my wife is white.

We just moved into Chatham from a smaller hamlet and we love it. I am from the GTA originally and my husband is from Wallaceburg (steer clear of Wallaceburg). We moved to the south end of Chatham near Queen st and Indian Creek. We have a toddler and a baby on the way. We are so glad we moved to this neighborhood. There are many diverse families with younger children and all of the kids love playing outside and are very inclusive.  We can walk to the grocery store and there are lots of walking paths and playgrounds in the area. Daycare can get a little tricky in Chatham - there's a waiting list process through the municipality website and they recommend you sign up your child before their born. There are spots available but they may be across town. The elementary schools in the south end are quite reputable.

"Sure. Since the forced amalgamation in 98’, where Chatham made the smaller communities surrounding it a “Kent” to save itself from municipal bankruptcy, there are monopolies behind the scenes. A few examples:

1) The veterinary clinics are all owned and operated by the same owner, they’ve bought out every clinic spanning out as far as Dresden, meaning cost will be the same. 

2) The cost of living for regular residents has increased exponentially from slumlords and property management in renting apartments that are decrepit, yet ask for upwards of $1500. So much greed. You can argue that it’s happening everywhere, but it seems quite isolated. The owners and slumlords are aware that big city folk are moving here, respectfully. With the majority of them working from home and making such a high salary, the rentals and homes for purchase go to them first since they can pay cash with no conditions and accommodate those high prices

3) The police force can be questionable. With one officer being convicted of drug possession and trafficking on probation (caught in leamington at a traffic stop), yet not fired or given any jail time, just suspension with pay. Another one who was a first rank constable brought his firearm home to pistol whip and beat the shit out of his wife. When reported, he pleaded guilty and got NO suspension, just a demotion to fourth rank for a few months (these are available on the Chatham daily news website).

These are just a few of my observations over the last year and a half. You could argue that this could happen anywhere, which is fine, but I’m comparing to a living experience in another province. People say it’s great, they’ve been born and raised here, then of course.

Try to filter on those aspects. I feel like the centralized city of Chatham itself is a great start. If after 4-5 years you like another smaller community then make a move.

"Born and raised in Chatham. Do not live there anymore but a lot of family and friends still do.

Great place to raise a family. It’s a small town, but big enough where you can always meet new people. 

Safe, with little crime (some areas not so great like any other place) but generally speaking no major violent crimes.

Has all the big box stores , Best Buy, wal Mart, Home Depot etc. 

Lots of golf courses , sports for the kids, and good elementary / high schools.

As far as diversity goes , it’s a growing city and I’d have to image the diversity is expanding as well. 

The biggest con(s) would be jobs and night life.
If finding trendy bars and restaurants aren’t top of your list than your good.  No “downtown” type vibe in Chatham. 

If you can get a good job , then in my opinion, Chatham is a great place to live and raise a
Family. 

The smaller towns surrounding Chatham , Blenheim , wallaceburg (do not
Move to wallacburg ) etc.
If your moving this way might as well be in Chatham as your kids and yourself will have much more to do to stay busy and will be able to meet many more people.

"Hi there;

I would be cautious if you’re looking into living in chatham and not one of its hamlets (ie Blenheim, Tilbury, etc). Chatham specifically has had problems with racism in the past, as it has an older demographic. They really don’t seem to like Asian or Muslim folks, Chatham folk are very much entitled, white trash for the most part. 

I would look into Blenheim, Tilbury, Ridgetown. They are small, tight-knit communities. Everyone knows everyone, you have your basic amenities there, and if not, Chatham is only 20 minutes away from any of those towns. The schools in Blenheim specifically are peaceful and all within 1/2 a kilometre from each other (elementary/highschool, it’s very convenient).

Also, be mindful about the housing market here. You are not the only Torontonians coming here because of the allure of cheaper housing, but the houses are not new and it becomes a bidding war. If you have a budget of above $500,000, then you’re good. You should be able to find a recently built 3 bedroom house. But anything under the $250,000 range and you’re getting as-is, pre-70’s built houses to fix up and make projects with. Again, if you have the budget, then shoot for the stars.

Personally, I’m from Blenheim originally and moved out west during the recession and then back here right before COVID hit. There is a lot of corruption in this municipality, along with crime with addicts/theft (I know, it’s everywhere, but there is a lot within a smaller population here). I don’t recommend living here, we’re moving back out West in December. I’m not sure what you’re expectations and/or living conditions are, but it would be best to have no expectations here, that way you won’t be disappointed. 

One last thing, be careful about saying you’re from Toronto, the Chatham folk have been pretty vocal about “F*># those Toronto people buying up all the housing”. I would recommend joining the Chatham buy and sell, or the rant and rave on Facebook. You’ll get a pretty good idea about the quality of people (or lack thereof) you’ll be interacting with. 

I’m sorry if this is discouraging, but I want to be as realistic and honest with you. If you have any questions, you can DM me. I wish you and the fam the best of luck! 👍👍",t2_2dflx56y,SpideyManning23,0,1619119808.0,0,t1_gvhbhpg,gvhbhpg,True,Flimsy-Ad6080,t3_mw9z8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/chathamkent/comments/mw9z8r/insight_into_living_in_chatham_kent/,Insight into living in Chatham Kent,/r/chathamkent/comments/mw9z8r/insight_into_living_in_chatham_kent/gvhbhpg/,4,r/chathamkent,0,4

"It's a classic case of supply and demand. There are very few listings so competition is fierce. Many homes being sold with no conditions and being purchased with 100% cash by buyers from other markets.  It's nigh impossible for new buyers to get into the market right now, and those looking to sell are faced with very few local buying options. But to answer your question yes, everything is selling for over asking price right now, bidding wars have become the norm.

"Good luck. Chatham’s housing market and cost of living used to be very affordable. But now, we have the Torontonians out-buying the community with cash, no conditions and of course, over asking. 

I wouldn’t suggest buying at this time due to the market being severely over-inflated. Even renting here has become absolutely ridiculous. You’re going to end up impulse buying a house that is not worth it, continuously looking for potential, sinking more money into it.

One house she planned to put a bid on was at $190k or something but the owner refused to allow for any inspections on the home so she withdrew but her agent told her the house ended up selling for $270k,t2_jobhq,marshmallowcritter,0,1617211962.0,0,t1_gsxqflq,gsxqflq,True,Prudent_Poem4929,t3_mhaxhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/chathamkent/comments/mhaxhk/house_offerings/,House offerings?,/r/chathamkent/comments/mhaxhk/house_offerings/gsxqflq/,10,r/chathamkent,0,10

"I have several addresses set up in my Amazon account one rural mailbox and it’s 50/50 if it’s by a carrier or Canada Post (CP) at this address it’s usually dependant on the size of the package.
