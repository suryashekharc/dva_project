"Appreciate the feedback!  

I am wanting to switch from cable to fixed-wireless for a few reasons:
1. Spectrum has raised their monthly charge by greater than 50% since I signed up and switching would save $20+/mo. 

2. I want to help drive the growth of competition in the ISP space (vote with my $).  Up until recently cable basically had a monopoly at my address.

3. I want to help drive the growth, evolution, and optimization of the technology (hardware, software, services) underpinning these new offerings.

4. I probably don’t need 200+mbps downloads, 10+mbps uploads, and a fast ping (<10ms).  My days of console / PC gaming are over, and now I only need enough to stream HD and video conference.

"Wireless, especially cellular, is subject to interference, congestion, over-subscription, arbitrary throttling, “network management”, “deprioritization”, and crippled hardware.

I wouldn’t deliberately choose wireless over coax unless there was a massive price incentive, and even then, if I was concerned with volume, caps, and speed, I’d think twice.   Wireless is a great complement to wired service, but not an equal.

Sad to hear of Wander’s demise, I tired of waiting for coverage; based on previous rooftop startup failures I was wary that they wouldn’t make it.   Too bad, I was always hoping we’d get our own MonkeyBrains, but I guess we don’t have the density and enthusiasm to get there.

"If the Plantiff’s win, our city leadership will lose its diversity. Right now, we have 4 Latinos (Davis, Parra, de la Torre and Nagrete) and one African American. It is also highly likely that Oscar de la Torre, the man whose personal grievances this lawsuit is based on, will not be able to retain his seat in a Latino district.

You will see other lawsuits that challenge the way Tricia Crane designed the districts. Her map does nothing to rectify past inequalities.

Economically it will cost the city roughly $55M. It will be the end of the services that Residents demand and could easily lead to actions like the outsourcing of the Fire Dept to the County.

"California isn't great without a car- doable but not that easy to explore all of the great places it has to offer.

You can easily get by for the time being.  Where is work going to be for you?  

The metro gets you downtown very easily and the bus is easy and pretty quick if going east/west etc.

Santa Monica is very easy to get around all parts of town on a bike or walk.  I often don't get in my car on the weekends unless leaving town.

Like most cities, it is not that expensive to live in outside of rent.  As someone mentioned, sales tax is high here but there are many restaurants, grocery stores etc that make it easy to find affordable options.  

Not sure where you are coming from but here you don't need a big place to live because its almost always nice outdoors so you won't be locked down because its cold, raining or crappy.

The further you are from the beach the more mellow it gets.  I prefer Northern Santa Monica because it is more mellow in the summer months.

"With $100,000 you can most certainly do that. And you won’t have to live in the homeless infested parts either. May just have to adjust your spending a bit. Probably can’t lease a luxury car, have a big apartment, go out every night, and pay loans. But you can certainly find a small one bedroom for around $2100 or a studio for 15-1800. 

My last 1 bedroom there was $1800 but was in a more crime ridden location of SM. I’ve also lived in $1100/mo studios on the nice north/west side of town.

Edit: just did a quick search on Apartments.com out of curiosity of what prices are like now.

"I was helping a friend find an apartment in SaMo about 8 years ago. At that time, a studio apartment in a nice part of town went for about 1250/month. I can only imagine it’s gone up since then. 

Santa Monica is notoriously expensive and you typically don’t want to end up in the more run down parts of town because there is quite a lot of homeless issues in those areas. 

If you want to live on the West Side, I’d also check out some of the more adjacent areas like Mar Vista or Palms where your money might go a little further and you can still take advantage of the weather and closeness to the beach. 

My friend ended up finding a studio guest house in Mar Vista he was happy with. Once you start looking in the area you’ll find it pays to broaden your search a little and be open to less expensive alternatives, because on its face, Santa Monica rent will seem super pricey for what you’re looking for.",t2_6z5dv,Lixard52,0,1647957769.0,0,t1_i1nucyz,i1nucyz,True,rachelkatz,t3_tk3dyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaMonica/comments/tk3dyg/is_a_100k_salary_in_santa_monica_practical/,Is a 100k salary in Santa Monica practical?,/r/SantaMonica/comments/tk3dyg/is_a_100k_salary_in_santa_monica_practical/i1nucyz/,13,r/SantaMonica,0,13

"Your car was parked pretty far from the main roads so based on this I wouldn't be surprised if the person who hit your car either lives within a few blocks of you or has to park for work nearby. Also, the fact that the accident happened in the morning and they're heading away from the main road into the neighborhood gives the impression that the person who hit your car either did so on their way home from a late-night shift or to work in the area.

Given this is the case, I took a look at Google Maps near the area of the accident and noted the cars matching the description you gave here: [https://imgur.com/a/BVHrpF6](https://imgur.com/a/BVHrpF6). I didn't go down every side street, so you may want to look further. Thankfully, the map was updated in Feb 2022 so it's still recent. From there, you can do a process of elimination to see if these vehicles are still parked near where they are in the Google Maps image. I'd start with the white trucks/vans that have parking spots since they should still be in the same place. If they're still there, you can rule them out.

Given the residential nature of the area and being away from the main roads, if any of these cars cannot be found after a while, it's possible one of them may be the one who hit you. Of course, only one of them did so you'll just have to be mindful until you're more certain. I did want to note that the closest vehicle that matches your description parks very close to that corner where you were hit in a designated handicap parking area (just make a left turn from your photo).

">In what world is Santa Monica supposed to be an “affordable place”?

This world. Through the 80s Santa Monica had plenty of middle class people. Who do you think was living in all the apartments south of Santa Monica, and around SMC 25, 40, 60 years ago? There was a mobile home park somewhere tucked in off of Pico, but they were forced out, evicted. Ocean Park, around 14th, used to be lined with adorable courtyard apartments. In the late 90s I had a friend who lived in one, $650. 1BR, original hardwood floors. That's what I paid around Pico/Robertson. DTSM was a dump. There was a Pussycat Theatre on 2nd. Another friend, a poor student, lived on the beach in a place that's now a hotel for a few hundred a month. There was a Greyhound station on 5th and Broadway. Palisades Park was in state of total disrepair and all the stairs were closed. Before Nordstrom there was Sears. There was gang activity around Pico

People shouldn't have to travel 1.5 hours by bus to serve froyo to tourists or clean rich people's homes. Those people spend money here. They keep business here open. People who work here are part of this community and deserves to live here as much as anyone else.

"No, I disagree with your premise. Santa Monica rent control only applies to buildings built prior to 1979. I don’t think people with heaps of money are living in these, at any rate not by my observation. Buildings built after that (roughly between 1980-2018 or so) are at market rates which brings us to the ones going up now. These big new modern ones have a mandated low-income percentage of units, with the balance going for market rates. So between one system and another, it’s possible for a full spectrum of income levels to actually live together in Santa Monica. If you meddle with what’s keeping the older population, and the lower-income workers, secure in their units, it stops being a full spectrum community. Even Beverly Hills has affordable units in the flats. That’s important for a community. 

What happens when you don’t have rent control is something like Malibu - where they can’t keep a school superintendent because they can’t afford to live in the community.",t2_1d35k1jz,timelesschild,0,1646971470.0,0,t1_i077g4o,i077g4o,True,SpaceSox,t3_tbb9gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaMonica/comments/tbb9gl/should_rent_control_rent_amounts_be_indexed_to/,Should rent control rent amounts be indexed to income?,/r/SantaMonica/comments/tbb9gl/should_rent_control_rent_amounts_be_indexed_to/i077g4o/,6,r/SantaMonica,0,6

Also, NYC has its own problem with NIMBYs, and Manhattan has actually LOST a lot of population since it stopped building so much multifamily housing in favor of commercial and office space. Population was Almost 2.3 million the 1910s and 1920s, but has dropped to 1.6 million today.

"There is also non-metered street parking on the side streets as soon as you get north of Montana Avenue- gets very residential just a block or 2 north. As an FYI - from Montana Ave area up to san Vicente and 26th is actually about 5 miles round trip - and there's only 1 light at 7th st. if you cross 26th you can continue up to Bundy- then loop the Brentwood country club which returns you to San Vicente east of 26th Street and would add another 3-4 miles.  Good thing about this run is that means only a couple stop lights to contend with - just about the best you can find other than running on the beach path. There are also a couple water fountains in the grass median on San Vicente by 14th and 22nd streets just as an FYI.

You'll probably want to stick to running on the asphalt vs the grass median on San Vicente  initially until you can do it in daylight because there are tree roots to contend with.

"Not a runner, more of a cyclist, and used to live right off the beach in Santa Monica.

My two cents, stick to San Vicente in the early morning. The beach path is really dark and there are often sketchy characters wandering around in the dawn hours.

"The key to visiting the LA area, especially if you don’t have many connections out here or are unfamiliar with the city, is to generally stay in the same area. Traffic is no joke. If you do plan to venture out of the area you’re staying in (and don’t have a local buddy with you), plan on spending your entire day in that area. That being said…

- go to the downtown SaMo farmers market on Wednesday (more vendors) or Saturday morning. Probably the best farmers market in the country. Pick up some seasonal fruits, hike the temescal canyon trail, and on your way back jump in the water at will Roger’s beach. 

- walk or bike the bike patch (the strand) between SaMo and Venice. Plenty of stuff to do/observe all along that route, including the pier. 

- go to Sawtelle (by ucla) for some great Asian food. Not in SaMo, but still on this side of the highway. About 15 min from downtown SaMo. 

- spend a few days just living the life here. SaMo is a nice place to walk around with plenty of good coffee. Rent a bike (or just buy a cheap fixie off fbook marketplace) and enjoy the neighborhood. 

- plan a day trip to Malibu (not far but you need to take a car). Try matador beach, maybe grab some food at Malibu seafood on your way back. 

- plenty of bars on Main St, around downtown, and even more in Venice. 

In regards to what I said at the beginning of my post, I think you should definitely try to venture out of Santa Monica to see downtown, Hollywood, West Hollywood, Silverlake, Griffith park, etc., especially if you want to get some good food. However, I think you’ll be a lot happier and less stressed if you space those adventures out with a day or two of more local activities.

Not to mention the negative knock on effects for nearby parks and open spaces - namely Tongva Park which is used by children since it’s got a play area and close proximity to the new SM Lab School. Kids worry of waking up sleeping residents in the park and there’s been increasing hazards like broken glass, refuse, and broken toilets. Enforcement is minimal or non existent with the disproportionate number of resources directed to the un-permitted vendor enforcement at the pier and surface parking lot.

">I think a solid argument against this is that the same money could help many more people elsewhere.

I think there are two issues with this.  One is that state laws lean heavily on incentives to accomplish housing goals. The development of affordable housing (or, as is more often the case, market rate housing with X number of affordable, very affordable, etc. units) is incentivized in a lot of ways, including, as someone pointed out elsewhere in this thread, reimbursements. The City doesn't get those for selling an old garage or even the lot that it's on.

The second (related) issue is that land acquisition is always going to be the largest associated cost here. If the City flips the lot, it's not going to be able to acquire an equivalent property elsewhere. That's the case in a lot of places in California, but it's especially true in an area as small and close to the coast as Santa Monica.

It's obviously a really tricky issue, and I can understand the ""why does it have to be by the coast"" argument because I think far too many people refuse to acknowledge that the weather makes southern California one of the best places in the world to live outside. Ultimately, though, I think the ""ship them elsewhere"" crew (not saying you are one) needs to acknowledge that coastal communities haven't pulled their weight on housing in a long time.

">seems to be a much better use of capital than building an affordable housing apartment in what is literally some of the most expensive real estate in the entire country.

Why is the expectation that some of the most expensive real estate in the country should be in private hands? If it's a question of housing more people, why shouldn't the city own and operate a larger building? We've seen what private greed has done to Santa Monica - half the shops on the promenade are empty. Barnes and Noble has been empty for what, seven years? All because the landlords wouldn't offer a reasonable rent. Not only should the City not give over a single square inch to any private owner, it should be doing everything it can to get its land back.

>If the goal is truly to help as many people as possible, there are better smarter ways of doing so.

If that's the goal, the housing projects need to be bigger. Period.

"How old are you? North of Montana has lots of boutiques and restaurants but the population is older, established families and wealthy new families. Very walkable. 

Main St is slightly funkier than Montana (for Santa Monica) with slightly less wealthy families than above. I'd say it more casual, too. Ocean Park intersects Main and  they're pretty similar, at least west of Lincoln. Living near Main St can also be very walkable.

DTSM has *everything*, including homeless people and tourists. I've lived here 15 years and love the convenience; I can truly walk to almost anything I need. (RIP Michael's 😭) It's *not* cool or trendy. Those racing assholes aside, I like the rhythm of the city. It's not a place to move if you like quiet. Yes, there are a ton of homeless people. And yes people have stories. In all this time I've never been bothered or harassed by a homeless person. Santa Monica is home of the homeless and people have *opinions*. Do your own research, check crime stats, etc. Homeless are everywhere in LA, some places are better, some worse. Oh, and thanks to the tourists, DTSM is basically spotless. 

Santa Monica isn't much of a late night town but mid-city seems pretty empty at night. It's where all the hospitals are, lots of doctor's offices, more of a business district. 

If you tell us where in NY you lived, (or where you wished you lived) maybe some transplants can point you to similar areas. 

Like someone else said, avoid Lincoln. It's loud and there will be more agita with homeless people.

Basically, the further south you go the funkier and very slightly less expensive it will get to Rose Ave and the Venice border.

In this case it is the bad kind of discrimination. Although I think your case for good discrimination is weak. Can you elaborate on more cases of “good” discrimination? I think it’s a fine line to walk and really kind of petty. Good discernment is a thing for sure. But to discrimination against a paying customer for anything other than them not having the funding to pay for the bill is bad business and will lead directly to oppression. Now if a crazy person covered in dog shit is at the door and you have a button to lock them out that is good discernment.

"Last year, I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott on Colorado and it was nice, but its not cheap and its directly across the street from the bus depot so you get TONS of homeless/drugged out people right there, 24/7.

"As far as I'm aware, the change in rules happened on the county level and applies only to venues where patrons or shoppers are screened for vaccination/testing status upon entry. There was no blanket removal of the masking policy.

However, Santa Monica has its own emergency orders in place. Perhaps someone else knows where that currently stands and if there are plans in the immediate future to alter it.

Either way, does wearing a flimsy cloth really matter that much? Whenever I leave the house, I shove two disposable surgical masks into my pocket and put them on my face when I enter a business. If the rules change where it's not necessary, and if it's clear the employees are all aware of that, then I'll leave the surgical masks in my pocket. If the rules change and the employees aren't aware of it, then I'll put the two strings around my ears and let the weightless fabric rest on my nose and mouth.

"IMHO - Home owners clutch their home values like pearls, in fear of the value being impacted by ""more renters, more traffic, etc"".  

Long term renters (Fact: 58% of people rent in SM) and owners have experience seeing the city  and builders make ""under the table or squeak it by"" deals to get apartments or malls or things built without public comment or review (height, size, etc). This absolutely irritates the crap out of people who have been around a long time and know how Santa Monica works. Many people rent for their whole lives due to income and watch giant houses replace aging craftsman homes next door and they can't do anything about it. But, an apartment is going in at Gelsons? Time to rally the troops and write the letters and show up at meetings. 

Then there are suspicions about practicalities in planning. When apartments are built as studios and 1 bedrooms (often), families with  children will not benefit from the new housing stock whether it is affordable or not.  And...once the affordable apartments are snapped up from a very long list, the cook on Main street (Example only) isn't going to be able to afford to live in any of the apartments within a few miles of their work anyway. And...there are suspicions that newly built apartments are not filled already, so has the city or the builders incorrectly estimated the need for new housing at this time.   So the NIMBY has multiple factors going on around these sun filled streets.

"One thing that happens with rent control is that you get people who want the status quo for reasons like not wanting increased competition for street parking. This is probably inherent to a strong rent control program. But the other thing that happens is I think something that's not inherent to having a strong rent control program but rather something you get when when it intersects with the extreme NIMBY dominance of housing policy Santa Monica: because of the NIMBYism, you can't replace a SFH with an apartment building, and you probably can't even replace an empty parking lot with an apartment building. The only sites on which you can build an apartment building are those already zoned for an apartment building, and most of those sites already have an apartment building on them, so the NIMBY policy artificially creates a zero-sum game where it's impossible to build any new apartment buildings without tearing down an existing apartment building, which in Santa Monica is extremely likely to mean tearing down a rent controlled apartment building.",t2_4dmtf,Eurynom0s,0,1646012252.0,0,t1_hypzupi,hypzupi,False,Biasedsm,t3_t2sfv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaMonica/comments/t2sfv7/why_do_long_term_renters_fear_new_development/,Why do long term renters fear new development?,/r/SantaMonica/comments/t2sfv7/why_do_long_term_renters_fear_new_development/hypzupi/,3,r/SantaMonica,0,3

"Well said.  There is plenty of housing in other cities that is affordable.  Nobody has a right to live by the ocean, in the center of a major city like NYC etc.  Its a luxury that you need to decide if it is worth it.

So traffic has done nothing but increase despite the metro and poorly thought out bike lanes.

"No one lives on campus because it is a community college, and the overwhelming vast majority of students do not live in Santa Monica at all.

When I was last a student there - though keep in mind this was years ago and before the pandemic, so I don't know if they still do this - SMC students could ride the Big Blue Bus for free. The Big Blue Bus is a city busline centered around Santa Monica, but branches out into other cities/neighborhoods. When you are looking at options for housing, check how accessible they are specifically to Big Blue Bus lines (complete list of routes and schedules [here](https://www.bigbluebus.com/Routes-And-Schedules/)). If you can easily walk from a house to a Big Blue Bus line, then while it may take up a lot of time, your commute to SMC will essentially be free. I had classmates who commuted several hours to get to campus from pretty deep into the city. (When possible, they usually tried to pick/schedule classes such that they only had to come to campus a couple days a week. Not always possible - arguably rarely possible - but certainly worth trying.)

Don't fixate too much on the exact numbers/prices, as those are averages and there is a lot of variation and options.

"Expect a contentious (well, more than usual!) council meeting tomorrow, lots of inflammatory stuff on the agenda:

\- 7A: Criminalization of street vendors around the pier.

\- 8A: Vote to investigate a Brown Act violation **that we know happened**. Nothing says ""government transparency"" more than obstructing an investigation into a body the members sit on. If you have an hour, I highly recommend giving the [previous discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKtJtJwQxUg&t=29464s&ab_channel=CityofSantaMonica) of this measure a listen and to come to your own conclusions about who done it.

\- 13G: A couple of landlords voting out a pro-housing commissioner, who never found it prudent to recuse themselves when voting on land use / tenant items.

"Needs five votes on Tuesday. Let’s see: Brock, De La Torre, Parra, and probably Himmelrich and no from Gleam and Kristin. Swing vote Negrete. The commissioners term ends in June. Quite a chilling precedent to remove a commissioner absent any actual wrongdoing besides advocating for housing and whose objectives are aligned with the state and helping to solve the housing crisis. Plainly it’s retaliation for the housing element rejection by the state but it was that same element voted on by the Council knowing it’s non conformance, same as 2014, and trying to wage war against Sacramento’s RHNA numbers. Also the city never formally adopted rules against having lobbyists on boards and commissions, and again likely some dispute whether Ms. Camner is a lobbyist or not. This is all part of the change slate’s playbook to see that commissioners not seeing eye to eye with the new council members are removed or potentially coerced to resign. This debate actually surfaced mid 2021 and led to council asking staff to come back with a draft ordinance to exclude registered lobbyists but wasn’t ever adopted. Maybe it had something to do with them continuing council appointments every meeting from June to September, they couldn’t get anyone to apply to vacancies or a assemble a full council meeting.",t2_dwich5aj,No-Year9730,0,1645395709.0,0,t1_hxraz6n,hxraz6n,True,VelourBro,t3_sxbtbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaMonica/comments/sxbtbz/leonora_camner_kicked_off_housing_commission_for/,Leonora Camner kicked off housing commission for no apparent reason,/r/SantaMonica/comments/sxbtbz/leonora_camner_kicked_off_housing_commission_for/hxraz6n/,13,r/SantaMonica,0,13

The beach is still a novelty for me that I consider a luxury that I highly value for many reasons - from outdoor exercise to social aspects, dining, etc. I also don’t really care about tourists or congestion since that’s what I’m used to coming from where I came from.

"I’ve lived in basically both those locations before. I far preferred the location further from the beach.

">  morning walks along the ocean ave park/strip with the ocean breeze sounds nice. 

Yeah, I won't lie. This is very nice. It's a fantastic experience. If you can find anything a bit farther north than what you've mentioned in this post, it would be perfect. As it is, I would definitely not choose to live in the area just south of Wilshire and west of Lincoln-ish. Just not worth it for the nice Ocean Ave. walk.

> Also, as someone who currently commutes an hour each way, the prospect of a 9 minute walk to work with my friend sounds really nice and is a bigger factor than the beach.

Preach x 100000! I used to commute 70-75 miles per day, 2 hr+ driving total (round trip). It was **NOT** fun. Got a lot of audiobooks in, but it took a tremendous toll on my well being. Anyway, just saying I sympathize.

> For my pup, I don't need to take him to a park per se but on Google maps there doesn't seem to be any grass patches or anything on the surrounding streets/sidewalks

Yeah, it'd be hard to find a patch of grass directly outside the door of your building. I don't have a dog anymore, but it would be a pain in the ass to find somewhere for him to go poop in that situation. Another con for living in that DTSM area.

"Lifelong Santa Monica resident here. I would take the place farther away, absolutely no question. In fact, I would need a little bit of convincing to take something — even a fairly nice place — in the area you’ve described. Being able to walk in a short time to the beach is not worth the congestion, tourists, noise pollution, and restrictions in space/parking that you have to deal with to live there. I promise: unless you are a diehard beach bum or surfer of some kind, it’s not going to matter *that* much to you to be a 15 minute walk vs. a 30 minute bike ride from the beach. 

Either way, even if you were to end up living in the closer place, you’re not going to walk your dog down to the sand all that often. It’s actually a bit of a schlep to cross over PCH and head down to the sand and can take anywhere from 15-25 minutes, depending on where you’re coming from. My grandparents still have their apartment on 3rd St. just north of Wilshire, and we used to do this constantly growing up. It was never a “let’s just take a walk” thing and always a “OK everyone let’s plan the day to walk down there.”

Bottom line: the comfort and relative peace that you’ll get living a bit farther east is very much worth sacrificing that shorter walk to the ocean. It’s better to regret that you don’t live closer than to regret that your life sucks from all the chaos of a busy area. At least the former gives you something to look forward to (moving closer) and doesn’t make you hate your life at the moment.

"I spent much time in Santa Monica, both near the beach and further inland.

Honestly it all depends on the type of lifestyle you want.

If you're the type that likes to go out to bars/restaurants and meet new people all the time, I'd stay closer to the beach. I used to work on Ocean Ave and Arizona and I'd literally just walk down to the beach every day during the summer. You literally have everything within walking distance (shops, restaurants, bars, movie theaters, live theater) right there. If I wanted something more quiet and less touristy I'd walk over to Montana Ave. It does become a bit unbearable during the summer weekends though.

I also worked and lived in the Pico neighborhood on Olympic and 18th. Hella chill, pretty much only locals, less dining options but they're still there. Everything around that area shuts down after 8 pm though (exept the art centers but only if they have shows) because it's mostly a business/commercial area. Santa Monica College, Crossroads and UCLA extension are right there so it gets very hectic during the school year, but other than that it's pretty much like a chill small town.

Me personally I'd go for closer to the beach since if you're gonna live in Santa Monica you might as well get the whole Santa Monica experience (beach and tourists). Further inland and you might as well live anywhere else in LA and it would be the same experience.

"Definitely I’d take the place at 25th and Santa Monica. Yes you’d be closer the the beach at 4th, but your walks would be along major tourist/shopping mall crowds/unhoused individuals. There’s not really a close clear path down to the beach there unless you walked to the pier (and again through major crowds most of the time). Since you are wanting to meet people, I’d take the one with the mini dog park in the middle. That’s where most dog owners meet each other and it’s always good to let your dog have multiple easy outings. You also have a nice (on-leash) park at 25th and Broadway, some nice neighborhoods above 26th, the Water Garden etc for walks.

It’s a tough call. Not sure you’d meet a lot of locals down near 4th since it’s tourist central.

"I used to live on 7th/Santa Monica and I was an absolute nightmare. It’s very loud and congested because you are right in the middle of downtown where all tourists flock to. It’s a huge pain trying to get in and out of the neighborhood because of the congestion as well. If you’re someone that likes to host friends they will have trouble finding convenient/free parking in that area as well which will discourage them from coming over. I live farther inland now (~20th) and it’s much nicer. The neighborhoods are much more walkable and quiet and less congested with out of town traffic. In the case that you do want to go to the beach it’s an easy bike or quick drive. 

Personally, I’d look for something North of Wiltshire instead of right off Santa Monica but the apartments are a bit older so you’re not going to find as many amenities. Since Santa Monica is a major boulevard most emergency vehicles use it and it can be a bit noisy at night if you’re a light sleeper.

LA is more affordable than Santa Monica. Find a reasonable place in Hollywood to be close to the industry. But be smart, because Hollywood is full of creeps. It's also a lot of fun, but that can be overwhelming. It was for me sometimes.

If you can afford Santa Monica, Pico neighborhood is the best bet since it's close to SMC.

"To add to the neighborhood recommendations- West LA is also pretty affordable and great. Plenty of rent controlled buildings as well with 2 bedrooms around $2500. Lots of off street parking with units too. 

Basically, look outside of Santa Monica city limits because it will likely be cheaper and if you have your car then you can live further way and drive in or take a bus. The SM city bus lines run through these adjacent neighborhoods and go to SM college! 

In terms of finding a roommate… you will probably want to track down the SM College Facebook pages or message boards. Im sure they have resources!


Agreed on waiting tables for work. Another option would be looking into something like remote customer service jobs. Like being a call center service rep. Most require low experience, pay decent, and provide the technology. It should allow you to work odd hours around your classes as well. 

I would recommend getting some sort of job now while in HS to get your resume going. Maybe waiting tables at a restaurant or working retail in a store. I know they don’t seem like much, but I worked retail and it was pivotal in me getting my first jobs during and after college. They show customer service skills, professionalism, an ability to multitask in stressful settings.

As far as jobs go: waitering at nicer, hip restaurants always pays well - there’s plenty on Abbott Kinney in Venice and on Montana Ave in SM. Since you do photography you could also consider doing wedding photography as long as that didn’t become overwhelming/take the place of your schooling.

Even Phil Brock is supporting tearing it down and providing good additional arguments for doing so--according to him the way the seismic retrofitting would need to be done, the interior walls would need to be expanded outward about a foot, making for some extremely narrow turns going between levels in the structure.

"With the states rejection of Santa Monica’s housing element, it is now highly unlikely that the city can come into compliance with state laws before  Builders Rights apply. This changes the value of the land the parking structure is on so we should encourage the city to sell it.

I suspect that piece of land will be worth over $175MM to a builder. The city could use the profit to buy other properties in the city.

The best use of those funds would then be to buy and then build in the R1 districts. The city could build 10 story buildings where you could easily have 40 units. If some of those are high end condo’s, the city could make make a profit in the millions, which would make it easy to buy more land…..the process could keep repeating itself!
