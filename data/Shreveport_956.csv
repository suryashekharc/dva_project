"No one has pivoted. We just assume people are smart enough to skip the obvious concept that poor neighborhoods are full of poor people and skip straight to the why. 

The argument that poor neighborhoods are poor because the people in them are poor is not a novel concept or a smart observation.

The reason money is an issue for many people, especially a city with 54% black residents in the former capitol of the Confederacy, a bastion of Jim Crow, and a place where the federal government had to step in to address political segregation in the 1970s… is race. The lack of generational wealth and the cyclical nature of poverty are major contributing factors to blight and crime. How are you not following this?

My guess: You _are_ following this, you’re just refusing to engage with the concept, resulting in bad faith discussion.

"It’s literally describing how this process occurs. Black people couldn’t legally own property in most of Shreveport for like 100 years - that’s 100 years of people unable to buy houses that will rise in value, unable to pass down concrete assets to their families.  So when we talk about white flight, what we mean is places like Highland - which was once a brand new expensive white subdivision, that transitioned to a rentier neighborhood after segregation ended.   The property owners left the neighborhood, parceled many of the houses into duplexes and quadplexes, and rented them out.  But it’s still very expensive for most people to buy property, even there, so most of the working class are stuck renting, and renting from landlords who live elsewhere and have little incentive to fund or improve their properties or the community.

"I rent from 318, and can confirm, they’re “good” landlords. Very responsive to issues - I live in an old house = tree roots in the plumbing, and every 2 months or so when it starts backing up, they’re here within hours to clear out the pipes. Our AC completely shit the bed last summer, and they made sure we didn’t need a portable unit (we also had 2 window units) while we waited for the parts. Basically, if you rent in highlands or Broadmoor, you’re going to mostly be dealing with very old houses, so it’s pretty important to make sure you’ve got a property manager who actually deals with rentals, as they’ve got the staff or connections to get stuff done quickly.

That being said, property management rentals don’t usually come cheap (at minimum $900/mo for a house, and more likely 1200ish if we’re being realistic for a better house in “good” section of the ‘hood), so if you’re looking for cheaper alternatives, the poster who put the map and told you to drive around looking for signs is your best bet.

* Gilmer Bayou starts near Greenwood
* Boggy Bayou starts near the TX line
* Gilmer empties into Boggy North of Keithville and Boggy continues SE

------
* Keatchie Bayou starts just North of the town of Keachi (yes, the bayou has a T and the town doesn't)
* Cypress Bayou starts a little North of Keatchie Bayou and forms most of the border between Caddo and DeSoto Parishes
* Keatchie empties into Cypress between Stonewall and Keithville and Boggy continues NE

-------
* Boggy Bayou Joins Cypress where I-49 crosses into DeSoto and just before it becomes Wallace Lake

_______

After the Wallace Lake Dam, Cypress Bayou becomes Wallace Bayou until it runs into Bayou Pierre at Hwy 175 a little South of Ellerbe Rd. Google Maps calls this segment Bayou Pierre, but Google Maps is wrong.

Bayou Pierre parallels the Red River until it finally empties into it just a little North of Natchitoches.",t2_5xg3g,squeamish,0,1647984573.0,0,t1_i1pqrjw,i1pqrjw,True,[deleted],t3_tjxszo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tjxszo/does_cross_lake_drain_to_keithville_do_we_have/,Does cross lake drain to keithville?

"There are food pantries, some of which I think are no questions asked, but they don't operate anything like what it looks like FNB does in terms of partnerships with growers and grocers.

I do think about the community fridge concept, which might be a bit easier to start and grow from there, but I've never done anything like the scale and frequency of FNB, so I'm only speculating. Organizing can be quote hard here, but it can happen if you find the right group of people who believe in the cause. 

We do have a group, for example, who is working daily to ferry immigrants who are released after being detained in Louisiana who are basically dumped on the side of the road. Because it is daily work, they have struggled hard with burnout and are actively working to become a nonprofit formally so that they can create a structure necessary for daily work.

So anytime I think of a mutual aid operation here, I think about how hard it is to get a great volume of volunteers for any length of time simply because of our population size and the amount of poverty in the community, meaning that if my assumption is correct, the amount of free time per capita is really low.

"Wifey is out of town for the night so I asked The Chicken Nugget what she wanted to do. Her response, let’s get Cajun Asian Togo and then play video games at the house!  Who am I one to say no to that?  
So we had the crawfish wontons, Cajun Pho and Cajun PadThai. If you like your wontons made with thin dough, then you will like these. The Pad Thai had a good kick to it and good flavor, only bad thing is that I work about 20 minutes away from them and then it’s about 10 minutes away from the house. So the noodles kinda conformed to the shape of the container but that’s my fault and not the restaurant’s fault since I placed the order online before I left work. The Chicken Nugget got the Cajun Pho, some assembly required. It was good but as you can see in the picture, it seems like everything was cooked without seasoning and the seasoning was just tossed on top when it was put in the container. This may have been different if we ate there instead of getting it Togo, prior experiences at this place we had always eaten at the restaurant.

Edit: sorry if this post is a bit all over but I am paying more attention to my daughter right now than making this post. Only posting between changing games or I died in a game. 
But the Cajun Pho looked better than it tasted. It was average pho with Cajun spice, sausage and crawfish added in. The Cajun pad Thai had a good flavor and spice to me but the peanuts they used did taste like they came right out of a planters nut can.  Not the best in town but we will still be going back.

"Myself and The Chicken Nugget have been eating at Thai and Japanese kitchen for several years now. Back since they had the blue benches that where falling apart or had rips in them. Back when the A/C hardly worked and the menus where falling apart. 
A lot had changed since then but the food hasn’t. It’s always been good!  FYI, they redid the menus again. 
We had the Kamikaze sushi roll for an appetizer. Wifey ordered red curry, The Chicken Nugget ordered the green curry and I had the Pad Thai, spice level 4 out of 5. My only complaint about Thai and Japanese Kitchen, was that it seemed like they where scared to give people the spicy level they wanted. This time however, I asked for a level 4 and I got a 4!!!  This was also my first time getting Pad Thai here and I have to say that it didn’t disappoint. Was full of flavors and spices!  The Green and Red curry’s where also very good, still the best in town in my opinion. We showed up before the dinner crowd, so we didn’t have to wait for a seat or wait long for our food either. When we left, the place was full and it was taking a bit longer for people to get their food. I really have nothing negative to say about this place, just a tip. Since the A/C unit in the dinning room is back on with it getting warm outside now, bring a jacket or a pullover with you. If they seat you below that A/C, your going to get cold!

"Firstly, I am very sorry that you are having to deal with this. I know how frustrating it is to be buried under school system bureaucracy. It is clear that you are also very intelligent, and I know how it makes it that much more unbearable. 

A previous comment mentioned focusing on the ADHD, and I agree with what they said. Seeking accommodation for that should be your focus, since there are more legal implications with the 504 status. 

Record all audio from your next hearing. You do NOT have to let them know they are being recorded if you don’t want to. It’s perfectly legal in this state to record audio without their consent. Hopefully you don’t have to get legal with them. But if you happen to drop a line about finding a lawyer because your rights under 504 are being infringed upon, they might change their tune a bit. Document everything in case it does come down to a legal battle. 

Best of luck to you. Most of the schools here are so overwhelmed by the amount of IEP/IAPs they handle on a daily basis, and students with them that aren’t “difficult to deal with” and perform to a satisfactory degree usually get neglected.

You are not alone.  My son is in 5th grade and has ADHD and autism.  We get the same treatment because he make “straight A grades” that he doesn’t have an issue.  Every year we have to go through the same issues with accommodations and getting teachers on the same page.  The administrations at the school and parish level are garbage and will do nothing without you having an advocate.  Our son’s doctor has been very proactive in helping with our issues but even then they don’t always follow our requests.  It’s extremely frustrating.,t2_hzspsqmo,Sad_Mix_3030,0,1647620192.0,0,t1_i163yhf,i163yhf,True,Sufficient_Cicada837,t3_tgv6yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tgv6yx/extremely_frustrated_with_how_our_schools_handle/,Extremely frustrated with how our schools handle accommodations.,/r/shreveport/comments/tgv6yx/extremely_frustrated_with_how_our_schools_handle/i163yhf/,-1,r/shreveport,0,-1
"Hello! I want to first say how sorry I am that your needs aren't being met in the school setting. Regardless of what a school system says, your diagnoses are valid.  

Unfortunately, the school seems to be handling things by the letter of the law.  School systems have long used more strict standards for meeting diagnoses such as autism. It's ridiculous, but it is what it is for now. I have known many people who are autistic and never had that acknowledged by the school system. This is very frustrating for students,  teachers, and parents.

I want to address some of the things you mentioned directly, then share some ideas about working within the system that might help. 
IQ tests: they are outdated, but a required part of any IEP evaluation. 

Neurodivergent assessments are notoriously bad at diagnosing females that are autistic. They are also old and come from the time it was believed only boys had autism and that they would outgrow it ( all so very false).

The IEP team is not only listening to your mom, even though it feels like it. They are required to use phrases such as, ""Her mother feels..."" in order to record parent concerns. They use phrases such as ""alleged autism,"" to note that the school is not seeing the qualifications for the diagnoses in their testing (which again is designed to not qualify everyone, only those that ""need"" accommodations), while I completely disagree with the process, it sounds like they are following it. 

While you and your parents decide if you wish to request more assessment from the school, I recommend you approach individual teachers and ask for preferential seating where you feel less distracted. Explain to them that you are autistic and have ADHD and that you are working to maintain your excellent GPA. Most teachers are happy to work with you. 

If your doctor has diagnosed you with ADHD, you can request a 504 medical plan, that includes accommodations. Since ADHD is a medical condition, they cannot deny you that. I'm guessing they are so busy looking for your autism that they missed the fact you are diagnosed ADHD. Many of the ADHD accommodations mirror accommodations typically used with autistic persons (extended time, breaks, preferred seating, etc). Honestly, this is your best bet. If the school refuses this, after a note from your doctor saying you have ADHD, contact the school board office and ask to talk to the head of the 504 department. They can help you. If they don't, call the state office and so forth. 

Finally,  this process is long, even in the clearest cut cases. It is frustratingly long and can be overwhelming. I am sincerely sorry you are experiencing this.",t2_dehjt1a,donnapict,0,1647618484.0,0,t1_i15zk0b,i15zk0b,True,Sufficient_Cicada837,t3_tgv6yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tgv6yx/extremely_frustrated_with_how_our_schools_handle/,Extremely frustrated with how our schools handle accommodations.,/r/shreveport/comments/tgv6yx/extremely_frustrated_with_how_our_schools_handle/i15zk0b/,2,r/shreveport,0,2

The crime rates are based on FBI data.

Violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.

Property crime includes the offenses of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. The object of the theft-type offenses is the taking of money or property, but there is no force or threat of force against the victims.

I tried to provide the school with the documents and they told me they needed to fill out a release form but they never provided it. The only reason he has an ILP is because his teacher was on the conference call and set it up herself.

Not sure if it is a lack of care from administration, a lack of training, or a lack of funding.

"I’m very sorry that this has been your experience. Is that staff member who doubts your diagnosis older? The way autism and ADHD are viewed now is much different than before and it seems (relatively) younger tend to understand these new ideas of them better. That’s why I ask. I have ADHD but my mom denied that I did. My brother was diagnosed and was the hyperactive type so she didn’t think I was since I got better grades. I went undiagnosed and still don’t have an official diagnosis but the psychologist said it might be that along with my depression. My wife is autistic and ADHD as well. She was also a gifted student and no one ever picked up on her disabilities. 

Like you said they can’t legally keep you from receiving accommodations from an IEP and suing would be a breeze if they do. I don’t understand why they think they can test you and do better. Testing at all seems very suspicious. If you have an official diagnosis from a psychologist or psychiatrist that should be all you need. You might go over this staff members head to the special ed person for the district to voice your concerns. If they’re doing this to you, chances are someone else is getting the same treatment and that shit needs to be shut down.

"My assumption is that if you’re talking about a specific geographic location in a city, you’re talking about it in context of the city. Your “well the whole city is unsafe so that specific spot is also unsafe regardless of the statistics” is kinda bullshit, but you knew that.

I still visit Chicago despite its crime rate. I still go to Lower Manhattan and walk streets at night. Again, Austin is brutal with the homeless and aggressive tactics, but it’s not hard to say “I’m sorry I can’t help you today” and they move on even if they yell at you after. Just keep walking.

My girlfriend has no problem walking downtown Shreveport at night and she hasn’t had an issue. She did it the other night to go to the Robinson for an event. Drunk visitors at clubs like Sand Bar cause more issues than the homeless. We even go sit and talk with the homeless sometimes (the ones that want to talk anyway). In my opinion, the downtown homeless are more harmless than some of the home-owning neighbors I’ve lived next to in this city.

For anyone reading this who wonders how to handle a situation with the homeless downtown: say “I’m sorry I can’t help you tonight, but best of luck and be well” takes care of about 99% of interactions which _might_ happen once a week if you’re downtown every day of the week.",t2_73s7a,chrisplyon,0,1647609843.0,0,t1_i15eqrp,i15eqrp,False,JustinGitelmanMusic,t3_tbfxr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tbfxr0/anybody_think_noble_savage_will_reopen/,Anybody think Noble Savage will reopen?,/r/shreveport/comments/tbfxr0/anybody_think_noble_savage_will_reopen/i15eqrp/,1,r/shreveport,0,1

"My wife works at the school (but not for the school board) and I have two kids who go there. So here's my best summary of events as I understand them.

- There's a non-binary transgender music teacher at University Elementary.

- Teacher was under the impression that they weren't allowed to instruct kids to use their preferred honorific (Mx.) and pronouns (they/them).

- Teacher makes a tiktok lamenting this but doesn't specify the school or city only stating they teach in Louisiana. Tiktok goes semi-viral.

- Some in the school board admin wanted the teacher to get in trouble for the tiktok.

- It's ultimately decided the teacher can't be punished for the tiktok as it was done outside of school and doesn't name the school.

- The principal informs the teacher that they can in fact ask the kids to use their chosen honorific and pronouns. Teacher proceeds to do so. Kids comply and don't seem to mind. 

- Principal sends out an E-mail instructing rest of faculty and admin use their preferred honorific and pronouns as well.

- One member of faculty/admin posts the e-mail to social media.

- Some parents after seeing the post contact the school asking for their children to not attend the teacher's class. They are denied as elementary schools don't offer customized curriculum (especially not for bigoted reasons).

- Principal is called to meeting with all of CPSB legal where they inform her she's done everything right so far.

- With the matter now more or less settled, the best the transphobes can do is have a school board meeting to rabble rouse where they use the guise of dress code to complain as the teacher has a habit of dressing flamboyantly.

Incidentally, they're a great teacher. When my third grader started piano lessons a little less than a year ago, his teacher was impressed with how much they had already taught him.",t2_8qrtw,JonnyAU,0,1647439553.0,0,t1_i0vwk10,i0vwk10,False,JuliePhoenix,t3_tffplr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tffplr/parents_clash_at_louisiana_school_board_meeting/,Parents clash at Louisiana school board meeting over nonbinary teacher.

"You can have up to 6 laying hens (no roosters) in Shreveport. There are specific rules in the ordinance pertaining to how they’re required to be housed and the minimum distance they should be kept from homes and other buildings etc. Those who rent must have permission from their landlord to keep chickens on the property. 

Bossier does not allow chickens, but reside in Benton and I’m pretty sure there is no limit plus you can have goats.

If you’re considering getting chickens it’s best to do it in a way where you don’t push your limits and you’re respectful of your neighbors. The ordinance guidelines are incredibly fair: they’re meant to keep your chickens and humans/pets in the surrounding area safe and happy.

"Oh I know people are working their ass off...my comment was not meant as a knock to them. Chase at fattys is a good buddy of mine and the dude has poured his blood sweat and tears to making something special in downtown. We still go towntowm more than any other area when we want a night out, but the simple fact is it's just not what itg used to be. You used to be able to bar hop just under the bridge. We could grab dinner and massive margs from Nickeys, hit happy hour at proud mary's, take in the patio at fatty's, play pool or shuffleboard at fully stacked...and that was JUST under the bridge. Everything I mentioned minus Fatty's is abandoned now. Events are awesome and we're out there for everyone from mudbug to st. fatty's day to bourbon and bbq....but go on a normal night and tell me it's not dead. Homeless people have taken over under the bridge and stretches of Texas street. They aren't violent and won't hassle you which is nice, but when you see more homeless than people walking and enjoying a night...it feels dead and off. Pop in pizza is awesome...but I drive downtown for a slice...then what? There is there is only fattys until Stray cat opens. No parish, no noble, no fully stacked. Also...we would love to support RFC, but they have the oddest movie times I've ever seen. We've tried to go some weekends and there have been almost no showings at all.

"Downtown isn’t dead, y’all just act like “parking” is a real problem because you have to walk a few blocks. Get over that and there are plenty of things to enjoy.

Pop n Pizza & Cookie Bs Smoothies just had ribbon cutting events yesterday. Popn has seating at their new downtown location and is selling by the slice, so there is reason to “park” if you want a slice.

I went to Missing Link for lunch last week and the place was CROWDED- full. The food is definitely bar forward and they have trivia nights etc… if I was a person who went out at night I’d definitely be going there.

Between The Lot & Festival Plaza there are events from spring until late fall that go all day and into the night. Bars like Stray Cat and Fattys are open for whatever after party you want to have. Ghost Ramen is now at Stray Cat from like 10AM - 6PM several nights a week. 

As much as downtown (and all of the residents and workers) need a nice small grocery, they can still go grab organic produce and locally sourced food at Cotton St farms.

Agora Borealis has art, gifts, and glass blowing as well as regular events. And let’s not forget that downtown has several gallery spaces and an art walk every month. The Andress has events every Saturday and the Second Saturday is their main popup weekend. Our art community also frequently puts together events in the downtown area.

Up For Brunch opened within the last year and it’s one of the few awesome brunch places we have in the entire city, and it’s DOWNTOWN. Rhino stays busy during the day and evening and doesn’t close much earlier than the South location. 

There are a lot of people working really hard to bring business and events to downtown and the only thing hurting downtown is the mentality that there is nothing there or that parking is somehow a struggle. You can usually park in front of most of these businesses. When we went to Missing Link last week we walked three blocks from where we parked. We could have potentially parked closer. It cost me 50 cents to park, and the walk was lovely. There is also only a fee for parking during regular weekday business hours. I’ve never walked more than 4 blocks for parking downtown, even for events.

If you don’t go there then you’re killing it. But downtown is not “DEAD”, as I invite you to visit other cities where the downtown is actually dead. People are just constantly fighting the “there’s nowhere to park and nothing to do” fake news disinformation crowd.

"Without giving out person information, The Chicken Nugget had a seasonal job at a local bakery making KingCakes. Well on the last day, they let them make whatever kind they wanted to and bring in whatever they wanted to put inside or on top. So she bought Canes chicken fingers and a cup full of sauce. She mixed the sauce in with the filling, baked it, then mixed some of the sauce into the regular icing and added Canes bread chunks to the top. 
It my not sound very good but it did taste good. It was on the sweet side for me so I couldn’t have more than one small slice. But I definitely have to give credit to The Chicken Nugget for “thinking outside the box” when it came to this.

"I have been wanting to try them for a really long time now but since they are a “pop up restaurant”, we have never been able to catch them until tonight and luckily enough, it was at the Seventh Tap brewery!!  
They only had 4 options available, 2 chicken and 1 steak and potstickers. They definitely seem to kinda winging it by event, so do not go by the menu on Facebook or what I listed because it’s probably going to be different at the next event. But that being said, you need to try them!! Wifey had the French onion with steak and the eldest and I had 2 different chicken options.  It was rather tasty, the eldest said it was better than the ramen at Thai and Japanese kitchen.  I preferred the spice option of Thai and Japanese kitchen but keep in mind that they also have the advantage of operating out of a permanent kitchen and Ghost Ramen uses a mobile kitchen.  It also took about an hour and a half to get our food. So if you can catch them, show up early but expect a wait. 
The Seven Tap brewery it’s self does not have a restaurant but they do allow outside food.  They are kid and dog friendly. If you have some folding chairs, it might be a good idea to bring them with you. The outside seating gets full but they have the spool tables that you can use. Inside they had a cabinet with board games that you can play and out side was a few corn hole games. They had way more options of beer than Flying Heart and very, creative names. Everything from The Cats Whisper to Juceport to Cros with Socs. So weather you like a light beer, to dark to extra hoppy, to pineapple flavored or cocoa laco… I am sure you will find something that you like. Check the webpage for the ever changing beers on tap though. They also serve different beer in different shaped glasses to help focus the type of beer on certain parts of your tung, like wine glasses. Does this work?  Not sure because I’m not a beer or wine expert but I did feel fancy drinking out of the different shaped glasses. 
On a side note, parking is also, horrible. So unless you show up really early, except to park in an overflow parking lot and walk a bit. The website also listing additional parking options and most of the business near by had signs out front that either said overflow parking was allowed or NOT allowed. So please respect those signs. 
We will be going to the Seven Tap again but more than likely without the eldest since they do not have a restaurant onsite. But whenever we can catch Ghost Ramen again, wherever they maybe, she will be going with us.

Edit: I tried to refer to the eldest one as “the chicken nugget” but it didn’t seem to fit very well.

"There’s some real negative nellies On this post. I’m from Shreveport but have left and come back several times. Here’s what great about Shreveport: 

it’s easy. There’s really no traffic and you can get pretty much anywhere in 15 minutes. Unless you’re in bossier then there is traffic and it’s horrendous. I try to stay on the interstate or Benton road as much as possible when I have to go over the bridge. 

It’s inexpensive. If you have a decent job you will find your money goes a long way here. 

It’s three hours from both Dallas and Houston which means you can get a cheap flight to anywhere. Shreveport regional has decent prices now too but sometimes it makes sense to make the drive. 

It smells really great in the spring when everything is blooming. 

We have great festivals and events. People say we aren’t really Louisiana. I’ve lived in new Orleans and Dallas and that just isn’t true. We definitely have some east Texas running in our veins but there’s some Cajun in there also. 

We do have great food. 

It isn’t that it’s what you make it, it’s that there are always trade offs. Big cities = big traffic + big expenses. Sometime it’s true that’s it not the place but the person. You take yourself everywhere and life in general is what you make of it. 

If you like hunting or fishing there’s tons of that here. If you like religion we have plenty of that too. 

Shreveport can be insular and cliquish but it’s more from laziness than not liking outsiders. My kids know and are friends with the people I grew up with, and I’m friends with the kids of my parents friends. We all know one another and so we can forget there are other people in the orbit. You can find a group of friends though, no doubt. 

I hope you enjoy Shreveport. It’s no more dirty or violent than any mid-sized city in the Deep South. We definitely have issues. No doubt. Lots of corruption in city government. It’s very quid pro quo with a dash of banana republic (as is all of Louisiana). Lots of generational poverty and the issues that come along with that. But a lot of people do care and a lot of people are trying to make a difference.

"WELCOME!! I moved here last year from Minneapolis, after spending my entire life in the Midwest. So this is what I’ve discovered that a fellow midwesterner should know.

Get a Brita filter for your sink. You’ll need it. The water taste and smell was one of the biggest shocks of my life hahaha. I haven’t gotten used to it. But I buy a lot of bottled water and drink from my brita filter.

I also live right by RiverScape (I think that’s where you said you were looking), and it’s a great area. It is a gated community. Stoner Ave (the road you take to get to riverscape) is a little sketch, but not bad compared to the violence in other parts of the city. Someone commented West of I49 is the worst and I agree. By the airport. There’s literally no reason to go over there anyway, so you’ll be fine. Also agree with the violence almost always being targeted. Just be smart and watch out for yourself. 

People move realllllllllly slow down here. I’m used to the immediate pace of living in a city, so I really had to learn to be patient. They are so damn nice tho. Everyone is super genuine and willing to help you out in any way possible. 

People don’t know what longjohns are down here (donut). I asked for one and people thought I was speaking a foreign language. People say “buggy” instead of “cart.” There are some really funny quirks you’ll find and it’s very amusing.

I didn’t visit before I moved here. Just know that the shitty neighborhoods you may see really don’t reflect the soul of Shreveport. I was intimidated by them at first, but there are so many nice places you’ll discover. Bossier City is also AWESOME. If you don’t live at RiverScape, check out bossier. It’s only across the River but it’s a night and day experience from Shreveport.

The malls are janky. But we have the essentials. Dallas is only a 2:30 drive, they have great shops out there.

Travel! Check out some of the surrounding cities. Luckily I get to see these places because of my job, but check out Jefferson Texas, Texarkana, Natchitoches, Ruston, Hot Springs Arkansas, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, etc. There’s a lot of character there. 

The summers are… excruciatingly hot. I love the cold weather and there’s not much of that, only during like Jan-early March. And what’s really “cold” is relative depending on who you ask. So your utility bills will be pricey. Air will have to be on. Look up some energy saving tips, you’ll need it! 

We don’t have Aldi (huge disappointment) but we have a Whole Foods and Kroger, so I guess that’s fine. No Costco, Sam’s Club only. No Culvers, but Shreveport has some BOMB ass food.  

I think that’s all I can think of right now lol. Welcome though. People are super negative about Shreveport and they’re dramatic af.

"Hey! Born and raised in KC and have been living in Shreveport for almost 3 years now.

You are used to a hot and humid summer but the real difference here is how unrelenting it is. Where in KC you'll get some breaks from the heat, here it just stays ridiculously hot for months. But the fall here is long and beautiful and Spring is nice as well. Winters are short and laughably mild.

For me the biggest culture shock was how pessimistic people are about the city (Kansas Citians are hella proud of KC) but that's something we can hopefully change. I remember people in KC used to be incredibly pessimistic about the city proper, especially downtown and midtown but there have been some incredible improvements. I'm seeing a lot of that same energy here now.

The city is a lot smaller than the KC metro area so while it has great variety and options everything is on a smaller scale. I mostly consider that a feature and not a bug. You'll continually run into people you know or recognize but it's not like you know every single person. 

Drivers are worse here; learn to drive defensively, double check at intersections that someone isn't running the red light. 

There are a couple of ethnic restaurants in KC that I miss but the food here is really good. 

I've never felt like I've been in danger from violent crime here. Honestly, it's no different from KC. Some petty property theft stuff in the core neighborhoods with the violence mostly isolated to the neighborhoods that have been horribly redlined and disinvested in (just like KC). It's still terrible that it happens but it's unlikely to affect you directly.

As someone else mentioned, people do seem kind of cliquish here but if you get involved in something local (hobbies, sports, arts, music, whatever) you'll keep seeing the same people and they'll warm up to you. Church is also very popular here.

"I’ve spent a lot of time in Kansas City and the “violent” behavior isn’t much different in Shreveport - heavily localized and personal as another poster said.

We have great restaurants here, heavily focused in the Mexican and Margarita realm so if you like those things you’re in luck. We have extra hoppy beer at the local breweries. Louisiana is a party state so we have some pretty fantastic festivals and drive thru daiquiris. Our downtown is growing and it’s a great place to grab a bite or attend a festival. We have plenty of outdoor activities for those who enjoy trails and you’re moving just in time for Azalea season which is a gorgeous time to walk around the historic areas in Shreveport. 

I’m not from here and I’ve moved A LOT so Ive encountered all kinds of communities. The biggest difference you’ll encounter between Shreveport and KC is that Shreveport is VERY small town vibes: cliquish, attached to history and generally uninterested in outsiders. KC is used to new people moving in and out and Shreveport is not. 

Highly suggest you find the local stores, restaurants, and business and stick to those. Aside from supporting the community you live in, the customer service and quality differences are beyond noticeable. The quality of chain businesses here is poor and has gotten worse since COVID. I’d avoid the Shreve City Walmart at all costs even if you live next door. There is a Super 1 down the street that is better, or the Albertsons/Drug Emporium or Kroger close by. If you have base access then the commissary is the best place to shop for groceries tbh. 

You’ve had plenty of these offers, but once again if you have any questions feel free to DM. Every community you live in is what you make of it so if you wanna love it you will. Welcome and sorry you missed Festival Season but it’s something to look forward to next year!

"That is a nice spot. You’re going to be right next to the area referred to as “ShreveCity.” It houses a couple of decent restaurants, a kind of shabby Walmart, and some other small shops of different kinds. My fiancé and I have recently started getting into D&D, so we go to Tabletop games store called Gamer’s XP. 

The Clyde Fant Highway next to you can get you quickly to several places like Downtown which has Casinos, a couple of good restaurants, and some nice areas to just walk by the river. In the middle of Clyde Fant is the YMCA. At the other end of Clyde Fant you can find a larger consumer area with lots of food choices, plenty of shopping and even a used bookstore we love called “Thrifty Peanut.”
You’re also close to a dog park and a great Frisbee Golf course. The river has a great 5mile long walking/biking path that is VERY easily accessible for you. There is a small path by those apts that leads under Clyde Fant. 

Telling you which areas to avoid would be easier with a map, but I’ll say this, if you’re driving though a neighborhood with LOTs of VERY shabby run down houses, that’s probably not a nice area to be. West of I-49 has some areas I wouldn’t recommend. 

I’ll go ahead and apologize for crappy roads, loud trucks, and the god awful heat in the summer.

"The negative comments in this thread sadden me.  I have lived my life entirely in Louisiana but from one end of the state to the other (Shreveport/Bossier to Houma/Thibodeaux and several spots in between). Opinions are all about perspective to an extent in these threads but there are some objective markers one can examine.  The comment “Roads are awful, crime is awful and everything seems”. The point is that exactly “seems”.  I finished medical school and residency in Shreveport many many years ago and left with my husband also a physician to return to his small town in Avoyelles and then Rapides to be the small town hero dr.  Let me tell you regret regret regret.  Being in Cenla now means I often still to this day travel from one end of the state to the other and if you think cities such as S/B, BR and such are suffering please next time you travel in the state get out and look at what’s happened outside La.’s “urban sites”. Go check out Alexandria, Natchtoches, Marksville and see true devastation and despair.  Or as I said just take a look at objective markers such as Alex and Marksville ranked #2 and 3 worst most violent crime ridden cities in La.  Alexandria last year ranked most dangerous college town in U.S(per capita of course). You complain that Shreveport doesn’t realize it’s potential in this environment be thankful Shreveport still has potential and hope.  There are towns and cities such as Cheneyville, Bunkie etc which are essentially in death rattles.  And even New Orleans has reached preKatrina violence and the Hurricane spurred the greatest gentrification drive ever with massive massive inequity.   But don’t take my word I think one can get an idea of the difference by just checking out some subreddits here such as the Cenla and New Orleans subs.  You will notice a distinct difference in content and tone.  There are no restaurant posts in Alex bc no restaurants hardly left at all, extremely rare events and certainly no event listings or calendars.  Usually just latest crimes or lack of services such as police, utilities etc.  New Orleans as I said appears to have returned to preKatrina violence glory days with less residents though and higher living costs.

I guess I am asking you all to pull your heads up and look around at the rest of the state.  It is becoming a wasteland if you will notice then come back and complain about how bad you have it.

Sorry I didn’t mean to hijack your post OP.  I think you’ll enjoy Sport city especially the convenience after BR and with several colleges and institutions of learning you will be able to find a social group of peers quite easily I believe.  The culture difference I think is the biggest change to get used to anticipate living as in the South as opposed to Cajun country.

"I think people are completely misunderstanding your question or you misunderstood what your Shreveport friend was saying. 
The word is used often as a term of endearment amongst some black people of all ages in normal conversations. Some in the black community despise the word and will not use it at all and do not like that other black people use it so freely. Hip-hop music and culture has been and continues to be extremely influential around the world to all races including whites. I know whites on the east coast that use the word in the same context and manner of endearment as people in the black community do. There IS a “racist version” of the n-word that, not always, but commonly is pronounced with the “hard R” at the end instead of “uhh” at the end. White kids that grew up in predominantly black neighborhoods and schools are gonna talk like the kids in their environment in most cases…Human nature. It’s cringy to me, but in Shreveport and many other locals from west coast to east coast there are these particular white kids that are completely influenced by black culture due to their environment and surroundings and pop the word out there like easy entitlement. Then there’s the “wanna-be’s” white kids that try too hard to be what they’re not, but just love to act that way somewhat aimless and ill-guided, but it’s America and we’re all free to act or pretend to be what we want lol. There’s some black kids that get accused of “trying to be white” because they may talk this way or dress that way. What your friend may have been saying is that she may freely use the n-word in a friendly context among her peers that may even include some black friends. Your friend is giving signals that it is unacceptable to use the word in a racist and derogatory way, but that in their mind ok to use in the same way popular rappers do in a “you’re my homie” endearing way.  One fact remains is that the vast majority of normal folks of all races just don’t use that word, Shreveport or east coast.",t2_2rw95wmx,bigbatai,1,1646328699.0,0,t1_hz7gy06,hz7gy06,True,[deleted],t3_t5slj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/t5slj2/friend_from_shreveport_said_it_was_ok_to_say_the/,Friend from Shreveport said it was ok to say the n-word there,/r/shreveport/comments/t5slj2/friend_from_shreveport_said_it_was_ok_to_say_the/hz7gy06/,0,r/shreveport,0,0

"I mean, when I was a kid in Bossier I was implicitly taught that the n-word wasn’t a bad word per se, but just a word that you can only use in certain situations i.e. with like-minded white people. Twenty years later I don’t remotely associate with that kind of crowd, but it wouldn’t surprise me if that sentiment is still going. A LOT of white people in this area (and the South in general) view racist language not wrong so much as impolite. If your Shreveport friend was very insulated in her social group, I can see where casual use of the n-word might feel normal to her.
