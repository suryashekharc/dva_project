"I asked an officer about this once and learned they never turn their vehicles off if they park them and are sitting there or go inside for a meeting/event/misc.  They have a load of equipment inside that would kill the vehicle battery if the vehicle turns off.

It's very unfortunate, and I think if you haven't noticed this before, you'll start noticing that empty cop cars are always running (I'll assume it's when the cop is on-duty rather than off).

There is [Idle Reduction Technology](https://afdc.energy.gov/case/3076) available that's effectively a large battery pack that can keep equipment running when the engine is turned off.  ROI is 0.5-2 years from what I've read.  This should no doubt be standard.

Our SRO threatened to put the student who brought the peppers in handcuffs and bring her to the station. Took the rest of us pointing out that nobody forced the other kid to do it and we all had done the same thing just to get the SRO to back off. I'm guessing she never planned to actually do it, just wanted to scare the kid that brought the peppers.

Other kids weren't so lucky, some kids were arrested for having weed in their lockers, fighting, a couple kids got put in squad cars for smoking cigarettes (guessing someone thought it weed). Stuff that, while admittedly illegal, probably could have been dealt with in a better way that didn't result in a criminal record. That probably isn't 100% on the SRO, as the administration seemed to really love arresting students, but she did facilitate the arrests.

Of course this all happened when I was in high school which was over a decade ago now, so I may be misremembering or could have misunderstood how much impact the SRO had.",t2_ey9v2,Kwahex,0,1648134377.0,0,t1_i1xt0k8,i1xt0k8,True,No-Kangaroo-4438,t3_tlwfkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cedarrapids/comments/tlwfkc/for_a_school_project_from_a_general_public/,"For a School Project‚Ä¶.

"Starlink will be available eventually, but there's a long wait list. If ImOn doesn't serve your area, I think Mediacom and CenturyLink are the only options. As much as I dislike Mediacom, my suggestion is to purchase your own router/modem that has dual band (2.4Ghz and 5Ghz). Mediacom won't be able to limit bandwidth like they can on their own routers and if you use the 5Ghz band, you'll likely get speeds in excess of what you're paying for. I have a 300Mbps down/30 Mbps up plan and have gotten speeds up to 450Mbps while on the 5Ghz band. Just my thoughts.

Mediacom is the only ISP to offer gigabit service. Their billing department has only fucked up once in 7.5 years of service and it was at the beginning. Centurylink never ever sent me a correct bill and still owes me money they claim has been sent by check and ACH (both lies, one beyond obvious to prove is false).

Centurylink required my to use their horribly outdated modem/router combo that had outages at least once per hour. It made WFG, gaming, and streaming all impossible. I had to call at least 3 times to get them to replace the unit, each time they claimed it was because of something else. When they replace the unit it was better and my outages reduced to about once a day (still completely unacceptable for their price).

"Not to defend hyvee on nearly any charges but I will speak to the alcohol sale denial- anyone who sells alcohol in Iowa is required to take mandatory IPACT training every 2 years.

It‚Äôs not that they didn‚Äôt want to inconvenience you, it‚Äôs because getting caught selling to someone with an expired license means a $500 fine (first offense) and probably getting fired as well as a mark against the store.

"A woman pulled into the lot with a man as i was eating lunch. Clothes and other items started to be thrown out of car. I wondered if it had been stolen. Then the man ripped the seat belt off and started yelling and hitting the dashboard. I immediately called the police. He became violent towards the vehicle. Smashing the dashboard,  busting windows, yelling aggressively at a petite woman standing there FROZEN. Then he ripped the headrest out and started bashing it into the driver's window right next to her head. I did speak up at that point and told him to get away from the woman. He yelled that it was her car and went back to trying to bust the window. This car had paper license plates and was recently bought from Ross car sales(?). When the first cop showed up the man continued on without much pause. Seemed to be on drugs.  An undercover arrived and got the girl to safety. He continued to rant and yelled his girlfriend's name and blamed her for ruining his life as he then backhanded the drivers window and finally succeeded in breaking it. He told the cops repeatedly to shoot him. CR cops held their position while the guy refused to get out for over 30 mins. There were about 7 or 8 cop cars, he was surrounded, and it was a standoff. No weapon in sight other than his bloody hands. He did yell that he loved the woman....yeah, you can keep your love crazy mf!! I couldn't stay to see how they finally apprehended him but I got some pics of the scene.

"Sadly Sac N Fox is your best bet short of leaving the city . The trail off Boyson is being paved and Morgan creek is also being paved though for now there's still a lot of grassy and clay areas you can run if you want to. Grant Wood Trail in Marion is paved until the Rock Park at which point it becomes a nice clay/dirt trail for quite a while and is nice to run on. I mentioned Palo already and if you're willing to head south there are a lot of good options north of Iowa City near Lake McBride, and a few other places but that's a bit of a drive unless you're on the south edge of town. 

If you like group runs, Thursday's are either at NewBo or the nearby Iowa Running Company, Tuesday Night Track at Washington high school should be starting soon, and there's the previously mentioned Pleasant Creek group. There's also a Saturday AM group in Marion but they change locations so you have to get on their email list.

in my experience it is worth it, but the only Ethernet that works is out of the the base unit hooked to the modem and that there is only one port, you would need to hook an Ethernet switch to it to hook up multiple Ethernet devices, you can get simple ones for about 15 dollars that will do the job just fine. If possible maybe put the modem and base unit upstairs next to the PC if not a long Ethernet would work too.

"I guess your experience varies from mine, and I won't try to convince you otherwise. Sounds like you've had some bad times. 

For me.. I am as involved as I want to be in the community, and have many friends who are as well, and a good share are non-white, non-Christian (or at least not overtly so/church goong), men and women. 

Marion is one of the very few cities that has actually engage inclusion and diversity programs on a large scale and has made changes to policy and police procedures as recommended. They lead the area in providing licensed social workers on police staff to respond to domestic disturbances. The Marion Civil Rights commission is not only respected but their recommendations hold weight.

The mayor isn't even white, is an immigrant, and is probably one of the most respected members of the community.

You mention biological males coming to dominate women again. How many kids this is really going to affect in mostly small-town red-state Iowa. A couple dozen at most at any one time. And of those, how many are actually going to be good enough to star on a girls team, a handful probably.

You act like there's a whole bunch of boys just getting ready to run the girls off their volleyball teams and take over the sport. Your argument on this comes across to me as fear mongering than looking at it objectively.

"I agree. And, I'm much closer to 60. 

I'm just interested that there seem to be assumptions for this young couple on what neighborhood they'd like to live in. If the original post had asked for recommendations on where to live as a person of color,  I think there would have been a flurry of SJW feedback.

Yet, everyone is free to make age based recommendations and assume what a young couple is looking for. 

My wife of nearly 40 years and I probably never fit a standard mold. We've chosen homes based on features, costs, and location. We've always had neighbors and friends from different ages, races, and walks of life.

"Here's a very unpopular opinion; no they're not.

Often times what it comes down to is the way you've set up your network inside your home. If you're using the provided modem / router combo you're never going to have good service. They're cheap which is why they give them away essentially for free and you can exchange it any time. If you're paying for 100 mb/s or anything higher and you're using their provided hardware you're cheating yourself. 

I've been on mediacom 1 gig for 3, I think almost 4 years in 2 different houses. I've never had the issues that people constantly complain about on this reddit. You know why? Because I set up everything myself, own a top of the line router and modem. I can stream, have 4 5 6 devices connected to the router and still get 400 mb/s download. 

The thing is if you're paying for 1 gig and using subpar hardware you're not going to get the speeds you're paying for, you're going to create bottlenecks. Also, if you're paying for 100 mb/s but say you're streaming on 3 devices gaming on 2, you're over pulling the bandwidth you're assigned so yes you're going to have issues.

People have unrealistic expectations because they simply don't understand their home network. Mediacom customer service sucks, but its because they're overwhelmed with issues they can't even fix.
