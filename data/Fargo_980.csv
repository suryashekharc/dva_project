"*""Attention former loyal K-Mart Shoppers, you have had your last Blue Light Special.""*  

When I was growing up back in the late '70's and '80's in my area we had no Target or Walmart.  K-Mart was the discount store and I remember my parents taking me there often.  I haven't shopped significantly at K-Mart for ages nor really paid much attention to it for years, but it's still kind of sad and nostalgic to see it go as it brings back some faint, ancient childhood memories.",t2_a1w9a,WhippersnapperUT99,0,1648286266.0,0,t1_i269w0y,i269w0y,True,MurderMittens42,t3_to4x1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/to4x1w/s_fargo_kmart_facade_coming_down_stopped_to_take/,S Fargo Kmart facade coming down!

"Sounds to me that the Sales Manager made a promise to someone that now, can not be kept.  The pressure to sell ANY vehicle right now is enormous, what with the economy and the general lack of vehicles due to the pandemic and microchip shortages.  If I'd have to guess, from 5 years experience in that industry, is that the SM knows he can immediately flip your current vehicle and had already started to process during those 6 hours.  

He was counting on you taking the deal and so had probably already contacted a buyer he had in his back pocket.  If they started the process of a sale and it blows up, now they have to unwind the deal.  This would normally involve the banks or relevant financial institutions, multiple phone calls and headaches.

I looked at a pickup at Gateway and that salesman pissed me off. They only had one truck on the lot and he suggested we go for a ride. While we were out I noticed all the features the truck *did not* have and told the guy I didn't want the truck and why. We got back to the dealership and went inside and he kept trying to sell me that truck. I kept telling him no and why! He did look to see what they had coming in, but any thing I wanted had been pre-sold. 

I was about ready to walk out and he asked me if I could hold on for a minute as he just thought of something. He come back in minute and tells me if I buy the truck we test drove he could knock off and extra $3000. I told him that he must not be paying attention and he asked why? ""Because I don't want that truck!"" That was the end of it. He had given me his business card and I dropped it in the garbage while he was standing there and I walked out.

Your comment isn't showing up because of being moderated (i'm assuming).  U.S. deaths re: COVID are sitting at 974,000.  How fucking stupid do you have to be to think that this error in any way shape or form supports a position that COVID wasn't bad or something to be taken seriously.  


Brilliant deduction genius.  Hinging your position on a 7% margin of error and somehow completely glossing over the fact that even people who survive COVID are expected to have long term damage to their body.

[https://www.westfargond.gov/1202/Agendas-Minutes](https://www.westfargond.gov/1202/Agendas-Minutes)

Construction Cost $616,024.50  
Engineering 10% $61,602.45

Legal 3% $18,480.74  
Interest 4% $24,640.98  
Contingency 5% $30,801.23

So, for a $750,000 project, only an estimated $616,000 is actually the price of the lights and installation. This isn't just a ""single"" traffic light. There's 13 lanes that would need signals, plus crosswalks, most likely inductive loops that would need the concrete to be removed and repaired, the two arms crossing Veterans would be close to 45' long and need to be able to withstand ND winds,  fiber optic cable that would be need to be bored to 36th and/or 40th, etc. A stainless steel weatherproof controller cabinet isn't going to just cost $500. Cripes I would bet money that the L- bolts to secure the light poles to the bases will cost well more than $500. Then throw in the specialized equipment and 100s of hours of skilled labor to actually install it, and you end up with $616,000 for a traffic light.",t2_113hce,Moolio74,0,1648166007.0,0,t1_i200bur,i200bur,True,chootie8,t3_tlnfts,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/tlnfts/im_surely_being_naive_so_can_someone_help_me/,"I'm surely being naive, so can someone help me understand why this stoplight costs 3/4 of a million dollars?",/r/fargo/comments/tlnfts/im_surely_being_naive_so_can_someone_help_me/i200bur/,2,r/fargo,0,2

"If you make the time and commit to marathon training, it's totally doable. I remember one year training for the full while working 60-70 hours a week, and still pushing myself through rain/sleet/snow/wind to get those long runs in. It sucked but I challenged myself. And obviously there are the folks who travel all over the country to run marathons, but a ton of Fargo Marathon participants are from the area. Aside from registration there isn't much else you're paying for.

Is the frustration just about getting around in your car? I can see the inconvenience, but it's one Saturday a year. And half a Saturday at that.

With some frequency, I see people not understand how to yield at a roundabout.  Two of the most common things are:

1. They will treat the yield sign like a stop sign, and before entering the roundabout make a full stop when no one is coming.
2.  Stop while in the roundabout to yield to incoming traffic

My all time favorite though, was the woman who drove toward the roundabout, but before entering it she decided ""you know what, roundabouts aren't for me.""

"Right now downtown Fargo produces the most tax per square foot vs anywhere else in the state.

Part of the issue is IMHO we tax land wrong. The parking lot where block 9 is wasn't producing a whole lot of tax revenue . It was a parking lot .

So now there is a massive incentive not to build expensive buildings (building up, high density buildings) and this is exactly why in the 1990s downtown was basically 1/2 parking lots. This is why the commercial areas are over 1/2 parking lots.

So if you want to build a tall building that uses the same space as a parking lot you are going to pay 1000x the taxes. Does this make sense? Both take up the same ""space"" but one will be taxed 1000x more.",t2_710fi,SirGlass,0,1648070765.0,0,t1_i1ulg3j,i1ulg3j,False,Significant-Ad-4184,t3_tkj4rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/tkj4rv/economic_committees_vote_to_recommend_kilbourne/,Economic committees vote to recommend Kilbourne project along Fargo riverfront,/r/fargo/comments/tkj4rv/economic_committees_vote_to_recommend_kilbourne/i1ulg3j/,1,r/fargo,0,1

"I don't hate them at all, but I do have some issues with how some of the things involving them have gone down and continue to go down. I also think the city has become a bit too cozy with some companies, which I find very uncomfortable. 

I am going to say it a million times... the tax breaks on Block 9 were icky af. They pay some flat rate of property taxes for something like 20 years if I remember correctly, that is far below what we would pay. That part I can kind of get, as the building should probably provide good benefit to the area. 

The part that gets me is that it was sold to us all as a tax they pay, but neigh. Neigh. That ""tax"" goes to pay for the loan of the parking ramp that they own. Ok, we get to use it sometimes, but it isn't the city's. 

It isn't Killbourne or any of the other company's fault. They should try and get the best deal they can. That said, just call it what it is. It isn't a tax that somehow they are paying. They are paying off a loan for something that they own and they don't pay property taxes. I don't appreciate the city selling this to us (and sending us Killbourne propaganda) as the explanation of the taxes. 

Really, I would like to see a wider variety of companies that are encouraged to do these projects. Whether it be Authentic, whose proposal seemed pretty sketchy, or someone else. It benefits the city, IMO, to have more than a few companies playing Monopoly with the look of the city. Some of which maybe should a bit more like Authentic's proposal than Killbourne's.",t2_347p1,cheddarben,0,1648066851.0,0,t1_i1ubbay,i1ubbay,False,Significant-Ad-4184,t3_tkj4rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/tkj4rv/economic_committees_vote_to_recommend_kilbourne/,Economic committees vote to recommend Kilbourne project along Fargo riverfront,/r/fargo/comments/tkj4rv/economic_committees_vote_to_recommend_kilbourne/i1ubbay/,5,r/fargo,0,5

"""Owning"" a home doesn't actually make you wealthy.  You still pay rent in the form of the non-principal parts of your mortgage - interest, mortgage insurance PMI, property taxes, and home insurance (which is much more expensive per year than renter's insurance).  Thus the first 15 years of home ""ownership"" on a 30 year mortgage might be best described as ""home loanership"".

As a modest twinhome ""owner"", I figure I'm paying about $850/month right now in ""rent"", which as I see it is money that goes directly down the toilet, never to be seen again.  Even if the mortgage is ever fully paid off, insurance + property taxes would be about $375/month I reckon.

Between our down payment and several years of mortgage payments minus money we would get from selling after paying a commission, I calculate that our total rent per month - total amount thrown away per month - has to be about $975/month.

"It could be a long time depending on the company/landlord. I requested a new wall AC unit for my place for years. It was only when my building got a new management company that they suddenly had new AC units. And I only found out when I saw an AC unit box in the dumpster. I texted the building manager ""Oh you need one?""  

As for a washer and dryer I have seen many buildings have the hook up for them, but not offer them. They want people to use the machines that make you pay to use. So it puts money  in the pocket of the landlord. If it came with the unit I would check if all the units have the washers and dryers. The units might be just left over from the old renters and the land lord decided to add them as a bonus to that unit.

100% disagree. Things can both provide a profit and be affordable. We can talk about crony capitalism and hyperefficiency as a problem all day long and I might agree with you.

"It seems like you haven't been watching this closely.

One, Design - The design isn't final, in the original proposal which is public, they state they will go through a community design process.

Your analogies are cute, but they said in their original proposal and subsequent presentations that they will lease parking from the City, there is a ramp 3 minutes away by foot.

Passive house design is normal, not extraordinary. People already have done it in North Dakota and there are some single family developers that get very close to it (and single family is harder than multifamily because there is more surface area in a single family house, no neighbors units to provide protection)

Solar is inexpensive, there are tax credits for it, and they included it in their financials which were submitted to the city at the very beginning of the process. They just aren't public information because its proprietary. This is normal. It's why you haven't seen Killbourne's proformas either.

Two, Economics - The City's financial advisors stated in a public document that they had no concerns with the economics, and the committee just received letters of interest from investors who are excited by the project. The original proposal didn't require any of the most recent requests from the city, and I would be surprised if any of the 7 developers have submitted as much as Authentic Housing has (please correct me if I'm wrong, but none of the public proposals have this information that I found.)

Three, The competition is here, which is where the money comes from, https://softwoodlumberboard.org/mass-timber-competition-building-to-net-zero/

Authentic Housing will pay taxes right away, Killbourne is asking for 11 years of no taxes. Using the City's estimates, in the first 11 years Authentic Housing will pay something like $5 million in taxes before Killbourne pays a single dime, and Authentic Housing's rent is actually affordable.

"Authentic Housing’s proposal, to me, doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, and I mean that in regards to purely logistics. I appreciate the aspirations they have for the community, but there are way too many red flags for me to ever feel comfortable with it. 

Construction/Design: their design is not good. The exterior reminds of me something inspired by Soviet era public housing, and not in a good way. Please also look at the floor plans provided. There are deep, cavernous recesses in the plan that do not make any sense, and will provide perpetually dark canyons in plan. There is almost no parking provided in the plan, so I don’t know how they can expect the likely 200+ people all living there to not have cars. That’s just not where Fargo is right now as a city to not provide that. Net zero in this climate is extremely hard to achieve, and is phenomenally cost prohibitive. Offsetting that big of a building with solar panels (expensive) will not be enough. I’m not saying that’s a bad goal to have, but it’s not very realistic. 

Economics: this is a massive project for a team and group to undertake that has never done a project before. I would much rather them scale it way way back and learn about how to develop and build before undertaking what will be one of the largest apartment buildings in all of Fargo. Also, not having all of the financials sent to the city that shows their financing fully makes me nervous.

Another thing recently that made me have questions was the article saying they will be giving project teams at local university’s (UND AND U of M) up to $500,000 in a grand prize to come up with a design that utilizes mass timber? Where on earth is this company coming up with any of this money? That sort of prize money is way way way more than any architecture firm would even charge for doing this project in their proposal. Plus, UND isn’t even the school in ND that has an architecture program…(https://www.inforum.com/business/authentic-housing-taking-part-in-national-design-innovation-project) 


I really don’t want to bash this group, because I really do appreciate the goals that they want to achieve. But, the way they’ve garnered attention for this project makes me extremely nervous that they are making promises and claims that will never become reality. I hope they can do a project in Fargo, but at a much smaller scale in a location that’s much cheaper so they can prove themselves.",t2_7ngsh,DeathByMozzarella,1,1647909770.0,0,t1_i1lpt5d,i1lpt5d,True,DeathByMozzarella,t3_tjqez5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/tjqez5/honest_thoughts_authentic_housing_proposal/,Honest thoughts Authentic Housing Proposal,/r/fargo/comments/tjqez5/honest_thoughts_authentic_housing_proposal/i1lpt5d/,1,r/fargo,0,1

"Not pushing, just stating that personal vehicles are one of the largest contributors. I myself have a car, as I live somewhere that I need it to depend on. What I was trying to say is that we can design our communities to make it easier for people to either drive less, or be able to not have to rely on a personal car. We start doing that by building developments exactly like this - but we need to keep it affordable for the general public. Rents that start at $875 for a studio apartment is far more than what the median income of Fargo can afford. 

Per the US Census Bureau in 2019, the median single income in Fargo was $32k, with households being $55k.

"

Well said. When the mall was built, the creator  obviously grew up in an era of downtowns and mixed use. Seems like the whole build cities around the car concept got stronger and mixed got weaker until a decade ago

I might add West Acres is still doing very well. It's packed, very well kept and most of the store closings during the pandemic were national chains who went bankrupt

The Herberger's deal gave the appearance the mall was struggling when it was not. It's kind of shocking West Acres didn't even own that part of the building so it had no control over it and the company who owned it filed for bankruptcy 

Now West Acres owns it and within months they have a 56 million dollar investment 

What's crazy is during covid and a retail apocalypse,  the mall will end up mostly full and stronger. 

I think the best way to reinvent is to have more smaller outside accessible stores that can also be accessed from the inside. It seems like stores now want the outside visibility but the benefit of getting inside mall traffic, but the flexibility of not being required to be open 11 hours a day 6 days a week plus Sundays. In the current labor environment,  that's tough. One of my first jobs was at the mall and staffing was always an issue during the holiday season

It appears that's what they are doing 

But they better keep at it because  I doubt JC Penny's survives. They filed for bankruptcy and closed 30% of their stores but Fargo still remains open because it's busy. But eventually they will probably go broke, so we may see this same concept in their old location in the next 5 years

If you want built in traffic, build vertical. Get a hotel with event space. Get people living there. Don't depend on national chains who almost always go bankrupt and don't give a shit about the cities they operate in.

"Since people on this thread are much more negative, I want to offer a bit of support for the project.

When the mall was first created, Victor Gruen (the creator) wanted people to live, work, and play there. If West Acres plays their cards right, they can move in this direction which would make the mall much more friendly and timeless. On-site residents means built in business for tenants. If West Acres adds a grocery store to this development, or a gym, that would push more people to the area and create what Victor Gruen wanted. While prices are a bit expensive, I'm not surprised. Mall apartments tend to go for this much or greatly more due to their close proximity to amenities. Much like how downtown apartments are more expensive because of their walkability. 13th Ave is a drivers paradise and a walkers hell. Finally adding some apartments to an underutilized parcel of land directly on 13th helps to remove that. West Acres is generally considered a top tier mall, newer tenants tend to be more high profile (Pandora Jewelry, Daily Thread, Best Buy, Sephora, Crave, etc.) which points to that West Acres won't die like many other malls. But it does still need to evolve, and becoming a mixed use development with apartments, offices, grocery stores, restaurants, and normal mall tenants is  just about the best thing they can do. It helps eliminate vehicle use for residents, which Fargo and its sprawl desperately need. Anyway, I think this project is a step in the right direction and could be really good for Fargo, if West Acres plays its cards right.",t2_o60x1,Hascerflef,0,1647750386.0,0,t1_i1d8wyn,i1d8wyn,True,Significant-Ad-4184,t3_thvf89,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/thvf89/566_million_housing_and_retail_complex_planned_to/,$56.6 million housing and retail complex planned to replace Herberger's at Fargo's West Acres Shopping Center,/r/fargo/comments/thvf89/566_million_housing_and_retail_complex_planned_to/i1d8wyn/,13,r/fargo,0,13

"Sigh. 

I really like this idea/concept of infilling the space with housing, retail etc. But we need more actually affordable housing - not these luxury units that are insanely overpriced. These are Minneapolis rents in a Fargo economy. 

Also, 225 parking spots for 160 units seems like a massive overkill. If the idea is to develop and build where people have readily available and easy access to amenities, located near public transportation etc - you shouldn't need more than one space per unit. Which I know is not everyone's ideal cup of tea, but it's necessary in order to reduce greenhouse gases and the impact to climate change.

"Boy - if you can't spare the 3-4 minutes - or get stressed out waiting like that - I feel sorry for you. 

90% of the time they just smile and wave - have your receipt out where they can see it - and just walk by them... If you're not trying to hide something it's not a problem. 

10% of the time - they will ask to see the receipt - and will do a quick glance - usually it is if they saw you walking through an area of the store that theft is higher in - they do have security watching you constantly - and they do profile.  And the guy by the door does have a 2-way radio - so they can point out who they want checked. 

By the way - Target does the same thing or a similar thing.  Those guys / gals in blue security shirts are not there to help with cart return.  They are there because someone tipped them off to someone - the difference is Target won't let you come clean first - they wait until you leave the store - then they've got you.

"Here’s what I take exception to: “Board member Kay Schwarzwalter said she views the serving of minors as a ""major problem"" in the city.

""We have to remember that alcohol is a potentially lethal drug and we have to protect the public,"" she said.”

I’m not a minor, but IMO it’s not the responsibility of City of Fargo’s Liquor Control Board to protect anyone, from alcohol. It’s the parents responsibility to teach their minor children to drink responsibly, because teens have been drinking alcohol for many decades. It’s not going to stop, either. The bar owners I know don’t want the hassle of scanning ID’s. Their employees do check ID’s and when a fake ID is found, they confiscate them and turn them over to the Fargo Police. But, the teens just get another fake ID and go to another business, but they don’t even need to, if they want alcohol. At NDSU, the teens bring alcohol right to their dorm room, because no one checks for alcohol, when they come in.
