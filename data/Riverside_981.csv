You're much better off giving the above-mentioned Fire Up, DTE, Mezcal, Lake Alice a shot. Really, any downtown bar that isn't Dukes.

I'll suggest Safe Haus in MoVal (Right on the border of Riverside), Heroes on Mission Inn and Getaway Cafe across from UCR.

Downtown and wood streets are my favorite because of all the charming old houses. (That's one thing I missed about Pasadena) Alessandro Heights and Hawarden Hills neighborhoods have all that old money and new  luxury homes.

"Rural property nearby is expensive.... More than city because people are desperate for a little space and freedom.

Lots of off-road areas, and Saturday you will see dozens of pickups with quads jammed in the bed. But its like 1-2 hours away.

Downtown Riverside is a dump IMO.... homeless people all over.

Good enough music scene. Bands will play at bars and orange county and LA aren't too far away.  Plus vegas is close enough for weekend trips.  

Its really hot in the summer but its not humid.  The winter is long and very mild. It was like 70 degrees today.

As far as quiet nights....every where I have lived in Riverside there were loud mariachi parties almost every weekend in the summer.

I would say the best thing about Riverside is the people.  Compared to LA and Orange county where there is a tendency for people to be douchebags and snobs people in Riverside are very down to earth and kind but maybe a litter rough around the edges.

The worst thing in my opinion is police service.  They don't respond to most calls and are pretty much understaffed and legally powerless to do anything about the rampant property crime, drug dealing, gang activity, homlessness, etc. 

Riverside is on an economic upswing.  LA is full and people are coming east.  20 years from now it will be built up from where it is.

Traffic is bad but in the city itself it really isn't.  Mostly the freeways going to and from OC/LA are bad.

I love Riverside. If you make enough money its great. Remember, Gas is almost $6 a gallon, electric rates are double the national average, sales tax is 8.75%, and nice houses cost $700k+ while apartments are renting for $2,500+.  So you better get paid enough to make it worth while.  

Plus.....you can get pot delivered to your house (legally), you can drive like shit (fast or slow), we have great restarauntors from all over the world.  You can be religous or athiest, straight or gay, fat or thin, it don't matter...be who you want because we don't give a fuck either way.",t2_blxeddzh,PhotocopiedProgram,0,1647662332.0,0,t1_i18rlpr,i18rlpr,True,gimmiefuelgimmiefire,t3_th56gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/th56gu/i_have_a_job_interview_in_riverside_in_the_summer/,I Have a Job Interview in Riverside In the Summer.

"South riverside is WAYYY different than any other side of the city.. it's almost a whole separate city in itself...as there are alot of ""communities"" and its geographically the largest Side of the city...90% of Those communities you just named are all on the SOUTH SIDE.  And yes... they are all VERY DIFFERENT 

let's start with...

>**Casa Blanca**

I havent read any of the comments yet.. but I'm sure theres a native riversidian or a transplant that had to learn the hard way... but this is for all intents and purposes... WHERE THE SOUL OF THE SOUTH IS.

generational families.. extra protective of their community and their best interests. ***(if you can feel me)*** ....outsiders may or may not be welcomed... contingent on a number of different things...

prob equivalent of what BEDSTUY is to Brooklyn or Farrockaway is to queens  or what SOUTH BRONX is to the Bronx


>**Arlington**

Where I grew up .. 

 One minute its MIDDLE CLASS the other its UPPER MIDDLE CLASS... ..the other you'll be in .what might be perceived as a so called  "" rough neighborhood..""... 

every dozen blocks or so you kinda get a whole different vibe..  

We have a drive in theater...OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL is here..we have a HUGE MALL...GREAT SHOPPING PLAZAS..alot of schools ... and it's overall a great place for working class families . And were right by the orange groves

>**La Sierra**

Where I live now.. this place is DEFINITELY A ROLL OF THE DICE.  One minute you're next to the college and nice hang out spots around riverwalk...the next... you're watching a bum OD outside of a del taco.  As you migrate down north down magnolia or collette towards la Sierra ave.


Then... around Jones and Hole ... theres a neighborhood that's almost completly insulated by the trees ..... alotta dirt (not metaphorically..I mean literally) and mini gardens..palm trees for front yards and back yards....  middle class working people ... and college students....ALSO multi-generational families who literally claim the neighborhood as theirs...***(if you catch my drift)***


>**Victoria**

Elder. .. retirees or people who are close to retiring that wanna be left the hell alone lol.  

THE STREET IS LINED WITH VIVACIOUS AND VISUALLY STUNNING ORANGE GROVES.  A few parks .... a few schools... a few houses....  and alotta ORANGES.   Definitely where you wanna live if you wanna be left alone.

>**WoodCrest** (ORANGE CREST)

Up the hill and away from the city...The Beverly hills of RIVERSIDE.  Big houses....big money... private schools . RED AND CONSERVATIVE (not a knock at any political party but let's call it what it what it is) ...   If you got the money and can afford it... and wanna raise a family in a nice community.   This would definitely be the place 





#NOWWW


those were all the areas on the south side..The rest of em are on the EAST SIDE....

>**UCR** (not my area of expertise but I work downtown sooooo..)

Like LA SIERRA.. you have a fair share of COLLEGE KIDS WHO FREQUENT STARBUCKS AND THE HOOKA BARS.. AND THE LOCAL CLUBS AND BARS IN DOWNTOWN RIVERSIDE.  

But imagine the the population I described of the college kids that live around La Sierra University...and multiply it by 12 ...since UCR is actually a state college and not a private one. It's a lot larger and has alot more students


Alotta dorm living...  but ALSO...  you might get pressed or robbed cus like LA can fool you... so can this area.  

One half of it is ALL THE COLLEGE KIDS....by the 15 freeway.

AND the other half... as you TRAVEL down towards the 91.. IS IN THE MIDDLE OF ...

 mmmmm.....  idk How else to put it ...other than the HOOD 🤷🏻‍♂️


>**DOWNTOWN** 

COMMUNTY COLLEGE... HOSPITALS...  RESTURANTS ...CLUBS ... BARS.... JAIL...COURT...FIRE DEPARTMENT...LIBRARIES...BIG PARKS..BIG BUSINESS.... MUSEUMS....DANCE STUDIOS..ART STUDIOS....HOMELESS...the infamous mount rubidoux...  the Infamous FAIRMOUNT PARK... 

the famous RIVERSIDE THEATHER...
.RIVERSIDE CONVENTION CENTER...
MISSION INN..and Alot of other landmarks I probably missed 

DEFINITELY THE SOUL OF THE CITY.  And if we had a Mardi Gras every year itd be right here 

Like the  PROVERBIAL ""downtown"" of any city would be.. downtown riverside is no exception.  LARGE.. LOUD... PROUD.

Its definitely the PLACE... you're bringing out of town relatives and friends to have a good time when they're in town..

As far as living .....Mostly middle class... 

a vast amount of Victorian style houses that were built in the 40s and 50s.  ...... Mixed in with a little seediness... as you TRAVEL more towards FAIRMOUNT park.   Alot of homeless vagrants.   

>**The other community** 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️

I've never heard of.. so I couldnt describe it

What I described is about 40% of the city...theres still probably about 20 or more so ""communities"" that make up the city as a whole


I DIDNT REALLY READ THE REST OF YOUR POST.


BUT since I have alotta experience as my roots are here in this city and those communities specifically you named I felt compelled to share 

You'll DEFINITELY BE FINE living here.. especially if you want to see what REGULAR MIDDLE CLASS LIVING is like in southern California. 


#AND YEA.. ITS NOTHING LIKE NEW YORK 🤷🏻‍♂️

I mean I guess I kinda get the analogy your friend was tryna make by drawing the parallel between the boroughs and communities.  But naaaaa... NY is people.. 24/7 business/entertainment and most of your interactions are transactional 

Riverside is definitely a lot more like Seattle ..or Portland.. something along those lines . Populated with mostly middle to upper middle class people who wanna just go to work come and either or shop or go to dinner or a bar every now and then.

"I'm closest to Tampa. Florida as a whole is getting really expensive fast. We do have a ton of California immigration but most transplant come from Chicagoland, Cleveland, DC or Boston and New York (the alantic gets more Boston/New York transplant).

For a long while people from Chicagoland were able to sell their house and buy on in Tampa for cash. That has changed. Miami and Orlando have surprassed Chicago in cost of living.

"> When you visit, drive to the beach/mountains/LA on a weekday and a weekend day to see how you fare with the traffic, though it sounds like you're not going to be a fan. 

I'm a dawn patrol guy in Florida. I get up at 5:30 on a Sunday to get to the beach at 6:30-7:00 before the crowds get there. Usually by 9 am Florida beaches are packed. The biggest problem in Florida isn't other surfers or ""locals only"" but dealing with non-surfers (Karens) who stand in the middle of waves and  assume you are just a ""jackass"" even though they got there after you...

I kind of feel like Florida has become California without the taxes or cool action sports culture. Because utilities are crazy here, especially water and electric. Our gas isn't as bad.

"Riverside is a college town, if the different areas are any different in vibe, it's because of the culture of whichever the nearby college and of course the funding each one gets. 

I grew up here, it used to be fairly quiet before a lot of these metro apartments and and business parks went up. They built more schools of course too. Now its pretty noisy and there's more traffic than necessary for 15ish square miles. Big homeless issues too.... lots of empty buildings and weird buisness practices after the pandemic. Police here are cleaning up lately.... aggressively.

It will be breathlessly dry in the summer and its not recommended taking the shoelace express as walking may melt shoes in direct sunlight.

Rural areas are agricultural/privately owned. There's an Air Force base just outside town. The cheapest places to live are the central/ mid-town apartments or the trailer parks.  But there's a lot of single-room/shared room options everywhere because of the college students...

The punk scene is long gone. No metal...But there are bars ...you might like Morgans Tavern, Crowleys Tavern, Events, or Lake Alice.

"Thanks for the detailed response. Good to hear that Skateboarding, Surfing and Snowboarding all have a place in town. As does Moto. Even here in Florida, I have to drive an hour, sometimes an 1:10 or an 1:20 to get to beach to surf depending on traffic. I'm sure Riverside is similar. Most people in inland Florida don't surf and are honestly unaware of it. It's different from California.

Hockey exists here but I also have to drive an hour to go play. I will say from what I know from reading USA Hockey, while California isn't Minnesota, I feel like out of any Sunbelt state you guys have the best hockey scene.

For Rock Music I really love Stoner/Desert rock as well as thrash metal, skate punk, blues and classic rock.

"lifelong resident (well other than a few years in LA and corona) of Riverside. Reply back to my post if you have any questions or DM, but I love Riverside/ SoCal in general. Could just be biased or because I grew up there and it is what I'm used to, but of all the traveling I've done and places I've stayed, I just don't see myself living anywhere else. My sister has lived in various states, and I have family in various states, but none of it seems to compare. 

Starting off with your paragraph about the neighborhoods, yes, they feel different, but not as much as in LA. What I mean is that some are predominantly Hispanic, some are nicer areas with million+ dollar homes, some are just vintage feeling i.e. wood streets near downtown. I've lived off of Victoria and spent time near there, CB, UCR (my alma mater), and Hawarden mostly. 

Skateboarding is pretty big in Riverside I'd say (there's a @ Riversideskateboarding Instagram page i believe). As for snowboarding, I feel like this always depends on the friends group i.e. the snowboarders I would know all seem to hang out with one another and go. Lots of people i know used to go surfing on weekends or early weekdays if they have off.

Off-roading is common, though not something I'm into, but know friends who ride all around. There's apps to find trails too. You can find trails like these all over southern California. Also, Pat Casey held the most recent X-games at his house, and Axel Hodges held motocross at his house (though that is like an hour-2 away from Riverside). 

For Rock music, be more specific? We have Goth Nite at Aurea Vista downtown on Thursday and that's fun, Chain Reaction/ The Glasshouse/ 1720/ HOB/ etc etc are all an hour drive or even less. A fan of heavier music myself, let me know what you're into and I will try and steer you in the right direction.

The town is split with Dodgers/ Angels, with a slight lean towards Angels IMO, but the stadium is like 30-40 minutes away without traffic, and you can ride the train on Fridays to home games.

As for Hockey, it varies, not as big here but definitely picked up speed over the years. Vegas GK fan here, but still like the Ducks. 

As for cheap/ safe, unless you're buying a mansion or living in the absolute ghetto, its all about the same anywhere you go IMO.",t2_4j87myh8,el_payaso_mas_chulo,0,1647633607.0,0,t1_i171qge,i171qge,True,gimmiefuelgimmiefire,t3_th56gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/th56gu/i_have_a_job_interview_in_riverside_in_the_summer/,I Have a Job Interview in Riverside In the Summer.

"Riverside is a big of a hodge podge, which is a bad thing for planning and traffic but a good thing for variety.  Our various neighborhoods are all somewhat different but none of them, not even downtown, approaches the level of urbanization of pretty much anywhere in New York City.   But if you do like urban pedestrian living, Downtown is pretty good.  If your job offer is in downtown, I would also consider living in Downown as the best commute in Riverside is commute, as traffic can be terrible.   I grew up in Grand/Wood Streets, lived in Downtown, and now live in Victoria, while they are all fairly close they all have a pretty different vibe.   Housing in all of them is very expensive compared to historical norms.    


Riverside is known as a place that is an hour away from everything.  With traffic that is more like 90 minutes though. But we have beaches, mountains, deserts, lakes, multiple major cities, theme parks, all within an hour or so away.  Whatever it is you like to do, it can probably be done from living here.    


As far as sports loyalties go, I am not a baseball fan, but I doubt you would have any problems if you liked one over the other.  People tend to like both and if either the Dodgers or the Angeles are in the World Series or something people will be supportive.    Most people do not care enough about any sort of rivalry between the two.   I remember everyone went nuts when the Angeles won the World Series in 2002 and once again when the Dodgers did in 2020.  I think most of the enthusiasm is that its a Southern California team.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you want a quiet living, you can get that.  The biggest noise will be traffic vs partying.   By far the biggest nuisance is going to be traffic.  A lot of suburban neighborhoods can be every bit as loud as Downtown (which many places are actually fairly quiet).

"Metal head in Riverside. Since Covid, that music scene is not nearly as strong. Not too aware of local shows since the pandemic; I'd say the genres here are heavily punk/metalcore-esque.

"Heavy traffic. It’s expensive, but more affordable than other areas in So Cal. Kings dominate in this region and so do Dodgers. Especially Riverside. Every now and then you’ll see Angel gear and Ducks gear. I’m gonna keep it real with you, most of these folks are either Caucasian, 4th generation Hispanic, Asian or triple digit makers. Lol. Also comparing Riverside neighborhoods to the 5 boroughs is funny. I understand the concept, but no, other than finding people of different shapes, sizes, colors, and ideas, it’s probably nothing like NYC. Riverside is a quieter small city. Nightlife is cool. Downtown is on the quieter side. They have a few bars that might be to your liking, MCL and Lake Alice. They’re your typical dive bars. I know MCL has their goth or emo nights. I’m honestly not sure what they properly title these events. Skating culture is huge here, good luck trying to snowboard, even during winter you have to pack up and head at least 1:35 to try and get that pleasure. Surfing is huge. Closest beaches are Newport and Corona Del Mar. 40 min. Depending on traffic, might be a longer drive. Off-roading is a culture here, don’t worry about that. Nothing is cheap, (well your definition of cheap might be different than others) and if you made it in Jersey, you’ll be fine here.

"I'm from the Riverside area and lived in NYC for a while - I have no idea what those people are talking about.  The two couldn't be more different.  *Maybe* I could see a vague, generic similarity in that Riverside has pretty well-defined neighborhoods, but that's it.  That is a benefit - there are traditional Southern California bungalow neighborhoods, mid-century ranch house neighborhoods, and modern tract home neighborhoods.  Amenities are no issue.  Riverside is the core of inland Southern California, but it's also pretty quiet as it's on the fringe of the Los Angeles megalopolis.

As far as sports loyalties, I'd say it's roughly split between Dodgers and Angels, depending on whether, when your family moved out there in the 1980s or 1990s for cheaper housing, they came from L.A. County or Orange County.  It's about 60 miles from Dodger Stadium, and for night games you'll be going against commuter traffic so it's usually not too bad a drive.  Same for concerts.

It gets *hot* in the summer.  Mid 90s to low 100s are average.  But it is dry, and air conditioning is ubiquitous.

If you can get used to the traffic patterns, it's quite easy to access and spend a day at the beach or in the mountains.  On a Saturday morning you can easily just go to beach for a couple hours and head home without it being an all-day proposition.  I'm not into it, but there are a lot of people into motocross and off-roading, and they seem to find plenty of opportunities.  I grew up in a rural area of the county and it's safe overall.  There is a lot of rural space, and people enjoy having horses and privacy.  Of course, some people will use that privacy for nefarious purposes, but rural living is a fine option if you can avoid such areas.

A lot of people will say negative things about living in the Riverside area, but it's a lovely place to live if you can afford housing, if you don't have to commute to L.A. or Orange County, and if your need for big city entertainment and social life is only occasional.",t2_12ac94,sweetnourishinggruel,0,1647627968.0,0,t1_i16nvo7,i16nvo7,True,gimmiefuelgimmiefire,t3_th56gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/th56gu/i_have_a_job_interview_in_riverside_in_the_summer/,I Have a Job Interview in Riverside In the Summer.

I’ve been living in riverside for college as I attend UCR and the city where I’m from is next to Los Angeles so for me it was a big change of pace. Riverside is quiet and things are spread far apart from one another unless you live right near the super center of stores. That being said the shopping centers are quite nice and vast. There’s a lot of hiking and def space to go off roading and yes the mountains are near to go snowboarding if you consider at an hour drive as “near.” As fore mentioned I’m from a city near LA so when I drive home to visit it’s at least 40 min on a clear no traffic day but to actually reach LA it’s at least an hour. If you like going to the beach expect the drive there to be at least 1hr and 30min more if there’s traffic. Riverside is nice and very pretty due to the canyons but it’s a quiet city. Downtown riverside is quite nice but other than that there’s nothing there major to do. Since I have been living here I do see that it is common to drive to neighboring cities to go eat or do activities but that is something I see as a pro bc you get to see other sides of the area. Also there are homeless people in riverside and sometimes bad things do happen but that’s how it is everywhere in California . Also the weather is dry heat so it’s quite nice since it’s not stuffy or wet humidity. It does get really windy at times but most often the wind is quite nice. It does rain but that usually depends on the entire winter season here to see how much we actually get. But the summers are hot! So be prepared!

30 mins from the mountains with snow ( big bear ...mount high etc)

Deserts are everywhere ...remember southern California is literally a desert 

Sports ....you have all the teams .....I... one city over from riverside is ontario and rancho Cucamonga which house the Toyota arena.... they have all sports there.....nba pre season games.....hockey etc...  there is also a minor league baseball stadium as well ...which is a feeder league for the dodgers.....riverside is huge geographically.....huge Mexican population ( all tho all ethnicities are here )

Riverside does have gangs and ""hoods""

Literally 3 ppl killed in front of my house last week( look up arlanza shooting )

But I live in a rougher neighborhood......if you make good money there are dozens of nice areas in riverside .....

Weather is great 

But be prepared for heavy traffic and $6.50 gas prices if you come here

"If you're heading west on Jurupa Ave. there's a bunch of new homes right after you pass Van Buren full of upper class white families which are driving up the prices for the community just south of that. Already affected heavily by the pandemic, some families have sold their homes and the new buyers are also predominantly white. It's been affecting the community for a few years now, there's a Wendy's in that community on Arlington that USED to be a family-run restaurant. This area has also been affected by a severe form of ecological racism. It used to be a cheap place to live and the area used to be (just 20 years ago) full of violence and drugs, and part of what made it so inexpensive to live there was that there used to be a military base nearby which dumped hazardous materials there. The hazardous materials leeched into the groundwater and now residents who have lived in the area for decades have an elevated risk of thyroid cancer/ thyroid issues due to the nature of the hazardous materials the military didn't dispose of properly.",t2_8a3u38y,StabTheFire,0,1647385738.0,0,t1_i0tbs8g,i0tbs8g,True,nia_saldana18,t3_raqlso,https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/raqlso/gentrification_in_riverside/,Gentrification in Riverside,/r/Riverside/comments/raqlso/gentrification_in_riverside/i0tbs8g/,1,r/Riverside,0,1

"It's been a minute since I took the test. 

> 1.) Sometimes, I always stop before the stop sign like behind that line, but then I couldnt see if traffic is going at a direction that i wanna turn to so I have to creep in a little bit and stop again so that I can clearly see the traffic and then turn when it is safe to do so...Is this good? Im worried the examiner will mark me an error on that one and what changes should I make on this one if it is wrong.

That's fine. You come to a complete stop behind the Limit Line, then proceed when it's clear to do so. If you need to creep out to gain visibility, that's also fine. 

> 2.) Is it legal that I can safely turn right on a solid red light unless the light shows that it is a right arrow red line. For me, the cars behind me honking their horn because i am not turning right on a solid red line lmao i had to wait for the green light then i turn right

Is there a question here? The way you described it is accurate. Rights-on-red are legal, except when posted otherwise, or if the red light is an arrow. If people are honking behind you, ignore them.

> 3.)I hope on my test day, I get a chill , lenient, and laid back examiner, but man having harsh examiner will make me nervous i dont know why. Regardless of what kind of examiner I get, any tips on how to remove the fear i have if ever i get a grumpy or harsh examiner on test day

Sorry, no tips here. I'm sure it'll be fine, though. 

> 4.) When I change lanes, do I look at my rearview mirror, side mirror and look over the shoulder all 3 of them as fast as i can and then complete the lane when its safe to do so, I only check side mirror and look over my shoulder and then lane change when its safe thats it lol, but if this is wrong let me know.

I was taught SMOG. Signal, Mirror, Over-the-shoulder, Go. 

You don't have to use your rear-view mirror. Just signal the lane-change, check your side mirror, glance over your shoulder, then get over. Don't try to rush through this; there's no time limit or anything. 

> 4.) If you have helpful tips that you think I didnt cover, Please write down in the comments below, and if any of you experienced taking the behind the wheel test at DMV RIVERSIDE EAST. Please share with me what kind of tips and routes I can be expecting.

DON'T BUMP THE CURB. When pulling into a space, don't let your front wheel come to rest on the little curb stop thing. It's one of a few Critical Driving Errors that will be an automatic failure. I took my test in Rancho Cucamonga, so I don't know anything about your DMV.

"We're kind of a mixed bag all over the IE with various gyms, but most of us are 24 Hour Fitness members & since they let each member take 2 people with them, there is plenty of room for everyone. Mostly we go to either the one in Beastvale or the one on Madison in Riverside. We also do stuff like hiking various spots around here, and indoor rock climbing at Hangar 18, but there's never any pressure to do anything. We started out as a game dev group and that's still our overall theme, but it's really just morphed into a bunch of local people helping each other out in any/all fascists of life.

"I have worked in Property Tax assessment at the BOE for thirty years  
I run the Southern California office of the Board of Equalization and I am committed to using my knowledge in this very specialized field to protect your rights and provide fair and equitable property tax administration. This is my life’s work.  
Schools and local communities rely on property tax revenue. I want to see robust revenue streams to solve problems. There is an affordable housing crisis and homelessness is rampant. The family home is one of the few avenues for working and middle class families to build wealth.  
Many believe property tax law is written in stone. In fact, property tax law changes every year. You deserve someone with the experience and knowledge necessary to navigate these changes.  
I will support laws that encourage the highest levels of owner occupied home ownership. I will fight against loopholes.

"I've read that study. If you look at the methods, they were done via laboratory abstracts, and do not represent real-world scenarios (In one study, they attempted to prove masks were effective by separating COVID +/- hamsters via walls made of the same material of surgical masks). They did not take into account how the general public fit them to their faces. 

Here's a link to a peer-reviewed and published study that used a mannequin, and a pretty ingenious method of aerosol distribution to create as close to real-life scenarios as possible to measure the efficacy of various types of masks:

[https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0057100](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0057100)

Please read it for yourself, but the conclusion was that cloth masks were only 9.8% effective, blue disposable 12%, and KN95s with 3mm gaps around the face were only 3.4% effective. 

So while not completely ineffective (there was a 65% efficacy for K95 if properly fitted), there's still one other problem. Wearing a mask dramatically increases the amount of times you touch your face. The more you touch your face, the more you're putting germs around your eyes/nose/mouth and into the fabric of the mask itself. In addition, reusing any type of mask dramatically decreases its effectiveness and can end up having you inhale more germs (either from yourself, or whatever bacteria it picked up depending on where you keep your mask when its off). 

We haven't seen a real study on that as of yet (at least as far as I could find), but I believe an argument could be made that having the general public wearing masks might be *increasing* the spread, or at minimum, doing nothing to prevent it. 

None of this is situation is ideal, and there's no easy way to get out of it. Vaccines didn't solve it, masking hasn't, shutting down didn't, quarantine didn't, travel bans didn't...... I get that people want to feel like they have control, and masks are an easy way to do that. Masks have become more of a tribalism identifier than anything. Unfortunately, and I don't say this lightly, I believe the only way forward *is* to go back to normal for those that can. There's nothing left for us to do, and staying in this perpetual COVID era is also slowly eroding our freedom, and any unity we had left as a country. 

I appreciate your final comments, and they're a rare breath of fresh air here on Reddit. I know that we're certainly of different viewpoints, but I'm glad we could discuss them without demagoguery. 

I'm constantly researching this topic, and triple checking any new sources of information that come through the news or via the NIH/CDC. I don't want to be responsible for harming people around me, but at this time, based on peer-reviewed articles and cross-referencing them with real-world data, I'm confident that I'm not a health risk to the general public.

"I'll try to answer each point.

Yes, there is some political stigma and science associated with any generic study to suit someone's particular point of view. I tend to stick to more rigorous studies and will provide this study done early 2021 on mask usage if it interests you.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883189/

What is interesting about COVID in general is that we were essentially seeing ""live"" science play out to the world population. By that I mean that the CDC in general really dropped the ball on this and how governments handled it, but I will stick to the US for now. Initially we had professionals saying no masks needed to now we need them, then we don't again, followed by recommendations to use them, etc. What this accomplished was the general public losing trust or not knowing what to believe anymore (in regards to masks). We know well enough *now* how the virus can be transmitted and even studies like this in early 2021 highlighted this, but now it's more like the boy who cried wolf type of situation. 

Masks help, but they are not the end all be all type of cure that would make the virus just disappear. With that, we both agree on there not being a single country that has demonstrated this because it has to be an all or nothing type of thing that has to be done, which as you said, it is impossible to do so. 

That being said, of course I don't see people as evil for not even knowing they might have the virus or are tiny incubators. The thing that is troubling is that because of the incubation period of the virus before symptoms happen, why not just wear a mask so you don't spread it onto things. 

I do think that you are right in thinking of personal responsibility and risk. Just like there used to be smoking only sections in restaurants or knowing to be responsible to not drink and drive, we should be accountable for our actions and choices; whether we draw the line at a mask or some other issue I think we probably have different viewpoints, but I can see your opinion and respect that.",t2_frbsz,XGhoul,0,1645133244.0,0,t1_hxd1egm,hxd1egm,False,Grouchy-Trouble-1414,t3_su0ucv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/su0ucv/masks/,Masks,/r/Riverside/comments/su0ucv/masks/hxd1egm/,2,r/Riverside,0,2
"I know I'm correct. The scientific data has been clear on this since mid-2021. The only thing that's changed now is the political science...

Masking the general public won't work, and it's never worked. From the day they required it, it's just been a tool to calm the masses. Its real function is to make the government look like they have some control over COVID and are working towards solving this crisis. 

If wearing a mask makes you *feel* safer, that's great, keep it up! But when you get angry at those that don't want to wear masks anymore because they don't work, at least show real-world data as to why they're wrong, don't just call them ""Trumpers"". 

I'm happy to be proven wrong though. So please, give me the data that has shown success in masking a population. It's not like I'm some murderous monster, not caring about your grandma... I'm happy to do what works, and I obviously prefer that no one else dies. However, I'm not ""Evil"" to not want to participate in pointless mandates that have ruined any credibility the government did have, and has now created even more tribalism...which is back to my original point, that the words ""Normalcy"" and ""Freedom"" now scare some in our country. 

The idea that governments were going to be able to out-mandate an incredibly contagious virus was, and still is, laughable to anyone slightly libertarian. People give way too much credit to the abilities of the government to do anything positive. Never forget that the government is run by bureaucrats and politicians intersted in self-preservation and reelection, nothing more. (In fact, just today, I read in the NYT that South Korea, the shining example of mask compliance, vaccination, and government intervention & tracking, has given up most of their attempts of tracking and working with the general population, and is now focusing on elderly and high-risk individuals only, because the masking and safety steps didn't work). 

I'm sorry that you have to deal with immunocompromised individuals. I have elderly grandparents as well, with one that cannot be vaccinated. However, they all believe, as do I, that it's a personal burden for them to deal with, and not something society in general needs to adjust to meet their needs  (They go shopping in the morning, avoid crowds and large gatherings...we test for COVID before visiting). Me masking doesn't really help them one way or another. 

Plus, if we were to follow your logic of protecting all segments of our society from potential harm, we shouldn't stop at mandating mask coverings, we should also outlaw alcohol again, since there are alcoholics and they cause 10k+ deaths a year. Or we should limit cholesterol in restaurant recipes via mandate, because 50% of US adults die of heart disease....or helmets in cars along with a seatbelt.

"This is such a shit take on so many levels.

I'll give you some free rope first. 

Statistically, you are correct that tiny numbers are a drop in the bucket and there have been people that never got vaccinated and never contracted it. (And there are people that have got vaccinated and a booster who still got the virus)

Here is your dosage of reality which seems to get overlooked. If you get the virus without vaccination you have a *higher* chance of dying from it rather than typical flu-like symptoms where you don't need to get hospitalized if you were vaccinated. 

I have family members on both ends of the spectrum to not talk out of my ass about things (complete anti-vax and never got it to fully booster and contracted it). I also have a situation with elderly immunocompromised individuals, since I am the only one who can infect them (and kill them) I take my precautions very seriously. I also work in a biochem workplace that I probably never need the mask since I rarely ever get sick. Even if there is a tiny insignificant percent chance that a mask helps or not, I am certainly not going to be a mouthbreather walking around like an idiot pretending everything is okay or that my rights are being imposed upon seeing some of the idiots parading Trump flags in 2022 around the area.",t2_frbsz,XGhoul,0,1645122236.0,0,t1_hxc88gs,hxc88gs,False,Grouchy-Trouble-1414,t3_su0ucv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/su0ucv/masks/,Masks,/r/Riverside/comments/su0ucv/masks/hxc88gs/,3,r/Riverside,0,3

The pizza place is the best. They use a wood fine oven so it gives the pie a good char. The Baba chicken place is wack. They are just riding the chicken sandwich trend. Their flavor is no good.

"It’s so funny to see people talk about about how much there is to do in Riverside now.

"I am a Riverside lifer, and for as much as I want to favor Riverside in the Riverside vs Redlands rivalry, the two cities are more or less in the same greater metro zone.  Your personal preferences are really going to play more than anything.   Because you have no attachment to either one, you should probably pick the one that will eliminate your possible commute as much as possible.   If you work in Riverside, especially downtown, you are better off living in Riverside.   Downtown Riverside is a pretty lively place, I lived there for a few years in my late 20s (originally from the wood streets) and it was great, and this was during the recession, its much better (but also much more expensive) now.    


If you are going to work at UCR, RCC, Riverside Community Hospital, or for a state agency in Downtown Riverside, I would highly, highly recommend picking Downtown as your spot.   But granted, if you are working in Redlands or Loma Linda, you are better off living in those areas.   Riverside and Redlands are less than 20 miles apart, its not a bad drive to do when you want, but its better to not have to do it twice a day.    


Downtown Riverside does have another major advantage over Redlands that a lot of people never take advantage of.  The Metrolink Station.  While not known for mass transit, we actually have a train that can can get you from Downtown Riverside to Los Angeles Union Station (which is very close to DTLA) in an hour or so, no bullshit stress inducing traffic.  You sit and chill for an hour.  If your job requires you to go to DTLA once a week or a few times per month for whatever reason, the Metrolink will be quicker, cheaper, and way less of a head ache than driving.  Once you hit LA Union Station you have access to pretty much every form of transit in Los Angeles.

"I will try that. I remember it well. I remember him well.

Truth is, I know his name. 

I've searched his name on Google, so many times. But I find nothing. Like, nothing. (Or maybe I'm searching incorrectly, I'm definately not paying some site for  mailing address and phone number details, those things seem like scams, and I'm not ring to stalk the guy. If he is so removed from an intenet footprint, it is most likely because he didn't want to be found via the internet. ) One time years ago, while searching his name, there was a blurry out of focus picture that might have been him. Like a scanned copy of an old Polaroid.
His work is hard to find, though it was truly brilliant. He was gifted. He was shy, complicated, honest, tortured, and very much an sevant and empath, which is one reason his paintings were so poinient. He was so very talented. His mental state had him move into seclusion and then he just up and dissapeared. He may not be with us anymore. I honestly don't know. I search for him from time to time still. This is the first time I have reached out to anyone else. On the off chance someone else may have known him.
I've tried so hard to find proof (online) that he even exists.
That painting, at the coffee shop, is one of the very few actual pieces of actual tangible evidence. It proves that at some point, he was there. He existed. He was my friend. 

It's a great piece of art. Though he had so many others. Can anyone find more work from this artist? 
Does anyone else know his name besides me?
Is he still out there? 
Does anyone have anymore of his work?

"Native plants are great for a number of reasons. 

They use way less water than pretty much anything labelled as drought resistant or water efficient because they are adapted to our specific rainfall patterns.

They don't need or want fertilizer, but they do like mulch such as their own fallen leaves so you don't need to rake around them.

They work together to suppress weeds. If you have a yard full of natives you will have very little weeding and you aren't having to mow all the time.

Native wildlife like them better than anything non-native. If you wan to save the bees, plant native. You will get tons of butterflies, moths, hummingbirds, and the birds that eat those as well. Remember, more wildlife is also carbon sequestration.

Trees and large shrubs along roads reduce sightlines and cause drivers to drive slower.

Many of our sages and sagebrush's smell amazing. Some can be used as ground cover and lawn substitute. 

We have lots of edible natives, elderberry makes good pies and jams, sugarbush and lemonade berry can be turned into a lemonade like drink. Nevin's Barberry and Toyon are edible. Black sage can be used on cooking. Prickly Pear fruit are delicious and you can cook the pads. We have blackberries and desert grapes, there are others as well.

Planting natives helps protect our wildlife and keeps Riverside looking unique.",t2_b9ggj4m3,StormAutomatic,0,1644009980.0,0,t1_hvm67l8,hvm67l8,True,StormAutomatic,t3_skoj49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/skoj49/see_what_native_plants_grow_where_you_live/,See what native plants grow where you live,/r/Riverside/comments/skoj49/see_what_native_plants_grow_where_you_live/hvm67l8/,6,r/Riverside,0,6

"We can do something about this. This is what Tactical Urbanism is for. We can make temporary modifications, document them and present them to the city, or just make them permanent without permission.

Corn starch and water makes a good street chalk we can use to make lanes narrower, expand bike paths, and increase crosswalk visibility. Large visible Objects in the center of low traffic intersections slow drivers. Trees and large bushes not only provide shade but make streets feel narrower and slows drivers. We can use leaves to create sneckdowns and reclaim unused parts of the road for cyclists and pedestrians.

"Going to complicate this for you a bit, but you might need to find a welder (or other professional, maybe a skilled plumber) that can do brazing. 

The main difference is in welding you are melting the base metals (dog tag and mug) to fuse then, and in brazing you use a filler material with a lower melting point to join the base metals. Because of the lower temperature (and assuming the correct filler is used) you are less likely to lose the stainless steel's anti rust properties and less likely to make a hold on the mug. Since the mug likely uses a vacuum between the inner and outter steel walls, any pinhole will irreversibly ruin its insulating properties. 

Finally I think (but I am absolutely not an expert, talk to whoever does the work for you) brazing filter can be melted off so that the dog tag could be removed from the mug in the future.
