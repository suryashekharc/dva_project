"I was thinking about this today. I particularly like downtown Kirkland, since it is relatively open, safe, clean, and that scenic. I've really enjoyed having many of the amenities in walking distance (or a short drive away) too. Also, I'm not 100% sure if this is just a place families visit or not, but whenever I go out, I often see a lot of families, new and old, which has been relatively calming as well. But, I guess to answer you questions, the things I like the most are:

* the openness (can see the sky / views in the distance / something calming)

"For Kirkland you can get an appointment to ask questions about specific permitting types and what it takes to get the permits. They’re really helpful, but I agree with the other comments that the permits can be a nightmare depending on your property. You can also use the Building Department’s website to look up your specific lot and see if there’s anything like wet lands or waterways (creeks/drainage) anywhere near it. There’s a pretty firm 50’ (or more) set back from water that’s pretty much impossible to get around, so knowing that can save you a lot of time.

"Good suggestion and yes.

He did cross country this year. I was *certain* that was going to lead to some connections. But it didn't happen for him. Something like 60+ kids on the team, which didn't give many opportunities for small groups to bond.

He's not an athletic kid and we stopped making him do the traditional sports leagues a few years ago when skill levels start diverging widely. We're looking into swimming at Juanita HS because he swims well.

Bottom line: he's shy and friend-making skills have to be learned. Because he's not practiced at it, he can't easily make a buddy in a new school where kids have only ever seen half his face. Which results in him not improving his social skill practice, which exacerbates the cycle.

"I think the area that at the west of 124th Ave and south of pipeline trail belongs to Kirkland but served with those two schools OP mentioned.

The Kingsgate is a peaceful neighborhood in general (except the condo area around Safeway). Many old kind peoples and they are very friendly. Kinda of like an everyone-knows-everyone hood. I know many of my neighbors names and talk with them occasionally. The houses are all with similar 70s styles. Split entry or tri-levels, with relatively small footprint but big backyard.

"North Kirkland is a nice area, and you absolutely need a car (or two). Woodmoor Elementary and Northshore MS are in the highly rated Northshore School District; not sure how those specific schools are rated. Kirkland is served by the Lake Washington School District, which is also considered to be a very good district. The elementary schools in the north part of the Lake Washington SD closest to Woodinville  are Muir and Frost (within a couple of miles of each other). Not sure if you know the area, but if you don’t and you’re looking on the east side, also consider Redmond, Issaquah, Bellevue, and Sammamish.  Pros about north Kirkland are: easy freeway access (but traffic can be frustrating ), nice new shopping center close by (Village at Totem Lake), close to hospital and clinics, renovation of a large, family friendly  park (132nd Square), and you’re not too far from places like Target, Costco, Home Depot, Fred Meyer, and a ton of places to eat.

"I’ve made my suggestions based on the observed condition in the photo of a basically empty parking lot and a large fire apparatus parked across multiple parking spots.  I made an assumption they were NOT on a call because if they were, I would expect them to occupy the fire lane of the location of the call right up front (if that makes sense).  They want a buffer because a “call” can happen anytime and they’d like some buffer so they can work with their truck.  Again, just my suggestion of occupational tradecraft on the photo originally presented.  

The notion of “new parkers” parking them in is legit in this region unfortunately.  It’s sad that some may park right next to a large fire apparatus like that with no forethought to give these guys a bit of room.  They’re on the clock so maybe leave them in peace with a big “buffer of kindness” because they’re out there keeping us safe.

"Not sure if you’ve ever driven an oversized vehicle or fire apparatus in parking area, but it’s not easy.  Many times parking long and legging it in is just an ease of use for the driver who likely has saving lives on the mind, rather than painted stripes on the pavement.  

Given it’s a fire apparatus,  they likely want to keep space around it should they get a call and need to depart quickly.   Much like why police don’t park in your driveway when they come to your home in a call.  They keep it in the street.   It’s called  tradecraft and perhaps it should be allowed for emergency services?

Further it allows access to the equipment on board (especially the back medic area) so they could reasonably assist should they need to unexpectedly.  Again, tradecraft. 

Finally, door dings.  Hot ride like that they don’t want it dinged up from all those fussy folks who need to park as close to the building as possible. (I’m kidding).

"I like to get drunk, so I can recommend my two favorite alcohol focused establishments: Flatstick and Wilde Rover.

Flatstick truly only has drinks, no food except a couple bags of chips. They also do not have any sort of hard liquor. The menu consists entirely of PNW beer and cider. The selling point are the games. They have an indoor mini golf course, they have a unique shuffleboard style game that is super fun called duffleboard, they have an N64 for Mario kart, and they have a whole mess of board games. Always a super fun time. 

Wilde Rover is a classic no frills Irish pub. The atmosphere is nice, dimly lit and they actually have food. Their patio is also killer, huge outdoor balcony deck. They used to have live music on the weekends too, not sure about now. They have a single traditional shuffleboard table and 2 pool tables. 

Honorable mention goes to Bottle and Bull as others have mentioned. Exceedingly classy, much moreso than the other two on this list. Great time but not a place you'd want a ton of rounds at because it's expensive. I usually get the first drink and a snack (truffle fries yes plz 🤤) at Bottle and Bull and then do the rest of my drinking at the other two places.

"Hi there! I went to NU for undergrad, Kirkland local. Depending on what you’re going to school for, be weary. For my undergrad, I transferred from CWU and had to take 6 theological classes: Old Testament, New Testament, Jesus the messiah, etc. this added a semester to my time line because I hadn’t planned on 18 religious credits! I was a political science major and did not feel prepared at all for post grad. While my professors were helpful and personable, the school itself did close to nothing to actually help facilitate relationships with local companies. All my connections I made during undergrad were on my own accord. The school’s career counselor was never on campus, didn’t answer emails, not helpful at all. As far as the money, it’s private school pricing. I didn’t have scholarships so paid full ticket and it hurts now paying loans back! I think if there’s another program for your interests, check that out. The school is really aimed towards theology and very little money goes into other programs.

"The vanguard funds are a solid choice.  You should also be maxing a Roth IRA if you meet the income requirements.  In emergencies, you can pull your contribution penalty free.

If I recall correctly, The Intelligent Investor's Benjamin Graham recommended not having more than 5% of your portfolio in one company.  Index funds make that easy.  Actually I'd recommend reading the book.  It's been updated by a new author and the two styles are a little hard to read, but Graham's advice and especially the historical perspective are very powerful in helping give tools to feel confident in your strategy.

"I appreciate the insight. 

I am already contributing 10% to my employer 401k. I've been regularly contributing to my 401k since I entered the workforce, but I wasn't always able to contribute the max amount, but I've increased over the years. I have always chosen majority (80%) of that investment to go into a Vanguard Target 20XX retirement fund, and a little (20%) in company stock.

I had asked the original question because I was wondering if there are other opportunities I should be pursuing as well. Since my 401k is heavily invested in the Vanguard funds I was curious what other options I should consider to help diversify myself. And I figured doing some sort of investing outside of my 401k would be good since it would be more liquid if I ever ran across a situation where I needed to access funds for some reason.",t2_13e19y,eklektos51,0,1619797213.0,0,t1_gwfqaml,gwfqaml,False,eklektos51,t3_n1c6pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kirkland/comments/n1c6pw/fiduciary_recommendations/,Fiduciary recommendations,/r/Kirkland/comments/n1c6pw/fiduciary_recommendations/gwfqaml/,1,r/Kirkland,0,1

"I have always done my own investing because I'm too cheap to pay someone 1% of my invested money to manage it for me.  Here are some basic concepts and thoughts for you:

A really important question to ask upfront is: when are you going to need this money and how  much risk can you tolerate.  You said you're in your 30s so, e.g, if you need the money for retirement and you retire at a ""normal"" time (e.g. late 50s?  early 60s?) you might need it in 25-30 years.  That kind of a longer time window allows you to take more risks, especially at the beginning.

In investing, higher possible risks usually (and should) go hand in hand with higher possible returns.  There are no hard rules but here are things people invest in from highest historical volatility (and highest historical returns on investment) down to lowest historical risk (and lowest historical returns):

crypto currenciesprivate market stocks / angel investing / venture capitalindividual stocks (i.e. shares of a public company)REITsan ETF, index fund or mutual fund composed of many companies' stockscorporate bondsmunicipal bondsmoney market fundsUS government bonds / tbillsa savings account or CD

On the riskier side, the S&P500 (i.e. the stocks of the 500 largest companies in the USA) has returned (on average) [10-11% per year since the 1920s](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp).  Government bonds, on the other hand, are low risk and have returned [5-6% per year over the same time period](https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/investing_bonds.moneymag/index3.htm)... and return next to nothing right now because interest rates are very low.  Today, if you buy a 10 year government bond you will earn 1.65% on it.

So why would anyone buy bonds?  Because they are way less volatile.  Stocks can drop by a lot in a very short period of time.  They have always recovered, eventually, but it's hard to watch your investments depreciate in value during a market crash, it's hard to resist selling when the shit hits the fan, and it stinks to wait for the value of your investment to claw its way back out of the hole.  Take a look at some historical market crashes like 1929, 2000, 2008, spring 2020, etc... If you had $500k invested when it crashed, how low would your balance have gone?  How freaked out would you be?  How long would it take to come back to the original value?  This is a key bit of introspection and it's hard to do hypothetically.  But you really, really do not want to panic and sell during a crash.  That's how you lose money.  When the stock market declines I try to find more money to sink into it.  Because, as it recovers, your returns will be disproportionally large.  For example, the return on the S&P500 since (bottom of) the crash last year in has been in neighborhood of 80%.

The standard way to do this is, if you can stomach it and have a long time horizon until you need the money, is to invest in higher risk / higher return things like stocks and stock funds.  As you get closer to the time when you need the money, shift more and more of it to less volatile and lower return investments (e.g. bonds).  You can also just buy vehicles that do this for you: they are called ""target date funds"".  e.g. There's a Vanguard fund for target date 2040 that will rebalance the risk profile automatically over time.

Ok, now let's talk about diversification.  Putting all of your money in Tesla, bitcoin (or GME!) is a pretty risky bet.  If Elon sells more cars (or bitcoin, or clean energy credits) you'll do great.  But if he misses an earnings target, smokes weed online, calls a Thai diver a pedoguy, etc... the stock may suffer (well, it still didn't, but it might).  Having ""all of your eggs in one basket"" is risky.

There are ETFs, index funds and mutual funds that are essentially baskets of stocks.  e.g. SPY is a fund that has the stocks of the 500 largest public US companies in it (proportionally to their size).  Tesla is one of those companies and so is Microsoft.  Hypothetically, Tesla might drop in value next year and, again hypothetically, Microsoft might rise.  Those opposite movements will offset each other and your investment is at less risk.

Another way to get diversity is to mix assets (e.g. have 70% of your money in stocks and stock funds and 30% in safer bonds).  Your risk is lower this way so your returns will tend to be less... but when the market crashes you'll lose less money.  Shifting this allocation 70/30, 65/35, 60/40, etc... is what that ""target date fund"" I mentioned is doing automatically.

One more thing: all of these funds charge you money every year you hold them.  It's called the ""expense ratio"" and it has to be listed in the prospectus.  It's the same deal as paying an advisor: you pay the fee every year whether the fund goes up or down.  ""Actively managed"" (i.e. a human picking stocks) mutual funds sometimes charge 1%+.  ""Passive"" (i.e. run by a computer, tracking an index (like the S&P500, mentioned above)) are usually cheaper.  Studies have shown that it's rare for active funds to beat the S&P500 consistently -- they just charge you more.  I'd recommend a book called ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" for more info here.  My investing strategy is to buy lower cost, passive funds.

Ah, another thing too: dividends.  Some stocks pay dividends -- return some of the profits of the company to the shareholders.  Others do not.  Those that do (e.g. XOM, MMM, JNJ, MSFT, etc...) pay you to own them.  The way to make money on the rest is to buy low and sell high -- there's no regular dividend check coming.  This is a tricky subject because companies that do not pay dividends are usually ""growth"" companies (i.e. they are expanding a lot every year and their stock price should go up with their profits) whereas those that do are usually not growing as much or at all (think: stable markets, utilities, landlords, etc...). There are great and terrible stocks in both camps.  Terrible dividend payers lose value while returning your own money to you in the form of dividends.  Be wary of very high dividends (e.g. 5%+) because, again, they usually imply pretty high risks.  Likewise some great companies don't pay dividends at all -- no one is complaining (yet) that Google doesn't pay a dividend despite the fact that they have a shitload of ""shareholder"" money in the bank because they are growing still and their stock is too.

Anyway, sorry to write a book but I hope this was helpful and I wish you luck.  Compounding returns and interest (i.e. reinvesting your dividends, investing consistently over a long time horizon when things are good and bad) is the key to having a nice nest egg when you're old.",t2_eet98,yoshiatsu,0,1619749113.0,0,t1_gwdl6pp,gwdl6pp,True,eklektos51,t3_n1c6pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kirkland/comments/n1c6pw/fiduciary_recommendations/,Fiduciary recommendations,/r/Kirkland/comments/n1c6pw/fiduciary_recommendations/gwdl6pp/,6,r/Kirkland,0,6

Give Alta Health Cafe a try in Totem Lake. Craziest location for a restaurant, but is better Chinese that I've seen elsewhere (not considering Spicy Talk which I haven't had in Kirkland yet.)

Santa Fe on 85th East of 405. They are also opening a new restaurant on Lake St. in the main part of Kirkland too. Carne Asada is great and they have fish ceviche which can be hard to find.

"Houghton landfill....you mean the Kirkland transfer station? Cause it's very much still there. I use it for card board recycling all the time. Doesn't have any issues as much as I'm aware. The smells are minimal since the large portion of it opens up to Bridle Trails park. The residence around it seem fine. I don't live right next to it so I can't speak for how busy it is. I've never seen it very busy.

As a transfer station it's just a dumping place for people to get rid of large items, recycling, or yard waste. It's dumped into container trucks and then driven out to a landfill elsewhere and a recycle plant. I think the recycling plant is in Woodinville.

"This is the answer--MEOW is a great resource. 

Note that I think that MEOW will lend you a trap for free. When my cat ran out (a few years back), they took a $70 deposit that was refundable when I returned the trap. Their guide (linked above) is ambiguous. Regardless, traps and stinky food are the absolute best way to get your cat back.

My cat was coming back to the house at night, when everything was quiet, but I wasn't awake to let him in the door. Eventually he got really hungry and crawled in the trap to eat the awful-smelling Trader Joe's cat food I replaced every evening. 

Get a trap.

"I was surprised I could see it from downtown last night. I assumed bright lights, trees, and buildings would obscure it, but it was easily visible with the naked eye for about 15 minutes (from where I was) at 10:45 pm before the earth’s rotation put it behind a tree. If you can find an unobstructed (and preferably dark) view of the northern sky, you should have no trouble.

Any big park should do (e.g. Peter Kirk, Everest). Would avoid an overpass due to all the lights.

This article was super helpful in finding it. If you can find Ursa Major (the Big Dipper), you’re all set.

By recruiting, licensing, training, and supporting foster parents, they provide therapeutic foster care and support to children and youth who have faced significant family trauma and need a safe home and counseling. Friends of Youth nurture foster kids in need of the most intensive services, creating the most dramatic changes in their lives.

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on a lot of businesses and non-profit organizations. My friends and I got together to form this campaign to help the Friends of Youth because we believe that its message and goal are extremely important, especially in the time of crisis that we find ourselves in right now.
