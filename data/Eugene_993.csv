"Airbnb

Graduation, track & field events and some football games (20 to 30 days total a year) pays a huge chunk of my whole years rent.

Paying way more than I could afford upfront was a serious risk. It paid off the first year with about $8k of offsetting rent. I didn't know much and was learning as I went with lots of random weekend bookings. Probably was not in my apartment 3 months out of the year that year.

The second year was dialing in dates when hotels are usually fully booked. $14k. I paid more attention to key booking dates and was able to block off more dates to actually live in my apartment on a regular basis. Place was booked 2 months total that year.

Third year, blocked out my entire year except dates that were likely peak pricing. Doubled my rates. Was very strict and unaccommidating with my policies so people really couldn't back out easily. 

The apartment makes about $10k-$14k a year now

Things get broken/ruined and need to be replaced but, for the price people pay, it's not a big deal and I don't worry about it. It's all rolled into the cost of things. Bonus, I have super nice stuff now.

Don't be afraid to spend money. Having my carpets cleaned twice a year, buying new sheets/towels/etc every few months and having professional cleaners come before guests come is how I get great reviews. 

Also, picking people up from the airport or waiting until 2:30am to check people in is how I get repeat high dollar guests. 

My landlord has given me a couple warnings when I first started because I was pricing my place to attract booking and was getting anyone that could afford this or a cheap motel. By raising my rates, I now can be way more selective and the clientele are professional athletes, executives and people that pay a premium

"I spent 2 weeks looking full time for apartments. Through hard work and a lot of luck, I found an apartment through a private owner who is incredible. We are neighbors so I've made it a point to stay on good terms-quiet, clean, friendly, etc. I make decent money ($20/hr plus benefits) though I'm only working part time due to school. I bought a car I could afford to pay off in cash and my insurance is only $26/month. I rarely eat out, I try not to shop a bunch. Admittedly I'm relatively introverted so a lot of my hobbies are at home and somewhat inexpensive (except my plant hobby, that one is expensive af) If the month is going to be tight, I cut back on luxuries. Had an unexpected bill this month? Welp, not buying any alcohol. Don't need anything and no fun budget? Then don't go into a store. I don't smoke. I only keep one streaming subscription at a time and jump around from month to month. If I need something, first I try a buy nothing group, then thrift store, then new if necessary (somethings are new only though depending on item). I also don't (or very rarely) buy online. Online shopping seems to be a slippery slope for many. I have access to an Amazon account but really think every purchase through. 

Right now due to gas prices, I try to plan my trips better so I can do more at once-especially since it seems I live 20minutes from everything.

"You’re right, that was an insult and I apologize. It is a problem though that small subcultures (generally born and mostly perpetuated online) create new definitions that only they subscribe to, but use them that way in greater public spaces. It breeds confusion and becomes an unnecessary barrier to communication, more of a signal to other members of that subculture than it does create building conversations with people outside that subculture. It’s not a useful progression of language, it’s only useful in drawing hard cultural lines which I think we need less of these days.

Coming from a family that is well versed in legal issues, I say YES. Consult with lawyers. IMMEDIATELY. Call a few on Monday, meet with a few, and choose the one you feel the most confident in. Only take free consultations. 

While you wait for Monday, start researching. Look for lawyers that specialize in medical injury and their reviews. Start documenting *everything*. Dates, names (of every medical professional who has seen your arm), and your summaries of what occurred. Gather proof that your arm was functioning before this appointment. Gather proof that it wasn’t functioning after the appointment. Get your progress notes from the physical therapist. Put it all into a clear concise document so your potential lawyers can review it all in a short meeting.

"I see some red flags. A couple suggestions for things to find out:

Get the name of the community. Since the owner has not told you, I’d Google the address or drive by and look for a sign. There should be either an HOA or management company you can call directly. Ask them what their policy is on homeowners renting rooms/homes, background checks, and payment for them. You may also want to check that the “owner” is actually an owner. 

You were told applications would be submitted in the order received. If they aren’t running your background check, there is no cost to them. Ask why it’s not refundable if no background check is done. There is no non scammy way to answer that question other than you’ll be refunded. There are some technically legal loopholes they may try to exploit, my opinion is it’s a red flag they will be crappy landlords. You don’t want to be stuck in a contract with a crappy landlord.

"Like I said; in the spirit of honestly I was just offering my experience and advice to be helpful and I don't think that qualifies as trolling. Nor was I ""updating"" you that the market is nuts.

A LOT of finding a place is just luck and persistence. Everyone should have the right to live somewhere safe and habitable but unfortunately that isn't the case right now. I move around a lot so I have a good amount of experience finding apartments in a new city without connections.

Reddit is a forum for commentary, not classified ads and transactional communication so getting upset and calling someone a troll when they're offering insight on your misplaced ad looking for housing is a bit off-putting (especially to anyone on reddit who might have a room to rent.) The ""incel"" look of being nice when asking for something and then turning around and biting the head off someone taking time out of their day to offer advice is a really bad look for someone looking for help. 

Also nobody wants to live with someone like that. 

I sorry to be the bearer of bad news, and I understand you're just trying to cast a wide net, but there's a reason fishing boats don't just aimlessly wander the ocean looking for fish and then get mad when another fisherman tries to tell them ""hey, there are no fish here."" They research the best places that fish are *most commonly found* and spend their time there.

Apartments aren't commonly found on reddit, that's now what this is made for. If you're looking for niche sources where you may be able to find a place to rent, reach out to local realtors. In a college town where there's a chance anyone under 30 is going to be partying with college kids, an older single renter comes with less chance of trashing a place than someone younger. Even though the market is nuts, some realtors have units they're sitting on for one reason or another that they'd love to rent to someone reliable. My advice would be to check with them for a place they might be hanging onto until they can do work on it or something.",t2_sdcsm,Hoosier_816,1,1648218126.0,0,t1_i22gp25,i22gp25,False,SophiKatt,t3_tk3ae8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eugene/comments/tk3ae8/looking_for_a_room_to_rent/,Looking For A Room To Rent,/r/Eugene/comments/tk3ae8/looking_for_a_room_to_rent/i22gp25/,2,r/Eugene,0,2

"They're not great. When I moved back to Eugene it seemed like the system had just been installed, and there were lots of convenient locations very close to my house.

You can't even technically ride to the mall right across the river and leave the bike there. It seems mainly designed for people who live right around downtown/the whit/campus to go to and from downtown/the whit/campus. So, not great for long bike rides or anything other than *very* basic ""biking around town.""

Now several years later, I hardly ever see bikes in the racks that are near my house.

For free trails, hit up Alton baker park especially some of the little sections near the Children’s museum and Cuthbert amphitheater.

"Unfortunately, cats are abandoned all the time. Especially true during these Covid years when a lot of people were evicted or forced to move and, terribly, decided to just leave their cat behind to fend for itself (as some people like yourself believe cats ‘belong outdoors’ and can easily fend for themselves which is not true but that’s a whole other topic) so a friendly “stray” cat is not uncommon and you should be glad someone in your neighborhood takes the time to care for your cat in some way. 

No one is kidnapping your cat if it’s able to clearly come back to you. Keep your cat indoors if you are concerned, which is *best for the animal anyway.* (which should be the top concern here.)

And for all the people freaking out about cats killing birds … that’s what the do and they are certainly not destroying the bird population and if they were then I would say the town has a serious TNR program to start because that sounds like a stray cat population issue.

"I'm not in a union, but I have the same bargaining power as everyone else - I can leave and get a job somewhere else. I've used this power twice to go get better conditions and more money.

>Hey, maybe your tenants should form a collective bargaining unit! 

I have less than a dozen units, that would be pretty funny and pointless. If they don't like the unit, they can leave with 30 days notice like anybody else. I hate it when people leave though, so I try to make sure the rent is reasonable and things get taken care of quickly. Most of my tenants stay for several years at least.

>I am a business owner. I’m a self-employed contractor

If you are self-employed and have no employees, the scope of projects you can take on is very limited. This can be nice in some ways, but it's not a good solution for everyone. I have worked for very small companies, and you get stuck with the equivalent of remodeling grandma's bathroom. 

Surveying is pretty cheap compared to construction, but most 1-man shops can't come up with the manpower or money to outlay for a big project. My old roommates were both ""forestry surveyors"" for Weyco and worked as independent contractors, but in reality they were not expected to come up with much of anything besides a pair of boots and tape measures, etc. Just the service gear for the project I'm doing right now costs $150k, that's just one piece and a fraction of the outlay. Most people don't have that kind of money laying around-that's the point of working for a company. 

The same can be said for tenants-when I have to drop $12k in cash suddenly because a roof has gone bad, I can come up with the money because I'm maintaining my cash reserves for emergencies. This is actually required for landlords to get financing, for good reason. The more properties you own, the more you can balance out the books when one of them has a bad year and costs a shit ton of money instead of making money.

>The prospect of fixing up houses is pretty cool, I’ve thought about that, but I would not then take that opportunity to become a landlord.

That's called a house flipper. Lots of douche bags doing that too!

Honest question - if you don't believe in landlords, do you think that all apartments should be condos?

"Thanks for taking the initiative to register your car in Oregon. In Eugene expired tags are extremely common partly because your car does not have to go through emissions control (DEQ), so cops don't care as much as they do in Portland where you have to pay a bunch of money on the tests to get new tags ($$$$ for the state). There are also a lot of out of state cars with expired tags in Eugene, and I'd guess it's because the Eugene police simply is already used to ignoring expired tags for the aforementioned reason. Also, the University of Oregon brings in a lot of out of state cars, and students/kids aren't known to be great at paying for things (like registration tags) that they expect their parents to pay for.

">that’s like me getting mad at my boss just because he extracts the value I generate with my labor and hard-earned expertise, and uses it to buy a nicer car than me.

Lol I mean… unironically yes, that’s why you guys have a union lmao. Your employer uses his economic leverage to reap the profits of your labor, so you collectively bargain so you can get something closer to your fair share (which, since you’re the one who’s the fucking electrician, doing highly skilled and valuable electrician work, and they just act like a fucking Hollywood agent taking a finder’s fee, should be *quite a bit*).

Hey, maybe your tenants should form a collective bargaining unit!

>being an owner isn’t for everyone

Lol (plot twist!?) I am a business owner. I’m a self-employed contractor, an LLC, my business is forestry surveying. Being a speculative landlord is not for me, because I would find the prospect unconscionable. The prospect of fixing up houses is pretty cool, I’ve thought about that, but I would not then take that opportunity to become a landlord.

Lol, it seems clear from this conversation that you *know* what you’re doing is exploitative, it’s just “that’s how the world works, if it weren’t me getting my mortgage paid by people with no other options, it’d be someone else. It’s an investment”.

"Just went through this...  

Get your utilities and such setup so that you have some bills and proof of living here.

Don't worry about making any appointments.  They're all stupid far in the future if you can even make one.

Go to https://www.oregon.gov/odot/DMV/pages/driverid/licenseget.aspx and fill out all of the information so that it's already electronically submitted.  )  Make note of the documents you need to bring with you to prove your identity and residency.  Print off the email with the submission ID and take it with you when you go to the DMV.

Go here (https://www.oregon.gov/odot/dmv/pages/vehicle/titlereg.aspx) and complete your title and registration application with the link on step 1.  Again, make note of the documents you need to bring with you such as your title.  Again, print off the email with the submission ID and take it with you when you go to the DMV.

When you have these forms submitted online and all of the required paperwork gathered together then go to the Eugene DMV one morning about 20-30 minutes before they open.  Be sure to bring the vehicle you are registering and park it just outside the mall doors that lead to the DMV.  There might be a relatively small line already gathered when you get there.  When the DMV opens everyone will get a number and instructed to wait in the seating area.  They process folks really quickly.  

If you already have a current and valid driver's license from another state then you'll just do a quick vision screen, answer some questions, and be issued a license for Oregon.  For your vehicle they'll have to go outside and confirm that your VIN matches your title.

They'll do a bunch of paperwork and issue you license plates and stickers on the spot.  You'll get your picture taken for your license and they'll give you a paper copy of exactly what your license will look like and they'll punch a hole in your existing license.

They take credit card and don't charge any extra fees for using it.  It was probably the best DMV experience I've ever had and I've been around long enough to have had many experiences.

When you get done with this check to see if your state will let you electronically notify them that you've moved.  I could do the change of address online, but still had to send back the registration renewal notice with a note on the front saying I moved.

This will also start the process of getting you registered to vote.  A week or so after you have been to the DMV you'll get a letter giving you the final instructions.

"I think you might be a bit confused about the point I'm trying to make. I have made very good investments, and I should be able to have a very good retirement in the distant future because of them. I dumped a lot of time and money into my properties that I made working, and I bought at an excellent time in an excellent market. I'm not unhappy with my situation.

My point with this is that I could have been sucussful with a different business strategy as well. I've already spent 9 years doing this, and because of refinancing to continue buying properties it's going to be 29 more years before these places are paid off. So, that's almost a 40 year outlay. Everyone should think about the future, especially when they are young. I drive shitbox cars and live in a 640 square foot shipping container house to save money, because I'm more interested in financial security than trying to do rich shit. 

The other point is that just like with tenants, or any other group of people, landlords come in all flavors. Some are shit bags, some are cheap asses, some are honest and dependable. One main reason I do things myself is that I've always been disappointed with the way that the people I've hired have done it, and when I was a tenant I had bad experiences with property managers that were sheisty. I'm doing my best to ride the line between being sucussful and also providing a good product for a good price. Many costs are outside my control, but I have kept the rent lower than most other landlords in Eugene. 

I don't participate in online landlord groups, but I'm not surprised to hear some people trying to flex their wealth. I know electricians who do that, and I have always found it to be pretty fucking stupid. Being rich as fuck won't make you happy, but having enough money to be secure is important. 

I have had many tenants that go from one of my rentals to buying a house, and I always tell them to do what I did instead. Skip the house, and buy a shitty duplex. Live in one side, fix the other side up and accept having a little less privacy and space in exchange for a good investment. Most people I've recommended that to are not interested in doing that though, they would rather achieve the ""American Dream"" of having a single family house and pay out the ass for it for the next 30 years.
