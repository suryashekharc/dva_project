"Colorado is open enrollment, so technically a child can “choice in” to any public school in the state.  However, public schools must guarantee a spot for every child in the schools neighborhood boundary (and in DPS  people buy houses with school boundary maps in hand), followed in priority usually by children of staff, and then siblings of students, and then choice in district kids, and then non district kids are considered.  Each school makes up its “choice in” criteria, so you’ll have ask.

All that being said, LPS schools in general are under enrollment numbers, so it’s usually easy to choice in, even from out of district.  It’s not like DPS where you have to buy in the right area just to get a seat at a decent school or face waitlisting.  LPS schools are all generally good and moving to a different one is easy…

LPS is a much smaller district than DPS - 15k students versus 90k.  LPS mostly serves middle and upper class families, whereas DPS has a much wider range.  LPS also has a strong teachers union, and residents generally have voted strongly for school funding.  I’m not sure about Littleton’s general politics, but it’s not like Douglas County where they’re seemingly trying to destroy public education.  The board seems sane and they followed science and health department guidance when it came to COVID policies - although Douglas County dropped out of Tri County Health, which killed it, so JeffCo and Arapaho are each on their own now.

I’m sure the district’s official policy is that bullying is not acceptable and inclusion is a priority.  It’s really up to each school to implement that.  My kid in a LPS high school talks about different kinds of kids, and all are accepted.

My kid went to DPS schools, and then choiced into LPS.  LPS is smaller and easier to navigate - less red tape.  Resource wise it seems about the same, but we don’t have special needs.

The LPS teen driving school is a bargain - highly recommend.  You don’t have to be a LIttleton resident or LPS student to enroll.

Some of what you’re asking can be read on LPSs website, or you can call and chat with someone at the district.  I’ve found LPS folks to be very easy to talk to and helpful.  Also try calling the schools directly and chatting with whoever answers.

I do know that the new Newton Campus is insanely awesome.  I know families at all three high schools that are happy - Littleton High has a strong IB program, Arapaho is big and competitive, Heritage is great all around.  I also know families at Wilder, Goddard, and Euclid who are happy.

Highly recommend touring the schools to get the feel and see what your kid responds to.  The high schools all have 8th grade preview nights and scheduled tours where kids and parents go to learn about the school.

Good luck!  I hope your kid(s) finds a place they like!",t2_3pdh3,el_tophero,0,1646287863.0,0,t1_hz5gc6s,hz5gc6s,True,Kristin_busc,t3_t5esh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Littleton/comments/t5esh7/please_tell_me_about_lps/,Please tell me about LPS,/r/Littleton/comments/t5esh7/please_tell_me_about_lps/hz5gc6s/,2,r/Littleton,0,2

"I moved to LPS in 8th grade (20+ years ago) from DPS, at the time LPS was probably about 2y ahead of DPS curriculum wise. 

My children went to LPS and now one of my grandkids (only one of age) is attending LPS. 

Luckily I went to school with my son's 3rd grade teacher so she informed me he was lacking in areas. My son was on an IEP and yes it was a struggle to get him on it, his compression was so high it off set the rest of the scores and technically made him ineligible for one. Lots of meetings and back and forth he was finally put on one (4th grade). Again about 20y ago give or take a few. 

As far as if one school is better for one thing over another, on the highschool level Arapahoe is more for athletes, Heritage is about 50/50 athletic and curriculum and Littleton is the most diverse and has a decent arts program. 

As far as can kids attend any school of choice I believe you have to get a waiver and apply, that usually ends in January or very early February otherwise you go to the school in that district. Even if you apply it's up to the school to grant it. My daughter went to Littleton only because she wanted one more year with her brother, she did get a waiver and did get okayed to attend heritage.

"I can speak on Fairways - it was a few years back that I lived there. Like any apartment community the management is awful. The trash compactor was always broken and they would never seem to be able to fix it - resulting in massive piles of trash. The parking is also kinda nuts - there are no guest spots so if you want to have someone stay over night there is literally nowhere to park. They booted my girlfriend at the time's car the very first night she stayed over - and I wasn't going to have her park at the park across the street and risk getting towed. Speaking of the park - that was actually the best part of living there - Clement Park is right there and it is a really gorgeous park. The garages are pretty nice as well. 

I am currently living at Berkshire Aspen Grove - and while it is not perfect I believe it is one of the best apartment rentals available in the area. It is right on the Platte River trail overlooking the nature preserve - and I like the location as it is right on Santa Fe, C470, and there is also a lightrail stop here for when you want to head downtown and don't want to worry about parking. I wish there were more cool shops and restaurant in the mall here but there is a sushi spot, Chick-fil-a, and Alamo Drafthouse and Movie Theater.",t2_8cmd0l5x,krisdelakrem,0,1645116061.0,0,t1_hxbrkjh,hxbrkjh,True,Recent_Ability_4071,t3_surmw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Littleton/comments/surmw6/apartment_recommendations/,Apartment recommendations,/r/Littleton/comments/surmw6/apartment_recommendations/hxbrkjh/,1,r/Littleton,0,1
"Of the places you mentioned, I can speak about three.  

Dakota Ridge.  I just got an off vibe from the place.  I can't explain it more than that, but I didn't feel good while I was checking out apartments there.

Avalon at Red Rocks looks really nice.  Their fees were a bit higher than the rest of the complexes I was checking out at the time (pre-COVID), but I loved that some of the apartments had white kitchens, and the views are awesome (this was a must-have for me). 

I currently live at Bell Ken Caryl and I absolutely love it (have my mountain view!).  Been here for almost 3 years, and its calm, quiet, clean, and friendly.  Anything that breaks, maintenance is there in a few hours.  Snow is cleared very quickly, too.  They have food trucks on Thursdays (maybe once a month, I think?) and the grounds are kept immaculately.  Plus there are some easy hiking trails a few minutes way, and it's close to grocery stores, shops, restaurants, with quick highway access.  

The only issue is people don't pick up after their dogs, but I am starting to think that happens everywhere.",t2_8fut9,leese216,0,1645114998.0,0,t1_hxboqyn,hxboqyn,True,Recent_Ability_4071,t3_surmw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Littleton/comments/surmw6/apartment_recommendations/,Apartment recommendations,/r/Littleton/comments/surmw6/apartment_recommendations/hxboqyn/,2,r/Littleton,0,2

"I was going to suggest the one at Belmar in Lakewood, but it appears to be closed? Maybe the internet is wrong; you might try calling and asking. I think that was the only outdoor rink in Jeffco aside from Lake Evergreen, which is an amazing experience but can get quite chilly, so bundle up. The ice can be a little rough, too. They do use a Zamboni on the lake ice, but it's still lake ice and will wear your blades down faster than indoor ice.

I have skated at Edge throughout the pandemic. The ice is great. Crowds really depend on when you go -- the weekday public sessions from 12 to 2 pm tend not to be very crowded, and they do require reservations, so you can see how many people are already signed up before you commit. Mask-wearing is very hit-or-miss, though. These days I just skate with a well-fitted KN95 and try my best to keep my distance. Covid seems to linger in cool indoor air, but I think you're more likely to catch it in the lobby, which has a much lower ceiling and gets a lot more crowded.

The South Suburban Sports Complex off County Line is another indoor option. The ice is shit, but they do offer adults-only sessions a few days a week (usually around lunchtime) and those tend to be very sparsely populated -- I'm talking 3 or 4 people total. If you're 40+, it's a godsend. Their late-morning/midday/early afternoon public sessions also tend not to be crowded unless it's a holiday.

To my knowledge, the only rink in the Denver area that requires proof of vaccination and is strict about masking is Big Bear. I haven't skated there, but I've heard from other skaters that they do enforce those policies, for what it's worth. That rink is probably your safest option if you do decide to skate indoors, with the usual caveats about peak hours and holidays. It's a bit of a haul from Littleton, though.

Sorry for the unsolicited info about indoor rinks, but unfortunately we don't have many other options around here. I'm extremely Covid-cautious and will leave if there are more than about a dozen people. To me, skating indoors (while triple vaxxed and wearing a really good mask) is worth the slightly elevated risk, but I understand if you're not comfortable taking that chance.

"I’ve lived here for most of my life, so here I go:

>	I have some questions, why is Old Town Littleton vastly cheaper than Lakewood and Ken-Caryl?

Much smaller homes in general, and much older. They don’t have central air, so say goodbye to air conditioning. 

>	Is it safe? Should I opt for a garage?

Mostly safe. Garages are nice, but mostly for weather reasons than anything else.

>	I’d be commuting to Roxborough Park weekdays, should I consider moving there instead?

Roxborough Park proper or Roxborough Village? Park is super safe as they have a security guard at the front, and more expensive. I bet you got a job at Lockheed? It’s literally the only employer in Roxborough unless you’re working at Subway or Safeway. Village is very nice too. It’s technically part of Littleton still even though it’s 30 minutes (on a good day) from Downtown Littleton.

>	I keep reading about crime in Denver, specifically a lot of homeless (Downtown Denver) and catalytic converters being stolen. I am in need of a two bedroom that is affordable, and most of the places I see close to work are 2k+!

Yeah… that’s why there are homeless people. Don’t confuse this with unemployed people. Catalytic converters are popular everywhere, not just CO. Just don’t have a car that’s on the popular list.

>	I read that old town littleton is beautiful and has a lot of options for walking, is it close to the rail line

Yes. Not my thing as there are a lot of people and cars, but it’s beautiful and close to light rail. There are a lot of parks nearby too.

My big draw to these guys is their honesty.  12 years ago or so I brought in a high mileage Lincoln that needed the transmission rebuilt. They tried to talk me out of it telling me to go buy another car.  I didn't listen and sure enough had more major problems in the following years.

"You’re asking for a lot with that little of a maximum… 3-4 bedroom house you’re looking at a decent commute downtown from the south around Highlands Ranch or Parker area. Moving up north towards DTC like off Holly or Quebec you might find a home for that price, but they’re quite small. Go further west towards Ken Caryl area and you can pull it off, but then it’s like an hour commute downtown. 

All of the areas mentioned are great for families and stuff, with lots of activities, playgrounds, parks, bicycle paths, and fun events at libraries. As a father of two toddlers I laughed at your restaurants/bars, but again, each of these areas have some great stuff. 

Your biggest concern is budgeting a house that size with that commute. You’ll have to figure out what’s more important because that’s pretty rough. Another challenge is “within your age range”.

"Hey I was in a really similar position a couple months ago and recently moved to Littleton. Highly recommended.

Downtown Littleton is great with tons of cool stuff to do. The crowd leans a bit older but you'll have no issues finding young people. They shut down main street (I think) every Saturday. Tons of live music and interesting things.

You're really close the mountains so you can get hikes and mountain biking in after work during the summer months. If you're next to the south Platte river you have access to a network of bike paths that go all over the city. There are a couple mountain bike parks in the area you can visit off the trail.

Denver is a really small big city. It's not LA. It's a 15 minute drive to south Broadway (tons of really cool bars and restaurants for the <35 crowd). You can go see anything you want in under half an hour. You're not stuck in the suburbs.

"Even better, if you get your ham radio license, the ham radio on the space station is currently in cross-band repeater mode, so you can use the space station to talk to people hundreds of miles away (quickly) from a handheld radio!

It's also sometimes in digital packet repeater mode that allows one to send their current GPS location and a short text message for all to hear.  First time I did that was with the Mir space station back in 1998 from a handheld radio.

"Those are all 3 great hikes.  

Water flow at the falls will be lower this time of year but it's still a great spot.  Just be sure to go to the lower trailhead and hike up to the falls if you want an actual hike.  The falls are  1/4 mile from the upper trailhead.  There will be no mountain bikes on this one and not much in the way of mountain views.

Lair of the bear first mile is flat and runs by the stream with a lot of little trails crossing over the stream by the trailhead. After that first mile you start to really climb into the trees.  

3 sisters is one of my all time favorites though.  From the meadow by the upper lot you have great views.  If you cross the road and go up evergreen mountain the view are even better.  Hiking up over the sisters are some fun technical features with nice views.

You'll be happy with any of these trails.

"That’s so funny, my husband and I just went there for the first time Monday and we liked it enough that we went back yesterday and signed up.

We went around 6 pm and it was pretty empty - but I can’t tell you if that’s a normal Tuesday or not…? Most of the people there seemed to be parents watching their kids doing gymnastics or swimming. The exercise room is pretty well equipped but small, there’s only one Olympic squat rack and bench press rack. So if it ever did get busy with more than ~6-8 people it could get really annoying which is my one worry. Double basketball court gymnasium and I didn’t get a look at the pool but I plan to use that too eventually.

"Littleton is a huge range of space, from west of C470 to nearly I25. It can take 30 minutes going from one end to the other, so there’s a lot to do in Littleton depending where you want to be.

For example, Southwest Plaza mall has changed from stores to being a place to have fun like Roundone (good-sized arcade). Or further south of C470 has Main Event (like Dave & Busters). 

There’s a bar scene at Downtown Littleton, but oddly enough it’s not central Littleton and closer to Englewood. A few venues for concerts and shows, but it’s not far from more closer to Denver.

There are plenty of parks, especially southern side of it, and it’s close to the mountains for hiking during summers and skiing in winters.

Might add that 10th and Osage can get a little sketch at odd hours due to the proximity of a day shelter some blocks away and the usual colfax crowd. Nothing major but something to be wary of. Lots of construction everywhere so be aware of that. Check along the N line to the north for places to stay as you can still make it down to union and then to the D line.

"D line is usually really reliable even when we have bad snowstorms. Usually runs every 15 min during the majority of the day, so even if it is running slow you will not have major issues. About a 25 min ride from Denver and a few minute walk to Aspen Grove. Keep in mind, there are only a handful of stops in the Denver area near capital hill and most of them don’t have parking nearby. The closest stop to the capital hill area for the D line is probably 10th and Osage, which is a pretty long walk/bike ride.

"I read about it and i truly don't understand water board, promises for over 6 years upgrades, expending the water treatment capabilities to over more households, etc. I even look up up thier revenue $4 million a year according to public info.

I thought they upgrades supose to make the distribution and treatment more efficient therefore less expensive but from the info i found it's opposite.

I think there should be an audit of this company because i smell something fishy going on with this fees.

"Live in Roxborough village, welcome! All of the above are true. We (RWSD) have a 99 year contract with the city of Aurora for enough acre feet of raw water to sustain the existing homes. Their tunnel emerges to the west of Rampart just a few blocks South of the exit from the Park. The small tan cinder block building up on the side of the hogback. 

RWSD just built a brand new water treatment plant (2019) That will mean 15+ years of construction bond fees that only 5000 households have to pay for. 

About 11-13 years ago our wastewater treatment plant was near collapse so we built a pipeline ($$$$) to pump our waste north to the Englewood water treatment plant, as soon as the ink was dry on the deal Englewood jacked our fees. 

Sterling Ranch has their own water district, Dominion WSD. They made a quiet offer to cover half the total cost to double the size of our water treatment plant to handle their raw water supply (sourced via pipeline from Co Springs). This technically should have reduced our construction costs due to economies of scale, but unsurprisingly no reduction in our monthly fees has been seen. 

Our water board meets at super inconvenient times like 10:30 am on a Tuesday.

"Hi there, I have lived in Littleton/Highlands Ranch most of my life.  If you are on Denver water which cuts off around C-470 you can count on $40 water bills each month.  Down near the new Sterling Ranch development and even when these homes were built back in the mid 1990's, water was scarce over there and very much depended on snow melt.

I believe a contract signed from the city of Aurora to set up a diversion to just supply Roxborough.

"Yup, I got the same shock when I moved here (also from the NE).

My understanding is, Roxborough water isn't connected to Denver Water or any other larger suppliers. It's its own, small network. So, they need to provide all the same services (treatment of clean water, distribution through a pipe network, collection of waste water, treatment of waste water) as a larger municipality, except we don't have the economy of scale out here. 

Therefore the administrative fees are quite high. The new plant they just build to share with Sterling Ranch was SUPPOSE to reduce that part of the cost since it's more economy of scale, but clearly that hasn't happened yet.

Roxborough is about a mile further South of Waterton Canyon. There's a large shopping plaza there and I'm sure you could park there overnight. If you talk to the owner of The Tavern there in the plaza he may keep an eye on it for you. You could probably get a lift from there to Roxborough State Park (a couple miles South of the plaza).

"You don't need to explain Bandwidth to me.  I think you are not familiar with the Hybrid Fiber Coax networks that cable companies use.  There is only so much bandwidth available on a given HFC node that you share with your neighbors.  The purpose of data caps is to discourage wanton use/abuse of that shared resource so nobody has a bad experience.  The theory is that everyone knows the cap is there so they won't be a daily bandwidth hog to ensure they can have normal fast speeds throughout the month.  It's not a elegant solution but when Comcast tried other solutions they were criticized by the bandwidth hogs with loud voices who were ""throttled"".

"Bandwidth != data limits. Think of it like a funnel. Only x amount of data can flow through fiber network at any given point, and I know for a fact in my area the utilization is barely 30%. Once it’s through the funnel it doesn’t have any meaning.

Data caps are arbitrary. I was certified as a Cisco engineer many years ago and I’d find it difficult to believe that wiring somehow got worse. The reason they were implemented in the first place was to reduce piracy, but given how 4K streaming and video game streaming is more common, it’s asinine. Their only concern should be bandwidth, not limitations for a monthly basis. It’s quite easy to manage variability if bandwidth is overwhelmed. Hell, your basic $25 router does that.

Also, my office doesn’t have 60,000 employees. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? My office has like 15 people. My employer as a whole has 60,000.

"I can hear the train from Chatfield and Wadsworth when the roads are quiet. Much farther away, and many more obstructions.

Chatfield Reservoir reaches capacity every summer weekend (prior to SR being built, let alone the Solstice community) and there's a line to get in that stretches all the way out to the surface streets (Deer Creek entrance @ Wadsworth) by 10:00 A.M. every weekend. It will be the same for the South entrance this season.

The Front Range trail systems are all overcrowded every weekend. No parking left anywhere by 9:00 A.M.

Jeffco Open Space seems to think that bigger parking lots are the answer to crowded trails.. not more trails, or user specific trails. I understand that SR is in DOCO but IMO the recreational opportunities in DOCO pale in comparison to that of Jeffco.

I've lived a stone's throw away from Chatfield Reservoir for 30 years... The only thing I like about this place anymore is how much my property values increase hand over fist annually.. but I hate living here now. In 3 years when our oldest goes to college (which won't be soon enough) we're outta here.

I can't imagine the traffic and overcrowding issues around here that will exist once Solstice and Sterling Ranch are completed. Not to mention the water issues that have already been covered... and for those of you who have Denver Water and think it's expensive you should look at the rates for Meadowbrook Water.

SR is another cute, cookie cutter neighborhood like Helpless Ranch or any of the other contemporary residential projects in Colorado for the past 20 years.

For the cost of entry I'd rather buy a house in Ken Caryl Valley with resident exclusive trail systems without the risk of further influx effecting recreational opportunities.

"Water rights in Colorado can get rather complicated, but to keep it simple, water rights are determined by seniority.  In times where there is a shortage, those with older claims have rights to take water flows while junior claims may end up with no water at all.

Denver Water is one of the oldest and largest claim holders for water rights, having acquired claims statewide over the past 100+ years.  DW services the majority of the metro area and is more desirable as far as water access is concerned.  Colorado is in an extended, nearly decade long drought, meanwhile the population is growing rapidly.

Sterling Ranch is outside of Denver Water jurisdiction and was approved for development with only provisional rights, meaning no 'actual' rights, just access by working with regional suppliers (this may have changed).  Much of the water in that area is obtained from aquifers which pinch out along the hogback, making this area the shallowest portion of the reservoir, meaning it will dry out first.  This is similar to the issues experienced in Roxborough nearby and why you see so much talk of responsible water use in any marketing associated with SR.  

TL;DR If there is not enough water to go around, communities like this will lose access first.  Homes without water will not have value.",t2_7ayikuqn,Funwithfacts,0,1612543446.0,0,t1_gm4s7s2,gm4s7s2,False,snow77bunny,t3_lczehw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Littleton/comments/lczehw/sterling_ranch_and_noise_from_train/,Sterling Ranch and noise from train,/r/Littleton/comments/lczehw/sterling_ranch_and_noise_from_train/gm4s7s2/,7,r/Littleton,0,7

"A week or two before the extortion I signed a petition to prevent Arapahoe Road in Centennial from being rezoned for another car dealership and high density housing which 'certain members of the city council' were trying to approve. [High density housing is a money laundering scheme.](https://www.fincen.gov/money-laundering-commercial-real-estate-industry) and [Car dealerships have also been used for money laundering.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-co/pr/owner-colorado-car-dealership-sentenced-structuring-and-money-laundering)

I had also mentioned somewhere on the internet how I refused to sign a petition outside King Soopers, offered up by soccer moms toting children beside them, to legalize slot machines at the Arapahoe county race track because I figured it was going to be run by the mafia. This might have struck a nerve with Mr. Mafia of Centennial.

I had complained about how we couldn't trust [contractors in Colorado because there were so many frauds.](https://kdvr.com/news/local/home-improvement-roof-repair-contractor-fraud-spikes-in-colorado/) I had asked the city to find a way to regulate that. So this guy sent us his specific scumbags to do evil. I suspect he damaged our plumbing, because he threatened to. After we returned home 5 days early from an international trip, our back door deadbolt lock that had never fit in place since having it installed was suddenly fixed and working perfectly, 24 hours later our water heater sprung leak. The Extortionist had threatened to flood our home to cause asbestos tiles to have to be removed, well the basement tiles were 2% asbestos, so he knew something about our home we didn't. I called Garvins whose 'operator' told us ""we're too busy, call Plumbline"" and  Plumbline's people carried out several of the extortionists threats exactly as stated. I believe we were targeted in 2007 as soon as we bought our Centennial home because things the extortionist said he liked to do to people's property were done by our initial contractors 10 years before the extortion. They even completely contaminated the basement with aerosolized dry wall material and had their baby and toddler playing in it, just like the Extortionist threatened.

I had also written about how vaping unregulated chemicals could lead to an epidemic of lung disease and that the city council persons who benefitted from approving  vape shops might be held responsible. [He said he was part of the Heartland Institute who lobbies the government on behalf of the vaping industry](https://www.heartland.org/Alcohol-Tobacco/Vaping/index.html) (although he didn't mention the vaping angle, he was assuring me he had ['a teenager in Europe'](https://www.heartland.org/about-us/who-we-are/naomi-seibt) to push his climate change denial agenda at the time) and then [threatened there would be a wrongful death lawsuit, against me, involving Vitamin E.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_illness_outbreak)

I had also theorized how the high speed fiber lines he intended to install could be used for malicious purposes at speeds we've never seen before and lo and behold every government network and even Microsoft source code has been accessed.

I had mentioned that my wife had worked  as a credit card fraud analyst and maybe could be some service to law enforcement in that regard.

I had also pointed out that I had received mail at my home for three different people for ten years and that could be used for mail in voter fraud...so that's what I think really triggered him because it's probably what it was, since he then threatened to *place* someone else's opened mail on my property to frame me for felony taking the mail of another person for any reason, and followed through on that threat exactly as threatened and I'm still receiving mail for other people in a brand new never before rented apartment. He had also threatened to fill out and mail in our ballots.

"I was extorted by the guy who runs municipal broadband in Centennial, he was city councilman at the time and had plans as far back as January 17, 2017 to take the job his actions on the council enabled and the $5 million check the city handed him to run the operation.

Mail for 3 people was sent to my home in Centennial for at least a decade. The former city councilman threatened to place mail in my possession to frame me for felony 'taking the mail of another person for any reason', mail for at least eight different people has been showing up in my mailboxes since moving to Littleton in 2018, including mail from the USDA  exactly as threatened on January 17, 2017,

* He also threatened to fill out and send in our mail in ballots if we did not change our address when moving out of Centennial so that his fraudulent asbestos inspector could place a lien on the property we moved to.

If you take just that handful of threats out of more than a hundred, the fact that mail is used for identification and  mail in ballots,  and the fact that the Colorado Secretary of State at the time who made mail in ballots legal in Colorado handed this guy an award after just about 1,200 mail in ballots made the Centennial community fiber initiative possible, and note that [there was a controversy with mail in ballots when that same guy ran for mayor](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/11/07/aurora-mayor-race-mike-coffman-omar-montgomery/), and how the GOP these two guys belong to attacked the [Democrat Arapahoe County Clerk who could audit for voter fraud](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/news/arapahoe-county-gop-calls-on-democratic-clerk-to-resign-in-wake-of-election-stumbles/article_5c69a00a-0ca6-11ea-9a34-93d07cbc9dbb.html) in their elections under a GOP clerk, and it was this same GOP who incited insurrection across the United States...just be super wary of who you hand your internet access to, since now these same insurrectionist extortionist racketeering mafia have control over Centennial municipal fiber that is tapped into the [Federal Emergency Management and Homeland Security](https://www.colorado.gov/dhsem) and [Metcom 911 call center](https://www.southmetro.org/611/Metcom-911-Dispatch) in Centennial and they are building a data center in Centennial that will capture and *view* all your internet traffic if you try to to report through your phone or computer to federal or state authorities about any crimes you might be a witness or victim of, which is *exactly* what the former Republican city councilman extortionist-racketeer of Centennial Colorado threatened me with on January 17, 2017.",t2_5jfpypks,revelations117,0,1610968394.0,0,t1_gjpllrm,gjpllrm,True,minimallyviablehuman,t3_klcdg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Littleton/comments/klcdg7/anyone_else_interested_in_advocating_for/,Anyone else interested in advocating for municipal broadband?,/r/Littleton/comments/klcdg7/anyone_else_interested_in_advocating_for/gjpllrm/,0,r/Littleton,0,0

"We moved out here for the same reason. We’ve lived at both 5151 and Dakota ridge. We preferred Dakota ridge - it’s quiet, was closer to work for my fiancé and we liked the surrounding area.

"Southwest Littleton is pure suburbia. I lived at Cottonwood Creek just west of Wadsworth and Belleview for about 3 years. I liked it. 

The apartments right around Southwest Plaza Mall seem to have the worst problems with cars being broken into. Not like a high-crime area, but compared to other complexes. The mall and shopping centers just has enough traffic to make it easier to not stand out. There's not really a rough part of town south of 285 and west of Santa Fe. 

The most important thing he needs to do is eat so much BBQ in NC that he gets sick of it. Even decent BBQ is hard to find out here, and they think BBQ pizza is grilled chicken as a topping with store-bought sauce under the cheese.

"Yup. They feel really nice and sometimes I like to splurge if I've saved enough money and can afford it. The only downside is that they typically wear out much faster than cheaper sweatpants because the materials used are softer and not as durable as say a pair of sweatpants from target.

"It is trash. I’d rather go hungry if I was starving and that was my only source of food.  It fails miserably on the basic 3 items of a pizza. The crust tastes horrible. The sauce also tastes bad, like it’s improperly seasoned and oddly sweet, and the cheese is bad quality. If my wife ever said that she liked the pizza, I could never look at her the same way.  I don’t understand how anyone could eat it, or how they’re still in business. It’s not just a one off, I’ve unfortunately had the pizza like 5 or 6 times due to others ordering it. This applies to both locations I’ve been to, uptown and Littleton.
