"Resort is laid out such that it’s pretty difficult to find yourself “stuck” in a very difficult area. For the most part, all of the expert runs and ski areas drop off of blue runs that you can just continue to follow if you don’t want to drop into the advanced terrain. most of the time, the runs are all labeled well and there are gates that mark the more difficult terrain sections.

It’s one of the things the group I go there with like about it…we can mostly ski “together”…if some of us want to the hit the steeps, the rest of the group can stay on the groomers and still all meet up at the same lift.

Yeah, the runs on the “north side” of the mountain under chairs 7 and 11 are generally a bit easier and shorter than those on the main front side.

Do be prepared though, the “blue” runs, especially on the front side, are likely steeper and longer than what you’re used to in the Midwest.

"Realize this post is over 2 weeks old, but just got back from my 2nd trip to Whitefish, and thought I'd add my own...

>The blues in Whitefish are a little steeper than what you might find in Colorado. I'm mostly a blue skier, so that's important to me. Beautiful runs though.

>The back side of the mountain blues are less steep than the front side. 

I Will agree.  One thing great about Whitefish is that as long as you are at least an ""intermediate"" skier/snowboarder, there's pretty much a way down the mountain for everyone from just about anywhere, which is great for families/groups of varying skill levels that don't want to have to completely separate all day long....but, having said that, some of the blue runs, especially on the front side of the mountain, have sections that can be a bit steeper than folks may be used to on other mountains.  These runs are generally wide enough and snow conditions are *generally* forgiving enough that most ""blue-level"" skiers can make it down, however, and shouldn't be a barrier for most in this skill level...but your quads may get more of a workout than you're used to, haha.

The north side (heading towards chair 7 or 11) blue runs are a bit shorter and a bit less steep, and probably a better area to stick to for those less confident...but be aware that the entry to that section from the summit down the first part of Russ' Street can be a bit crowded.

Also, if you're there on a weekend, the areas at the top of chair 11 and around the bigfoot t-bar (which is only open on weekends), can have some great snow which is often untracked during the week and can be a good entry point into ""tree skiing"" for those at more an intermediate level.

>We rented ski gear in town, but when a few of us wanted to swap some gear it was a pain to get there. If I came back I would pay the extra and rent at the slopes

One option to also consider is Black Tie rentals.  It will cost a bit more, but they will deliver your equipment to your place the night before your first day on the mountain and pick it up at the end of your trip, and the equipment is fairly decent if you opt for the highest level.  Not sure about how easy it would be to swap equipment mid-stay, but it is an option that saves a lot of time and the logistical hassle of having to visit a shop to get/return rental equipment.

>In town we enjoyed the Craggy Tavern. Bierstube at the top of the mountain had good pizza and burgers.

Montana Tap House is also a great option for food/beers after a day of skiing.

> Locals told us that it's very common for the summit to be socked in with fog so bad that you cannot see the tree 20 feet in front of you. I'm a pretty good skier, but I'm not great, and I don't know the mountain. I feel like we got lucky with mostly clear skies for 4 days.

I'd say on our 2 trips, we've been about 50/50 in terms of summit conditions and visibility.  Never had a day when it was so fogged up that felt dangerous, but definitely some days when it got a bit tricky to see where you're going.  Also worth noting that some days there was -20F degree (or more!) difference between the base and summit ...so good to be aware that you may want to layer up even if it feels fairly comfortable at the base of the mountain, and check the daily snow report for summit conditions.",t2_a47gt,PaintDrinkingPete,0,1646059401.0,0,t1_hys6f19,hys6f19,True,locoyoda,t3_spcv8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/whitefish/comments/spcv8i/skiing_whitefishwhat_we_learned/,Skiing Whitefish...what we learned,/r/whitefish/comments/spcv8i/skiing_whitefishwhat_we_learned/hys6f19/,2,r/whitefish,0,2

"10$ + tips in Whitefish will likely net you between 12-15$ an hour depending on how busy it is. Whitefish is a huge tourist destination due to people going to glacier national park, summering on the lake, and mountain biking. Its an outdoor paradise. A full summer of working in Whitefish is enough to set you up for about 2-2.5 years in Serbia. And if you like the outdoors its an awesome experience. Few things to be careful of though, things in the US are expensive, if you have a canteen at your work (employee paid meals) take advantage of that. Going to the grocery store and getting things to cook will also help a lot. Also, if they let you work overtime we have a time and a half law so if you work over 40 hours a week every hour you work over 40 you get 1.5x your standard hourly rate. I also strongly recommend renting a bike and exploring, its a beautiful place to check out.

"What do you mean you could ""do Louise in 2 days at most""?  You'll get bored and don't want to ride anymore?  This seems like a personal question.  There are people who ski 100+ days on Big Mountain in a season...(and people who do 100+ on Louise or Sunshine as well)...how do we know if you will be bored after 2?

Personally when I travel far to ski, I try do do at least 3 days.  Only 2 feels rushed and not worth it--especially if you need a full travel day on each end, then only 50% of your trip is actually skiing. 

If I could make a suggestion though...maybe do 3 days and plan for a lesson on the second day where you truly work on fundamental skills.

"I get decent AT&T service at the summit and the base--varies elsewhere (but I assume you're not trying to literally work on the ski runs).  My wife's Verizon phone seems to have slightly more consistent coverage, but we ran speed tests a couple months ago while sitting outside the summit house and my service was much faster...but I'm not sure I'd expect that to hold true when the resort is at capacity.

My laptop has LTE, so in theory it would be able to work from the summit house, but I certainly wouldn't rely on that if I had to make important zoom calls or something (but probably fine for day to day use without pressing deadlines).

Not sure about the base.  You're obviously not going to find a private desk cubicle, but you can probably find a semi-quiet spot to sit and do some work om a cafe/dining area.  If it isn't a frequent thing, you could probably pull up a chair in a hotel lobby?

"I agree the restaurant/bar thing has always been silly, at least when they weren't doing any sort of extra table spacing or partitions.

I suspect that one was always an intentional facade...

"In hospitals it certainly makes sense. I don’t know why they wouldn’t always require this for everyone’s well being in hospitals, it’s where a high concentration of sick people are. 

But once restaurants and bars were doing indoor dining, why have people wear masks to the table just to take them off for the next hour or two once they were sitting? That was always absurd and did damage to any veneer of credibility to the masking argument. Also, the number of people who would be wearing a mask, but would pull it down when talking so they could be heard was pretty funny.

They also will let you switch boards multiple times because the idea is that your are demoing boards that you might want to buy.  Most shops will also let you credit your demo fees towards the purchase of a board.

Normal rentals can be a mixed bag and are usually lower quality. Some places will also offer ""performance rentals"" that are a step up.  With rentals you are kind of stuck with whatever gear they give you and they may only have one or two options in your size.

"> ""Caltabiano said under his leadership he’d like to review the stringent zoning, architectural standards and setback requirements he says are a deterrent for builders""

I don't have high hopes for G-Man's ability to do that.  He got into a spat with someone on a local facebook group where he claimed the a hotel proposal was 45' (above the 35' maximum height).  Someone called him out that the building is only 35' and meets the rules.

Instead of backing down, he posted a document that he thought proved his case and demanded multiple times that they remove their comment.  Only his document didn't prove that at all.  It noted that the elevator tower will extend to 45' but literally said that the statutory height of the building would only be 35' (buildings are allowed to have stuff stick up in the middle as long as the actual roof line meets the requirement).

Then he DOUBLED DOWN on that after someone tried to argue and posted a screenshot of the city code clearly defining building heights...he truly believed it supported his 45' claim despite it doing the exact opposite.  He even underlined the parts that support the 35' claim (bolded below)...

>BUILDING HEIGHT: The vertical distance from the undisturbed ground level at the perimeter of the building to a plane that is parallel with that undisturbed ground **to the highest point of the roof or parapet wall** as viewed from an architectural section/elevation

For real....an elevator shaft/stairway exit is NOT part of a roof or parapet wall and does not count towards building height (the same way an antenna or HVAC unit doesn't count)

The problem is that the city defines a short-term rental  as less than 30 days. If they want to fix the problem they’ll have to either increase that or impose high taxes on people who do this.

"As spartybasketball noted, you will be fine on hikes like Hidden lake or Avalanche lake. if you don't have a ""going to the sun road"" pass, I highly recommend you enter the park before 6:00am; just to be safe make sure you pass the gate by 5:45am. Bring bear spray, sun screen and 2-3 liters of water. Again, depending on what you do, you may need to bring more water. 

Highly recommend parking at Logan pass or near by (coming to the park early does not guarantee you a spot at Logan Pass). Do the Hidden lake trail; you may see mountain goats as you hike. 

There is so much to see and do. Please do your research. Hidden lake, Avalanche lake and McDonald lake will not disappoint.

"They were spread out along about 30ft of shoreline about 2 ft from the waterline - so probably from a few weeks ago since water levels have dropped. Don’t know what to tell you guys.

They don’t all just scatter Willy Nilla randomly on the lake buzzing off in their own direction once they get dropped.

"""During this era [early 1900s] many towns across the country adopted policies forbidding African Americans from residing or even from being within town borders after dark. Although the policies were rarely formalized in ordinances, police and organized mobs enforced them. Some towns rang bells at sundown to warn African Ameri cans to leave. Others posted signs at the town boundaries warning them not to remain after sundown. A 1915 newspaper article in Glendive, Montana, was headlined ""Color Line Is Drawn In Glendive."" It noted that the town's policy was that ""the sun is never allowed to set on any niggers in Glendive"" and boasted that the town's black population was now a ""minus quantity."" The town of Roundup posted a sign banning African Americans from remaining overnight. In Miles City a once-substantial African Ameri can community was forced to flee by white mob violence."" -excerpt from The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein.

"Your statement is divisive and unnecessarily politically-charged. Rather than simply asking about its history, you went to a racist implication  that is both unnecessary and does nothing to encourage a united-community attitude.

No, there is no racial skew to the curfew siren. As a matter of fact, it was removed a few years ago and the people complained that it be brought back.

"Looks like it’s everywhere. Rental car agencies usually carry rigs for 2-3 years. Auction and buy new ones. Last year they did the auction and didn’t order new as usual with the pandemic. They figured the lots would have plenty of things fell back into play and they were as surprised as the vehicle manufacturers and the shortage of new vehicles. All due to the worldwide shortage of the computer chips and silicon necessary to run these new rigs. 

I live in Alaska and the lots are near empty of 2021-2022’s and the 2020s are gone. Used vehicle sales are way up (in selling price - it’s a seller’s market) and the rentals are ridiculous. 

I have three younger brothers. Mom and Dad’s 50th Anniversary, we grew up in Happy Valley, between the ’Fish and Kalispell - so we’re going back for a killer trip. Point being one brother is flying into Bozeman and another Helena JUST to get rigs. My old man got a 7-person van a while ago, so we’re covered. 

I just thought I’d give it a shot and I’m considering renting a car or two out while down there lol!!! 

Make some vacation monies! Bam!!!

Thanks everyone for your ideas. Even the lots down in the valley are thin on options (for sale). 

Take care everyone, looking forward to the trip - 4 wives with the four of us brothers and 11 grandkids, two are great G/Ks - it’ll be a blast and I’m sure with the van a day for the park - another one two at the water place with the kids and two weeks one at each lake lol - we’ll be good!!",t2_xeysf,AlaskaJaxx,0,1622106032.0,0,t1_gzm7c9s,gzm7c9s,False,AlaskaJaxx,t3_n890cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/whitefish/comments/n890cv/looking_for_a_rental_cartruck/,Looking for a rental car/truck,/r/whitefish/comments/n890cv/looking_for_a_rental_cartruck/gzm7c9s/,1,r/whitefish,0,1
