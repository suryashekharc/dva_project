"This post strikes me as so tone-deaf that I wonder if you’re trolling. You have three houses, two of them being vacation houses mere miles from each other, and you’re fretting over what the culture will bring in 10-20 years? If this post is genuine, I’ll point out that the answer is in the question. You won’t find younger neighbors because their potential homes have all been snatched up as vacation houses by the “haves”; in your case, multiple houses in one community. You can either sit on two mostly-unoccupied buildings or you can complain about having no company around your age.

"I went with some friends just last year. This is a public area with loads of walking trails, so you don't need to worry too much about security, but be aware of other curious, potentially troublesome visitors, or going late at night.   
Theres a neighborhood of houses surrounded by a fence, but there are some spots to crawl under. There is also a bowling alley and other activity buildings, but we never went into that area. Jenny Lind Tower is a short walk away, but was fun to check out. Besides the buildings, there is now a music stage on the baseball field, an overgrown airfield a bit further out with what appeared to be tiny bunker rooms filled with water nearby, as well as the dunes with an amazing view of the ocean. Please do not climb around on the sand, erosion is a big issue.

"When I was growing up in the dark ages, Chatham was for money ""summer people,"" Harwich was solid middle class vacationers, and Dennis was working class. The housing inventory was priced accordingly.

They used to call the Cape the Irish Riviera, as they were a distinct majority of vacationers, followed by Italian Americans and the occasional Canadians, some from Quebec. 

Most were local to New England, and the 2 week vacation at a little motel or efficiency was common. You'd meet fun kids at the beach and they'd be here one day, gone the next.  Now the motels are condos.

  Then came the crush of New Yorkers.  

Now Chatham has a massive influx of Arabs and Russians (maybe not this summer 🤔) with obscene amounts of cash. 

 It wasn't like this in years past, but   this is what happens when the rich decide they want something. They did it to Montana, too. Griping won't change it. Taxing them might not either, as some seem to be laundering money.

">We don’t have any family local to the cape so I’d also be apprehensive of finding a community or way to make friends.

Don't be apprehensive, just forget about it happening period. It is extremely difficult to make or find friends if you're a young professional on Cape, even stretching ""young"" to be up to your 50s. It continues to be difficult if you have kids as families here tend to be clannish and most parents have very limited social interests beyond ""how 'bout dem Patriots."" Over the years, almost every friend we've had has later moved off Cape.

Food. I'll be honest, when we go on vacation, going to restaurants is really the big attraction because there's so little variety on Cape. There's obviously fried seafood and lobsters. More sophisticated contemporary American is finally getting a hold. Foreign is a wasteland. Chinese food here is still straight out 1970s Pu-Pu Platters and Chop Suey--the land Szechuan forgot. There's a couple of ok Thai places and the one Pho place in Yarmouth. Mexican seems to be cursed. Every time we find a good place it closes shortly after. Anything else, fuggedaboutit.

The last time this happened was not a historical event lmao it was because of sub prime lending and inflated home prices. Similar to what’s going on right now minus the subprime (although a lot are short term variable interest rate loans which will come due in 3-5 years) when these loans come due and their houses are worth 25% less than their mortgage they’ll be screwed.

"Living on the Cape had it’s pros and cons, but many people are happily situated here. It’s beautiful in season and there are a lot of cool places to explore. Housing is really hard to find these days, but not impossible. It most likely factor into where you live. I think most towns are pretty nice but some are easier in terms of travel. I love Falmouth and the downtown area there but it can be a bear to go anywhere else in the summer. I live in Sandwich and love it because I’m close to the bridge when I want to go to Boston. Other towns mentioned like Harwich and Barnstable are lovely and have their  own vibe and feel. Chatham is expensive to buy but has the lowest property taxes on the Cape. As far as food goes, there are some really wonderful restaurants here but I would say they are more heavily located towards the outer and mid-cape. Sweet Tomatoes and Moto Pizza in Sandwich are favorites of ours for pizza! Best sushi is at Inaho in Yarmouth. Some of the best restaurants are in Chatham, and they have a great downtown area and theater as well.

"I think the main driver is how much can you afford for housing?  Are you willing to live in a condo?  Or would you prefer a house?  Housing costs vary widely. 

Do you want lots of shopping, night life, activities?  Or quiet and a bit more nature?

I think you can find yoga studios in most/many towns. So that may be less of a concern.  Plus many community centers and schools sponsor classes.

Restaurants abound, but may close for a few months in the off season. 

As for raising kids, in general,  the Cape has an aging population and is losing families and younger adults.   That said, class sizes are often small and inclusive.   Check the demographics of individual towns to find the populations with more kids.

"i grew up in marstons mills for the first 20 years of my life, and i currently am living back here with mom due to all the shit in the world. i'm 36 and gay, so my outlook as a stubborn bachelor probably differs from yours, but i can't wait to get out. this place is miserable for young adults like me. the year round population here has one of the highest average ages of anywhere in the country - old people old people old people. which, that's great for them but it makes *me* feel old too. students in boston were obnoxious but being around that kinda youthful energy does rub off on  you.

if you're raising kids, that sorta domestic life probably vibes well here. my education was excellent, but there's a housing crisis that will effect every level of service because people simply can't afford to live here without making big bucks (i.e. no teachers). but i did grow up really appreciating the beauty of the land and the sensitivity of our ecology.

i don't resent growing up here - i was certainly privileged - but i am always a little jealous of my friends who grew up in more connected, urban areas. i definitely would take the cape over somewhere in remote middle america though, but that may just be my east coast snobbery talking.

not to mention trying to go anywhere in the summer kinda sucks. you really have to plan around tourist traffic.

edit: i may have been talking out of my ass a little bit regarding teachers; in fact i have heard that some schools shut down due to dwindling number of students. no idea how true that is, heard it second hand supposedly from a teacher herself. housing is definitely a problem but i'm just saying i'm not a reliable source on this stuff so ignore that",t2_7v9xysyn,dedolent,0,1647728614.0,0,t1_i1c236a,i1c236a,True,mciccar,t3_thzyva,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeCod/comments/thzyva/moving_to_the_cape/,Moving to the Cape,/r/CapeCod/comments/thzyva/moving_to_the_cape/i1c236a/,13,r/CapeCod,0,13

"Decent restaurants are easily found on Cape Cod, but there are not a lot of certain types. Indian, Cambodian, and Vietnamese restaurants are pretty much nonexistent. Things are looking up in terms of other ethnic cuisines (Peruvian, for instance, in Hyannis, at Tumi), but often the restaurants here have very similar menus. If you love to cook, you will find that houses with really good kitchens are often quite a bit pricier, since so many houses were designed for vacationers or retirees, folks who generally aren't in the market for a high quality, spacious kitchen.

Child care will be difficult to find here, but not impossible; it will probably be expensive. You should definitely scout around for it in advance so you can locate near it. Children help us form connections, so if you are starting a family, you'll find the connections may follow from the people you meet who have children of the same age.

It still has the Coast Guard Air Station, and obviously PAVE PAWS, but as you can see from the responses, housing will likely be an issue for you if it’s not being provided.

There is a housing crisis on the Cape because demand overwhelms supply, especially in the summer months. Year-round residents who do not own homes are getting squeezed out because summer rents are 4-5x what they would be in colder months.

"OP is coming to the Cape in April.  Wellfleet drive-in opens Memorial Day weekend, although the flea market is year round.   Arnold's hasn't posted their reopening date (AFAIK), but last year it was in May,

However, if you're on the outer Cape, you can see Nauset Light, which is the lighthouse thats is on the Cape Cod potato chip bags, it's at Nauset Light Beach (NLB) in Eastham (not the confusingly named Nauset Beach in Orleans).   NLB currently has a very small parking lot due to a construction project and erosion that happened during one of the winter storms, but you should be able to park there in April without a problem.

Edit:  The Wellfleet Cinema's indoor theater is open year-round, but currently closed for repairs; they may be open by the time OP comes.

"**The Wellfleet Drive-In**. It's a little bit of a drive to get to but it's totally worth it. Place is ran by the head of the Drive-In Association of America and has a ton of fun activities around once you are in such as mini-golf and a dairy bar with classic American diner favorites. There's one big screen complete with the original sound boxes from the 1950s. Each ticket is cheap and all are a double feature often starting with a family movie and then ending with something for the adults.

It's a nice one to come a little early to. Bring some folding chairs and a portable radio. Bonus points, have a late lunch at **Arnold's Lobster & Clam Bar** and get a lobster roll before going.

Another suggestion: **The Edward Gorey House**. It's a great tribute to an eccentric children's book illustrator. He is known for comical macabre stories that influenced Tim Burton and Lemony Snicket. It's great seeing his original ink artwork and the house where he spent the last years of his life. It once belonged to a retired sea captain. It's a truly unique place that is well-worth taking a tour of. Plus, you'll probably get to say ""hi"" to a nice cat or two along the way.",t2_h28lo,coldermilk,0,1647381722.0,0,t1_i0t20wx,i0t20wx,True,emeraldrae,t3_texzhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeCod/comments/texzhr/what_are_some_family_friendly_activities_to_do_on/,What are some family friendly activities to do on April vacation in the Cape?,/r/CapeCod/comments/texzhr/what_are_some_family_friendly_activities_to_do_on/i0t20wx/,3,r/CapeCod,0,3

"You're joking, but I think that's actually true.  Rhode Island, Connecticut, and especially Maine have plenty of nice beaches, but because space and access are so linited, which is the root of the traffic problem, it's much more expensive, so it's a bigger flex to talk about a Cape Cod vacation than a more affordable, enjoyable trip to Midcoast Maine. 

I'd add that the traffic doesn't seem like a problem if part of your day to day is sitting on the Southeast Distressway for 45 minutes to travel 4 miles, and you aren't used to how easy it is to get around the Cape in the off-season.

"We did ours at a summer camp so had a similar vibe to a backyard. We priced out backyard but by the time we rented tents, tables, bathrooms etc the cost was the same as renting the camp for the whole weekend, including cabins for guests to stay if they wanted.

Clambake etc is the best! We had such a wonderful time working with them and years later people still rave about the food. We did Hole in One for dessert and next day brunch.

Second doing your own flowers if you have the time. We went to the Boston flower exchange and saved so much money. Prob less than $500 for all the centerpieces and floral decor.

If the Cape is a destination wedding for your guests, we did postcards for our save the dates which was fun. Bought a custom stamp with our info and stamped it on a bunch of vintage cape postcards from the antique center in Dennis.

"If they don't list a pay, I don't bother applying.

I always keep looking to compare my wage to what's out there, and luckily I'm in the top bracket and I like my company, but starting pay should not be a mystery or use ""upon negotiation"" as a hiring haggling piece. I should be a valued employee and not an auction piece. I also hate seeing job descriptions with multiple functions and they use ""team player"" as an excuse to clump three jobs into one. If you can't afford to hire two or three people for separate positions, you aren't a company anyone would want to work for, because I guarantee you will push more and more work as the business grows onto one person until they break.

A long time ago I tried explaining to my employer to split my job or I was going to get burned out with the workload that increased over time. They didn't listen and I left. On my exit interview I spelled out all my job duties and explained they needed to hire more people. One of my co-workers told me after I left they split my job into two full time and one part time positions. If only they had done that when I asked......

Sorry, went on an anecdotal rant. There are good employers out there that do care about their employees, I have been fortunate to work for a few. But sometimes growing companies don't understand when the profits start to increase, they also need to expand their staff.",t2_apsuc,Freakin_Geek,0,1646590873.0,0,t1_hzlqo4k,hzlqo4k,True,redditwastesmyday,t3_t809y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeCod/comments/t809y9/serious_question_to_any_business_ownersanyone_are/,Serious Question to any Business Owners/Anyone - ARE you finding it hard to hire/get/find employees?,/r/CapeCod/comments/t809y9/serious_question_to_any_business_ownersanyone_are/hzlqo4k/,5,r/CapeCod,0,5

"Hey,  >!(this is gonna be long winded so sorry in advance this is a topic I care about a lot) !<

I'm sorry you're going through this. I can deeply empathize with you because I and most others I know are having similar issues and it's literally costing them their lives due to missed major life milestones or due to developing mental health/drug use issues.

Someone/a government should be doing something to look out for the locals- young and old. But no one in charge seems to care enough to do anything to help and it strikes me as surreal and dystopian. (especially as the Cape struggles to find low-wage workers)

**Semi-random thoughts about moving**

One of the problems with moving is that CoL varies and thus what you can get paid. So *Home Depot* in the south probably doesn't pay $16 an hour. Which means making ends meet/finding housing (even though it's cheaper) may be just as hard there.

If you know someone living elsewhere it'd be a good idea to ask them about CoL and their finances. Often people claim *""oh where I LIVE is SOOO expensive""*  (for example in Denver) but by our standards the rest of the nation is relatively cheap. So knowing what things actually cost is useful.

If you can afford a 20% down payment on a 450K house here you can *probably* afford a down-payment on a home in other parts of the nation. The Federal Reserve which offers money to banks which banks then offer as loans [is about to jack up the interest rates on money they give/loan banks. In the next 24 months](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/inflation-fighting-fed-likely-flag-march-interest-rate-hike-2022-01-26/) this will be passed onto consumers thus making it more expensive to get a home-loan from banks. Home loan interest rates are the lowest they've been in more than 40 years and it's likely causing inflation. which is a rabbit hole. Suffice to say getting a home loan with a fixed APR ASAP is probably a good idea.

***To answer your questions:***

I've left Cape Cod longish term 4 times.

The longest times were during college in Western Mass for 2 years and in 2020 just before the pandemic for 6 months to Oakland California.

College was obviously college but my impression of Western Mass was that the towns are just like the ones on Cape Cod and for the most part lack opportunities- economic or otherwise. If you have a trade, a highly in demand skill that you can do remotely or anything in healthcare you might do OK. Northampton, Amherst and Worcester seem to have more varied opportunities but from what I hear Worcester is getting expensive and NoHo and Amherst are college town so.. YMMV

The other time- was in Oakland California. driving across the nation felt rapturous. Felt like a settler going West to a new and promising land. Uh anyway- I applied to niche job on Linkedin at a tech start-up, phone interviewed once, flew to California, did a panel interview and the next day miraculously was offered the job. Flew home and 2 weeks later packed most of what I owned/cared about into my car and headed West.

Before departing home I booked an AirBnB near my new office for 2 weeks planning to search for an apartment during those weeks. >!The lady I stayed with was weird, bragged about being friends with Ted Bundy and her cat threw up on my bed a few times. All told she was really nice just- weird and slightly off-putting. !<I found an apartment fairly easily through Craigslist. The number of apartments available was astounding. Meeting strangers and asking if I could live with them for money was weird though. Lots of scams and underhanded tricks. Being charismatic and asking *lots of* questions is key.

I resigned from that job in mid 2020 due to the pandemic and lots of other factors. (If you want details DM me, I don't want to bore you.)

&#x200B;

One thing I found surreal is that moving from Cape Cod to a new place is very isolating. People won't understand what it's like to grow up on Cape. They'll think it's the paradise the tourists claim it is because that's how the internet portrays it. You also have to consider if you'll be lonely- moving far away without knowing anyone in an area is inherently lonely. You'll have to get good at making friends and accept some weeks of feeling alone.

But on the upside LITTERALLY EVERYTHING IS NEW(!!!) every day is an adventure(!!!) and it's great. All of a sudden there's not a dull weekend for months if not *years.* Everything is new from the food to the way people talk and act to the landscape to the culture.. It's **wonderful.** Plus less old people and more young people and more diversity of perspectives..

Most of the people who move off Cape Cod seem to be able to do so because they got a job offer ***prior*** to doing so. But if you majored in the wrong thing in college this might be tough. Convincing someone many miles away to hire you via video-chat is... uh.. A challenge to say that least.

But yeah- apply to jobs on [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/?q=online+data+entry&aceid=&gclid=CjwKCAiAsNKQBhAPEiwAB-I5zcx6xEEG7txUmEyBwduZqNw078JHgmrcUayDZXRvJLSIMoGYDiYOhRoC7W8QAvD_BwE) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs?src=go-pa&trk=li_sem_namer_careers_jobsgtm_CON-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_ALL_NA_NA_Core_JobsLP_Headterms-Linkedin-Jobs_Brand_Exact_network=g_campaign=15162283135_keyword=linkedin%20jobs&src=go-pa&mcid=6862098078669914124&trk2=ga_campid=15162283135_asid=132290511034_crid=559438513571_kw=linkedin%20jobs_d=c_tid=kwd-1528692947_n=g_mt=e_geo=9002084_slid=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyLPm6a6U9gIVF8mUCR0A2QLWEAAYASAAEgLaX_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), brush up your resume and interviewing skills. Most of the people I know got job offers after college or got stuck here. Service jobs don't exactly have much upward mobility, unfortunately.

The other possibility is dating someone somewhere else and moving in with them so they provide you housing. I know three ladies (one being my sister) who did this and are financially better off for it. *(though this practice also seems demeaning to both individuals)*

All in all I wish you luck. Things should be easier and better for all of us.

Prior generations didn't have it as hard.

*TL;DR:* All we can really do is stay employed, network and keep applying to jobs online.

"This is honestly the best answer. You can move anywhere and have it be cheaper, but everywhere is getting more expensive so if you don't get some sort of training you'll be doing the same thing in 5 years.

I moved to Wilmington, NC. It's where they filmed all the things that ""take place of Cape Cod"" so there is some Cape feel. It's a small city that still does feel huge, but bigger than anything on the Cape. There's a lot to do and the beaches are nice and have lots of restaurants on it. There's a university and community college here too so lots to attract young adults. It's maybe as expensive as most of the Cape, but they're starting to build suburbs that aren't far and much cheaper if you don't mind 10 minutes to downtown or 30 minutes to the beach 

But the South is where things are cheaper, or the Midwest. But most of the Midwest has all the problems of New England with none of the benefits in my opinion. Cold, boring but no beaches or mountains. I lived in Colorado for a while and while it's nice, it's way too expensive now. The whole West coast is the same way.

"I wish I could be as hopeful as you about the housing market as someone who desires to move to the Cape. But I just do not see it. With more and more companies pivoting to permanent work from home, the demand in areas like Cape Cod is going to stay very high. Because why spend $2 million on a house near Boston or near New York City, when you can have the same thing when living on the Cape especially if you love the area? 

This is happening to a much cheaper extent where I live in central Pennsylvania.  We got our house for $240k in 2015. Since the pandemic our value has gone up nearly $100k. It had gone up just $25k in the 5 combined years prior. And this doesn’t factor in the ability to sell over asking price if we were interested in doing so

You have a ton of people coming from Philadelphia and New York who have wads of cash and going $50-70k over asking price here. Don’t get me wrong I love my home. But the idea I could sell it for $420k is crazy to me and it all seems like an artificial bubble. But....it shows no sign of slowing down. Heck, they're putting in a Trader Joe's in our area now after years of petitions so even they know the growing is going to continue. Which means prices won't go down.

"I actually lived in a lot of places before coming to the Cape. I was born in NJ, but lived in NY, PA, IN, IL, and OR.

Advice? If you have a lot of stuff, get rid of half before you move. Don't bring furniture, sell it here and buy used stuff there and wait until you decide you want to stay.

When finding a place, consider what's missing in your life, what you can't live without, and what you want to try. If you're a country mouse, consider the city life for awhile. Etc.

Food. Find a place with good food. There are some shitty areas with shitty food and no foodie culture. Stay away, you'll complain everytime you want to order takeout or try to find an ethnic spice.

Look at if the place you are moving to has already peaked. Yea North Carolina might be nice, but has it reached saturation over the last two decades with New Englanders moving south? Who knows.

If you're in the right career: Get a headhunter and task them to find you a job with moving expenses as part of the hire package. You'd be surprised who will offer that.

"I think you misinterpreted my reply... 

Local governments on Cape Cod are run by town meetings. The government doesn't get to say what to do, it needs to be passed at town meeting. In a town of tens of thousands, only a hundred or two or three show up to vote at town meeting. 

Major financial decisions and zoning changes require 2/3s vote. It's why the government doesn't say, ""We are going to allow weed shops for the tax revenue."" Because it goes before town voters for town voters to make the decision. And of it doesn't pass by the required votes, the change can't happen.

It's not for lack of trying, but the government has to abide by local/state/federal laws. 

So, yes, the government can tell you to turn down Britney Spears because you are breaking a law. So if you want to blast Britney Spears without a visit from the boys in blue,  then you go to get that law repealed. Again, that will take a bylaw change and that bylaw change will need to go before town voters. A lot of people like their peace and quiet and will tell you where to shove Britney Spears.",t2_apsuc,Freakin_Geek,0,1645401450.0,0,t1_hxro0nx,hxro0nx,False,Your_rongagain,t3_swdxpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeCod/comments/swdxpz/how_to_find_housing_near_chatham/,How to find housing near Chatham!!!,/r/CapeCod/comments/swdxpz/how_to_find_housing_near_chatham/hxro0nx/,1,r/CapeCod,0,1

"Her best bet job wise:
Retail: the mall: Target and a few other retailers are paying like $16 an hour, Home Depot is paying $18 an hour.

Grocery stores: Whole Foods (Hyannis) is looking for early morning shifts starting at around $17 an hour I believe? 

Food service: anywhere really, but. The best local place to work right now would be the knack with their new location in Hyannis.  They pay a livable wage and I believe have a few benefits as well. But places like chipotle and Chick-fil-A are also hiring for between $16-$19 an hour. 

Hospitality: best bet is a hotel, I work for Pelham House and they pay $18 an hour and they love to cross train people so if she were to work at a Pelham house location they would probably cross train you in reservations or serving and your wage would stay the same and there’s always room for growth there. Obviously any hotel is a great option especially if she was looking for something she could keep more long term & grow 

As far as housing i’m not sure specifically who has openings but I know for a fact that Hyannis, Dennis & Yarmouth have a lot of affordable housing options. If not I know Carver and Plymouth also have affordable housing options and they also have a great job market up there

"I grew up on Cape Cod. Lived there 21 years. Also never went to college. My last job was serving tables and making about $50-$65/hr and I couldn't find housing near that job so I lived in a van last summer. Then I drove away and I haven't looked back.

It's brutal out there. And despite the relatively progressive nature of the area, it's mostly yuppies who vote against affordable housing in their neighborhoods. So I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for that to happen. 

Oh, and living in a van is specifically illegal in most places on Cape. Towns have by-laws prohibiting sleeping in vehicles on public property, campsites are $1200/mo (only open seasonally too), and good luck finding someone who has the space to park a van or is willing to rent it if they do. In which case you'll probably be paying $500/mo for a *parking spot*. My own grandma charged me $350/mo to park in her driveway last summer.

"Nuclear bombs do not cause tsunamis. Even those detonated underwater displace the water in such a way that it would never form a wave big enough to swallow Cape Cod.

Also, Cape Cod is about as benign as any place in the USA can get. Small year-round population. No major industries or supply chains originate from our region, except for fish, which isn't really a staple in most American households. Relatively few gun owning households. Otis is not a significant base. Overall, Cape Cod poses as much a threat to Russia as an ant does to a human. Maybe capable of delivering an annoying bite. 

That said, if the USA *does* get incapacitated by Russia in some kind of conflict, I'd be scooting off of Cape Cod ASAP. The fact that we don't have much manufacturing muscle means that when supply chains tighten or are broken, you're going to be SOL for a lot of necessities.

Mashpee is great! I don’t live there but a friend does. Very woodsy with some great places to hike and beautiful ponds as well.

"All true. This area has become completely unsustainable. There are mainly service industry jobs here, and the average house price as of last summer was $1.2m. Chatham has even considered giving DOCTORS a $100k bonus to open a practice here so they can afford a house, as there's a huge Dr shortage on the Cape (they can't afford it either, and want to do something other than geriatrics).

I live on Nantucket Isl so I’m not as familiar with all the minutia like some of the people here but I do know that if you are working in Hyannis at the hospital and live any significant distance from your work ….your commute Memorial Day through Labor Day (minimum) will be riddled with Cape Traffic Nightmares.  We go over to Hyannis quite often on the boat but have learned to avoid peak season because it’s wall to wall cars.  Just pointing that out in case it wasn’t something you were aware of.
