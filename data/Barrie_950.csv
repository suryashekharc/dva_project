I have been in the group for years so not a new member.  


Like others have said, leaving the cage outside with food and favourite toys is a good idea. You can also leave food and water dishes in other areas outside so the bird comes down to eat. Also can you play any music or sounds (phone rings, whistles, etc) that are familiar to your bird? It's probably not far from your house. Might be hiding and quiet since that is their instinct when in danger. I read somewhere that most of them are within 500 metres of the house.

"I believe that annual parking of $700 is for places like the Collier Street lot that aren't covered with our resident passes anyway. Great for people who work down there and need to be parking and paying for it anyway.

To me, the article is poorly worded. If you use the hotspot app, which is similar to the Green P or the Mackay Pay app that are used in Toronto and in conservation areas (Tiffin uses Mackay Pay), charges a ""convenience fee"" each time you use it to pay for your parking.

So you go downtown, park on the street during a week day, your resident pass wouldn't cover that so instead of hunting for change you put the spot number into the app, the car your driving and the time you'll be there and you can pay with your credit card.

The $20 annually they refer to is in lieu of the $0.20 per use convenience fee that is charged in the app. If you park downtown less than 100 times a year then the $0.20 per use fee is a better value, over 100 times then the annual / monthly fee is a better option.

"I think an A+++ score refers to a credit score, so a landlord knows you can pay your bills on time. The higher a credit score the better. 

I haven't been a Landlord in awhile but showing evidence of a good job lined up or having a good job is great as well as references from the employer would be great. If you don't have a credit score, a written letter from your employer with how much income you will be earning in the year would be helpful. 

Paying for the year might be enticing to some but I know I would be nervous of getting paid for the next year after that and so on, but it may help. 

Rent in Barrie is one of the highest rental costs in the country I would be nervous to hand over a year's worth of rent to anyone.

"I have a unique perspective.

Barrie and Simcoe County is the farthest south I lived in my life.

I'm originally from Timmins, about 7 hours north of here up Highway 11, and the northernmost big city in the Province. Moved here in 2004, lived in the same part of town til 2020, now live in Orillia, and wanna move back to Barrie.

Simcoe County shares the 705 area code with the eastern half of Northern Ontario, and every car, truck and bus from my city passes through here bound for the big smoke. In a way these qualities about this place are comforting for me. I'm very far south, we have a problem with rich and entitled Dbags here, but thank God i still am in reach of both the ONR and GO train, and have the best of both worlds. Every phone i've ever owned has been a 705 phone and I have the best of both worlds here.

Simcoe is a unique place in Ontario. I met lots of Northerners from Timmins, Sudbury, North Bay, Cochrane, even from Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or in Northern Quebec and peeps from my Cree homeland on James Bay down here, as well as living in the diversity that the south is about. I feel i can still be in my roots here, and we have the best in both worlds. In 8 hours you can be as far north as James Bay or as far south as New York City or Kentucky, and to Montreal and Ottawa about 5-7 hours east, through more ways than just the 401.

Politically though I feel there's potential being squandered. We have a port in Midland and Port McNicoll that shut down in the 80s, and a railway between Barrie, Orillia and Washago that shut down in 1996. If Orillia joined the BCRY we'd still have Ontario Northland and VIA here every day, and LINX could've looked to both trains and buses when they started up 4 years ago.

We're the choke point between Toronto and all of Northern Quebec, Northern Ontario, and Western Canada, and we don't really see any local benefit here from it. Some of those trucks, trains and ships could transfer here or end at new factories here and we can solve our lack of good jobs, but we don't.

"That section of Mapleview was widened from a simple two lane road to a whopping seven lanes with grass shoulders and sidewalks about 10 years ago. You can actually go back and see what the road looked like in 2009 on google street view. At that point the house on the south side still looks like its being lived in, though there's a sign for junk removal at the front of the driveway so they were probably in the process of getting out. The house on the north side is already abandoned at that point, but probably only recently - the siding looks fresh and the lawn is still a lawn. 

Either the government Eminent Domain'd the entire properties and just isn't bothering to demolish the buildings until they actually have something to do with that land, or the former owners sold to some property developer who is doing the same thing, or the people that lived there still own the property, didn't want to live on the high traffic monstrosity Mapleview was going to become, and are also just holding onto it until someone wants to develop the land. In all three cases, demolishing the building costs money. Easier to just keep the buildings boarded up, and pass the costs of demolition on to whoever eventually wants to do something with that land.",t2_jredlytn,Cybar66,0,1647802934.0,0,t1_i1fqwxa,i1fqwxa,True,heather-rch,t3_tiq9yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/barrie/comments/tiq9yb/abandoned_houses/,Abandoned houses?,/r/barrie/comments/tiq9yb/abandoned_houses/i1fqwxa/,14,r/barrie,0,14

"I'm sorry that happened your colleague, genuinely, but at some point people have to consider whether not taking a safe vaccine vs. preserving their livelihood via a job is a hill they are willing to die on. I do understand vaccine hesitancy but at this stage there is myriad data supporting the safety of these vaccines that it is truly nonsensical to continue digging in your heels.

What happens in the event of a future pandemic with a much higher death rate? Should our government not impose restrictions to keep people well if that occurs? Honestly, I feel that if a more serious novel virus were to come about in the future that we are fucked as a species because a subset of the population appears so unwilling to display even a modicum of self-sacrifice in pursuit of the greater good and collective well-being. During times of crisis, personal freedom becomes secondary. 

I don't know what people need to see to be able to arrive at a place where they understand the seriousness of this pandemic and, in turn, why these measures have been necessary. Would it take bodies piling up in the streets? The reason we haven't made it to that point is in part due to the restrictions that have been imposed.

Is the insulation actually sufficient in that area? How did you confirm this? If you've trampled the insulation by crawling in the area you've just reduced its effectiveness.

How are you confirming it's actually losing heat through the roof and not going off a feeling? Thermal imaging?

Edit: are you saying there's a wet spot on the underside of the roof deck? That could be a roof leak or condensation forming due to warm air entering the cold attic. Without adequate ventilation from the soffits and roof vents condensation and possibly mould can occur. Any company that works with attic insulation should know how this all works.

"Lol. Okay. Should we define basic?

Health measures (such as a mask) that have the potential to protect others from becoming sick are minor impositions. I'm perfectly okay with being temporarily inconvenienced if it means that I'm helping to reduce the spread of a virus that has killed  over 6 million people globally. 

It's not logical to compare lending my couch to a homeless person vs. wearing a mask in a grocery store. I can't end homelessness by letting one homeless person sleep on my couch but I can donate to shelters or volunteer to help vulnerable populations. In the same way, one person wearing a mask isnt going to eliminate covid but collectively we can reduce the spread of the virus by doing small things to protect ourselves and others. 

Sometimes being part of a society means a certain degree of self-sacrifice, especially in times of crisis.

"I have a Canadian flag tattoo on my left arm and for years I‚Äôve flown a flag in my yard. It‚Äôs my only tattoo and I only got it (years back) because I thought at the time that I would never ever be ashamed of it. I come from a long line of veterans, 4 in fact of which 2 didn‚Äôt return, and it seemed unfathomable that I would ever face a time in my life when I wouldn‚Äôt be proud to show my patriotism. 

Wow‚Ä¶.shit can turn in a hurry.
