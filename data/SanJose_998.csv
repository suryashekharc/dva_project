"Ask yourself where you got the idea boomers are the people ruining your life, just consider where you got that ‘idea’ from. Consider how it’s pushed all over the media and why 

Klaus Schwab is the head of the WEF. We’re going down that road because it’s the main hub of politicians backed by the world bank (politicians you brought up, not me).

You want talk about the issues, let’s go. 

BlackRock owns 10 trillion dollars of US business, real estate, businesses, etc. this is backed by world bank credit. How do you think they buy up everything of value?

California’s governor is a WEF Global Youth Leader funded by the world bank from his early days as deputy mayor of SF.  His father was the lawyer for the Getty Oil Cartel and first billionaire. Newsom was considered ‘a son’ of JP Getty. Most of his businesses are funded from his trust fund, and his businesses partners which include members of the Getty Family and his Aunt Pelosi’s son.

Newsom during the pandemic created a new law that gives the state first right of refusal for all real estate purchases. In the last year he’s purchased several thousand homes, apartments and hotels/motels off the public market using tax payer dollars.

Newsom ran on the promise to ‘build build build’ but his housing numbers are the worst literally ever for any governor. In fact, apartment building construction is down 60% from when he took office.

And, the biggest complexes being built are being done by mega corporations that will create ‘rental’ properties only (not for sale).

Newsom, and mega corporations bid on nearly all homes up to a %, and often way over asking. The common people are competing with their own damn government and banker funded corporations for housing.

Hey man, I could go on and on and on. But you keep spouting some propaganda piece paid for by one of the mega corporations and their bank funded lackeys.   

Again, it’s not the 80 year old who takes 3 naps a day that’s your enemy, never has been.  Think about it.

And, no matter what you think of me for trying to help you open your eyes, it’s irrelevant.

They own the media, social media, pharmaceuticals, insurance, transportation, farms, chemical companies, supply chains, food packaging, ranches and meat processing, commercial real estate etc and they’re buying over 3000 homes out of the public sector a month since 2008 to help bring on the permanent rental class.

">This is the outcome of a concerted and long-term ""traffic calming"" program. A bunch of City officials toured around to some well-known bike-friendly cities, like Portland. 

Why the scare quotes around traffic calming? That is what happened on 10th/11th St. The changes implemented are mostly not new things in traffic engineering and have been shown to slow down speeding drivers and reduce injuries from collisions involving cars. Do you have alternate actionable by the city within a few years suggestions on how to accomplish those things? 
    
>They also recently installed a bunch of barricades on 10th and 11th, but they overreached on some of those. They made the space too narrow and some of them got mowed down pretty quick.   

The city hoped the flex posts would be enough. Alas, there are apparently to many reckless drivers and they are evaluating their options for more robust infrastructure. 

>They couldn't be bothered to do any proper outreach for any of this, but they did put up some confusing signs about a year or so ago.

""The city has only filled 18 of 30 positions budgeted for the traffic enforcement team, Police Chief Anthony Mata said during a news conference on Wednesday, adding that traffic-related deaths continue to outstrip crime-related deaths in recent years.""

""Traffic enforcement staffing was at the center of a spat Tuesday when the city council overwhelmingly shot down a proposal by Davis to expand the traffic patrol team beyond 30 officers in the upcoming city budget. Davis said the traffic division is underprioritized leading to the paltry staffing numbers. Mayor Sam Liccardo supports filling the current vacancies but preserving any newly budgeted officers for other divisions.""

"A single family home? Most likely not. If youre looking at a town home or condo, then most likely. Depends how much you save for a down payment. 


Personally I’d recommend doing some research on where in Santa Clara you’d like to live. What neighborhood you’d want to raise a family if you want to raise a family. Property in California is a great investment but it takes a lot of upfront cost. 

This doesnt even begin to factor in moving costs, upkeep of your home, etc. 


Even homes in great shape will need some work done. I spent close to 15k in repairs and upgrades the first year i owned my home (things i knew about when i purchased the house).

"Look up the Nuremberg code as a result of the Nazi atrocities during WWII using concentration camp prisoners, Jews, Poles, Gypsies, Gays as lab rats, and learn some history about coerced human experimentation. These people don't want to be lab rats. 

The shots have not gone through proper clinical trials which take 5 to 10 years, so you are being used as experiment fodder for an experimental gene therapy which is provably neither safe nor effective. 

Meanwhile there are cheap, safe and effective treatments which would invalidate the EUA making the shots illegal, but, they have been systematically withheld. Fauci even wrote a paper on the efficacy. All to line the pockets of pharma executives and corrupt government bureaucrats with the people's treasury, at the tune of trillions of dollars.

These people are old enough to remember.

"This is the outcome of a concerted and long-term ""traffic calming"" program. A bunch of City officials toured around to some well-known bike-friendly cities, like Portland. Then they came back and started redesigning the streets. It's been going on about 3 or 4 years now. That's when they started painting the bike lanes green and cutting off some places you used to be able to turn right on red (like from San Sal onto 10th - so poorly signed it feels like entrapment). They also narrowed lanes and returned a portion of Julian back to two-way. But I hope they keep 10th/11th and 3rd/4th. One-way streets are way better for traffic flow. They also recently installed a bunch of barricades on 10th and 11th, but they overreached on some of those. They made the space too narrow and some of them got mowed down pretty quick.

"For those that don't know -- the barrier to entry for posting on [care.com](https://care.com) is about as high as posting an ad on Craigslist. Last time I used it for a nanny search was \~ 3 years ago, and at least at that time the hit-to-miss ratio wasn't very good. We would clearly state what we wanted in our ad, and people would contact us and waste our time by messaging back and forth and then tell us they only wanted X, even though we clearly stated we weren't offering X (e.g. 40 hours/week).

Another gem - interviewing someone that seriously came to our house and casually said she's just looking to nanny until she can do X instead as her preferred job. Umm, OK you can leave now.

"I did a lot of research at one time for hiring a nanny.  One point that I recall now years later is to ask the pointed questions you think they would lie to you about if it were true:
- have you ever been arrested?
- have you ever been fired?
- do you use drugs?
- have you ever been accused of a crime against a child?

The advice suggested that when pointedly asked, people answer honestly much of the time.  In the short time I was interviewing, I found it to be true.  

Also, go with your gut feel.  If something seems off but you just can’t put a finger on what it is.  Don’t dwell on it, just pass them up.  Your instinct is  telling you something.  

I had a candidate that seemed great - good experience, loved kids, very personable, work ethic, but weirdly I never got her application despite her telling me she dropped in the mailbox one and twice on the doorstep.  She had already been to the house so I knew she knew where it was.  The application, btw, asked those kind of questions.  I think she was hoping I would just let it go because it seemed like we had a good fit.  Nope.  She was hiding something.

Sometimes you stopped in a parking lot and hung out and talked to other people you met. Maybe find out where there was a party and get invited.

"Check out r/nanny. We had a nanny for the twins’ first three years and used care.com to find them. It’s kinda like the LinkedIn for caretakers. 

One thing to keep in mind is that a career nanny will want full time work. 

For us, paying taxes (above board) was non negotiable and that definitely narrowed our pool of candidates. We had luck finding folks who were preschool teachers before.

"We had one during COVID. I think we found her on sitter city. We were paying $22/hr, which is probably below market, but both of us preferred it not be above the table payment. If you’re going legit on paying a nanny there’s a significant amount of taxes due that amount to an additional roughly 15%. The best thing you can do is check prior references. Also be very thorough as to what is and isn’t expect in the job description. Ideally there’s more in it and you encompass anything and everything that has to do with taking care of your child during work hours as well as prep for off time. I’ve had friends have very good luck with Au Pairs from other countries, and the cost is significantly less than a nanny. We loved our nanny but ultimately the cost was far prohibitive. Even $22/hr for 40 hours a week is $3800/mo. After COVID died down we went back to daycare, which is $2100/mo for 5 days a week (7:30-6:00 if we want). It has its pluses and minuses.

"Well, it’s fastest for a lot of reasons. Late stage capitalism is fascist. That’s where we’re at, and that’s where we are.

My husband and I pay about $20,000 a year to San Jose in property tax. That should cover our sidewalks and roads. But we are finishing up our $10,000 sidewalk project around our house and there are potholes on our street. 

In San Jose cops get something like 34% of the cities budget plus a whole lot of other money, including federal $ & lots from San Jose’s general funds budget. In 2020 SJPD sued San Jose for over a million bucks for overtime & won. There was also a settlement for a police dog attacking a small child during a “wellness check “. Every police settlement comes out of a cities general fun budget. Please keep in mind that the more police take for themselves, the less there is for everything else - like sidewalks (housing, school nurses & councilors, mental health care, etc) . 

The role of police is to keep us compliant in a society with vast inequity. All wealth generated goes up to the upper class, the 1%. Police exist to protect their interests, not ours. 

The United States has by far the strongest military in the world and at last count, 49 guns for each citizen. Our military receives a huge budget, infinite money. Their old gear goes to police. Cops in the United States are more militarized than other countries actual militaries. When we have this much money for military but no money for sidewalks & basic infrastructure, that’s fascist. 

If you want to go to Webster’s to define fascism, “forcible suppression of opposition” is the definition. We homeowners are not allowed to petition against replacing the sidewalks. The city doesn’t care if you don’t have the money. They will fine you and punish you if you’re not compliant. 

Taxes should handle our basic infrastructure. I’m 52. When I was a Bay Area kid, taxes paid for sidewalks. People also received pensions and could retire. Everyone had healthcare. It was a very different society. 

A few things have changed since then. The United States has become the worlds number one jailer. We’re talking in the history of the world. Here at home SJPD are recruiting all the time. Police are the one group in our society who still receive a pension and can retire. The 1% has socially engineered/ brainwashed everyone to think that police are necessary, when they are not. People also believe the lie that cops keep us safe, when they do not.",t2_om89q,Anagatam,0,1648170641.0,0,t1_i20aok7,i20aok7,False,mangocasio,t3_tle0uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/tle0uq/received_a_letter_in_the_mail_from_the_city/,Received a letter in the mail from the city indicating I have to repair my home's sidewalk/curb.

"I'm old enough to remember cruising First street every weekend in the 70's. It was a mix of white people in Camaros and Mustangs and Hispanics in lowered Impalas and Regals. Eventually the city started diverting traffic to discourage cruising. So everyone went to Los Gatos and essentially took over that downtown every weekend. That lasted at least a couple years. After LG, people cruised on Blossom Hill road (in front of Oakridge mall), then moved on to El Camino.

The most fun was the illegal drag racing on Bailey road on weekend nights. Huge crowds would show up. Scouts with CB radios (no cell phones yet) were posted at each end to watch for cops. White start and finish lines were painted 1/4 mile apart on the eastbound lanes. Flashlight started races, crowd at the finish line decided the winner.

"> You mean I have the option to pay 6x as much for something that’s ~~not going to taste as good~~ made from cheaper ingredients? Sign me up!

If you're gonna criticize Vegan food, do it correctly. The problem with Vegan food isn't the taste, I've had a gazillion Vegan recipes that are delicious in their own right.

My beef with Vegan food is that all the ingredients are plant-based, which is almost always cheaper than animal product based version.

"They are not focusing on curbs and sidewalks. They are working to keep them maintained which is a constant effort. The city should be expected to work on many things at once. This is something they have obligations to do because of various laws and court precedents. It’s also wanted by many residents. 

As to potholes, I find they patch them acceptably within a week or two of me reporting them. I sure wish the city were more proactive, but we don’t fund the government well enough to do that. 

As to where the money goes; have you read any city auditors reports? Attended any of the meetings where the overall budget or specific department budgets are discussed?
