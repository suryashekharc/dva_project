Over a weekend, an account was posting context, and trying to debunk their lies. David Knight was engaging in argument with that account during the weekend.

If David was an admin of the group, 'he' could have removed the posts and banned that account at any point during the weekend.

"We're talking Cheema?  
They (Aran Cheema, and Robert Forsythe) were behind the AAP vote on the public works recently, which I believe capitalized on the distrust sown by Squamish Voices.

Gord Addison of Squamish Forward also pushed for it.  


&#x200B;

Is there any benefit to delaying the publics works facility for Cheema (I can't see any), other than political posturing?  


Cheema have also run attack ads previously, on the same 4 council members that SV is attacking.  


  
But my gut feel, after speaking with them, is that they aren't behind this campaign. Don't get me wrong, Bob Cheema is shady AF, definitely got weird vibes from him, but didn't get SV vibes.

(my gut could be wrong, don't take this as fact, just opening the door to discussing other options too)  


The SV ads are attacking councillors who moved here within the past decade-ish, and aren't attacking those who were born here. Could there be an Old vs New Squamish thing at play here?

A group of people who are annoyed at the way Squamish has changed since these new councillors have come to town.

Or someone who ran previously and didn't get elected and is pissed by it. Someone with a lot of money, to throw around in a fuck you campaign.

Or a developer who the council has consistently denied rezoning or permit applications but is also against densification? (this really sounds like Cheema when I'm writing this out)

But this is nonsense. “Whataboutism” is a propaganda term. There’s not one law for the goose and one for the gander. Moral rules apply across the board. That’s what makes them rules. Crime is crime. Hypocrisy is hypocrisy, wherever it applies.

But Dermod Travis of IntegrityBC has compiled a list that he calls the “$100,000 club.” It has 177 members, including developers, mining companies and energy firms that have fed the party some $55.7 million in the past decade.

"There is the concept of a prescriptive easement in both American and Canadian law, a legacy from British common law on which both are based. I'm not a real-estate lawyer so I could be very wrong in my reading.

The idea behind a prescriptive easement is that if the public has been using that property for some time and the owner never posted ""no trespassing"" or fences, then public does have a right to insist on continuance of that usage.  In this case, I don't know when this land was acquired nor the statutory length of time to establish a prescriptive easement.  It's possible that the public might have some right to insist the trails not be removed or at least an agreed upon accommodation.

I have never seen a no trespassing sign nor fences on the property.

[Jonathan Burak and Todd Lawson are Co founders and publishers](https://www.mountainlifemedia.ca/our-team/) of Mountain Life Magazine. 

[Tim Emmett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Emmett) is a renowned adventure climber who has his own Wikipedia page. He's the one whose fine was doubled because he had a prior offense. 

I hesitate to try to pin down the other three in case I get it wrong but it's pretty clear that they're industry professionals of some sort , and likely derive their living from things like this.

"Interesting observations, especially about the guy facing the higher fine. 

My comment on the nature of the offence was meant to imply that society fines people for other things, for example speeding, at a much lower rate. A restaurant fined for violating public health protections got something like $500. Lots of other examples.

I don't disagree with the fine, just that the amount was high.

"Really I think it's to make a statement and to some degree I agree with that. I'm a bit torn about the whole thing but rules are rules I suppose and personally I have always tried to respect land boundaries in my climbing.

Tim Emmett (who's facing the higher fine) is an absolute monster in multiple disciplines of climbing, base jumping, wing suiting and is generally an all around good dude but this is clearly to make an example and set precedent around land rights and trespassing. 

Part of being good ambassadors and stewards of our sports is to respect land rules even if it limits what we can do and inconveniences us.

"Hi - here's [the latest guidelines](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing/when-to-get-a-covid-19-test) from CDC. Short version:

You don't need testing. If you're sick, stay home. It really doesn't matter if it's Covid making you feel rough or something else. Once you feel better, go back to your life.

You may need testing if: you're immune compromised, you didn't get the vaccine, you work with high risk groups (ie: us, at the hospital).

You can no longer roll up to The Shady for a test, we aren't there^now. You can come to ER, but you'll get a version of the above before you're sent home without a test (unless... see above).

If your symptoms are bad, come to ED. If you're not sure, come in anyway. We'd rather tell you that you're OK (or not) than have you suffer at home.

"Sure but a two month arrangement is short term rental. Anyone looking for long term tenants isn't signing people up on 60 day lease agreements. You might find a unicorn where those dates may specifically suit an owner in between tenants or before/after reno's etc but it could be a longshot. Airbnb and similar vacation stay rental platforms will likely have options for you, but their prices may more be based on nightly/weekly rental rates. At 2 months you might be able to negotiate a better rate, but as someone else mentioned, those 2 months are prime time so you may not have a lot of leverage.

"Triggered! This is one of my biggest rant topics. Snow really brings to light just how much dog shit lies in our parks, playgrounds, school grounds and trails. My dog is a poopsicle aficionado so I am particularly cognizant of how much there is at any time of year as she is always sniffing it out, but the snow makes it super obvious just how bad this problem is. Without a doubt there are countless dog owners (our neighbours) who go out EVERY DAY and don't pick up after their dog. There are several regular offenders in my neighbourhood, and they're just the ones I've seen or caught doing it. The most common reason for left turds from my observations? Off leash dogs that are not being watched. Owner walks ahead, conveniently on their phone or chatting with a friend, while rover lags behind and drops a bomb right by the picnic table. My favourite encounter with these filthy, selfish fucks, was a guy who showed up at a school field, let two dogs off leash, both of which stopped and dropped their turds within 60 seconds. He hadn't seen me and my dog and I conveniently made my presence known right as he began to just walk away. After realising I was there, he starts patting his pockets and then looks to me and asks if I had a spare bag OR TWO. Guys walking two dogs, through a school ground, with no bags, leaving dog shit for kids to stand or fall in. Trash humans. I also stumbled across two separate piles right under the kids play structure in our local park immediately after the first large snowfall back in December.

"Yup. People are terrible. 
As a dog owner, a couple things I can note that I found tricky about this snowy season re: picking up poop: 
(Pre-emptive statement: these are not excuses, as there really aren't any, we should simply be doing this well, they're just some of my experiences)

- often I'd go to grab it, and if I'm wearing gloves, it's really tricky to pick it up cleanly cause you can't feel

- if it's really coming down, some dogs tend to travel as they plop, so at night you see where they go, and grab it fast, but sometimes snow starts to cover it really fast and you think you've got it all, but perhaps a turd is missed cause it's already covered in snow or tumbled down a boot hole

- with this really crusty, icy stuff we've had, you go to pick it up, and it slips and slides and smears as you grab it, or it falls down into a boot hole and you reach in to get it, but then as you grab a piece, another falls out of the bag, and then you're just playing fumbly poops all night in the fucking cold while you're dog is dragging you down the goddamn street... It's a real curveball from the typical grab and go out of the short grass (that some even still fuck up) we're used to. 

Anywho... Like I said, not excuses, cause there aren't any, we should all just be better at this... but just providing some examples of how it does get tougher in the snow.",t2_9okc8,TaySharpe,1,1642203351.0,0,t1_hsp2s1j,hsp2s1j,True,Coolcoolcool2035,t3_s44ju1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Squamish/comments/s44ju1/so_much_poo/,So much poo,/r/Squamish/comments/s44ju1/so_much_poo/hsp2s1j/,-3,r/Squamish,0,-3

"It's a Snowskate, the bottom is made just like you would for skis or snowboards, with base material, edges, and wood core. The sizes and shapes are made specifically for snowskating. The top deck is like a skateboard, just a bit stronger, and bigger.  Then instead of regular skateboard grip we use foam grip, its waterproof and you kind of sink into it. There is also a spot to attach a leash, as you would for surfing, for when riding on the resorts. The two boards are separated by a pair of trucks, which are rigid side to side.  The top being wider and higher is how you are able to carve edge to edge.

They also make things called POWDER SURFERS, which is more like a snowboard or surfboard with grip but they only work in powder.

"Appreciate the feedback, I'd give the downtown snow clear a F grade at best, meaning my road/sidwalks haven't been cleaned at all.  Understanding the lack of people to do the work, and the difficulty most businesses are having with staffing levels certainly explains it though.  

My inlaws live in Winnipeg, they struggling with clearing mostly due to it being too cold for salt to be useful, and plows can't melt ice so it still compacts during the year, but mostly they do a pretty good job...that -44 wind chill in PegCity today is just brutal though.  

I did read elsewhere that the Lower mainland is on a typical 5yr snow blast schedule.  I'm not certain how scientific that is, but it matches the typical la nina cycles so makes sense.

"**From the article:**

The B.C. Mountaineering Club (BCMC) has entered into an partnership agreement with Recreation Sites and Trails BC—a division of the province’s Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRO)—to manage the popular hiking trail and alpine lake in Squamish after the area was designated a formal recreation site earlier this year.

*”I’ve been told this is a bit of an experiment in that this will be the first alpine recreational site in the province,”* said David Scanlon, a member of BCMC’s executive board and a past president of the club.

Scanlon helped spearhead the construction of Watersprite’s trail and existing hut more than a decade ago. The 10-person, reservation-only BCMC hut at Watersprite Lake opened to the public in 2017, after the access trail was completed in 2016. The recreation site will be bordered on two sides by Garibaldi Provincial Park.

***Beginning next summer, Scanlon said the plans are to have 20 newly built, pay-for-use lakeside campsites available by reservation only.*** At this point, ***the fees will be set at $15 per campsite, per night,*** he said.

Turning Watersprite into a formal rec site ***“is going to be quite the transition, because everybody’s been under the impression that you just go up and grab a spot. This is going to be new,”*** said Scanlon. *“This will be a challenge and I’m anticipating a few hiccups, but we’ll see.”*",t2_6i9dwst7,wavesofhalcyon,0,1641339288.0,0,t1_hra45cg,hra45cg,True,wavesofhalcyon,t3_rw80sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Squamish/comments/rw80sm/watersprite_lake_officially_designated_bc/,Watersprite Lake officially designated BC recreation site,/r/Squamish/comments/rw80sm/watersprite_lake_officially_designated_bc/hra45cg/,2,r/Squamish,0,2

"I'd recommend reading a bit about avalanches before going into it. I read the bible (staying alive in avalanche terrain) beforehand and felt like I got more out of the course since I could spend time asking more in depth questions instead of trying to grasp the concepts. 

'Staying alive in avalanche terrain' is probably overkill before taking the course, maybe start with something basic, like understanding how avalanches work, the different types of avalanches, how to identify avalanche terrain and the basic procedures of a rescue. 

Also, group dynamics is a major component of the AST course. For my course we talked a lot about how to make decisions as a group and how to listen to others. Doesn't matter how much you know, but if you feel pressured and can't speak up when decisions are being made then it won't matter. You'll meet a lot of people during the course, try to focus on finding people with the same level of risk tolerance and ambition (some people get way in over their heads when they first get into it, big red flag), skill level is less important as long as they can take care of themselves. Quality over quantity, having 2-3 reliable partners are much better than a pool of people you don't really know. Don't sweat it if you only have 1-2 people to start with, you'll eventually meet more people on the way

You'll likely spend majority of the first season in low risk terrain, so this is the time to bond with your partners and dial in a system for your group

Here's a link to a site where you can see who owns the towers in Canada. Always got to check when moving somewhere since the Telco customers of the tower owner will always receive priority access on the towers, meaning if you're on Bell, connecting to a Telus or Rogers tower, you get in line for your data/cell requests to be handled behind all the Telus/Rogers customers.

"I know Squamish is quite the trek from North Van/Lynn Valley, but I'm hoping to reach a wider audience, especially if anyone travels between the two cities. Yesterday we received a report of a sighting of Luna in West Lynn/Lynn Valley on Friday 03 Dec at 6:30am. Unfortunately it took a while for word to reach us, as the reporter only saw the posts about her yesterday. 

We have received advice that the best way we can spend our time right now is to SPREAD AWARENESS as much as possible to get more eyes looking out for her and more sightings. 

WE NEED YOUR HELP TO REACH THE FOLLOWING GROUPS:  
\- Biking, hiking, running and dog walking groups  
\- Bus and taxi companies  
\- Conservation parks, wardens and park managers  
\- North Shore block watch groups  
\- Businesses around Lynn Valley  
\- SPCAs, shelters and vets

If you do see her: DO NOT APPROACH. LUNA is a female white Jindo mix dog is missing in North Vancouver since November 29, 2021. She is 3 years old, approx. 40 lbs, microchipped and spayed. She's wearing a purple collar and dragging a black and royal blue leash, with a grey harness on. She is shy, timid, and skittish.

There isn’t really another spa massage type experience in Squamish. However we have plenty of great massage therapists in this town!

I loathe Squamish now. I go there early to do my things and GTFO quickly. The highway northbound was gridlock every day of the week this summer by 11am. There is a real homogeneous quality to the masses in Squamish which I find really alienating. Tacoma-Arcterxy-Santa Cruz to the tits everyone.

"The movie is awesome!  Watching the precision, calm movements of Leclerc on solo climbs was truly inspiring. Every move was measured, planned, no hesitation, without fear.

I will never climb even a hundredth as well as Leclerc but I wish I can have the a hundredth of his concentration, calmness and mindfulness.  Sometimes I wonder if being that close to death is the only way to achieve that type of concentration.

I love this quote in [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-09-14/the-alpinist-true-story-brette-harrington-marc-andre-leclerc):

*“I have this vivid memory of first meeting him in Squamish, coming out of the woods, barefoot with no shirt on,” remembered Honnold. “He had just climbed this big wall by himself. I thought: ‘What a stud, coming out of the forest. Technically, I might be able to do the things he does, but I’ll never be that cool.’”*

"I've got quite a few issues with things that have happened under her government. 

-The removal of the spit was a massive FU to all outdoor recreators. 

-Likewise, the camping bylaw was both terrible for recreators while also adding some vague wording which could allow for tent cities to form public parks. 

-Introduced a cash in lieu of parking bylaw under the guise of reducing vehicle emissions, this is fine in theory except when you consider the following:

---Downtown is already low on parking

---There is no connectivity between areas of Squamish. Try living in Brackendale and getting to downtown without driving

-Done nothing to improve the terrible bus system

-Spent millions on active transportation projects that still don't help with connectivity of the town

-Basically said no to single family developments and simultaneous approving tons of multi family developments which had multiple effects:

---further turns Squamish into an effective suburb of Vancouver

---Drives small residential housing contractors out, some of Squamishs few local industries

---Rapidly adds density the town isn't ready to handle in terms of jobs and amenities.

"100% unsubstantiated rumors overheard at a Squamish bar - and drinking was involved:

A founding partner of the Sea2Sky Gondola project is Jayson Faulkner, an ex-municipal councillor from Whistler. Jayson has also founded a similar gondola project in Chilliwack for Mt. Cheam.

Rumour has it, a biker gang in Chilliwack tried to extort Jayson to include them in the Chillwack project, but he refused. That led to the first cutting of the line. After presumably continuing to refuse to collaborate on the Chilliwack project, the line was cut again. And when you think about all the security that was brought in after the first attack, it does make some sense that you'd need a sophisticated organized crime group to pull off a repeat attack.

Of course, if the extortion concept is true, finding the perpetrator will be nearly impossible, because these guys are professionals and will have extensively covered their tracks.

"My thoughts on this are a little different than most.  I think it is a serial vandal.  Like an arsonist, but with a different destructive desire.

The reason this makes sense to me is that if the cutter was from a known group with some kind of motive like a climber or disgruntled employee it would have made this person much easier for the police to find.  From what I can tell they have absolutely nothing.

There was also a series of acts of vandalism very close by with the same type of tools so this could very well be the same person.

A lot of people have commented that the cutter would need to know a lot about lift systems, but I don't see why.  It appears that the cutter hiked up to a tower in the dark (headlamp), climbed one of the towers (ropes and maybe bolt cutters), and then cut the main cable (battery powered angle grinder with an extension... my guess is that it was duct taped to a hockey stick).  This person would be cutting at one of the sheaves so once the cable snapped it would go flying in either direction and leave the cutter safe below the middle of the sheaves.  Not rocket science.

I think the gondola should skip all the security guards and just hire a couple of lifties to run the gondola all night at slow speed.  It would be impossible to cut it while moving.

My second guess would be a local that thinks the development of the last couple of decades has ruined Squamish.  As a group, this is much harder for the police to comb through and from my own personal experience there is a lot of angst from long time locals being priced out of town.  The Gondola is kind of a symbol of the growth and development of the ""new Squamish"".

I don't think this was necessary.  Everyone knows what would happen if you cut the cable and there is no deep knowledge required to figure out how to climb a tower.

So this is where I start to take some exception. As a person that grew up here in the 70’s/80’s/90’s… I left because I didn’t belong in Old Squamish.

I fit in here now after returning years later in ways I never would have before and I don’t think I am alone. Yes it is expensive.
