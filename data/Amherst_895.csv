"Good old Phil. My friends and I have stopped and smoked a few cigarettes with him on one or two occasions. He is actually very friendly and didn’t seem to have anything funky going on with him (erratic behavior, intoxication stuff etc.)

From the conversations, if you press him and engage respectfully, he actually has much tamer views on things than his signs let on. Not sure if that is saying much considering he has signs that say Vaccines Make Your Dick fall off but whatever. He did seem to be obsessed with saying really inflammatory stuff to get a reaction though so like you’d get him going on a minute or two of non-lunatic opinion (mostly libertarian, reactionary populist shit) but then he’d call for someone to be beheaded and look at us waiting for a reaction.

General: allows you to park in any “general” parking space in any lot on campus ($120 a year)

Reserved: allows you to park in any general or reserved space on campus. Reserved spaces are the closest ones to everything. (This permit is EXPENSIVE)

"Interesting read. My take away is that it looks like much of the problem comes down to wages, Covid and communication.

As a result of understaffing and ever changing Covid-related regulations, employees are being asked to do more than ever. These employees feel their compensation is not reflecting their additional responsibilities. Workers also feel they are receiving very little notice or instruction regarding what is expected of them.

This appears to be a cyclical problem in that the low wages and post-Covid labor climate make it difficult for employers to fully staff their operations.

Iya is a crowd pleaser w/ Bao , sushi  etc) . panda or ginger garden for regular Chinese food ( they each have large menu’s that include more than traditional ) . Each has its own atmosphere. Panda has sushi too 
Lunch specials are a great time perfect to give places a try. There is a newer place idk what it’s called that you can cook your own on route 9 heading to belchertown. Ps north Amherst house of teriyaki changed things up (  soon dubu is memorable )  their bento box

"Frankly I hit all 4 . Also Atkins in Amherst -Atkins farm is hard to beat for in season produce . Hit farm stands when you see them now ,especially for corn - the season ends quickly take advantage. Whole Foods seafood and sale items ( their salmon is richer -I don’t eat fish but I will try it and cook it .so I am hyper aware ) their salmon is consistent quality and price ) I am not pleased with Whole Foods produce but their tofu  and their kale is priced best .People love the place between the malls ( it’s an interesting store and stocks international items  I think maple farms a worth checking out ) I like moms for Asian groceries they have nice produce but not a lot, Indian groceries ( spices etc next is right next door (looks like a  variety store but it’s has food)  Trader Joe’s for stocking up  on 
non-perishables ,snacks, and happy staff .
In general I find big y is more expensive but there is a draw for their sales and so it evens out  their bakeries are comparable but big Y has an edge they (plus they have pizza and subs)  . I prefer the deli at stop and shop. Hey not sure where your are from but it’s a tough area to find good sub … forget about it. Big Y when I am desperate ( and I have tried them all ) they also have fresh fish dinner if you plan to eat it fast . The times are limited daily . The price is great they cook it fresh .

"My two cents: Oriental Flavor inherited the mantle from the original Amherst Chinese (now Formosa) and they are consistently good.

I have not had good luck at all at Formosa. The wait staff have a very off putting sense of humor and the food is randomly flavored. They quite often are out of standard menu items and they burn their duck dishes.

Panda East is exactly what you would expect. They are fine in person, but getting any kind of take out can be dicey in that they apparently have a policy to never admit to making mistakes.

I'm a mom and cook for a family, so the smaller portions and sizes of everything at Aldi drive me nuts. Also, I don't care for the quality of produce there. OUt here, we have farm stands and farmer markets everywhwere.. there is no reason to eat crappy veggies!

Check out Maple Farm Foods in Hadley. There is a weekly farmers market every week on the common in Amherst. If you don't mind a bit of a drive, Granby has tons of terrific farm stands that cannot be beat. Check out Sapowsky's, Dave's Natural Garden (best CSA in the Valley IMHO), Breezey Acres on Pleasant Street for some of the best salads and soups you've ever eaten. Breezey Acres is on a local farm that has been in the same family here since 1840's! Evelyn is a rockstar.

Big Y has undergone a big change and leans closer to Whole Foods in pricing. Amazing company and the family that owns Big Y treats their employees fantastic. Good wages and beneifts, they even offer scholarships to the high schoolers who work there. A lot of us shop there to support this business in addition to having some of the nicest stores around. The Big Y in South Hadley is our homebase for everything I can't get at the farm stands.

The reason I don't want to use the shuttle service we've already booked is because A, I'd be paying them to stick around for another three hours ($$$) and B, I want couples to be able to leave whenever they want instead of being forced to stay until the entire party is ready to leave - utilizing Uber/Lyft would offer that flexibility.",t2_m0mjd,agiraffes,0,1625578421.0,0,t1_h48hqe3,h48hqe3,False,agiraffes,t3_oclp0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/oclp0k/how_reliable_has_uberlyft_been_in_the_area/,How reliable has Uber/Lyft been in the area?,/r/amherst/comments/oclp0k/how_reliable_has_uberlyft_been_in_the_area/h48hqe3/,1,r/amherst,0,1
"Yeah, I most definitely am not looking for ""sympathy.""  Just because it's optional doesn't mean I don't have a budget I'd like to stay within. 

It's not the transportation to/from the venue I'm worried about because that's essentially covered.  Our wedding ends fairly early so we are planning on having an after party in town.  I was trying to plan in advance for that while also being considerate of that fact that some people may want to leave earlier than others.  Hence why I was specifically asking about the reliability of ride share services that people could utilize whenever convenient for them.

"Well, in total honesty, you won't get a heck of a lot of sympathy for me for the cost of wedding stuff, because it is all optional and well... But either way, I wouldn't count on uber or other exploitative platforms to solve your problem. 

I had missed your mention of already having a shuttle. Why can your hired shuttle not pick up half your wedding party at the location where they are concentrated? Why would they have to walk a mile? I have to imagine they would be able to drive a mile for half your wedding party, even if they charge you some nominal additional fee. Sure, perhaps those folks might have to be ready 15 minutes earlier or something. But it seems logical that this might be an option. Unless you've already asked and it doubles the price or something?

Or...rent a van and pay someone to drive it. I bet there are plenty of college students who live in the area who would happily make some money (you could ask on this very sub and maybe under the r/umass sub and similar).

"Thank you. To answer your question, let's set aside the current year because the pandemic has changed many things on at least a temporary basis. Prior to the pandemic, the Town's revenues increased each year primarily from the State's allowable 2.5% increase in the tax levy, changes in State aid, and changes in local receipts. 

These revenue increases allowed the Town to increase operating budgets by 2.5% in most years, which was generally seen as a sustainable level. Within the operating budgets, much of, if not all of the 2.5% increase is consumed by a rise in personnel costs from contractual steps (raises based on experience), cost of living adjustments, and health insurance rates. As a result, it can be challenging to identify funding for additions.

The general philosophy that many share is that recurring expenses be funded with recurring revenues.

Ultimately what renaming a city is is a *symbolic victory*. It doesn't actually fix anything beyond renaming the city.

Renaming 16th St in Washington DC to Black Lives Matter Plaza did nothing to help either Breonna Taylor or George Floyd get justice for their murders.

I'd personally rather support an endeavor that puts effort towards boosting access to mental health services in Amherst or other efforts to deal with the issues *inside the city* than worry about it's name.

Yes, I am aware these efforts can be done concurrently, but moderates always stop at the symbolic victory and as a progressive, its infuriating to watch.

"I think this is just a variation of my initial point -- nobody associates Lord Amherst with Amherst the town. He's not culturally relevant enough to make it the primary association, as would happen with a town named Adolf Hitler.

If you're making the argument that if you look far enough back in the past, that you'll find a reason to dislike how we got to the present, then I think you're just looking for something to fight about, since every path to the present is tainted by past wickedness.

The choice we have is whether we should spend our time self-flagellating over ever ill-chosen fork in the road which you and I had no part in (since we weren't alive), or whether we should instead look to honor the values that we find important.

"I see a weakness in your argument. From Wikipedia:

In 2008, Mi'kmaq spiritual leader John Joe Sark called the name of Fort Amherst Park of Prince Edward Island a ""terrible blotch on Canada"", and said: ""To have a place named after General Amherst would be like having a city in Jerusalem named after Adolf Hitler...it's disgusting."" Sark raised his concerns again in a 29 January 2016 letter to the Canadian government.[66] Mi'kmaq historian Daniel N. Paul, who referred to Amherst as motivated by white supremacist beliefs, also supports a name change, saying: ""in the future I don't think there should ever be anything named after people who committed what can be described as crimes against humanity.""

The Hitler analogy above is a bit over the top, but the point is correct: Names are as important as statues. Perhaps more so. The town clearly should be renamed Dickinson.

"I think your argument was what worked back in 1992 when this issue was first raised. Re-naming a town or taking down a monument seemed impossible then.

Today, it not only polls over 60% favorable, but it has the backing of Fortune 500 corporations.

"This would be a more compelling argument if it were more focused on honoring a particular resident (like dickinson) rather than complaining about the quarter-millennia old namesake.

Nobody today proudly asserts that they're ""from Amherst, named in honor of Lord Jeffrey!"" So, it's kind of silly to say we need to change it because it's honoring some ancient asshole, when nobody actually associates or intends it as such. It's just a name that most people have never given a second thought, and mostly associate with the colleges.

Every town name is associated with something offensive if you look hard enough, because history is always full of people who did things differently than you. Belchertown was named after a slave trader. Northampton already had a name -- Norwottuck -- before white people showed up.

Make the argument about why we should honor someone important to us now, not about trying to do the impossible task of cleansing ourselves of all historical taint... cuz there are a lot of street names to tackle afterwards.

"I know it's difficult for eligible people go find COVID-19 vaccines. I hacked together a script that notifies people of when vaccine appointments become available near the Pioneer Valley and messages them. Originally this was text message based and helped find my parents get connected to appointments.

I've converted this to a Twitter Bot for people in the Pioneer Valley. When the bot sees vaccines available at certain sites in a close driving range from Amherst, it will tweet the location and a link to the scheduler.

"If she were an artsy 15 yo she would probably be smoking weed and there are nice spots at Mt.Pollux in S Amherst, Puffers Pond in N Amherst, and Amethyst Brook. Would definitely be a part of the theatre program. Younger kids aged middle school through 10th grade could potentially go hang out in town on Fridays after school where these get pizza at Primos or Antonio’s. Primos is next to a convenience store that started limiting the # of HS kids that could go on cause everyone shoplifts. 

Living would depend on wealth and I would not say Amherst Woods is an option unless the parents have money and plan to stay in the area long term. Echo Hill could be a better option but there are also lots of brand new bougie apartments now that families could live in. 

Public transportation isn’t a thing for HS students so make the story easier for yourself and have an older friend w a car.

"Hi! I'm a local. My daughter lived in Amherst recently and had four roomates. She paid $700 per month for rent, no utilities included. She chose the largest room/loft, the others paid around $500 per month. She lived right near downtown Amherst, about a half mile to the center. Amherst is notoriously expensive to live in, renting or buying. Don't be afraid to look at Sunderland, MA as an option for housing. It tends to be a lot less expensive but right next door to UMass and Amherst College.

For food, there is a Farmer's Market for fresh produce and TONS of farm stands in the whole area. I'm in Granby over by Mt. Holyoke College - we have seven farm stands in our tiny town. It's kind of awesome out here!

 You'll be outside Hadley which is a rural farm town that also has a huge section of large businesses and a mall. Atkins Farms has two stores for locally grown everything, but they are a bit pricey. The Target in Hadley has a full grocery store and  Walmart has a smaller grocery area. Trader Joe's as other's have mentioned in addition to a large regular grocery store - Stop and Shop. The Stop and Shop prices are pretty good and usually less busy than your other options. It's where the locals shop more than the college students.

"Hi Sean, I’m from Echo Hill, have a few questions/comments. 

Q. I saw on one of the documents that mentioned George Floyd, I might’ve missed it but  is the town allocating funds for more diversity training and community policing? Or any other redistribution of funds to create different respond teams that do not require police intervention? 

Q. Is the town considering bringing back passenger rail transport back to the town? 

C. I talked to Mindy Domb about it a year ago and she told me that the rail is not owned by the town and that “the trains didn’t had a good way to unload/load passengers with the current setup.” In a post-pandemic time the town should consider this method of transportation as I’m sure it’d help local businesses and the student population. I read somewhere about a Palmer-Amherst line I don’t know if it has any traction. Have you heard of it? if so, thought? 


Q. Has the town ever considered proving Municipal/Town Broadband to residents? 

C. From my understanding the town owns the lines of which Comcast or other providers use. Why don’t Amherst use or add lines that would provide high speed Internet to the community. This would greatly benefit low income families and would give residents an affordable, and hopefully a reliable option.

"Good question. I worked in the schools for about 10 years so I have a solid understanding of school finances. As of FY 19, which is the most recent year reported, Amherst spent $23,090 per student. This includes expenditures from all funding sources, local taxes, grants, gifts, fees, etc... 

Amherst spends more on education than neighboring communities which reflects the high value the Town and its residents place on education. The schools have continued to maintain an array of world language programs, arts, music, theater, technology and have an amazing academic program. The schools also have strong programming for special education students and English language learners.

"Great questions. Yes one strategy to manage the economic impacts of Covid-19 has been to delay some capital projects. This is Town funded capital, still waiting for the State to set its budget. The Town has a Joint Capital Planning Committee or JCPC. JCPC will be meeting in the Fall to check in on capital. 

FY22 could be as bad or worse than FY21. It will largely depend how quickly the local and state economy rebounds. Locally, we have numerous revenue sources such as parking fees, water and sewer billings, licenses and permits, etc... that are either already down or anticipated to drop significantly. On the State side, there could be reductions in funding as well. 

The magnitude of cuts will depend on a lot of factors like the state and local economy mentioned above but another big one is funding from the federal government. We have received some funds to pay for Covid-19 related expenditures but nothing yet to deal with the impact on the economy.  We are updating our financial modeling tools weekly with new information and forecasting different scenarios. 

On a positive note, the Town is in a strong financial position to weather this storm and has really great leadership to help steer us through.

"Thanks for doing this, appreciate it. Potwine Lane resident here, haven't gone in depth in the updated municipal budgets yet but saw there's around a 2.8 reduction in the budget and $2m in capital reduction (40%). 

Is it fair to say that the initial weathering of the storm will try to be offset by holding off on capital expenditures? Or are these capital expenditures tied to state funds that really won't effect our ability to shoulder the brunt to our services?

From a longer term standpoint, is this just the calm before the storm? Are towns and cities expecting the worst to come in the FY22 budgets, and if so how greater of a magnitude will cuts be?

"16 year old ARHS student here, Idk about where the family would live, one thing to note tho is that some families buy houses in Pelham or Levrett because the property taxes are way lower there but they still get access to the same public middle and high school. 

The teen daughter would definitely go to ARHS, unless she was in a private school.

There are school busses available to any kid living in the school region (Amherst, Pelham, levrett, and Shutesbury) so it’s likely that the girl would take the bus, unless her parents drove her or she had a car. If a parent was driving to Umass every morning then it would be plausible for her to be driven and dropped off each day by that parent.

Public transportation in the area does exist but is not used much by young people, at least in my experience. The only times I’ve ever taken it was once my lacrosse team had to take a public bus to the fields because our school bus broke, and once when I did it just for fun to see where I could go. It took me 3 hours to get from the Heatherstone bus stop to the movie theater in Hadley, a ride I can do in 30 minutes on a bike so needless to say it wasn’t incredibly efficient.

The Jones Library has a teens lounge in the basements open after school most days, and even on the days that the lounge is not open the library basement is still open and has couches and chairs. I myself am not LGBTQ but I have friends/know people who are, and have seen them there many times. The theatre community at ARHS has a very strong focus on LGBTQ perspective in their productions and I know a lot of LGBTQ people who are part of that community. Theater kids often hang out in and around the auditorium after school.

Riding a bike would be a much more effective way to get around, almost everyone I know in this area has a bike, regardless of wealth. Public transport doesn’t reach Pelham, levrett or Shutesbury, but does cover Amherst, Hadley, Northampton. However the busses are few and far between and while they can be used, you have to plan your route the day before or you could be at a stop for hours, and even if you do, you might still have to wait hours. Like I said before, in my experience young people rarely use the busses.",t2_2j219fpa,_qui-gone,0,1592365256.0,0,t1_fv361hr,fv361hr,True,thesadfreelancer,t3_gvaa8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/gvaa8q/book_research_what_would_life_be_like_for_a_teen/,Book research: what would life be like for a teen in Amherst?,/r/amherst/comments/gvaa8q/book_research_what_would_life_be_like_for_a_teen/fv361hr/,1,r/amherst,0,1
"Existing comments have hit this pretty well, but you should expect your commute to be between 30 minutes to an hour from downtown Northampton to Campus via bus. It’s certainly not awful if you don’t mind those commutes, but if you’ll have a lot of classes or on campus time you will live and die by the bus schedule since it’s hourly and doesn’t wait around long at the campus stop. Credit to the PVTA though, because of this stricter schedule the B43 bus line ran like clockwork.

Still Northampton is a gorgeous place to live and I know there are some people that do it, but they usually do have their own transport via car. I only knew one person who bus’d to Umass a few times a week while she was at Smith and she said it was too much for her after a semester. Just keep that in mind if you do go forward with it.

Hope that helps, and feel free to ask more if I can hopefully provide some more info.

"Nowadays, they’d probably buy supplies at target or Walmart. Maybe AJ Hastings right down town. Or the CVS, also down town. 

Kids would hang out in the woods, in any nook or cranky downtown that was hidden (say, behind a building or on a rooftop) if they were, say, smoking or drinking.

"I can speak for years ago, but not now. 

They could live in Amherst woods, echo hill, or they could have a very nice house on a cup de sac, or even a larger property in the woods in shutesbury. They certainly wouldn’t live in a aparment, though they could rent a house if they’d just moved to the area. And condos are not exactly popular in the area, though they are to be found

The daughter would bus to ARHS. Almost anywhere she is, there’s a yellow school bus that will pick her up. 

Here’s where I’m dated - years ago, we’d all hang out in downtown Amherst.  Coffee shops, walk around, loiter near barts etc. but that’s not the case so much anymore. There’s lots of hang out spots in the woods, the graveyard, 

Regardless of when your book takes place, getting to noho is easy. There’s busses to take you. The schedule is slower during summer and other school breaks, but you can get to and fro pretty easily. 

And again, not speaking for modern time, but the bi, gay girls and boys would hang out with one another, and with everyone else too. The place was (and I hope still is) very open minded.

"My parents got masters degrees at UMass quite a while ago. We moved to Northampton (from out of state) and to Amherst two years later. I spent 4 years in the school system there and we moved a lot in town. At times, we lived close enough to walk to school (in an apartment building next to the park on N Pleasant). At other times, we were far enough away I had to take PVTA in to town to get to school.

ARHS is a full mix of country kids to children of university/college professors. Ilan Mitchell-Smith and Uma Thurman both went to the jr high.

At the time, PVTA was free 9 months out of the year and getting to Northampton (or Hadley) was just a bus ride away. Now there’s also the Norowottuk Trail that makes biking from Amherst to Nton easy. When I was there, I rode Rt 9 often to Nton.

Many of my friends spent a lot of time hanging out in Amherst center or in Nton. My nerdier friends hung oht at UMass a lot.

There’s a community pool in N Amherst, on the way out to Puffers Pond. A lot of kids go there.

We used PVTA to go everywhere, like the poster above. We also biked: it’s a very bike friendly area.

"As a kid who grew up in Amherst since I was 7 and a recent graduate of ARHS, I can try to answer.

Where the family would live would depend on wealth, if a parent is getting a PhD I'll assume upper middle class and they would probably live in a house. Amherst Woods is a likely candidate about 10 mins south of UMass. There are also the other hill towns like Pelham or Leverett where you can live for cheaper but have a longer commute.

The teenage daughter would almost definitely go to ARHS, all the surrounding hill towns also go to ARHS. I only ever heard of the most wealthy kids going to private school like DA or NMH like the families that live on Sunset or Lincoln right next to downtown. (These are generalizations keep in mind)

She would either get driven by a parent, (If someones is getting a PhD, ARHS is right next to UMass) or would take the schoolbus. There are the local free PVTA busses too but they are mostly only useful for traveling between major locations in Amherst like from downtown to UMass or to puffers pond. 

If she's artsy, she probably would be involved in theater either as an actor, muscian or techie. (theater is huge at ARHS) So best guess is she probably would hang out in the auditorium after school. 

Northampton is kinda hard to get to without getting driven by a parent. Life changed when everyone got liscences around the age of 16 or 17. Bikes are a pretty good way to get around tho, I biked to McDonalds in Hadley which is about half way to Northampton.

"This was posted 5 months ago; Hampshire now has a new president and is no longer planning on a merger. The previous president unilaterally decided that a merger was Hampshire's best path forward during her first year in the role. The community vehemently disagreed, hence students trying to secure funding pledges to persuade her to explore other options five months ago. When that approach didn't work, the community protested until she quit and then found new leadership for the school.

Now that our leadership has been sorted out, we are working on fundraising in order to secure an independent future for the school.

As far as your other arguments go, a school shouldn't enforce political beliefs on its students, but should provide them tools and information to form their own. Hampshire's curriculum does focus on intersectionality and social justice topics, but I don't believe the organization itself taking on an explicit political alignment would be helpful or wise. Exposing students to various political perspectives and letting them think things through for themselves is the only way to avoid creating dogmatic culture, and I don't think the world needs more of that right now.",t2_4q1jt0,meningeal,0,1563635088.0,0,t1_euay5gq,euay5gq,False,meningeal,t3_alghf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/alghf8/hampshire_college_needs_your_help/,Hampshire College Needs Your Help!,/r/amherst/comments/alghf8/hampshire_college_needs_your_help/euay5gq/,1,r/amherst,0,1
"Hampshire needs to be reinvented from the ground up if it is to survive. The current leadership is obviously playing from the neoliberal playbook with doublespeak & corporate logic, looking to become the object of a buyout or merger. 

What the students may not understand is the seamless compatibility of the postmodern left they seem to embrace & the very same neoliberalism they seem to reject. The POMO condition, combined with the death of the liberalism, which is occurring all around us, makes for a bizarre & confusing presentation loaded with contradictions. 

There is great opportunity to forge something truly different & future focused at Hampshire, but it must break fully with the postmodernist left, with neoliberalism, & with the sinking Democratic party. A break such as this would involve radical self-reflection & a reappraisal of what we call ""the left"". Map out the blind spots. Define the contradictions, & re-invent.

"Hampshire isn't a business. It's a school. Nobody here is getting ""frisbee throwing"" degrees. 89% of students have job offers within 6 months of graduating, and 65% of alumni obtain advanced degrees (many from Ivy league schools) within a decade. Yes, the model is nontraditional, but it gets good results.

Tuition largely goes towards covering operating costs (building and grounds maintenance, salaries for faculty and staff, etc.), as our endowment cannot legally be used for those expenses, and the endowment is fairly small to begin with. Hampshire has always been tight on funds. Most of us in the community wish we could pay our faculty and staff better, as they certainly deserve it, but the money isn't there.

That said, we are not upset about administration trying to obtain funding. We all know money is tight. We're upset about the way this decision was made and the recklessness with which the livelihood of our faculty and staff is being regarded.

"Lived in Amherst for 5 years and I loved every minute of it.

In Amherst you can go to the reniasance center for an awesome view of the valley. The black sheep is a cool coffee spot.

The best spots are around the Amherst area and you have a car so you should be all set.

Go to the Montague Book Mill. It's one of the best book stores slash cafes around. It's a 10/10.

In Greenfield you can go to Ginger Libation for alcoholic ginger beer and go to leftys for beer. I love ginger libation and I think it's one of the best beverages the valley has to offer.

Based on your description Northampton seems like the place what you want. There's tons of parking. Great coffee shops all around. Dobra is a cool tea shop. There's an amazing art gallery in an old bank (I highly recommend this) across the street from the urban outfitters. For hiking you can do the 7 sisters, Mt Tom, or lithia springs. All of those are great options. As for thrift shops I'd say they're ok but pretty picked clean in that area. Go to Holyoke if you want some good finds based on my experience.

Edit: go to the Smith college botanical garden. It's free and amazing. You can also do an awesome walk along the river via a path across the street. Tons of good outdoor spots in that area! Go to shop therapy for a bowl, but all the head shops are the same IMO.",t2_kckri,TooFarTurner,0,1533095290.0,0,t1_e3e63id,e3e63id,True,OctoberInMyThroat,t3_93l5gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/93l5gg/thrift_shopping_cutehippie_spots/,"Thrift shopping, cute/hippie spots?",/r/amherst/comments/93l5gg/thrift_shopping_cutehippie_spots/e3e63id/,3,r/amherst,0,3

"Amherst Coffee and Share Coffee are both really good. As far as thrift shopping goes, I don't think there's a single thrift store in Amherst - that's more a Northampton vibe.

But honestly, everything you're describing sounds like you might have a better time in Northampton - there is a bus there from Amherst; I think it's like $1.50.

"The two biggest groups are the theater department (which obviously if you’re majoring you’ll be involved in, though they allow anyone to audition), and UMass Theatre Guild. The department is very active with a lot of professional level talent behind the scenes and you learn a ton, but beyond acting you need to major (or minor! As there is a theater minor starting this semester). Highly recommend taking Theater 140 or 190h if you’re not a major but want to take an acting class and get a feel for the professors.

The Guild (UMTG for short) is an entirely student run organization, but they do 2 productions a semester and you can be involved in literally any part of the process, audition for roles, apply to be apart of lights, sound, costume or other artistic teams, and direct or produce. I know for a fact, if you’re interested, that auditions and interviews for the two shows this semester (“Arcadia” and “Lucky Stiff”) start the third and fourth week of September. Admittedly I definitely have a bias since I’ve been involved with the group since my freshman year, but as someone who’s done pretty much everything with it (acting, directing, stage managing, costuming) I cannot recommend it enough.

Beyond that there are some community theaters, but almost all need you to have some transportation (I.e a car) and most have their auditions for fall shows in early August.

If you’re interested for more info feel free to PM me and I can give you more information!",t2_ed0bu,Tdude1196,0,1531362295.0,0,t1_e28dcko,e28dcko,True,[deleted],t3_8xwkpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/8xwkpa/how_is_the_theater_department_at_amherst/,How is the theater department at Amherst?,/r/amherst/comments/8xwkpa/how_is_the_theater_department_at_amherst/e28dcko/,1,r/amherst,0,1

"Holyoke and Springfield, while relatively small, have all of the social, economic, and educational problems of large impoverished cities. I'm not sure where you're moving from, but outside of New England most people are not aware of the economic history of this area. The Midwest/Great Lakes region has their famous Rust Belt of economic dislocation resulting in crime and social upheaval, but we've got a smaller string of old mill towns that I sometimes refer to as a Lint Belt, where the textiles industry that had kept people employed since before the Civil War packed up and moved out in the 1960s and 70s. The result are some shockingly small towns with the problems of a Flint MI or a Gary IN.

With that said, I wouldn't tell you not to work there if you're up for it. I started out in Springfield, and had some great experiences that more than outweighed the frustrations of the district. My wife still works in Springfield, and she loves her school. I'm not sure about where you've taught before, but if you come into it with solid classroom management and a good dollop of patience you'll be fine.

As far as certification goes, you can obtain basic MA certification simply be providing proof of a bachelor's and passing some MTEL tests. That would certify you for 5 years. I'm afraid I know nothing about the process of transferring certification in, although I gather from the few people I know who've done it that it's a pain in the ass.

Hope this helps, let me know if you have any further questions!",t2_55fm9,pustak,0,1519308810.0,0,t1_dungoou,dungoou,False,[deleted],t3_7z10q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/7z10q0/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/amherst/comments/7z10q0/deleted_by_user/dungoou/,1,r/amherst,0,1
"I'm a teacher and live in the area. If you're certified for math/science then you probably won't have too much trouble finding a job. The population is centered around Springfield, so of course that's the area with the most schools. Springfield is a tough district to work in, as is Holyoke, but not impossible to have a positive impact and experience.

Amherst is a nice place to live, but rentals are really expensive. I'd echo the sentiment that Easthampton is a good bet at the moment- I moved here from Amherst last year and I love it. It's also more central, so easier to commute around the area for work.

And The Kids and the Suitcase Junket also got their start here, though they are less local bands these days.

Like you noted, national touring acts tend to come through the venues in Northampton. The Parlor Room books more quirky stuff and can skew local, same with the Iron Horse, though they are more of a roots venue. Pearl St Upstairs and Downstairs get your usual touring indie groups, I've seen Typhoon and Lady Lamb there.

"I grew up in Amherst then lived in Boston college-grad school. I moved back home before and after grad school to save money while I worked in Springfield.

I was also hanging out with some people I knew from high school who stayed behind which was ok, but I don't think a lot of people stay after they graduate from college because there's really no job opportunities. So, to answer your question, it'll be mainly college kids or people who move to Amherst to raise a family and because they got a job at one of the colleges in the area.

"1. Start early, honestly now wouldn't be a bad time but definitely have your shit together by November.

2. I found every apartment I've lived in through craigslist honestly:

3. Avoid eagle crest like the plague! They own a lot and they're awful!

4. You'll probably want to avoid large apartment complexes in Amherst, and the town center.  As someone who graduated from umass 4 years ago I'll tell you that downtown Amherst kind of sucks unless it's summer or winter time.  Even normal restaurants like panda east (really good Chinese food) will be full of drunkards at a normal time. My girlfriend and I will sometimes go there in the summer but it sucks during the school year.  I've never spent much time in the big 10 college towns so I'm not positive but umass undergrads can be ridiculously obnoxious. By the time I was a junior I was pretty much done with the shenanigans.

5.  If your workplaces are Amherst and easthampton your best bet may be south hadley. As the person below me mentioned, the route 9 bridge connecting Hadley and Northampton is a horrible mess every day and you want to avoid it like the plague. If you live in Amherst or Sunderland your partner will have to cross that bridge every day to get to work. In south Hadley they can cut through Holyoke to get to easthampton and you can take 116 (nice scenic back roads) to get to Amherst. I personally live in Holyoke and work in Amherst, and my commute isn't that bad although your partner will have an easier commute if you live in Holyoke. Also worth mentioning that Holyoke is a bit on the ghetto side if that's something that would bother you, but rent here is cheaper than anywhere other than Springfield which is a good drive for both. I've lived in a neighborhood that is supposedly really bad for 2 years and haven't had any problems with theft or violence.

1) Finding housing is going to be really tough. Do it as early as you can. 

2) Check out http://www.umocss.org/searchRentals.php?sec=search . You can find houses / apts for rent - often from professors on sabbatical. There are other options on the page as well.

4) North Amherst is where the students generally live (and where the crazy parties take place). Sunderland is fine thought, more quiet. UMass is known for being a party school, FYI (attracting out of town guests).

5) One concern that you might want to think about - the Route 9 bridge from Amherst - Northampton is a mess at morning/evening rush hour. There are no other options really (meaning the next bridge is up in Sunderland). Sometimes this can mean a 5-10 minutes extra to your commute.

Comments about towns - 
Amherst - Plenty of good restaurants. Lots of students during the school year. More of a small town than Northampton; charming. Hiking at Mt Holyoke Range in S. Amherst.

Northampton - Cultural center of the area with the most restaurants. Really a little ""city"" that is quite lively during nights and weekends. 

Easthampton - Up and coming little town with a few restaurants, next to Mt Tom for hiking. 

Hadley - Farming community - Now has most of the big box stores in the area (also Whole foods, Trader Joes, Aldi, etc).  Hiking at Mt Holyoke Range in S. Amherst.

"Amherst.  Where only the 'H' is silent!  You're off to a great start.  

There's a furnace - which is powered by gas, oil, or electric.  It's in the dark basement.    We have gas in our house - it seems to be the most economical, also the most hassle free.  Oil burns dirtier and you will need to set up an oil delivery with a local company (O'Connell, etc.), they will also do any service if a problem crops up.  They'll come by once a month or so.  With electric, the system is always powered, sucking off the grid.  Sometimes there is a boiler instead of a furnace (which could be powered by any of the above).  Boilers are awesome cause it's not such a dry heat that's created (can you say static electricity?).
Then there's getting the heat from the dark basement to the rooms in the house.  Usually it's a fan unit that takes the hot air and blows it through ducts into the rooms.  With electric it there are those evil baseboards in each room that create the heat - I think electric is more expensive and the heat is really really dry.  You could also have a radiator in each room (old school), which is nice damp heat.
Eskaban is right on when he says the stoves are usually for a room, but if that room is your main central room, it could be sweet.  With stoves you've gotta buy a bunch of wood/pellets (which are pressed wood) before the chill sets in and ya gotta keep feeding that fire!

Last winter was unusually warm so it was sometimes in the 60s in the morning. But there have been winters where it's bitter cold and windy. 

Major roads in Amherst will be constantly plowed and rarely accumulate more than an inch. Roads off major roads may accumulate a few inches between plowing. Dead ends or remote roads may not be passable for most of the day. I live on one of those dead end roads and -- if there's an overnight storm -- my road won't get plowed until noon. I have to work from home.

Clearing sidewalks is the responsibility of the property owner. You can be fined for not clearing the sidewalk in front of your house. Downtown and University sidewalks will be plowed by the town or the university but usually not until the roadways are clear. People will walk in the street if they need to. You'll have to be extra vigilant. When you're wearing a hat and cars are driving on snow, they're very quiet. I would suggest not walking on main roads at all if they're snowy.

You will need cold weather gear. Get it now before you need it.

"You are far, far more likely to find a home with a furnace than with just a pellet stove. Furnaces usually run on one of two fuels. In more settled areas in town, they often have municipal natural gas. This is exactly what you would have with a gas stove. It runs like electricity; everything is already in place, and you'll just have to contact the local utility company and put the bill in your name.

The other major option, more common in rural areas, is heating oil, and it's a little different. There will be a tank in your basement (we have basements!) or just outside your home. When the tank is close to empty, you call a local heating-oil distributor, and they come with a tanker truck, fill your tank, and give you a bill. There are also some options to ""lock in"" a price ahead of time if you agree to buy a certain amount during a season. It's pretty likely that the previous owners/tenants will have left some oil in the tank when you move in. If you're buying a home, they almost always disclose the average number of gallons of heating oil the home burns per winter.

Pellet stoves are highly efficient wood stoves, but like regular log-burning wood stoves, they tend to be for a extra coziness in one room or on one floor, rather than for all your heat. (The only homes that burn wood exclusively tend to be very old, un-updated homes, or very ""green"" or ""off-grid"" homes).

"one thing that's great about amherst area, are the towns that surround Amherst. There are many, and mostly rural with minimal crime. MANY college kids live in amherst, and parts of sunderland and belchertown closer to Amherst.
 I too, am 35, and work at umass. I also attended UMass for undergrad many moons ago. I live 30 mins north in Greenfield as the Amherst area is expensive for housing- especially so 12 yeras ago when we bought our house. Often you will find that home owners rent out their houses to college kids, so it can be hard to know if you have normal folks or party folks... I would definately avoid the area immediately north of campus, as there is a bunch of apartments known to house most of the off campus students. In the area of Hobart ln and puffton village, there are excessive parties- as in the cops come out in riot gear. There are normal folks that have homes in there, but I can't imagine it's an easy place to live as a results. 
I come into campus from the north, and have no issues getting to and from campus since the added the rotary. I also work in the north part of campus, so i don't have to deal with many pedestrians and am able to park close to my building.
If you are specifically looking for a rural community, many parts of Hadley, Sunderland, Leverett & Pelham may suit your needs. Hadley is where the major shopping areas for the community are located.

"I've been a town resident since 2003. OP's account is accurate. I can add a few items.

* There are numerous companies for curbside trash pickup. You can also bring your trash to the transfer station twice a week where you pay $85 yearly for a sticker and then per 33-gallon bag after that. Recycling and composting is free and you can leave or pick up stuff and books for free. I usually end up leaving with at least one book.
* Snow removal can vary depending on your location. Major roads are plowed and sanded constantly. I live on a street off of a street that is off of a main road. I usually get plowed out around noon.
* Water and sewer are provided for 95% of the town. Only residences at the far north have wells. They may have sewer though. Billed quarterly.
* There's always some construction going on in town even when UMass is excluded. The town has been on a rampage redesigning intersections. We had an intersection to the south of town that was horrible at rush hour which has now been replaced with a double rotary which works beautifully until someone who doesn't know how to navigate a rotary snarls it up. You'll learn to hate those people.
* Grade schools are in town and are shared with the surrounding towns. Spending per student is high and average grades match. There are lots of hippy parents here and they do run the schools for better or worse. There are plans to create a mega elementary school to replace the two smaller schools but that won't start for a year or two.
* Amherst is EXPENSIVE. Property taxes are among the top 5 in the state and are generally double of the surrounding towns. The large number of college students and the resistance of the taxpayers to allow large development makes housing scarce so rents are high.
* As a family, stay away from housing around the UMass campus. There are entire streets of nothing but multi-family rentals. You probably won't find those houses acceptable anyway. That being said, crime is not the reason I'd avoid them. They're just loud.

"I lived in Amherst for 2 years.  Its a college town, plain and simple.  If the colleges weren't there, it would be a farm town, but the colleges bring enough business to have a somewhat well defined downtown area.  The area is very safe, despite a somewhat sizable (but harmless) population of homeless people.  The town is incredibly liberal, sometimes referred to as ""the people's republic of Amherst,"" and there is a very noticeable ""hippie vibe"" throughout the town.  Lots of locally grown food options etc.  I worked at Amherst high for a bit and its a good school for the most part, but I would note that drugs seem to be very available to the kids.

To answer your specific questions

* There are really no areas to avoid in terms of crime, but if you want to avoid drunk college kids, stay away from bars downtown, and pretty much campus in general.

* Getting to Umass during school hours can be difficult at any time.  Traffic gets heavily congested in the center of town, and near Umass campus at seemingly random times between about 9-4.  

* Not sure about these services because I lived in an apartment complex.  The water is clean and safe for drinking.

* Umass has a lot of construction projects going on, not sure about anything else.

* The schools are part of the 5 college system, meaning that students from any of them can take classes from all 5 schools if they want.

"im a junior currently, one of my friends started up intramural tennis for a semester last year, but it's hard to maintain unless you get a lot more people involved so you can get funding from the school (its not too hard if your club has 15+ people), but yeah it's always just a varsity sport, and occasionally for a semester or so, the tennis club/intramural stuff will be revitalized for a short while",t2_9fpxr,encognitowhetherman,0,1450900653.0,0,t1_cy99sff,cy99sff,False,[deleted],t3_3uxbkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/3uxbkr/tennis_at_amherst_college/,Tennis at Amherst College,/r/amherst/comments/3uxbkr/tennis_at_amherst_college/cy99sff/,1,r/amherst,0,1

"5 years ago, so no I guess. I just googled and I see their intramural page doesn't include Tennis anymore. That's too bad because there were a decent amount of people signed up to play in the past.

Since Amherst does have a ton of tennis courts you should be able to make friends who might want to play casually--I know I was able to my first year there. Also might be able to play townies.

"For my understanding the idea is to have a more simpler government, to have someone accountable for like it is said on   http://www.amherstforall.org/
 But is having a major a good idea? A point that Kelly says is that the majority of the people that go to town meetings are of an older generation. While most of the population of Amherst is in their mid 20's. The only Issue that I see in my opinion is that those people in my age group 18-30 are mostly college students that are living here for a while and they're not as involved in our town like we should. Would a mayor fix the representation issue or would it make it worse and unattached it self from the people who elect him/her? In my opinion it should be the stay how it is right now or go back to a more direct town meeting kind of government. What do you guys think??

"[Amherst College: Four Years of Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LstyBwyy36o) 

I went to Amherst back in the early 2000s  and absolutely loved it.  I knew I didn't want a city school because I love being outdoors and hiking and the country.  I didn't need a massive nightlife scene and wanted an intimate, close community focused on excellence and personal development.  Thats what I got and I'm extremely glad that I did.  I don't know how that matches your idea of 'fun' but it was rewarding and valuable.

"Amherst College student and prospective Biochem major here (declaring next year)

I've had a solid experience at Amherst so far. My home state is California, and my first semester/year was adjusting to being pretty far from home. While I agree with u/Jawjawbinx that universities could have a leg up on Amherst in terms of sciences, what I like about Amherst is that I feel like I enjoy sciences more than I would at UMass, UC Berkeley etc.

Why? Mostly because of the nature of the small liberal arts college. For one thing, I don't have to fight my way through general ed (I've done one semester of Calculus, and likely won't be taking more calculus from there), and I'm free to start taking classes I'm really interested in (e.g. I took two lab courses last semester, but I also took a music class and a class on South Asian History). But for science majors, it's really good to have classes not taught by graduate students and to be able to interact with my teachers and talk to them through problems. I don't know about UMass specifically, but I know other undergraduate friends in larger universities who struggle to get attention from professors who are usually more devoted to their graduate students. UMass definitely has some larger, nicer facilities for science, but a shinier lab does not necessarily mean better science education.

As a person of color, sometimes it can be weird going to a school with such a deep history of rich white men. But honestly, Amherst astounds me with its diversity. You meet other students of color, international students, and lots of interesting people from all over the socioeconomic spectrum. If you want to surround yourself with a diverse friend group, you can and will find them here.

That's all from me about it. I'm happy I'm here. Can't wait for the semester to start!",t2_og49o,TheHatThatTalks,0,1440264580.0,0,t1_cubyiiv,cubyiiv,True,[deleted],t3_3hx9g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/3hx9g5/considering_amherst_college_is_it_fun/,Considering Amherst College.

In all seriousness, Amherst College can be a pretty great place or a really shitty one, depending on who you are. Almost all departments on campus are full of top-caliber professors, and no one is pulling punches in terms of class difficulty (especially in physics and chem and bio, yeesh). You'll get a good education, you'll have learned about things you didn't know you were interested in, and you'll have a degree that can open doors.

Campus culture can be a bit of a downer, though, especially because it's too small to have many separate niches. There is pretty solid diversity on campus, they've been trying pretty hard in the last ten years or so, but white boys in salmon shorts are still the largest demographic. 

Most social opportunities that don't involve polo shirts and natty light are a bit harder to break into. Being involved in an activity that will automatically include you in a group is more or less necessary if making friends down at the socials doesn't sound great to you.

Not gonna lie, if you're interested in playing varsity sports at a high level, go somewhere else. We have fun though.

Honestly, though, one of the best things about going to Amherst is the absurd amount of money the school has, by way of being the alma mater of some of the bougiest alums that have ever lived. Everything is really well funded, in a way that seems goddamn miraculous to me after the high school I went to. The school can and will support you in almost anything you could want to do, whether academic or not even close to it (free ski trips every other weekend in the winter!).

Finally, our campus is damn gorgeous. Come visit if you can-- I fell in love with this place the moment I first stood at the top of Memorial Hill.",t2_4pzef,enewman4,0,1440229573.0,0,t1_cubm7yf,cubm7yf,False,[deleted],t3_3hx9g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/amherst/comments/3hx9g5/considering_amherst_college_is_it_fun/,Considering Amherst College.

"I tried driving for Uber in Amherst this past spring, weekend nights it was busy but never surged fares. The money really wasn't worth it. Most rides are only a couple of miles (across town, across campus), which makes it tough to get big fares. You have to deal with a lot of drunk college kids. Amherst area goes from city to farms in a couple miles so if one ride takes you to farm country you'll be driving on your own dime just to get back in town. The risk associated with driving drunk kids around a small college town late at night just didn't seem worth the $15-$20 an hour (at best), not to mention the gas, fishy insurance issues, and vehicle wear and tear.

"For outdoor activities, you could consider an annual pass to the MA State parks, or a membership in the Trustees of Reservations, both of which have natural and/or cultural sites in the area.

This part of the state is called the Pioneer Valley. Try googling that and check some of the sites that come up to if they give you any ideas.

Another possibility is to call A. J. Hastings, local stationery store, which has a good selection of books on local hikes, skiing, history, etc. They might be able to recommend some books and even hold them for her to pick up.

She should be sure to check out all of the Five Colleges. There are many free museums of various sorts. The Natural History Museum at Amherst College would probably especially interest her. Lots of dinosaur exhibits and hundreds of dinosaur footprints from local quarries.

One immediate recommendation I can give is for to check out Puffer's Pond, the town's swimming hole in North Amherst if she's looking for a nice place to cool off over the summer. Everyone goes there, but it's not something she might learn about in her first few months.

I think she'll really like the area. It's a great mix of rural landscapes and cultural activities.

While the weather is nice outdoors actives are popular. Hiking is popular especially in the Fall.

Beer is very easy to get access to if you are not 21. Just know the town police are very active. 

I would join a student group at UMass. UMass is large and makes sure to keep the student body population happy. Music venues. 

UMass is a top University too. I would make sure to engage in research in an area of your interest. 

Also, I would take a Peterpan bus to Boston an NYC to explore more.

"There's an ice rink (The Mullins Center Practice Rink) on-campus that offers public skate times. I'm not sure what they would do for curling. If you gathered together enough people, you could rent the whole rink.

If you're under 21, purchasing and possessing alcohol is illegal. That being said, what you do behind your own closed doors is your own business. Don't even try to purchase alcohol in Amherst. If you look older, you can drive 20 minutes north, east, or south and liquor stores may not ask for your ID. Given your situation, I wouldn't risk it. Find someone that's over 21 to buy it and transport it to your home. As long as you don't make too much noise or drink in the street you'll be fine. If you're going to live on-campus, keep the liquor in your room someplace hidden. Hallways, lounge areas, and other common space can be inspected at any time and even your room is not technically your space.

EDIT: I didn't mention bars. Depending on how packed the place is, you may be able to get in to an Amherst bar without showing an ID. If you go farther away, you'll have even better luck.

At the moment, snow-related activities are most popular. Go north into Vermont and learn to ski. Or grab a food tray from the dining common on-campus and toboggan down a hill. Just dress warm.

"I don't think it will stop any crime at all.

Underage people are not buying beer from Amherst liquor stores. All liquor stores in and around Amherst check IDs and aren't fooled by out-of-state forgeries. Underage people get their beer from friends who are over 21 or from liquor stores far far away.

TFA states ""Gunderson says that 135 people under the age of 21 were criminally charged last year with possessing alcohol."" That statistic is for all possession and not purchasing alone. I'd wager to guess that the number of kids caught successfully buying liquor last year at Amherst liquor stores is in the single digits.

Bars are a different story. If I needed to pick between bars and liquor stores to decide where cops need to watch, I'd say bars. Even so, I wouldn't spend the resources putting cops in bars because home drinking is more prevalent.

I don't think underage drinking is a solvable problem. Prohibition didn't work for adults so why would it work on college students? The best thing Amherst and the colleges can do is mandate AA (or equivalent) meetings for repeat offenders both young & old and provide after-hours public transportation. Assholes will continue to be assholes no matter what they do.

"Yes.  Recently it has come to light that there are several significant code violations in the building.  The condo association that owns it (meaning all the little business owners that own their own units) must either make more than 1/2 million dollars in repairs, or sell the building to a development company to demolish and rebuild.  We are renters, not owners so we get no say and no money if the building is sold.  The repairs are much too expensive for the association to be able to make.  So although the building has not actually been sold yet, there really is no other option.  It has to happen.  Our landlord came to us and said that we should probably find a new place to move to.  And even though it could be months before anything actually happens, because the downtown is so small we have to move now while a spot is available.

There is a Big Y, Stop and Shop, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's all on Route 9 in Hadley, easily accessible by bus. Big Y and Stop and Shop are local chains.

I have tons of friends without cars and other than getting to the airport, bus station, or random emergency trips to Springfield, they are all perfectly content.

"I mean, Amherst is great. Don't get me wrong. UMass is a huge and diverse school. It's just sometimes the bars in town can get a little crowded with bros. But bars were never my scene anyway, so I'm sure you can find a good spot. (I've heard good things about High Horse, but have never been there myself.)

Public transportation is really good. During the school year. During holidays and the summer it's a little more sparse in the schedule. But during the year, there's a regular bus from downtown Amherst to downtown Northampton. It's free if you're a student, but no one checks so it's free for everyone.

There's a CrossFit on Route 9 in Hadley, which is close to UMass. I can't vouch for it, though, because that shit is way too expensive for me.

I lived in Amherst for a bit while going to school then moved to Northampton. I also grew up in the area. Northampton tends to be a bit more alternative, while Amherst (especially at night) caters more towards the bros.

Rao's is a good place to get coffee and work. Amherst Coffee is a classier option. Stop by Amherst Cinema if you're into indie/art/non-mainstream films. 

Amherst Brewing Company was a favorite of mine until they moved locations. I've been a few times since then and it's been disappointing. The atmosphere is not the same.

Moan and Dove is a great beer bar, but they are strictly a beer bar. No hard alcohol, no wine (IIRC), and definitely no food. 

Try a cider donut from Atkins. You seem like a fit, active person, but I don't really care. Eat a donut, they are delicious and I miss them since my move.

If you do venture over to Northampton, here are some of my favorite places there:
Amanouz for Moroccan food, Paul and Elizabeth's for their dope lunch special (try a dinner roll!), Haymarket for coffee and people watching, Herrell's for ice cream (even their vegan ice cream is amazing).
