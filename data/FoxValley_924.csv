I'm all for freedom, if you love and want to marry the same sex... that to me is the definition of what living in a ""free"" country should be. I do not think government should be involved in the marriage process at all... including marriage licenses between straight couples... the origin of the marriage license was farmers wanted to control and prevent their daughters from marrying the black stable hands... by enforcing a license they could invalidate mix race marriage... another thing I feel is extremely wrong.

I so support the right to own a gun... and its ignorant of you to claim ""they're okay with a few school shootings"" because NO one is okay with this, its a tragedy and has no acceptable place in any culture. 

> edit: did you vote for Scott Walker and Trump?

No, I didn't vote for Walker or Trump. You're hanging onto this idea that Im a die hard Republican just because i didnt like political media propaganda being used in the school. I Care less of which channel they studied, and care more of the context of the lesson.

"You're kind of a prick. I agree the food sucks... It meets the states requirements was all I said. But you're talking underfunded public school food. The shear cost and time needed to provide the type of food you think should be served is unreasonable. If you want you're kids to eat healthy, pack their lunch.

State run schools, run state run programs... That lunch is one of them. Honestly private school isn't much better, but it is better. Those are your options if you're looking for a fix.

"If money isn’t an issue I’m sure you could find entry level work in a creative setting somewhere. If your degree and experience isn’t in multimedia or creative design then you shouldn’t expect much more. 

I’d suggest searching for print shops, photography boutiques, media outlets, or look into the bigger corporations who likely have a public relations arm/outward media service. JJ Keller comes to mind, but they’re not exactly “cool.”  The area isn’t known for having that sort of vibe but I’m sure it’s somewhere. Talk to the colleges in the area, I bet someone would be willing to give you a list of local places who hire niche services like that.

"I’m a truck driver and I’ve always been confused by the people who mess around on their phone so blatantly. If you’re gonna do it, make it when you’re the only person around. At least then you’re not endangering anyone around you, and the likelihood of getting caught drops. 

Especially don’t do it around trucks. We can see down into your car, a lot of us have dashcams, many of us are bored enough to call the cops on you, and most of all, if you hit us you’re gonna lose. 

I’m a pretty open-minded driver.. I don’t think pure abstinence works in most cases, including telling people not to touch their phone at all. Honestly it can help stave off getting drowsy by getting your mind working and eyes moving. And at the end of the day, I’ve seen much, much worse going on in that drivers seat than someone diddling around on their phone.

Its a 30 minute drive from Appleton. They provide the tube and have a tow back to the top. Cost is $6 per person.

More local, The most popular one in Appleton is at Reid Municipal Golf Course. They have bathrooms here as well which is a plus with kids. Appleton's Memorial Park has an OK hill (its long but the slope is almost too shallow)

Plamann park also has a good one but more difficult to find if you've never been to the park. To get to that one you'll want to [park just south of the baseball fields then walk almost due east from the parking lot](https://www.google.com/maps/@44.3253063,-88.3856908,305m/data=!3m1!1e3). The road on the hill is closed in the winter. Be warned that there are no bathrooms around; you'd have to head back into town to a gas station if needed.

"I chuckled.

I realize this was about humor, but if you want the real story, I have a co-worker who's daughter runs a massage facility in the valley and he has told me that there are regular ""tests"" of their procedures for this.

They get assigned ""massage duty"" on a periodic basis, where they schedule a massage under an alias and go get it and near the end of the massage, they request extra services to see what happens.

The masseuse is taught to terminate the session instantly and leave the room.  I am unaware if they generally would try to report you, but I know after they terminate the session, the cops usually identify themselves, so they don't freak them out any more than they already did.

"AT&T is behind right now compared to Spectrum (TWC) based on the technology they use. AT&T is working hard on their future 5G wireless option and plan to (in 4 or so years) adapting them to your homes. UVerse in this area is pretty much glorified DSL, they typically deliver to your home through the phone lines and depending on your speed they bond multiple together to get the speed. 

You mentioned in other replies to comments about bringing your own equipment (modem and router). If you are expecting to use the cable modem you bought for TWC with AT&T you will be disappointed, they do not use the same technology. The router you can hook to their modem/router combo they supply you and it will work fine. I recommend doing that as people who utilize the built in wifi has been known to cause problems with the unit.

Have a friend in Menasha who has had his UVerse modem reset 5 times a day and when he stopped using wifi on the device it has stopped resetting outside of occasional ones weeks apart. 

From all the tests I have ran while having both, one thing I noticed was AT&T's routing was either poor or lacking the capacity. Take for example a test downloading a 100MB file from a website. Spectrum would get 2-3MB/s and AT&T would get maybe 500KB/s - 1MB/s. It didn't matter the speed tier either that was simply how fast you could pull from some websites. It is getting better in the past 2 years.

and once you get in to a race, you'll get flyers for other races.. meet people who are talking about other races, etc.

"The best shot? Why? 

Do you see how he treats anyone that gives him a tough question? Do you see how reacts to anything negative said about him? That is how he will treat world leaders. He's a 6 year old playground bully. The worst part is he's been raised rich and has never had anyone tell him he's wrong. In foreign policy alone, Trump will destroy this country one volunteer soldier at a time in best case, and in the worst case, the world will cease to exist in a few short years.

Do you see how he treats women? A woman with an opinion is the enemy. A woman that questions his policy is the enemy. A President must be many things, but one of the big ones is to be able to accept criticism from others and work with people that disagree with them for the better of the country and our society. Trump will destroy any opportunity for reasonable Executive and Legislative branches. 

Do you see how he says nothing but, ""My presidency is gonna be great, amazing, and highly successful"" Yet says nothing about how he plans to make it so? This is business marketing and this kind of stuff works on people that aren't critical thinkers. He is a representative of big business. Not family business, but the type of business that kicks elderly people out of their homes with eminent domain bullshit to build a parking lot. He doesn't care about the people at his rallies. He incites hatred and racism because it takes the simple minds away from the real issues. There is violence at his rallies because he is backed by the least common denominator of this society that has no ability to hear or learn from others and must fight against the other. The same contingent is literally supporting a guy that would rather see them die in a dark room after he's done using them. He's been caught laughing about them, not even caught, he's said it in front of them on the podium, and those people laugh and agree with him. I mean, stupid is as stupid does.

I'm originally from New York and I know that the Trump brand is worthless. He's single-handedly destroyed Atlantic City, and everything he touches turns to trash in a few short years. Most people who want Trump to be President are fans of the Apprentice and think THAT guy is going to be President. Those same people think the Kardashians are influential. Trump would have more money in his bank account now if he just invested his inheritance in a mutual fund and did nothing, than he has at this moment. He has lost 40 billion dollars over his lifetime.

I served this country, proudly, so I'm not leaving it if he, however sick it makes me, wins the election in November. I personally don't think it even matters.

I voted Obama twice, but I'll be voting Trump this election.  Despite the twisted soundbites and outright lies told by the establishment media, his positions are quite sensible and he is frankly pretty moderate.  

fine with gay marriage, state rights for marijuana, pro-choice up until announcing his candidacy and now just doesn't want the government to fund it, nationalistic, relatively very secular, against illegal immigrants not legal ones, not racist or sexist, etc. etc. etc. 

aside from being a popular charismatic candidate, he does not share core beliefs with fascists. (people may not believe me, but [maybe you'll take Reddit's favorite historian Dan Carlin's word for it](https://twitter.com/dccommonsense/status/709076308853018625?s=09))

"I like his policies, his focus on the country and keeping us out of war and other countries messes. He wants to bring jobs back by changing policies and taxes on companies with holdings overseas. He believes we shouldn't pay billions a year to China or Mexico etc. For the privilege of trading with them. He's a successful businessman that wants to help businesses, and he believes that to do that you have to take care of the people. He's strong in education and wants to take our healthcare somewhere, he's moderate in social issues and for the 2nd amendment.

The wall people shit themselves about will keep the rapists (80% of migrant women from Mexico are raped) and drugs out of this country. He's going to make legal immigration easier and keep healthcare and other things the citizens don't have out of the hands of illegal aliens. He will temporarily ban Saudi Muslims from entering the country, which is constitutional and has been done in the past, and will work with middle eastern countries to take in more refugees. He'll also bomb the shit out of Isis and get the soldiers home.

All of the things people say that he's sexist and racist is because they're only seeing him through Facebook or Tumblrs eyes, Reddit is amazingly liberal as well.

Still don't see anyone in front that caused him to slam on his brakes.  It's hard to believe that he had no clue that slamming on your brakes  becuase someone is in the other lane is a bad idea.  I'm sure he hit his breaks becuase of the tailgater not to avoid some hazard. ,t2_firzi,reddisaurusx,0,1457736414.0,0,t1_d0wja9w,d0wja9w,False,LanMarkx,t3_49yii5,https://www.reddit.com/r/foxvalleywi/comments/49yii5/tailgater_gets_brake_checked_and_then_crashes_on/,Tailgater gets brake checked and then crashes on I41 in Appleton (XPOST from /r/wtf),/r/foxvalleywi/comments/49yii5/tailgater_gets_brake_checked_and_then_crashes_on/d0wja9w/,0,r/foxvalleywi,0,0
"Two wrong don't make a right I'll agree to that.

I'm pretty sure that, from a law point of view, that the tailgater is 100% at fault however for being way to freaking close - which is what caused this crash.

The clip shows that the van was moving faster than the truck that took the video (likely just passed him) and due to the car coming down the on ramp could not safely move into the right lane. As a result the van was still in the left lane.


From the Post-crescent (local Newspaper)-
>The video shows a Chevy sport utility vehicle tailgating ... The driver of the Chevy, a 42-year-old Green Bay woman, was not hurt, though she was later cited, according to Fox Valley Metro police.

Glad no one is hurt.   A driver following too close is wrong but I don't think it justifies causing them to be in an accident and  risking their life as well as any passengers the driver may have with them.  Not to mention all of the people around who have nothing to do with it as well as oncoming traffic.  I hope they find the driver who caused the accident by slamming on their brakes and make them face their crime.

"Old thread but I'll chime in.

Only two options I have are TW and AT&T. Both end up at about $60/month for internet only after whatever probationary period ~~pricing~~ scam they try to pull.

At the moment I have AT&T U-Verse. For Netflix and YouTube I increased my performance (quality/speed) *significantly* when I got a VPN for another $6/month from [private internet access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/). No more Youtube pauses and Netflix always plays at a higher quality. Its especially noticeable at peak times when I turn off the VPN.
Given that I only watch live TV maybe once a month or when the Packer play it was worth another few bucks a month for me.

"Actually you just reminded me, and I used their chat function. WAY better than calling. I got bounced around and put on hold so many times when I tried to call.

I just told them I was going to cancel if it wasn't reduced, and they brought me down to 39.99 for standard internet (15mbps). So plus a router and taxes will be about 52. And I'm renting a router, but I'm buying one right now, so that will bring it down to like 44.

He gave me this link to approved routers:

But the one I have right now, that I'm renting, is just [this guy](http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-DPC2100R2-MODEM-NA-LPS/dp/B004Y15NDU). So you could probably buy that one used for $20 and i'm sure it works. It's what i'm using now.

They're pretty much the first two events of the season, and are usually a good time. I work at the track and turnout was pretty great for both events. Rockerbox is a nice one because it is an all-inclusive price. Admission this year was $85 for a full camping weekend ticket, which is a damn good deal since it includes admission and a campsite.

"Menasha area police scanner for possibly more information: http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/ctid/3122/?rl=rr

Also, apparently possibly more shootings off of Main in Menasha. Possibly white car driving around involved. 

Will update as I get more info.

**EDIT** All units have been advised to switch to one of their private stations at this time so unlikely new news from the radio here.

**EDIT 2** From /u/hcjake:
>Fox 11 news interviewed city of menasha police, 5 victims, 3 dead. suspect in custody.

**EDIT 3** Shooter believed to be dead. Shooter was apparently someone ""familiar"" with police and apparently believed this was a random shooting (not gang or otherwise personally related). However, the police do not believe there is any danger to anyone anymore. 

**EDIT 4** [This](http://wbay.com/2015/05/03/large-police-presence-in-city-of-menasha/) link seems to have a bit more updated information in relation to Edit 3.

"Everyone will have their own opinions. Personally:

There's lots of smaller towns (like Neenah, Menasha, Kimberly, Grand/Little Chute, Greenville, etc) which are near Appleton or a lot like Appleton that have a great deal of nice places to live. It's really difficult to describe it without being here, as I am not as familiar with the area as I am others nearby.

I have some friends that live between Northland and 41 (after the big hook, can't miss it on a map), and there are a lot of really nice subdivisions up there. 

As /u/gravesville mentioned, the best bet is to look around here and see what you like/where you work/what you care about.

"Honestly, your best bet is not to do your research here. Everyone is going to be biased about what a ""nicer neighborhood"" is. Housing is pretty cheap in this area and depending on what you're looking for, you can find ""nice"" in any community.

In regards to food, there is plenty of options in terms of different ethnicities of foods. It really depends on what your preference is.

There are a lot of hunting and outdoor opportunities in the area. We have public hunting lands and a great multitude of public parks for outdoor activities.

So I guess if you'd like to know more I would be more specific on what you're looking for. But overall I would say the area is a very safe environment full of nice people.

"I would advise against Gather. I went there for food once, and it was excellent, but I have heard that since then their head chef left, and their product has gone way downhill. You can give it a shot and see what you think, but that is what I have heard.

I looked into Copper Rock. Looked like a really nice place.

I have been to Liberty Hall (which I think is technically Darboy, but it's off 441 at College Ave next to the 2 Buck Bar) and that was pretty nice, and the Paper Valley Hotel downtown. Liberty Hall was really nice because of easy access to hotels, parking, the highway, and was generally out of the way of things.

"**Pullman's** on the flats.  My wife has shot some weddings there and  thinks it would may work out for you.  She says there's a small room off the main dining room.

**Homestead Meadows** (where my wife and I had our reception) has a small building off of their main place.  Beautiful place!  We're hoping to have a 10 year anniversary party there.

**Copper Rock** downtown has a side room as well.  Not sure on their alcohol policy is here though.  We were at an event where alcohol was given away there.

Hope that helps!  Congratulations!

It's not the flashiest car in the world, but it certainly runs well and has required very little maintenance beyond the standard stuff like oil changes.

"I went to a wedding at High Cliff, and the reception was at Liberty Hall. High cliff was really nice, and Liberty Hall wasn't too bad. There was probably 60 people at the ceremony, and maybe 130 at the reception.

I've also been to a wedding at the Radisson Paper Valley hotel in Downtown Appleton, and that wedding was wonderful. Very nice little outdoor ceremony, great dinner/dancing inside, plus it's already a hotel, it's downtown, and there's stuff to do. Ceremony was very small (maybe 50) and the reception was probably 125-150. 

I was also in a wedding at The Marq in De Pere. The ceremony was great, though the setting could have been better. We got a lot of fun pictures there, though. The food was great (it's actually catered by Festival), and the hall wasn't too bad. Good for a fairly small (<150) people. Hotels are just a short drive away, and you're also on the outskirts of Green Bay, so if people need to fly in or need a big hotel to stay in, those are available.

I have heard The Waters (in Oshkosh) is gorgeous for weddings, and is somewhere we looked as well. I think it's a bit expensive, but the view is great, and it's in Oshkosh which has a ton of hotels and banquet halls.

"Good lord, they have an entire website dedicated to the 41 construction. I didn't know this.

http://www.us41wisconsin.gov/

Looks like they want at least six lanes going all the way to Green Bay, which is going to require considerable reworking of all the ramps on the way. 41 to 10 will get special attention: they're finally adding ramps to get to 10 West from 41 North (and 41 South from 10 East). They're adding a second bridge; the current will only have three eastward lanes, the other direction will have three lanes on the new bridge. I'm guessing this means both bridges will actually have a shoulder now.

"I'm going to suggest a more expensive place for pizza, Wild Truffle out by the Fox River Mall. Boyfriend and myself were worried about the negative online reviews but went anyway (with lowered expectations). Turns out it was great! We ordered the wild truffle pizza and pasta and were blown away. Again more expensive treat. Butch's in Kimberly is a popular thin crust pizza, though not my favorite.

If you're looking for more adventurous food I HIGHLY recommend the Basil Cafe on Richmond St. (Vietnamese & Thai) Start off with pad thai or curries. I've got plenty more recommendations depending on what you want to try.",t2_b7zvv,royallilly,0,1409190980.0,0,t1_ck2ff0n,ck2ff0n,True,_its_a_secret_,t3_2eefjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/foxvalleywi/comments/2eefjc/in_need_of_pizza_andor_other_food/,In need of Pizza and/or other food,/r/foxvalleywi/comments/2eefjc/in_need_of_pizza_andor_other_food/ck2ff0n/,1,r/foxvalleywi,0,1

"I can head to Jefferson tonight. If you take the road that winds by the river from broad street I think, you will see a tiny island with a small bridge going to it. Before you get that far is where I do the best. It is a bit of a waiting game for cats and it has to be sunset into dark for them. I get sheepshead sometimes but a good cat usually. I have 2 rod holders I made at work and I never see anyone else with them so that would be me. I'll have a green backpack for my gear if you spot me. I won't head there til dark  though otherwise it's just sheepshead before dark.

"I've tried out Peirce park (lutz) in Appleton and riverside in neenah as well. Only sheepshead and a channel cat at riverside, and sheepshead and one rock bass in lutz.
