"I’d look for a new job if your max rent is $1200 working at a software company. The salaries around here are really high. Some people around are making north of $300k TC. I’d say the average is about $160k in and around Boulder at the “good” companies to work for. That’s ballpark numbers for software engineers at least. I’m not sure about sales/marketing/other stuff. 

Golden, Denver, and Boulder are all incredibly expensive cities in an already expensive real estate market. The only way you’ll find something for $1200/mo is by having roommates or complete luck. You’re looking at almost double that on average.

Another thing to keep in mind is most of the supply is probably going to be completely gobbled up by all these displaced families from the fire last week. 

I read an article recently about a study that found the average rental in Denver had 14 or 15 applicants right now. That article was published before the fire…

Basically a family business that grew and grew but never shed the family business mentality.   Every decision was made by committee and it had to be unanimous.   My boss was double and triple booked with meetings all day long, every day.    There's been some mergers and acquisitions since then and maybe the new overlords (Miller?) have been able to change the culture, but my point would be that I shutter to think the hoops someone would have to jump through to make something like this happen.  


And while I'm no fan of Coors or their products, I have some nostalgia for the fact that they have been here for over 100 years and that pre-dates so much development around here, including most of the neighborhoods and offices we live and work in.

"Below is some information on the alt-market offerings for rentals in the Golden area.

In putting this together, I realized that the choice of a place to live is highly personal and there is no reason to believe that my choices would be appealing to you. For example, if I were in my 30s, knowing what I know now, my highest priorities would be financial ones:  save 15 - 20% of my income with a heavy emphasis on equities and have a  very large emergency fund that could absorb just about all of the risks that I could foresee.  Then living costs including car would have to fit within that.  I would be fine living in a neighborhood near a university that was safe but pretty scruffy.  I almost certainly would not be in newest, most pricey apartment complex.  I gather that what I describe is not the popular choice among young professionals today.  

I can imagine a perfectly reasonable person who would look at the prior paragraph and will say, “Nope.  Not for me.”


I should add that I did not follow my stated preference exactly, but something close. It has worked out very well, and I am no investment genius by a long way.  


So, back to the alt-market.  Here is a site I find interesting and look at it from time to time.  In the end, only one or maybe two places look interesting.

"Putting away more into savings and in your 401k than into your student loans is impressive.  You are showing good priorities there.  But this will inevitably put pressure on your living expenses.  I think the trade off is well worth it, personally.  

Check the compound interest table now and then.  $500 a month put into an S&P index fund that averages 8% for 35 years yields $1.1 million.

My suggestion would be to cast your rental net more broadly to Lakewood, Arvada, Wheat Ridge, and then further west.

"A take-home pay of $3400 a month on $68,000 a year seems low. The median is closer to $5000.  But there are so many variables that affect take- home pay, you might want to consult an online income tax calculator.  The calculator on nerdwallet.com is easy to use.  There are others.

Your gross income is close to the median family income for Golden. That means that half the people in the city are able to living on less than what you would making.  It seems like it is possible to live normally in Golden on $68k.  Of course, high student loans will change the cost of living calculations in a major way. Do you care to share what your monthly loan payments are? 

I wonder if there is not a financial planner in Golden who would give you a 20 minute summary of what life looks like there at $68,000.

"I used to work for the cleaning company. My uncle worked in the ammonia systems section for 30 years. A friend in packaging who I believe still works there. I talked to him about it and it took him 3 or 4 years to become a permanent employee. He started out as a temp through the company ManPower. If that hasn't changed, there are various companies that handle new hires, they contract you to work certain time periods and you have to reapply with them numerous times before Coors will actually consider you for permanent employment. 

Between talking to him and my Uncle, they both told me, be prepared to work long shifts and an insane amount of hours logged before and after permanent status. Even being an A1 employee for your temp period doesn't guarantee you a spot at permanence but it does indeed help and puts you in the top runnings. 
  My uncle's son wanted to work there and he didn't want to put his name out there as a reference even for his own son unless he was 100% serious about dedicating himself fully for the long haul. 

Talking with my Uncle further showed me he wasn't kidding in the slightest about being dedicated to his job. He was ALWAYS at work, I honestly don't know how my Aunt dealt with that, hardly ever seeing him and all but I guess the nice home in the mountains and plenty of toys was enough for her to be happy. Lol Good luck in your endeavor...
   I hear they pay pretty well... If you do get a job there and it's not in the labs, office areas or actually brewery part, they'll likely start you in packaging. 

  All I can say is be SUPER CAREFUL in that area, people die and/or are permanently maimed regularly there due to human error & mistakes. You don't hear about that shit but it happens, believe me. Lots of automated equipment rife with opportunities to get ate up by the systems at work if you're not on top of your game. No going to work half asleep there because it could cost you your life!

"What type of position are you hoping to land? My brother worked for Coors from about 2012-2015 in their QA/QC lab (degree in microbiology required). I believe he just applied through their website. There are a lot of cool perks, like beer taps in the break room and 4 cases of free beer per month (no idea if they’re still doing these things though). I think there was also an extra free case if they had zero safety incidents. The pay wasn’t great, and when you’re new you have to work a lot of night shifts. The brewery operates 24/7 and the day shifts go to tenured employees first. He also had to work a lot of holidays.

"Depends on what jobs are open and what skillset you can offer. If you don't know anything about brewing beer, you're probably not going to get hired as a brewhouse specialist. Even if you're a passionate homebrewer, it's slim chances that you'll get hired in the brewhouse... But, hey, are you good at accounting? Experience in the trades like electrical or welding? Do you have a safety certification? Science background for the QA lab? Sales and distribution your thing? You can go to their website and apply for jobs but I haven't heard much about people getting hired this way (maybe it's easier now with EWEPA but they used to have you list desired pay and eliminate qualified applicants from there).. Most people I know that work there either got their job back in the 80 when it was still chill, by network connections, or mostly by pure luck. I'd imagine it's quite competitive and they rank about even with the rest of the industry with how shitty the application process is. As far as I know, they contract out a lot of work out through temporary staffing agencies and so I'd get in contact with an agency in the area and see if they have any leads. If you really want to work for the Coors name, keep in mind CoorsTek is also a thing and often has openings. From what I've heard, it's easier to get a permanent job at the Budweiser plant north of Fort Collins.
Don't let this discourage you! They offer opportunities for a diverse range of skills.

In addition to studio and virtual options, they do sessions at parks, coffee shops, and one of the breweries.

Both have a range of style options but they're both more fitness oriented. My experience with Earth Treks is that the day pass fee is not worth it unless you are also taking advantage of the climbing.

Take a drive up lookout mountain (maybe with your newly acquired sandwich), pull over somewhere and take in the beauty. 

There are lots of amazing hikes, go on alltrails and pick one that you like! I suggest driving up clear creek, it’s a dope drive with lots of awesome hikes along the way. Not too many waterfalls locally, you’d have to drive maybe an hour or two into the mountains for a good one, and you might wanna check on water levels.

"It sounds like you are mountain biking? Green mountain can easily loop to Dakota by crossing the road at one of the parking lots (Rooney road). It's a bit more of a pain to loop into Apex, but certainly doable with a short road ride. As to trails on Green mountain, they aren't very steep or technical. The new rebuild of Rooney Valley trail is okay and box o rox is okay, both are flowier than most front range riding but neither are particularly good (IMO the berms can't support the speed you want to go)... and there's a ton of traffic. One other thing--it sounds like you're looking at the North side. I'm not aware of good trail access from there. 

IMO Apex and White ranch are far, far better (depending on what type of riding you like, I guess).

"We usually go skiing about every weekend. Leave 6am and try to return home between 1-2pm. We just barely miss traffic and typically still hit some coming home. Summer is not much better if you're into camping/hiking. Before pandemic, I worked across Denver in Aurora and my husband in the DTC in the southern part of Denver. Easily took us 1hr one way on good days. Now we work from home so not as terrible and seems traffic has lightened up, but not sure how long that will last once schools fully open. The train out of golden is slow and not very frequent. Ok for going to games but would not use unless absolutely necessary for work commute.

"**[Whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism)**

Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument.Whataboutism is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would often be ""What about ..."" followed by instancing of an event or situation in the Western world. According to Russian writer, chess grandmaster and political activist Garry Kasparov, it is a word that was coined to describe the frequent use of a rhetorical diversion by Soviet apologists and dictators, who would counter charges of their oppression, ""massacres, gulags, and forced deportations"" by invoking American slavery, racism, lynchings, etc. Whataboutism has been used by other politicians and countries as well.

"Ok, I agree a core tenant of Christianity is that you have to believe in Jesus, and you go to heaven. Rapists, murderers, pedophiles, abortionists - all get to heaven if they just believe Jesus died for their sins; but good people, who have other religious beliefs, go to hell...I'm fully aware of this garbage.

Churches, all over Golden, are where people are free to preach this message. It's pretty fucking obvious that a church is where one goes to seek spiritual ideology. No need to recruit people out in public.

Also, I don't like seeing people holding up political candidate signs either. I don't give a fuck which candidate you support; and it's not doing anything but making people who agree happy, and people who disagree upset. Just like ""believe in jesus, or burn in hell"" signs.

"""The man can hold up a Jesus Loves You sign, if he wants to publicly express his belief in Jesus.""

That's taking away a key point of his religion. Jesus giving eternal life is what differentiates Christianity from Judaism and Islam. The latter two believe that either he is a Jewish teacher or a prophet respectively. At that point, it's effectively holding a sign saying ""Abrahamic religions are good."" He's obviously wanting to advocate for Christianity. In order to do so, he has to be able to say the core tenants of Christianity. 

""Preacher John has a different sign (or maybe the back of the sign in this picture) that states: 'neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men...' This guy is openly disrespecting others' beliefs. Why is that ok?""

I would disagree that it is disrespecting others' beliefs. Would a person holding a sign supporting a political candidate be disrespectful to others' beliefs? Again, he's speaking about the core tenants of Christianity. If he had a sign that cursed Muhammad or something, I would agree that it is disrespectful. However, he was only claiming his religion was true. Due to the way religion works, there can only be one true religion. There can only be one thing that created absolutely everything and provides accounts about creation. Naturally religions will clash from time to time, especially when a scripture calls for making everyone a believer of a particular religion. He wasn't acting disrespectful.

"There are many non-christians, is the point. 

The man can hold up a Jesus Loves You sign, if he wants to publicly express his belief in Jesus. There is nothing wrong with that.

Identifying an In group (Christians) who get eternal life, and an Out group (everyone else) who get death, is divisive, insensitive and disrespectful of other religious beliefs, and wholly non-productive. 

Of course the dude has the constitutional right to not be arrested for holding his sign in public. And the public has the right to ridicule the narrow minded fool, until he leaves.

"Exactly. 

There are many churches around Golden, where people can seek more info about this - in my opinion, misguided - belief. This dude does not need to be out in public with a big, ugly sign, to initiate conversations about his religious belief.

The School of Mines has a very diverse student population, who are not Christian. There is a portion of the white population in Golden, who are Christian. These people are part of the Out group, according to preacher John.

This picture was taken in golden. I met Preacher John in Boulder, but I didn't get a picture. I heard people talking about how he preached hate, and shouted at people who passed by.

Well I can tell you that is wholly false. When I came up on Preacher John (a name he got from his trucking days), he was just silently standing on a street corner, holding his sign. I spoke with him, and he was absolutely wonderful to speak to. I asked him about the event and the harasser which first sparked my interest, an event which happened last Sunday. He said that the harasser had shown up and yelled at him and his friend, Frank, for over two hours. Eventually a friend of their showed up and tried to take the sign from the harasser, which sparked a fight. Neither I nor John know who started it, but the police were called. The cops all know John, and they know that he's a friendly and wonderful person. I don't know if any arrests were made.

I asked him if he ever shouted at folks, and he said no, he never talks to anyone unless they first talk to him. He just holds his sign. As I spoke with him, occasionally people would pass, waving at him, or saying hello, saying god bless. He would smile and return a ""God Bless you"". He's been in Boulder for 17 months, and he has made a lot of friends.

Occasionally, someone would say something hateful, and John would put on the same smile, wave, and say the same ""God Bless you"" he used on all the positive folks.

He showed me some bundles of dollar bills he would hand out to the poor, which was enough to buy a few hamburgers at Mcdonalds. This is not the work of a hateful person.

John is a wonderful human being, not someone who deserves to be lied about, or verbally harassed. I spent about 2 hours with him on Thursday in Boulder, and about the same amount of time with him on Friday in Golden. Not once did he shout at anyone, not once did he preach about hellfire, he just stood their, with his sign, and spoke with me and anyone else who approached him first.

John is a retired trucker, and he's looking to self fund his ministry. You can find his website here: [https://johnchoque.org/](https://johnchoque.org/)

"I play on the North Jeffco tennis league out of Apex Tennis Center in Arvada. Twilight league just started so they may not have spots. But Apex is a great facility, I’m not sure if they have ladders. They might have drills though which could be a good way to meet other tennis players in your rating. Otherwise check out https://njtctennis.com to see about teams.

Gates Tennis Center in Denver used to have a ladder, looks like they stopped it for the fall but I’ve played on that and it’s pretty cheap. Hopefully they bring it back next Spring. 

Finally, Meadow Creek Tennis Club on 6th and Sheridan has some stuff although that’s pricey. But they have 6 indoor courts so I think they run winter leagues.

"<my 2 cents>

1. Survey with decent elevation data (sounds like you have this)
2. Soil survey / septic walk through / quote (typically just need to know number of bathrooms and people). Having a rough area where you want to site the house will be useful at this point. 
3. Water well contractor walk through
4. Architect 
5. Bid out to larger general contractors who are willing to do the paperwork, and can oversee all of the moving parts.

"**Housing:**

You'd almost definitely need roommates to afford a house with a yard on $1.3k, unless you can find some kind of separate basement/guest house situation. I work at Mines, but ended up living in Lakewood because it's still reasonably close and I could afford a nicer/roomier 1 BR there on roughly the same budget as you. The area isn't as charming as Golden, but I still have pretty good access for outdoor/dog activities (Green Mountain + some smaller parks), and on the plus side it's a little easier to get down to Denver.

**Single Life:**

Golden is kind of a mix of nerdy-but-outdoorsy college town, suburb, and summer tourist attraction. My general feeling is that it'd be a very nice place to live a bit later in life (with more money and a long term partner, probably), but for now I'm actually hoping my next job gives me an excuse to live closer to the city.

There are definitely *some* single people in your age bracket here (including yours truly ;)... but there's just a whole lot more of us in Denver, and I usually end up going down there if I'm really trying to meet grown ups without rings on their fingers.

Obviously YMMV, and it just depends what your priorities are. Golden is generally good vibes, it's a great spot for most of your hobbies (can't speak to the yoga studios), and there are quite a few breweries full of largely friendly people to hang out at.",t2_af84h3m,pedalstiffcranks,0,1582324412.0,0,t1_fiblaig,fiblaig,True,eyi,t3_f7ctvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenCO/comments/f7ctvw/looking_to_move_to_golden_in_july_had_a_few/,Looking to move to Golden in July - had a few questions...,/r/GoldenCO/comments/f7ctvw/looking_to_move_to_golden_in_july_had_a_few/fiblaig/,1,r/GoldenCO,0,1

"In regards to your first question, I can tell you that renting a house for that price on your own is going to be difficult. My wife and I always rented houses, and were adamant about renting a house when we relocated from VA. When we looked for one in Golden (within reasonable biking distance to Colorado School of Mines at least) there weren't many good options, especially for the asking price. I think college students will pile in, and splitting up the high cost isn't so bad, so leasers don't feel the need to update the places. We ended up in an apartment complex with much nicer furnishings and additional amenities for a lower price. There are at least two complexes I know of that have dog parks on site, so having a yard is not as critical you might think. We have two dogs, and have really enjoyed the complex we live in. The county/city owned dog parks are also amazing. 

I can't answer any questions about dating, but I know that making friends here has been pretty easy. To be honest though, we have met most of our friends through our apartment complex. It is one of the upsides of living in an apartment. Beware that there isn't much of a night life in Golden, they role up the streets around 9:00pm. A lot of the activities in the area require an early morning to beat traffic, so its not that big of a deal.

Consider getting a long leash as a compromise for your dog to get more freedom on the trails without losing complete control.

Based on your experience, is taking the light rail from Golden to Denver and then to the airport a stressful trip?

LOL at calling the people trying to protect CO's air and water ""unethical""

According to the opposing oil and gas lobby funded site it's 43,000

https://www.vitalforcolorado.com/no_on_prop_112

43,000 will be lost, and a lot more won't be created in the future because they won't be able to pollute more places

A small price to pay for clean air and water

Also, don't forget a lot of those jobs are people who move here from OUT OF STATE, POLLUTE our air and WATER, and then leave, meanwhile CO citizens are left to deal with their mess

It's time to stop subsidizing the oil and gas industry's damages with our tax payer money

I cant stand the fracking/drilling industry, just as much as you cant kid.  But Im not naive enough to believe that the industry doesnt support a shit ton of Coloradans from an economic standpoint.

You can link to all the anti-drill websites you want (ya, because the sierra club is completely unbiased amiright?).  It wont change the facts on this bill.  This bill will cost 200,000 Coloradans their jobs. It will cost the state Tens to Hundreds of Billions of dollars of taxable revenue.  It will effectively end one of the largest single industries in this state.  

&#x200B;

If you want to stop the industry, get rid of the state supremacy laws, and allow this initiative to be decided on at a county by county level.  Where the people who stand to economically benefit or suffer from the drilling can best make the decision.  Stop being dishonest in your motivation and let the people most impacted by the legislation decide for themselves whether they are willing to way the economic impact over their health concerns.

"Jeffco Open Space is working on formalizing South Table Mountain Park within the next few years. In addition to shifting traffic to designated trails, the core part of this effort is to build a primary access point trailhead. The trailhead would include **signage, bathrooms, and most importantly a paved parking lot**. Currently the favored location for this parking lot is the east side of [this meadow](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.7462708,-105.1901386,15.42z) off Quaker St, near the current most popular access point on Golden Hills Rd.

The proposed parking lot will be fully paved (as will Quaker St) and will have space for **80 vehicles** including horse trailers. Alternate locations include the access point on Rimrock Dr, which can only accommodate up to 20 vehicles, and Camp George West, where parking would be shared with future recreational facilities (baseball fields etc).

You can find more information at the link in this post title and **submit comments to STM@jeffco.us by June 29th** (the sooner the better, as comments will be posted publicly to foster discussion).

I have plenty of opinions about this (good and bad!) and would be happy to discuss. But for this post I just wanted to get the info out there! If you live in this area or use this park, please have a look at the plans and submit your comments and suggestions. The folks working on this are working hard to balance the needs of county taxpayers with those of the neighbors who would be affected by these decisions.",t2_l1nx0,mokoroko,0,1528417754.0,0,t1_e0at5jc,e0at5jc,True,[deleted],t3_8pfdup,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenCO/comments/8pfdup/submit_comments_by_june_29th_s_table_mtn_parking/,Submit comments by june 29th - s Table Mtn parking lot & other plans,/r/GoldenCO/comments/8pfdup/submit_comments_by_june_29th_s_table_mtn_parking/e0at5jc/,5,r/GoldenCO,0,5

"You're in luck (if you haven't had them already), they're tasty! They're good local folks, and they try to keep their service area mostly to Golden. Kind of a cool hyper-localized thing.

If you need further expansion of your food truck dining, here are some faves that frequent Cannonball (It's the brewery I live closest to, so I'm there way too frequently).

Pile High Burgers - Good, giant, infinitely customizable burger-centered meals. Little pricey sometimes, but we like the folks who run it, so it's our regular every-other-Monday treat. If nothing else you can easily wring 2 meals out of it if you don't mind left-overs.

Burger Radio - Hugely hyped, and with good reason because the burgers are very tasty. They cut my favorite menu item (mac and cheese burger), but the EBS and mushroom burgers are great (good luck making it early enough to get the shroom burger before it sells out though). The folks running it sometimes have cranky days, but damn the food is good and heart clogging.

Jessie's Smokin' Nola - New Orleans food, really remarkably good for seafood from a truck in Colorado. I tend to get the Mardi Gras (shrimp po-boy), and my partner tends to get the massive catfish platter (which I steal bites from liberally).

Many of their other trucks are good, but those are my personal faves.",t2_51heg,tumes,0,1523983124.0,0,t1_dxin3te,dxin3te,False,deweese3,t3_82hv1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenCO/comments/82hv1o/moving_to_golden/,Moving to golden,/r/GoldenCO/comments/82hv1o/moving_to_golden/dxin3te/,1,r/GoldenCO,0,1

Yea. Unfortunately not that cheap of an area. Look to see if you can find places down Golden Gate Canyon and other unincorporated areas of Golden. They seem to be the cheapest.

Golden is a great place for outdoorsy people. I think it could be the center of an economic study on the saturation limit of outdoors sporting good stores. There are more bike shops than coffee shops. It needs a good bakery/donut shop but that's just my opinion. The creek was designed and built for kayaking if that's your thing. Theres hang gliding off of lookout mountain. Good farmers market in the summer. The university injects a lot of energy into the town. And they have fireworks every year in the spring. I lived there for 5 years and I loved it. ,t2_e4biq,thanksgive,0,1520375427.0,0,t1_dvagyqi,dvagyqi,True,deweese3,t3_82hv1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenCO/comments/82hv1o/moving_to_golden/,Moving to golden,/r/GoldenCO/comments/82hv1o/moving_to_golden/dvagyqi/,3,r/GoldenCO,0,3

"Easy hiking all around Golden (watch for snakes). Clear Creek bike trail takes you all the to the Platte River in Denver. Clear Creek (in Golden) gets crazy during the summer with kayakers and tubers, and people playing in the water.

There are summer Films in the Park at Parfet Park in downtown Golden. Buffalo Bill Days at the end of July (live music, parade, Coors beer trailer, Wild West shows, etc.). There are often other various events at Parfet Park, and Lyons Park.

Car cruises along South Golden Rd. first Friday of each month (summer months).

Miner's Ally Playhouse is neat. The Golden Rec. Center is pretty nice. 

Driving along Hwy58 toward Denver, you'll get to smell the wastewater treatment plant every time. But, if you smell cow shit during winter, it's usually a good indication a snow storm is coming in.

The ""M"" on the mountain is for School of Mines. They usually change up the lights around it for different events. E-Days (Engineering Days) they put on a *crazy* fireworks show that can be seen well from the library, but they often block the road going up Lookout Mtn. (then mtn. with the ""M""), otherwise *everyone* would drive up that hairy road.",t2_132s9h,CurlyHairedFuk,0,1520375240.0,0,t1_dvagrst,dvagrst,True,deweese3,t3_82hv1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenCO/comments/82hv1o/moving_to_golden/,Moving to golden,/r/GoldenCO/comments/82hv1o/moving_to_golden/dvagrst/,3,r/GoldenCO,0,3
"Damn dude. Sweet deal! I’m moving because the houses are cheaper in the California foothills :). Seattle must have blown up.

Do you kids play sports and such? I don’t have any kids so idk, but Earth Treks is a great climbing gym. If your kids are old enough you could get them into that.

I just did a trip there a month back and hit all the majors. Literally moving cause I love skiing and your homes are cheap relative to Seattle. Getting 35 acres in Golden and a nice house.

"Coors and Colorado School of Mines and probably the two biggest things the town has. Mountain Toad and Cannonball Breweries have lots of outdoor enthusiasts drinking beer there.

Why are you so upset about this? You are leaving rude comments on my previous posts. You clearly are looking back at post history hoping to find something derogatory to say about me. I think that's an overreaction to my my comment.

It's a known phenomenon. It happens in Golden a lot. It happens outside of golden too. It's called: your imagination. Also what representative did you call that told you it was a spirit of two suicide victims? That seems really unlikely.
