"> Unfortunately the vaccine doesnt seem to make much of a difference with severity.

False. Statistics over hundreds of millions of people outweigh anecdotes. 

The unvaccinated 70 year old is in a cohort that died in large numbers.

https://www.aha.org/news/news/2022-03-18-cdc-hospitalization-ventilation-death-rates-lower-fully-vaccinated

> When omicron was circulating in January, hospitalization rates for unvaccinated adults were 12 times higher than for adults who had received a vaccine booster or additional dose, according to a study released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adults who were vaccinated but had not received a booster were three times more likely to be hospitalized than adults who had received a booster or additional dose.

> In another study released today by CDC, two or three doses of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine conferred 90% protection against invasive mechanical ventilation or death in adults hospitalized during the delta and omicron periods. Three doses of vaccine conferred 94% protection during the omicron period, the authors said.


> Crazy, and moderna is wanting to release a 4th dose?

Well, it has a protective effect.

Also, the spike proteins on the outside of the virus keep changing shape (mutating), so eventually we'll need new vaccines.

"Huge turnover at RCGT. They say they care about their people. All the OGs are gone in one year. Some OGs are still around trying to carry the fort. We will see how long they last. Not everyone is bad at RCGT. 

Some senior management folks tried standing up against the partners. They got shot down.

The firm promised employees their bonuses and asked staff to work 44+ hours. Bonuses were not paid. 

Rumors were the firm took advantage of COVID wage subsidies while paying out bonuses to just the partners. I don't know if this is true but it sounds awful. 

This is a firm made to intimidate staff. The partner likes to raise his shoulders and puff out his chest and walks around. You look silly. No one needs to see a gorilla trying to flex. No one cares. Everyone is trying to focus on work because the firm promises their customer the mooooooooon and rsrc rates are waaaaaaaaaay below market. The firm thrives on employees eating hours and being afraid to ask for help. Before this was a good company. 

During a state of emergency and combined with covid restrictions they still ask people to go to work. I felt unsafe going to the call center. RCGT has been having issues staffing its call center while needing to meet requirements.

> what does annoy me that is the most enthusiastic proponents of these things usually have a vendetta against driving though. 

One thing I've become convinced of over the years is that the *default* North American perspective is heavily oriented toward the needs of drivers. So in that environment, I can see why advocating for non-drivers sounds like a vendetta. 

We should absolutely have safe and effective road networks for drivers. *But*, we should also have safe and effective transportation networks for cyclists, pedestrians and transit users. Right now in Ottawa we have road networks that are safe for drivers, but almost no safe networks for cyclists, and very little *effective* transit.

"We are living in the mistakes of urban planning in the past 70 years. The problem is not car culture. Many people cannot care less about cars or driving. But because of how cities and suburb are currently laid out,   many people are conditioned to be car dependent. They don't really have any concept how it can be both efficient and convenient to rely on other modes of transportation than driving a car. 

We need a functional example right here to demonstrate the feasibility.

Here's one opportunity. Approval of the Tewin development is a major eff-up. One remedy the city could do is to force the planning of Tewin to be completely self contained (minimize the need to commute to Ottawa downtown), make dedicated bike and walking infrastructure to be the main mode of getting around, and provides awesome public shuttle bus services.",t2_1jujho,ls650569,0,1648260552.0,0,t1_i25919h,i25919h,True,cjmochrie,t3_to4jzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/to4jzw/how_to_change_attitudes_toward_transit_cycling/,"How to change attitudes toward transit, cycling, car culture etc.?",/r/ottawa/comments/to4jzw/how_to_change_attitudes_toward_transit_cycling/i25919h/,4,r/ottawa,0,4

"I didn't say withhold rent, I said to dock the amount from the second last months rent.  There is nothing they can do about it and it's not a breach of contract.

Tribunal wait times are ridiculous right now because of a backlog.  If the tenant doesnt deduct the deposit from their second to last months rent, they will *never* get it back.

My advice is perfectly sound and more importantly, legal. 

I've dealt with shite landlords for friends and family.  I've helped a friend deal with collection's agencies sent after them from a landlord who never showed up to the hearing while telling the agency that it was ruled in the landlords favour.

I always advocate honesty and being upfront when renting.  Knowing your rights and the rule and spirit of the Act.  This shit isnt rocket science, its black and white and easily found online.  All Ontario laws are available in full online.

A damage deposit is not a legal deposit to request.  If already paid, a tenant is completely within their right to deduct that amount from any month's rent.  The Tribunal will never side with a landlord.  Withholding rent for any other matters will certainly not go in the tenant's favour.  But deposits beyond a deposit on last month's rent?

"Hey I use to do security at this mall and there should still be security. I'd assume they still only do 2-10pm or what ever the last 8 hours are.

 I'd suggest re visiting at the time above and go to any store. ask if they can call out security for you. Then make sure they note all this down.

 Have date and time ready for them. You can find that if you have Google location history on (if you cant try to get around an hour or between X and X time) A description of your appearance and route of the mall. If you want and I suggest you do. Let them know you want to file a police report and leave/take contact information. If they seem unqualified not serious or uninterested. Ask if you can speak to mall management, Ron or Garry. (Security is hit or miss)

">I would say that I'd remove mask mandates when a supermajority of local top health officials in Ontario deem them no longer necessary.

Why is ""local"" important?  Covid isn't a local issue.  What makes the local health officials the authoritarian on Covid?  Ontario is hardly a hotbed of global ground breaking medical advances.

I'd like to point out that the majority of local health officials also weren't completely against lifting these mandates.  They just wished it was pushed back by a couple of weeks due to March break.  They wanted to see if any new trends occurred.  From their point of view, I understand that.  They are cautious and more data will breed more accurate assessments.   But at some point, you have to stop collecting data and just make a decision.  Otherwise nothing ever gets done.

"While a good point, in this case Reddit users have pointed out the correct course of action.

Of course, the OP could always short change a rent payment by $500 as the deposit is not legally allowed.  With the backlog at the Tribunal, short-changing the second last month's rent is probably the most practical approach.  I say this because any Landlord who knowingly falsifies a required document so they can collect an illegal deposit is a shit landlord in the first place.

But go the proper route, file the notice others have mentioned.  If you get a hearing or a notice before the next two years, awesome.  If you move out before it's heard, take the amount off of your second last month's rent and send a note with the payment that you've withheld the $500 dollars for the improperly collected ""damage deposit"" and reference the section of the Act which makes it improper for them to collect.

This is one of those statutory items that you can't sign away on the lease agreement.  Similar to agreeing to no children  or pets.

"Major cuts to the transit budget were made in 2004, and 2011. Blaming this on amalgamation is nothing more than an excuse.

> So let's say you're running for mayor in 2022. How would you propose fixing this system, and what kind of funding would be required?

We need to establish better service standards. ""15 minutes"" as frequent just doesn't cut it. Also, the drop off in service outside of peak hours on these already-too-infrequent routes are too steep.

Upping these standards/frequencies will  
a) make it easier to simply go and take a bus  
b) make it more convenient to transfer by shortening the maximum amount of time you have to wait in the worst case (which is especially a problem at Tunney's/Hurdman/Blair right now)  
c) reduce the impact of cancellations and delays, by reducing the maximum gap in service that can happen as a result of those

This won't make everything *perfect*, but I think it would be the single most effective action at making transit *better*. Look at the TTC for example, where buses are very frequent, though they still suffer from some reliability issues (bus bunching) and lack of infrastructure (signal priority). All that said, the TTC still completely outclasses OC Transpo as a result, which is why I think this is the most important aspect that needs to be addressed.",t2_6x15o,Pika3323,0,1648256460.0,0,t1_i250myx,i250myx,False,cjmochrie,t3_to4jzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/to4jzw/how_to_change_attitudes_toward_transit_cycling/,"How to change attitudes toward transit, cycling, car culture etc.?",/r/ottawa/comments/to4jzw/how_to_change_attitudes_toward_transit_cycling/i250myx/,2,r/ottawa,0,2

Do not negotiate. Do not wait. If they don't immediately agree and return it, file a T1 ""Application for a rebate"" with the board (follow the instructions to do it properly). You have to file the T1 within a year of the deposit (don't delay though, it's your money).

"No, I'm not saying we need more *capital* investment (that's a separate matter). I'm saying we need more *operational* investment.

In Ottawa, a bus that runs every 15 minutes is ""frequent"", and that's only between 6am to 6pm. Outside of those hours, the vast majority of bus routes in Ottawa run every 20-30-60 minutes which is pathetic. We should follow in the footsteps of cities like Toronto and Montreal which have established networks of higher frequency buses. 

----
Here's a good example: Bronson Ave in Ottawa vs Runnymede Rd in Toronto.

Both roads with a stretch of similar length lined with medium-density residential buildings, except along Bronson the Route 10 also serves Carleton University.

Runnymede Rd has two bus routes that run so frequently you have a bus every 5 minutes on average during the day, and every 10-15 late at night.

Bronson sees a bus once every 15 minutes during the day, but every 30 minutes after 6pm.

---- 

Literally all we need to do is pay more operators to drive more buses to increase the amount of transit service we get.

It not only makes it more convenient, as you often won't even need to check a schedule before going to catch a bus, but it also reduces the impact of cancellations and late buses since.. oh the bus is cancelled? Well the next one might only be in 5 minutes, not 15 minutes.

Somehow, it is still next to impossible to find any widespread support for this on the completely misguided belief that the investment will be mis-spent.

"I would say that I'd remove mask mandates when a supermajority of local top health officials in Ontario deem them no longer necessary.

That isn't the case right now. None of the top health officials in municipalities in Ontario are willing to say right now that they won't encourage mask-wearing anymore or won't do it themselves. Many don't want to comment on the situation because it is politically sensitive, but if you look at their statements many are implying the province fucked up in rushing to remove mask mandates. I think Etches is of this opinion even though I don't think she has said it directly.

It also depends on the situation of course, masks should still be required in most indoor settings but there's pretty much no outdoor settings where they're really necessary as far as I'm aware. I really can't believe that people are so desperate to take them off, whereas I can totally understand the push to get rid of COVID restrictions or at the very least reduce them (mandates are another matter entirely, and personally I'm of the mind that they should stay for good until COVID is no longer a threat).",t2_6sqa1,caninehere,0,1648255708.0,0,t1_i24z2yq,i24z2yq,False,Myllicent,t3_tnmle0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/tnmle0/lifted_capacity_limits_behind_sharp_rise_in/,Lifted capacity limits behind sharp rise in coronavirus levels: Ottawa Public Health doctor,/r/ottawa/comments/tnmle0/lifted_capacity_limits_behind_sharp_rise_in/i24z2yq/,1,r/ottawa,0,1

"Our municipal government need to show clear plans with measurable targets. Then bidding on the project can take place. Now we have a price set to those plans. The deliberation on the value of those plans vs the costs need to be clear and open to the public. After the plans are evaluated and rhe public has had time to voice its opinion, then it can go ahead. 

The most important part is that the city must keep the contractor accountable. No more letting it slide when they fail to deliver. They made the bid, they set the targets. They need to be fined when they do not meet them (unless the city is responsible). 

Finally if the plan does not achieve the target results, then representatives need to resign, be disciplined, or be voted out.

As someone who is probably in the very skeptical category when it comes to public projects, this is what it would rake to get me on board fully. It may seem harsh, but we need accountability, otherwise our public servants will continue to screw up and not care.

"2/3 or so of Ottawa lives outside the Greenbelt.  Plus the outlying communities of Ottawa, and also Gatineau.

Have you ever used a non-Transitway route outside of rush hour?  It's all fucking miserable.  We need Transitway or LRT service in more areas of the city, with frequent service.  The Carling, Baseline, Cumberland, Kanata North routes that have been planned, but won't be built for decades.  Bank and Montreal could be prime candidates for a subway or other rapid-transit solutions, but have nothing planned in the new 2049 official plan, a plan that also does nothing to integrate transit planning with Gatineau and the NCC.

Basically, any suburbanite who can afford to do so uses a car for everything outside of rush hour trips to Centertown.  It's obviously not sustainable.

Cycling is the same.  There are very few routes through the Greenbelt, from any side.  The routes that do exist are on 80k roads, or meandering NCC paths with 20k limits.

">Folks that hate bike lanes, the bus, are sick of cyclists that think they own the road and just want to be able to drive places quickly and easily, what could change your perspective?

I'm making another comment here to say that I don't think it's wrong for people to hate these things. Bike lanes, as Canadians know them, really do suck. REAL bike infrastructure should be built so that bikes can stay off the road where it is safer for the bike and the cars. Lights for bikes should be built at intersections. The bike paths should be fully cleared of snow in the winter. If you do that, bikes ""owning"" the road wont be a problem, and neither will the bike lanes. 

The buses, the way they are designed now, aren't great for transportation, especially in suburban areas. Metro trains should be built to handle longer distance travel, and buses should be on a schedule that can get people to where they need to be on time. 

These kinds of things appear to be common in other parts of the world, but not so much in North America. Probably mostly because we build big suburban, car-dependent cities.

"You will note I said ""presuming Bill 124 was repealed first"".

Obviously renegotiating under the same circumstances would be a waste of everyone's time... which is why I explicitly included that proviso right at the start.

> The nurses only negotiating tactic realistically is to go on strike which is limited, so you are basically advocating for nurses to probably go on strike during a pandemic and with a huge surgery backlog, which would kill people.

I feel like you went from ""I'm not sure I understand what you're saying"" to ""I can safely assume you're advocating to kill people"" *very* quickly.  Three sentences is a shocking speed to get between those two points.  I'd really like to give you the benefit of the doubt you're not trolling, but you have to understand that if you were that is *exactly* what it would look like.

Regardless, my point is that renegotiating is only an issue because of a bill Ford instituted and can easily repeal.

"I wouldn't call myself a bike or transit freak, but I am getting to that point. Since moving to Ottawa last year, my wife and I have reduced our car usage down to one electric car. Last week we bought bikes and we are hoping to use them a lot this spring.

Part of the idea to do this was from us driving from Arizona to Ontario in July last year. I have family in St. Louis, Missouri and they live in parts of the city that are definitely walkable. We really liked it.

But an even bigger part of it for me has been several YouTube channels and videos. Here's what I've been watching:

* [Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes) \- A Canadian man who moved to the Netherlands. He compares his experience of living in London, Ontario (aka Fake London) with living in Amsterdam, and other European cities.
