"A number of things are disturbing here. Per state law, minors are not allowed in a vape shop nor allowed to purchase vape equipment. Heck, it's against the law to use them too.

Since we haven't read of adults getting ill from cartridges from Fog Foundry, this comes across as specific cartridges sold only to minors. Which isn't a selection I've seen in the shop. But, then again, I've never seen a minor in the shop.

Next, there was a rash of black market cartridges going around a few years ago with, supposedly, THC in them that caused some serious medical conditions that the mainstream media said were the same as normal cartridges. Thankfully the law enforcement folks didn't pay attention to those news reports and cracked down and raided a number of those black market suppliers and got them off the ""street"". 

Next we have an unverified accusation here with next to zero details, but what we don't have is the accuser saying they contacted the Indiana Tobacco and Alcohol agency to lodge a complaint and start an investigation. Which would be better at protecting the children than an low information accusation here.

"The many pedestrian-friendly walkability features of Kokomo were one of the many reasons why my husband and I decided to move to Kokomo in 2021. I love riding my bike around town; from our house to the YMCA, to Foster Park, to the Riverwalk Concerts, to other downtown venues, and down all the major trails. I also believe that these features set Kokomo up to be ahead of the curb too.

"People hate islands because people love their cars. The argument is that the islands are dangerous for drivers, and they're exactly right, that's the entire point. It's a passive design called a road diet designed to slow cars from speeding in an area where cars should not be speeding. If you can't stand to drive 30 in an area where pedestrians are walking all along you're the problem.

I'm so tired of hearing people complain about these things, even in my full-size van I can navigate Kokomo just fine, you just need to be more careful, which is the entire point. People are used to living in cities meant for cars and hostile to pedestrians, Kokomo is lucky to have as many pedestrian-friendly walkability features as we do. I for one am glad we have islands and other features to make our city walkable and beautiful, as towns move towards public health and prioritize safety and ease of transportation, we will only see more of this. Kokomo is ahead of the curb in my opinion.

u/CaelePemberton has some banger recommendations, I second all of those, they're all on the list. I'll add that Coopers Pub is getting ready to open downtown which should be really awesome, those guys know what they're doing. Some other great food recommendations are Pho Nguyen, The Radish, Oscars, Pizza co, and Stoneys. Definitely check out the trails in the summer, great city recreation.

Our trails are awesome and Grissom isn't too far from the Nickle Plate, which connects to the other Kokomo trails.

"Kokomo is not known for amazing internet, however there are a few apartments with fiber. The 306 riverfront complex specifically has blazing fiber speeds, although those are very expensive. In most areas Xfinity is the main option, and Comcast is a terrible company. That being said I personally haven't had a ton of issues with them, at least in recent years. I consistently get 150 down 15-20 up, which isn't insane but more than enough for several people in my house to stream. 

&#x200B;

Before I got super busy, I gamed a lot and unless four of us were all trying to play competitively it was just fine for most major esports games. One member in my house consistently streams 1080p 30fps just fine and doesn't experience any dropped frames unless someone else is doing some significant streaming. We do have a more expensive package though, I believe it's $90/mo.   


If you can afford it and if you have the option, definitely get fiber. I think AT&T and Xfinity both provide it, but don't quote me.

"There are a TON of places to volunteer around Kokomo, so it sorta depends on where you are and what you like to do.

If you are religiously inclined, a lot of churches have volunteer programs at food pantries and there is a lot of cleanup and community outreach programs as well. I would specifically contact Crossroads, Northview, First Naz, or St Joan, as they are the biggest churches, and are able to put you in contact with smaller churches for more specialized opportunities.

If not, there are lots of other places to look around. Here are some places I've volunteered before for various reasons: Narrow Gate Horse Ranch, Kokomo Rescue Mission, Bona Vista, Bridges Outreach, Carver Center, and Urban outreach. Also, the sports teams (jackrabbits specifically as they are in season) also have many volunteers. Here is a list of Non-profits in Howard county that will usually be happy to have some help: [http://www.cfhoward.org/legacy\_nonprofits.html#gsc.tab=0](http://www.cfhoward.org/legacy_nonprofits.html#gsc.tab=0)

You can call the parks and rec department as they have many events around and might have special volunteering opportunities, especially with park maintenance and city beautification. Unfortunately, all of our major festivals are done for the summer, but there are lots of minor events like runs and fall events coming up. Get in contact with city hall for more info and questions, they're really chill and always willing to talk about that stuff, you might even end up talking to the mayor himself!

Parks and Rec department: (765) 456-7275

"This portrait was purchased in Kokomo on a recent trip there. One of Ryan’s distant relatives mentioned that it is in his style (hand colored) and I believe it to be from about the 1930’s, give or take a decade. 

The relative mentioned that Ryan signed his portraits and research shows that he typically did so in the upper left corner. Unfortunately I can’t remove this photo without destroying it so I can’t check there. It does have embossed marks but they are illegible. 

It has no significant monetary value to me (though I know there are collectors in Kokomo of his work), I really would just like to know so that I can catalogue this into my collection. 

The relative mentioned that a museum in Kokomo may also be dedicated to him or have a large collection of his work? Does anyone know of this?

However, if your neighborhood has any sort of HOA, the rules obviously are different. Where I live, we don't have anything like that, so it wasn't an issue.

"I'm confused. You said you had been paying the bill, but then said that you're afraid they never made an account for you. So whose name was on the previous bills? I'm not judging, just trying to understand where the mixup is/was.

If the bills were coming in your name, then I'd say don't worry about it. But, if the bills were still under the previous owner's name, then you may have a problem.

Have you created an account online with them?  If not, I'd definitely suggest that as a first step. Their website is pretty good, as far as utility companies go.

If you work for a business that is a Chamber member, you can attend Chamber networking events, which at times can be stuffy if you're not necessarily a business-minded person, but you meet a lot of people, especially if you come to a few. We should have some ribbon cuttings coming up soon, which are casual ways to get your foot in the door without seeming out of place. You can check here to see if your business is a Chamber member: http://greaterkokomo.chambermaster.com/list/

"Check out The Kingdom Cards and Games.  The owner has helped put on several film festivals in Kokomo.  A regular of the shop is more involved with movie and film making.

It's a FLGS (friendly local game store).  I used to play magic the gathering and smash bros tournaments there.  

They usually have something neat for first Fridays. These events are geared towards the general public and building a gaming community too.  They are broader, extra welcoming to newcomers, and meant to help people find new hobbies and for people with hobbies to find days/events related to those hobbies.  

If you are a sports person, I'd check out Jackson morrow Park.  They have 3 sand volleyball courts.   I frequented them for about 10 years and most people are friendly and will accept new people that are in the park.  There is one super competitive group that doesn't like new people unless you are an experienced player. 

Frisbee golf in highland Park.  Just hang out by hole 1 and ask to join a group.  When I moved states I did this at a local course and still do it whenever I go to a new course alone. 90%+ of people I ask let me join.  Over half the time, I exchange contact info with them either to frisbee golf in the future or for some other mutual interest.  I've met gaming buddies this way and even met enough people to organize a volleyball game in my new area.

Definitely the Kingdom though.  Great people and friendly players.  Even if they don't have anything that interests you, they will point you into the direction film filmmaking stuff.",t2_10ishr,Dr_Golduck,0,1623944873.0,0,t1_h23nxyr,h23nxyr,True,Chipmunxism,t3_o1ykya,https://www.reddit.com/r/kokomo/comments/o1ykya/new_to_the_area_where_should_i_make_some_new/,"New to the area, where should I make some new friends?",/r/kokomo/comments/o1ykya/new_to_the_area_where_should_i_make_some_new/h23nxyr/,9,r/kokomo,0,9

"Man, Chucky Cheese?  Really?  I don't even know how to approach this with you now.  I guess I will say this.  A town has many purposes.  A town needs to provide  approximately three things.  Affordable housing.  Well paying jobs.  Everything else.  

So in the everything else category you can assume that means access to stores that sell the things you need plus places to go for entertainment.  Dining opportunities, fun stuff, and educational places.  Plus you need to include saftey in that equation.

But here's the thing.  No town is perfect.  I bet you think Chicago is a fun ass place to go.  Well, guess what the average housing cost is in Chicago?  It's a fuck ton. It's crazy expensive, but if you can afford it, there are fine dining places to eat at all over the place.  There are dozens of museums.  There are awesome fun things to do on every corner.  The question is, can you afford to live there?  Beats me, I sure as hell can't.

So, I live in a cheaper town (Logansport actually) where I have a good job that pays me well, and I own my own home that was incredibly affordable.  I buy my groceries and eat out at boring mid-priced restaurants.  When I want to have a good time I drive to Indianapolis and do something amazing.  I spent a bunch of money, have a great time, then drive home to my affordable city.

You are 30 minutes closer to Indy, than I am, if you want to have fun, hit the road, then come back to Kokomo where you can afford to live a good life.  If you want the kind of hipster lifestyle where you go to comedy shows on a Tuesday night, and a hooka bar on Wednesdays for lunch, you better get a really great job first, because that is an expensive way to be.",t2_kpl9f,SilentMaster,0,1607655161.0,0,t1_gfcou9e,gfcou9e,False,MadAshKash,t3_k9o4nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/kokomo/comments/k9o4nf/my_opinion/,My opinion,/r/kokomo/comments/k9o4nf/my_opinion/gfcou9e/,4,r/kokomo,0,4

"It's almost impossible to ensure that these kids will be 100% safe from COVID in the classroom. Even with 100% compliance with masks and social distancing, the amount of time these kids and staff spend together in a confined space is going to make an outbreak almost inevitable. We could test everyone before they come back to school, but that doesn't mean that can't get it anytime afterwards. Also, those under 25yo tend to have less or no symptoms. So you can't just send the sick kids home to avoid exposure.

Unfortunately the safest thing to do is keep schools closed and classes online until a vaccine is released.",t2_4znf8eh4,RandomUsername1119,0,1595600471.0,0,t1_fz3clv1,fz3clv1,True,splashinova,t3_hwxbio,https://www.reddit.com/r/kokomo/comments/hwxbio/how_will_our_school_systems_handle_this_second/,How will our school systems handle this second half of 2020 in the classroom?,/r/kokomo/comments/hwxbio/how_will_our_school_systems_handle_this_second/fz3clv1/,5,r/kokomo,0,5

"I'm a Kokomo native in the Lafayette area. Shops have came and gone in Kokomo over the years. Hopefully the other replies are right and there is a new one on the way in.

Gas City is probably the closest one. But definitely double check the locator, the distances seem off on most of these. I don't know anything about the Gas City one, but I will tell you about the Lafayette-area ones. I do sometimes see people I know from Kokomo at shops there. 

There are 4 shops in Lafayette/West Lafayette and I can say 3 of them are pretty good, the other (Castles) I can't vouch for because I haven't had the need to go there.

Game Preserve would be the closest Lafayette Area store to Kokomo. They are great, downfalls are a smaller play area, bad bathroom, and not a super-great singles selection. The people there are great, though, which makes it my favorite. They usually have a decent price pool. Their Friday Night Magic is usually draft.


Legendary Games or Castle Comics would be the next closest. Like I said, I haven't been to Castle because the others have met my needs, so I can't say anything good or bad about them other than their website/web presence sucks. Legendary has a large play area, decent singles selection, good parking, good prize support, good people.

Sage's Shoppe would be the furthest Lafayette-area one for you in West Lafayette. I haven't played there and from what they post on their events I'm not too fond of their 3 round prereleases and prize support, but they are the only Lafayette-one that offers online purchase/inventory of singles, so I have bought from them several times for that. They have a nice looking store and I would consider playing there for non-release events, but I've never played there.",t2_9pma3,pandorasboxxxy,0,1499393593.0,0,t1_djvu9ou,djvu9ou,True,[deleted],t3_6lm130,https://www.reddit.com/r/kokomo/comments/6lm130/magic_in_kokomo/,Magic In Kokomo,/r/kokomo/comments/6lm130/magic_in_kokomo/djvu9ou/,1,r/kokomo,0,1

"> jack rabbit stadium 

Kokomo Jackrabbits is a member of a Collegiate Summer League. It's a league to go to get more experience while still maintaining NCAA eligibility.  Haven't been yet but I will be going some time this month.

The Kokomo Speedway features mainly midgets and other sprint cars. It is s dirt track so either sit far away or bring eye protection. You will get hit if you sit somewhere along the first five or so rows. It's not bad but a little overpriced in my opinion. $20 to get in per person plus $15 for a burger and chips for two is a little much.

"A man who fled from both Kokomo police and Howard County sheriff deputies on his motorcycle early Sunday morning now faces two felony charges and two charges of operating while intoxicated.
The woman who was riding with him jumped off the motorcycle during the pursuit; she was not injured and does not face any charges.
Kokomo police initiated a traffic stop when they saw James F. Walker IV, 33, Kokomo, driving faster than 100 miles per hour on his motorcycle, headed northbound on Indiana 931 near Carter Street at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday, according to the arrest report.
Walker did not stop and the police officers gave up the pursuit. A Howard County Sheriff deputy patrolling the area of Ida and Nancy drives saw Walker sitting there and tried to make contact with him. Walker took off southbound on Indiana 931, with his passenger, Angela Wright.
After travelling about 3.5 miles to the intersection of Indiana 931 and Morgan Street, Walker moved to the left lane and attempted to turn and head northbound again. At that point, Wright jumped off the motorcycle and landed by the guardrail.
Walker’s motorcycle died, the arrest report states, and he was unable to restart it. Officers arrested him then, with Kokomo police assisting at the scene.
Walker faces charges of OWI; OWI endangering; being a habitual traffic violator, a Level 6 felony; and resisting law enforcement, a Level 6 felony.

"A 17-year-old Sharpsville male died early this morning after the car he was driving crashed into a tree near 6757 North and 500 West in Tipton County.
The preliminary crash investigation by Trooper Jeremy Perez and Indiana State Police Sgt. Rick Brown revealed that Devin Pearcy, 17, was driving a 2010 Chevrolet Malibu northbound on County Road 500 West, near 6757 North at about 4:15 a.m. when he lost control of the car and struck a tree broadside on the driver’s side door.
The state police report states speeding and alcohol were factors in the crash.
Pearcy was pronounced dead at the crash scene.
Two passengers in Pearvy’s car survived the crash, state police reported in a news release.
A medical helicopter flew a 13-year-old male passenger from the crash scene to a Fort Wayne hospital for treatment. He suffered non-life threatening internal injuries.
A 14-year-old male passenger allegedly fled from the crash scene on foot. He was later located with no injuries, state police reported.
Evidence indicated all occupants were wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash. Troopers believe the restraints helped prevent more serious injuries to the surviving teens. The crash impact, on the driver’s door, was too severe to prevent the fatal injuries to Pearcy.

" A jury has convicted Tim Jimerson of voluntary manslaughter with a deadly weapon for beating and strangling Toni Spicer, a 27-year-old mother who worked as a dancer at the Hip Hugger in 1992.The jury issued the verdict Tuesday evening in the cold-case murder trial after just over two hours of deliberation.

The Class A felony conviction comes after jurors listened to seven days of testimony from witnesses, including Spicer’s two children, who found her beaten and tied naked to her bed with pantyhose on Aug. 29, 1992.

Jimerson was linked to the killing in 2011 after tests revealed a single strand of hair around 2 inches long found on Spicer’s naked body was consistent with his DNA.

Jimerson lived just down the street from Spicer at Maple Lawn Trailer Court, located just north of the Miami-Howard county line, at the time of the murder.

Detectives with the Indiana State Police interviewed Jimerson in 2012 in Mississippi, where he has lived for more than 15 years.

Jimerson initially told detectives he couldn’t remember anything from the night of Spicer’s murder because he was drinking and had taken three opiate pain killers.

After detectives ended the interview without a confession, Jimerson called them back shortly afterwards and told them he remembered knocking on Spicer’s door that night.

He eventually said he cut her throat with a knife, and later said he might have strangled her.

Jimerson told a different story Tuesday, when his defense attorneys called him to testify as their last witness.

During his testimony, he told jurors he woke up inside a trailer on the morning of Aug. 29, 1992, but it wasn’t his.

The night before, he had purchased three pain killers from someone at a Kokomo bar. He injected the first one, but after breaking the needle, he swallowed the other two.

The next thing Jimerson clearly remembers, he told jurors, was waking up on a couch inside an unfamiliar trailer he didn’t recognize at Maple Lawn Trailer Court. He said he had no idea how he got there.

“I yelled, ‘Hello. Hello. Is anybody there?” he told jurors. “No answer.”

So he started looking around the trailer to see where he was or if anyone else was there,he said.

Jimerson said when he entered the bedroom, he saw a woman he knew as Toni Spicer. She was beaten, bloody and tied naked to the bed with pantyhose. There was no one else in the trailer. He told jurors he then leaned over her face to see if she was dead.

“She had that stare, and I knew she was deceased,” he said.

Jimerson said after that, he left and walked back to his own trailer, where he passed out again until the next morning.

During closing statements, however, prosecutors showed pictures of the couch inside Spicer’s trailer taken after her murder. The couch had numerous items on it, indicating no one had lain there the morning of her death.

In his confession to detectives in 2012, Jimerson said he killed Spicer after he asked her for sex but couldn’t perform.

“I was frustrated … She was kind of giggling about it … I guess I cut her throat or strangled her or did whatever I did,” he said in the interview.

Miami County Chief Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jeff Sinkovics said that confession, along with what he said was a pubic hair found on Spicer that matched Jimerson's DNA, proved Jimerson killed Spicer.

“Your pubic hair doesn’t just get onto someone’s dead, naked body,” he said Tuesday during closing statements. “The only explanation is it got there while he was beating her, strangling her and dehumanizing her.”

Sinkovics also emphasized that Jimerson told detectives he had tied up Spicer after strangling her with pantyhose, which the autopsy showed was wrapped around her neck and mouth four times.

A physician and the crime scene investigator both testified during the trial that an examination of Spicer’s wounds indicated she was tied up after she was killed, and the crime scene was manipulated after the incident.

“Nowhere, nowhere at any time did anyone say that Spicer was tied up after she was murdered,” Sinkovics told jurors. “It’s never, ever mentioned to him. That’s something only the killer would know. This man, Tim Jimerson, knew that.”

Jimerson’s attorney argued detectives elicited a false confession from him. Detectives suffered from “tunnel vision” after finding the DNA evidence, the defense argued, and were set on dragging a confession out of Jimerson, whether he committed the crime or not.

Jimerson was tried on a murder charge during the trial, but Judge Tim Spahr told jurors that the defense and prosecution had agreed they could issue a verdict of voluntary manslaughter if they deemed the evidence better fit that charge.

Indiana law says voluntary manslaughter occurs when one person intentionally kills another person, but they acted out of passion or anger before having time to calm down.

The jury deemed the crime a Class A felony, which means they determine Jimerson used a deadly weapon to kill Spicer.

Jimerson, 55, is set for a sentencing hearing at 1 p.m. on Sept. 3. He faces up to 50 years in prison.",t2_76waq,bambulance,0,1439380347.0,0,t1_cu09km0,cu09km0,True,bambulance,t3_3gpnvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/kokomo/comments/3gpnvf/guilty_jury_says_jimerson_killed_hip_hugger_dancer/,Guilty: Jury says Jimerson killed Hip Hugger dancer,/r/kokomo/comments/3gpnvf/guilty_jury_says_jimerson_killed_hip_hugger_dancer/cu09km0/,1,r/kokomo,0,1

"Kokomo police arrested five people on a number of drug charges Monday evening at a residence in the 500 block of East Sycamore Street.
KPD arrest reports show officers arrested Jade M. Cook Sr., 43, 800 block of South Locke Street, and Cassandra Shepard, 33, of the 200 west block of 300 South, at 8:05 p.m. on the majority of the charges. Cook faces a Level 5 felony dealing in a look-a-like substance, and Level 6 felony charges of possession of a syringe, maintaining a common nuisance, possession of cocaine and warrants for failure to appear and a parole violation.
Shepard faces a Level 4 felony dealing in cocaine, a Level 5 felony dealing in a look-a-like substance and Level 6 felony charges of maintaining a common nuisance, possession of a syringe and possession of a narcotic drug, the reports state.
At the same address, officers also arrested Jade M. Cook, 20, 700 block of South Union Street, Sierra R. Cattin, 18, Peru, and Jason Newman, 25, Peru, each on a misdemeanor charge of visiting a common nuisance.

"I was born and raised in Kokomo, so I have perspective (and perhaps a biased one)

IUK is good for what it is, it's a college education at a discount. People in town generally go there after high school to reduce the debt they will have at the end of college, or just go if they are unsure about college in general. Thus, you will be in class with these people. I imagine a higher percentage of them will be the type of people you are excited to get away from in high school.

I went to Purdue in West Lafayette and loved every bit of it. I lived in the dorms. I went to big college parties. I met lots of culturally diverse people. I got an amazing education and now I have a dream career. A large reason why I'm successful now is because of all the connections I made in college, and I just feel like your connections will be limited at that small school.

Plus, Kokomo is a dead town with absolutely no night-life and nothing going for it. You'll be lucky to actually escape after college, I know of tons of people who just never left Kokomo because it made them complacent and they never had the money to move away. It's sad really.

So, I suggest at least exploring other options. Since you live in Lafayette, Purdue may be a premium education at a discount. Otherwise, look at IU or Ball State, or even colleges outside of Indiana. 

There are two super big important parts of college: the connections you make, and the things you learn about yourself. Sadly everything else, including what you learn in class, is peripheral. Think about that before you choose, and good luck!!
