What you're asking is incredibly nebulous. In the best of times a 35 minute commute covers half the state. In the middle of tourist season it can easily take you 35 minutes to go from one end of Newport to the other. You've got to give lots more information for people to effectively help you.

"Rain should end about 2 pm with only a few showers after.  Assuming you do bring rain gear and warm clothes Cliff Walk will be sheltered from today's westerly winds.  Many of the more local places (especially lower Broadway, sort of a hipster hangout) will have dog friendly outdoor seating.  Some places there (I think The Tavern and maybe Pour Judgement) are both dog friendly indoors also.  The popular and funky Fastnet Pub isn't.  Also check the cluster of Restaurant/Bars (Caleb and Broad, The Malt, Fifth Element) on upper Broadway (near Cumberland Farms).   Many have somewhat covered outdoor seating with heat lamps.  The Corner Cafe half way between the other two clusters (across from St. Joseph's church has heated outdoor seating and great food.

Down on Bowen's and Bannisters Wharf (near Clark Cook House) there should be some heated outdoor seating that's pretty nice going into January.  Not 100 percent sure though.

On Lower Thames Street O'Brien's Pub and The International Yacht and Athletic Club (sort of a members place but they will serve you if not busy) are very dog friendly.   Good place to network if you want to help deliver a racing sailboat headed south for the winter :).

This is a thing now, it targets areas that will give the most return. Newport is a target, look at lower Thames.

Target Atlanta keeps stats, 42,000 single family houses bought by these companies in the last 2 years.

"Free market? What free market? 

In a free market developers would be able to respond to a scorching hot market by building more housing, so that they could cash in on the bonanza. But try to build an apartment complex in Newport and see how far you get. 

There is no ""free market"" in housing. It's one of the most regulated markets in existence. Local governments control what is built and how much of it. The result is that we're building at historically very low rates all across the country, but *especially* in a place like Newport. You can't have a city full of affordable housing *and also* it be a city that's full of buildings that are hundreds of years old.

"Dont wanna sound like a jerk - and maybe this is what the bride wants or whatever - but newport is DEAD come mid-November (unless there is something happening that weekend?).

But If you are set on going to newport and want excitement that isn't generated from your group itself, I suggest either booking activities in advance or going somewhere else.

"The fuck are they talking about?  There's so much transportation because they keep putting hotels all over the fucking place!  The mopeds and slingshots are nothing compared to how many people they are cramming along the shore, ruining the classic views.  If anything, the mopeds and slingshots are a nice to see after dealing with the Land Rover idiots practically parking in the middle of America's Cup like they own the place.  This is just the old fucks whining about noises that come with the people that stay in the hotels they build.  They want their cake and eat it too, so they do what they want and build their money making hotels and restaurants then complain about mopeds and live music when the people actually come.  I'm sick of the old, out of touch fucks trying to run the place.  Ask any musician in Newport and they'll tell you.  You have to play music to bring the people in to make money, but you have to play real quiet and at specific times or else you get noise complaints.  I know, I was one of them.  It's like they expect people to come visit Newport and either eat quietly or stay in their rooms if they're not endlessly touring the mansions.  They already got rid of the Newport Yachting Center, so no more exciting music or comedy.  What else is there to do?  Let the people drive as many mopeds as they want or else all that'll be left to do is get shitfaced on Thames and then they'll complain about the party culture like they did in the 90's all over again.

Food wise 1st beach and Gooseberry have the best snack shacks. Gooseberry is really nice but a season pass is $350. I’d recommend going to Gooseberry for a day ($30) and checking it out. 

I enjoy Rejects as well. Have to bike or walk there. Technically no life guards but I’m sure the Baileys guards wouldn’t let you drown.

"OK, first a caveat: I haven't ridden Ocean Drive after Memorial Day. I have no idea how busy it gets in season, and when the season ends.

But the weeks before Memorial Day, it's just glorious! I try to get down there as often as I can in April and May. I absolutely love it. Fantastic views and I don't find the traffic bad at all (again, maybe different story after Memorial Day).

I don't live in Newport, so I park my car at Surfer's End (where there are port-a-potties), then ride west but take a short detour down Tuckerman Ave, then west on Memorial Blvd, down Annandale Rd (there was a port-a-potty on one of the cross streets for a while), then Narragansett to Bellevue Ave to the end, clockwise around Ocean Drive (bathrooms at Brenton Point) along Ocean, Ridge, Harrison, Beacon Hill, Hallidon, Wellington.  I come out at Wellington Avenue where there's the Shell Station for refreshments. Then maybe have lunch in Kings Park or Touro Park and go around again, maybe counterclockwise.

"This map is a good guide to ideal biking roads: https://bikenewportri.org/maps-and-rides/

Biking to Norman Bird Sanctuary or anywhere in Middletown or Newport will be relatively easy. There are some hills, but nothing compared to the climb toward Balboa in SD. The more Northern parts of the island are a but of a pain as you need to do a bit of zig-zagging to avoid the busy roads (West and East Main).

You cannot bike over the Pell Bridge (to Jamestown), but can bike over the bridges to Bristol (no bike lane) and Tiverton (dedicated bike bridge). It would be about 30-35 miles total from Newport, but there is a bike path that follows the coast from Bristol to Providence (ending at the ferry landing) that makes a great ride. (I think the ferry also stops in Bristol, so you could skip the non-path portions potentially.)

Make sure you wander up to Broadway while in Newport. Thames is a good area, but most of my favorite restaurants in town are on Broadway (Stoneacre, Pour Judgment, Scratch, Corner Cafe, Malt, Fifth Element) and it's a bit less tourist-crazy.

For a unique dining experience, take a ramble up to Providence and check out Big King (Japanese, reservation required.)

Near the bird sanctuary is also Sachuest Point with coastal views.

The Boom Boom Room below Clarke Cooke House is REALLY fun although it's a ratchet mess. It's the closest thing to a nightclub you'll find in NPT.

Cooke House is delicious but pricey. REALLY good restaurants in NPT: Salvation, Perro Salado, Pasta Beach, Midtown Oyster Bar, Fluke. 

Diego's is a huge fan favorite for brunch. It's like a fun party spot with Mexican food.

A few places have live music consistently - One Pelham East and Blues Cafe are reliable but be warned that 99% of the time, any live music in Newport will be the same predictable cover band kind of thing you see everywhere.

"For the beach I’d head down to 2nd Beach in Middletown. Last year (COVID) they weren’t selling day passes though. Not sure about this year but you can always UBER. We don’t have any live music on our beaches. Also, I’m pretty sure you can’t get onto Gooseberry Beach without a season pass. 

For small bites and good cocktails I’d say Fluke but it’s pretty expensive. Stoneacre Garden is a great choice too. I highly recommend a sunset drink at the Vanderbilt on their rooftop.

"The bar at Forty 1° North would work great for you. Big, airy, outdoors, lots of seating for larger groups, on the water (though not on the beach).

Second Beach (aka Sachuest Beach) for a bustling beach scene, Gooseberry Beach for a little more laid back, stunningly beautiful beach. I don't think you'll find live music on either or on any beach in/around Newport.

The Mooring is a good place for seafood on the water. Bonus! It's right by Forty 1° North. Have dinner there then take a short walk to drinks.

"Depending on where you are coming from, you might just want to skip all of the above options you’ve highlighted, honestly. Newport has plenty of decent- and even some very good- food, but IMO as someone who moved here after living in various places that had legit options for Thai, Chinese, Mexican, etc. available, the closest you’re gonna get to any of your desired choices is Boru Ramen, which isn’t 100% ‘authentic’ but is still pretty legit usually. If by Mexican, you mean mission style taqueria, Leo’s market is definitely also quite decent, but I don’t know if they deliver. 

Seriously, though, skip any Chinese- it’s terrible here, I promise.

"The only heavy rain appears to be early on Saturday.  Otherwise it's mostly showers.  Instead of a souvenir t-shirt stop at West Marine, Helly Hanson or Team One and get a lightweight sailing jacket.

You will look like a regular Newport racing sailor type.   For a boat cruise all the schooners are great but the Gansett is a powered boat with a nice sheltered deck with a view.  They do a nice tour.

For electic music fun check out Los Duderinos at Pour Judgement on Broadway (local hipster heaven).  Band starts at 10 pm on Sunday night so get there about 9:30 pm to get a seat near the front.

"Restaurants with a view:

\-Ocean Drive area: Ocean cliff and Castle Hill both located on towards the most southern point of the island at the end of the Ocean Drive. Pricey but waterfront lawn setup with the Adirondack chairs for you to watch a sunset in.

Downtown mid Thames area: 41 North, The Mooring, and all of the restaurants on Bowens wharf. Really enjoy back deck of the Lobster Bar. Its probably the most cost effective out of all of the restaurants on the wharf as well. 

Uptown Broadway area: Where it lacks the water views it makes up for it with the foot traffic. This part of town has been built up quite well in the past decade and hosts several different restaurant's that attracts crowds from all walks of life. If its a sunny day, go to Fastnet where I am sure you will be met with some sorts of international sports fans watching there favorite team play soccer or rugby. Great back patio where theey keep a couple ping pong tables, TV's and dining tables.

Ragged Island is fun with good beer. 20/25 min outside Newport though. 

For wine your best bet is to buy a bottle (from Maria at the Wine Cellar) or drink at a restaurant.

"**Breweries**: There are 2 standalone breweries (edit: 3, see reply comment) on the Island - Newport Craft (previously Newport Storm) and Ragged Island, alongside a couple brewpubs (Taproot, Coddington). Honestly, none of them are going to blow you away if you're a really geeky craft beer fan. But if you just want some ok beer - have at any of them. 

If your trip to Newport takes you past Providence, 100% stop at Long Live Beerworks (imo: the best brewery in the state - I know guys overseas who trade for their bottled stouts). Tilted Barn in Exeter is also not too far away from Newport, makes solid beers, and their new location is gorgeous. 

**Bottle Shops**: Sandy's Liquors (corner of Green End Ave & Aquidneck Ave) is my go-to shop on the Island. Really good sized beer selection and he's getting solid stuff from the VT, ME, and NY breweries. 

**Bars/Restaurants**: Norey's is going to have unique European beers on tap and in bottles - occasionally he'll even get Cantillon on tap. Pour Judgement always has a nice selection and is just a great place to have a beer. 

Again, if you're passing through Providence, stop at Bayberry Beer Hall.

"Don’t know if it’s possible but if you delayed the trip 1 month I think you and the family would enjoy Newport more. That being said Audrain (sp) car museum on Bellevue is always a treat. The Art museum up the street is always cool. Maybe book a “Ghost tour.” I still see them rolling around town. Try some more local food spots like Perro Salado, Salvation Cafe, Diego’s, or anything on broadway. Hit some local shops on Thames St. The staff and owners would really appreciate it in these times. Take a walk to “The Bells” with the kids around ocean drive. Let them jump the fence and explore the abandon ruins of the old mansion. No one really cares lol. The bird sanctuary in Middletown is a nice walk. Some of the mansion MIGHT reopen by then as HBO is wrapping up their takeover of them for some show.

"Good advice so far.

Corner Cafe is small and charming and always crowded Sunday morning so you would have to wait in line as I'm fairly certain there are no reservations.  It's set in the funky but fun Broadway area across from Saint Joseph's church.   Food is great.

Castle Hill will be a very good choice if you dress warm.  The hill is exposed to the west and northwest and on Sunday it will be windy out of the west- northwest with temps in the high forties.  But they have good heaters and I'm sure you would be set up well protected.  Get reservations here.

If you go to Castle Hill take a drive after brunch around Ocean Drive and perhaps check out walking on Cliff Walk which will be protected from the westerly breezes on Sunday since it's on the east side of the ""cliff"".  Then check out Bannisters Wharf for later in the afternoon fun.  Good outdoor dining there and it will be somewhat protected from the wind.

Edit to mention that a drive through Fort Adams (near Castle Hill) might be cool on Sunday.  The winter Laser fleet (13 foot long single handed performance racing sailboat) of about 25 competitors should be out from 1 pm to 3 pm and the racing will be easily visible from the piers near the parking lot.  They only cancel if winds are over about 25 knots.

"Not to pry, but what are you moving to Newport for? Retirement? Job? Seasonal home? I lived in that exact area for 8 years (rent).

"Morton park is fine, it's one of the larger in Newport with plenty of trees and one of the better playgrounds for kids. But there are so many parks in Newport, I wouldn't use that as a factor in your decision. But to answer your questions better, it'd help to know where in relationship to the park you are looking as the answers will differ.

Roughly to the west of the park is the neighborhood call the ""fifth ward"". I'll assume this is where you are looking as apartments are common there. Houses tend to be older and very close together. Off street parking can be a challenge. Street are VERY narrow. Snow plowing can sometimes take an extra day or two due to the town only having 1 or 2 plows that are small enough to fit down the side roads. In the summer traffic can slow you down a lot, I'd add 15 minutes at least to your drive. Humanity is closer and privacy is a little harder than other areas in Newport.

The up side is that you can walk to the ocean in three directions, walk to the super market, have great restaurants and bars within walking distance as well as many other activities in the summer. (Pretty sleepy in the winter) You'll have access to a world class sailing community as well. 

I think it's a great place to live, but it's definitely not for everyone.",t2_16hekk,jammer3573,0,1613868987.0,0,t1_go6e8rt,go6e8rt,True,AuntieTess,t3_lok0d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newport/comments/lok0d8/morton_park/,Morton Park,/r/Newport/comments/lok0d8/morton_park/go6e8rt/,4,r/Newport,0,4

There are plenty of doctors on the island. Sometimes it can be a little difficult getting a primary care physician solely because they only take on so many patients but with a little research and word of mouth you can find one. I use Dr Del Gurcio. Have been since 2005. He was private and independent years ago but SouthCoast Medical bought his practice out so he’s contracted with them now. Still a very family oriented practice and easy to get a hold of.,t2_2ofjyrt8,sumthinserious,0,1609546870.0,0,t1_ghrysyx,ghrysyx,True,AuntieTess,t3_kom19u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newport/comments/kom19u/healthcare_in_newport/,Healthcare in Newport,/r/Newport/comments/kom19u/healthcare_in_newport/ghrysyx/,6,r/Newport,0,6

"The kitchen in the venue is tiny unfortunately. There is only one 5 burner residential style stove with limited overhead space, one residential sized double basin sink, an ice machine, a residential style dish washer and a double fridge.

"Operations manager of a large property with a restaurant, bar, club, and event spaces in Newport R.I. The problem you’re gonna find with having an event anywhere on the island that doesn’t own their own catering and event licenses is the liability, liqueur, and various other insurances. There are good caterers on the island that can help accommodate your wedding but they are not cheap. The solution to your problem if money is the issue is finding a member of the beach that has privileges that would be able to use the kitchen and have family help out with a buffet style reception and dedicate a few ppl to bring LQ & Wine. Otherwise you’re definitely gonna pay a premium to have a caterer come in. All this being said I sell weddings on the island for an UNBELIEVABLE amount of money and I often tell my wife I don’t know why “these ppl” don’t get married on a beach and have the family or friends help out so you’re on a good track in a beautiful place.

"Hey. Got married at Easton’s Beach. Same situation. We found a caterer that worked for our budget. Caterer provided food, silverware, plates (etc), and linens. They also provided bartenders (we needed TIP certified). Caterer set up and cleaned up.  We picked a menu and the caterer gave us his recommendations (we did buffet style). We switched our menu to his and we were happy we did. 

Then we found a florist (highly recommend Malinda Shea out of Middletown). She provided flowers, plants (rented some trees), and center pieces (also rented). She set up and cleaned up as well. 

For booze the caterer allowed us to provide it ourselves (saved an ass ton of $). I went to a local packie and struck a deal with them. They provided the booze and I returned the next day with unopened bottles and payed them.  Booze was a pain because I had to pick it up morning of the wedding and bring it to the venue. 

Brought in a DJ for music. Basically asked him not to talk. Had a friend do introductions instead. Best thing we did was give him a Do Not Play List. 

I wish we could have afforded a wedding planner or coordinator. We made it work but I think they would have alleviated a lot of wedding day stresses.
