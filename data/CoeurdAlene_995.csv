Fuck suburban sprawl

To add, its estimated we are ~5.5 MILLION housing units short NATIONWIDE. This is not a cda specific problem but the fact there is no local focus on affordable housing compounds the problem.

To add more, this is EXACTLY why government is important. You think the free market will ever build low income or middle housing without regulation or ordinances? Nope. Out of state developers will continue to build million dollar condos on the river to the highest bidder while locals get to sleep in their cars.

Contact your county and city officials and vote for people who are looking to build affordable density instead of ""all government bad/no growth"". Growth is coming no matter what. Better do something about it now.

"Budget is going to be a major factor but here’s the real answer:

Play cda resort or circling raven for golf.

Mineral ridge hike.

Rent a boat on cda lake, take it to Harrison and get off and eat/drink, maybe cruise down the cda river. 

I’d air bnb anywhere downtown or on cda lake, if hotel try the cda resort.

The other alternative is to come check out cda and move this whole thing to priest lake which is a lake an hour and half north of cda.  Lodging is hills or Elkins or a waterfront air bnb.  Priest lake golf course, tons of hiking and boat rentals with Elkins, take boat up to the thoroughfare etc…

Priest is more rural though, if you are looking for more of a downtown nightlife bachelor party vibe then cda is the place.  Hard to recommend bars I mean you will see the scene, you can easily hit most of them in a night or 2.
 
Both places will be busy especially cda, I’d suggest booking these things like now.

"That's all anyone who isn't from here knows about this place, it's all the national press ever talked about, which is sad because we didn't ask for them to come here. The hate group this area is know for was the Aryan Nations, and it was NOT HOMEGROWN. It's founder Richard Butler came here from California by way of Colorado in the 1980s back when land here was still dirt cheap. He bought some property, then invited like-minded assholes from around the country to come join him and live on his land. I've lived here since the early 80s, I grew up here during that era. The vast majority of locals all hated them being here and went to a lot of effort trying to get them out. A community human rights council was created specifically for the purpose of kicking them out. Ultimately we were successful in suing them after a shooting incident, Butler lost everything including the land and went bankrupt and died a few years later. We never asked for him to come, the overwhelming majority didn't want him here, but we'll be forever tainted by proximity. 

The sad truth is that racists exist and they are in practically every single town and city in this country. Most just don't intentionally try to draw attention to themselves like Butler did - that's the difference. If you look at cities like LA, Baltimore, Chicago, St. Louis, or the deep south you'll see waaaaaaay more evidence and incidents per capita of racially motivated violence and tensions than you'll ever find here, despite our notorious ""history"". Are there racists here? Yes, sadly, some have been attracted to the area by our unfortunate reputation, but I would argue probably no more than you'll find anywhere else.",t2_13q6ac,digitalvagrant,0,1647973292.0,0,t1_i1oxtqc,i1oxtqc,False,Dialectologist,t3_tjhs00,https://www.reddit.com/r/coeurdalene/comments/tjhs00/idaho_english_survey/,Idaho English survey,/r/coeurdalene/comments/tjhs00/idaho_english_survey/i1oxtqc/,2,r/coeurdalene,0,2

Our society has the resources to take care of basic human needs like housing for everyone at an affordable price, but refuses to because it will never make the profits required to stay in business.

"Take this with a grain of salt because I haven’t yet been able to have a lot of direct experience with therapy. But at minimum I think it would be really helpful for a therapist to offer regular group Zoom meetings where a variety of genera mental support strategies and coping mechanisms are taught.

For example when I started experiencing regular panic attacks for the first time in 2020, I had no clue what was happening to me or how to proceed. I happened to bring it up to a friend who was seeing a therapist and she taught me what panic attacks are, then shared the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding method. I was able to start using that immediately to help tide over until I could find someone for more targeted care. It made a huge difference in my day to day peace of mind and opened my eyes to the possibilities of changing my life for the better through principles taught in therapy.

Of course the internet is a great resource for learning about mental health but when I am really struggling, it’s overwhelming to try and distill only what I need from the firehose of info online. Having a regular class to attend to learn skills would be so useful.

Read to the end of the article, I'll quote it here. He's basically a bully who yells at people and intimidates them, literally sucks with money, and is going to bankrupt the school. ""Former NIC President Rick MacLennan, fired from the college without cause last September by the board majority, described his eyewitness account of Banducci's physical assault of a female college employee at a college-sponsored event on Dec. 10, 2019. That description was included in an email provided to The Press through a public records request.  
The NWCCU panel report declares Banducci is not to be involved in NIC Foundation operations or fundraising, based on an agreement between him and the foundation.  
In April 2020, the board issued a private censure to Banducci for conduct they believed “falls below the standard expected of an NIC Trustee.”  
According to the panel report, the NIC Foundation indicated a loss of approximately $4.1 million in legacy gifts, $343,000 in estimated Major Gifts and another $36,800 in annual donations.  
In a meeting with the NIC Foundation, the investigating panel found the Foundation Board had lost a “historically very positive relationship with the NIC board and the administration.”  
Hazel said the college can't afford Banducci. She cited the nearly $500,000 paid out to MacLennan for his remaining contract and from a lawsuit; the funds paid for a search firm to assist in filling MacLennan’s position; replacing administrators who left the college after his firing; and donations to the NIC Foundation that will not be realized.  
“His agenda is too expensive,” Hazel said. “Community members understand this when they sign our petition, and they’re taking a stand that we’ve lost confidence in the scorched earth leadership that has been brought to us by Todd Banducci.”",t2_5jmgrfo8,Weighenough444,0,1647624091.0,0,t1_i16e112,i16e112,False,Weighenough444,t3_th1u01,https://www.reddit.com/r/coeurdalene/comments/th1u01/resign_banducci_save_nic/,Resign Banducci - Save NIC,/r/coeurdalene/comments/th1u01/resign_banducci_save_nic/i16e112/,5,r/coeurdalene,0,5

So you read nothing from my comment. The reason he made the motto in God we trust was because of the civil war. During the Civil War is when religion started coming to America.

"**[Pledge of Allegiance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance)** 
 
 >The Pledge of Allegiance of the United States is an expression of allegiance to the flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. Such a pledge was first composed, with a text different from the one used at present, by Captain George Thatcher Balch, a Union Army Officer during the Civil War and later a teacher of patriotism in New York City schools. The form of the pledge used today was largely devised by Francis Bellamy in 1892, and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge 50 years later, in 1942. The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945.

Cliff notes:  pledge been around since 1892.  ""under God"" wasn't added until 1954 so go ahead and get out of here with that shit that it's always been that way.

Also with the God on money: A law passed by the 84th Congress (P.L. 84-140) and approved by the President on July 30, 1956, the President approved a Joint Resolution of the 84th Congress, declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States. IN GOD WE TRUST was first used on paper money in 1957, when it appeared on the one-dollar silver certificate. The first paper currency bearing the motto entered circulation on October 1, 1957 (that's from the treasury website of you care to have a look).

So go on, keep spewing your bullshit about how God has always been there and a part of this country.  Jesus christ do some fucking research before you try to spout off.

"So just gonna ignore everything else and latch onto the one thing you think can still make your case?

You said one of the main components of CRT was that whites were the prime center of racism. Not a single thing says that, so you pivot onto something else instead of admitting you're wrong.

Your argument boils down to ""well I didn't experience it so it doesn't exist"". Is your world view so small and infantile that you can't fathom things existing that you didn't personally experience?

Let's break it down since you supposedly read it too.

It first states: White privilege refers to the myriad of social advantages, benefits, and courtesies that come with being a member of the dominant race.” (Delgado and Stefancic, 87) White privilege “makes goals more accessible. It makes harms more avoidable. While it does not ensure that every white person will win, it makes it harder to lose.” (Bridges, 195)

Then gives some examples: Examples of white privilege include greater ease securing a loan or favorable terms for a loan, lower likelihood of being stopped by police while driving or walking somewhere, and better rates of maternal and infant mortality. (Bridges, 196)

And you must've skipped this paragraph because it actually addresses your exact argument: This should not lead to the “mistaken conclusion that the possession of white privilege equals the possession of a charmed life.” (Bridges, 201) “White people are a varied group, and the racial privilege that any one individual enjoys will depend on his social circumstance.”

So white privilege. I was wondering when that would come up. I read the exact same one. White privilege is a joke and the basis of racism towards whites. So where do we get white privilege? I mean I'm pretty sure I grew up pretty shitty too.

"Sure thing boss.

From the Institute of Education Services (actually a 2009 study done by Nicholas Hartlep):

 There are five major components or tenets of CRT: (1) the notion that racism is ordinary 
and not aberrational; (2) the idea of an interest convergence; (3) the social construction of 
race; (4) the idea of storytelling and counter-storytelling; and (5) the notion that whites 
have actually been recipients of civil rights legislation.

Nothing about whites being the center of racism in that one... Let's try again.

I'll let you read this one yourself because it wasn't nicely laid out for me, but suffice to say it says nothing about whites being the ""prime center of racism"". https://www.britannica.com/topic/critical-race-theory/Basic-tenets-of-critical-race-theory

So let's do one more, for old times sake.

From Sutherland Institute (https://sutherlandinstitute.org/the-core-concepts-of-critical-race-theory/)

The “core concepts” or “basic tenets” of CRT are described in introductory texts on CRT for college students written by the political position’s founders and practitioners. Two are quoted from here.[i] These concepts include: (1) the social construction of race, (2) structural or institutional racism, (3) implicit bias, (4) microaggressions, (5) white privilege, and (6) intersectionality.

I don't see anything in any of these about whites being the center of racism.

"As an aside, speaking of the way Bell refers to liberals as ""cockroaches,"" this is yet another instance of an extremely troubling trend in the Republican party to use dehumanizing language to refer to their political opponents. Rats, ""libtards,"" cockroaches, etc. Similar language was used in Rwanda in the lead-up to 1994 and in Germany in the 1930s about ""undesirable"" groups. I'm not saying that Republicans today are trying to push such language to refer to democrats to make the possibility of violence against political opponents seem more normalized and palatable, but it is following an exact strategy that has been used to do precisely that in the lead-up to some of the worst atrocities humanity has seen in the last century.

Republicans can already do pretty much whatever they want. Astroturfing the local democratic party to put a proud white supremacist as the party chair and to steal money meant for Democratic donations and give it to conservative causes will do nothing to further any supposed policy goals they have.

"This is a very interesting conversation, to me. I could listen to it all day probably. It's really easy to just say ""Republicans are corrupt"" after hearing this. If memory serves though, all parties are corrupt or at least have corrupt individuals and this is not news. This phone call is a small glimpse into the real world of politics. I don't care for either side and I hate that because of their split, that split exists among the people as well and it shouldn't. It is humorous he's talking about some other guy who got caught saying something on video because he's ""stupid"", how ironic lol

It wouldn't surprise me if all they said about the democrats rigging support was true, people will go to incredible lengths to win and that's all I see now, people who want to win rather than people who want to do what's right. Sadly, what's right isn't what gets peoples attention anymore (for the majority).

I remember a conversation between a political figure and a high level employee of a certain Social Media platform where the politician and their team were actually trying to run the race ethically and their intentions were good, but if they didn't play the game of ""pointing fingers"" at the other party for ""bad things"", then they would get nearly no outreach to the public. The reason this individual was talking with a Social Media employee about this was because they noticed that unless they made posts that were unethical, they'd get no views because the algorithm wouldn't let the post catch traction. The reason for that is because controversial posts make it to the top, while ethical posts don't (same thing with the news). Just look at Trumps tweets or how Howard Stern because popular, honestly neither of them should've been popular but the ""shock and ah"" got peoples attention and that's all it takes.

I really hope that these types of conversations continue to come to light (for both sides) and people start understanding that the average everyday normal people all want to get along, but can't because of how crooked the political system is. Maybe this is just the balance and needs to accepted for what it is, but I'll never accept it as it is today.

Don't forget, both sides have trained you to talk in their language. Nazis, Marxists, racists, etc. These are very large and damning accusations to call someone and we're just throwing them around like nothing. Putting people in a box like that (on either side) shuts off critical thought and examination, because it's easier for you to do that and they know it. Please think for yourself, please listen to yourself and no one else. 

If anyone wants to jump straight to the conversation....

"Right, because if the library and librarian are going to be legally liable for books held in the library, that that's any different than an effective ban on the book the moment someone gets a conviction.  Like every single school and public library in the state wouldn't immediately remove that book.  Jesus man.

The bible is an example, you got defensive instead of answering the question.  

Fine, let's set this all out very clearly.  Let's say that a lawsuit comes forth in which a librarian is convicted for a book that is declared to be ""harmful to minors"".  The book is ""Rainbow Fish"", just to make it interesting, which happens to be your theoretical kid's favorite book, just to up the ante.  Would you support the library being held legally liable, and an effective ban on the book in the state?

I have a strong doubt that you would.  Maybe you're theoretically poor in the scenario as well, to the point that you struggle to put food on the table and cannot afford to buy your child the book he so desperately wants to read with you at night.  

But you can't get it from the library, it's been removed by every library in the state ever since the aforementioned conviction.  'I should be the one to decide what is and isn't appropriate for my child!', you exclaim.

Are you seriously asking me to believe in that in this scenario, your response wouldn't be the aforementioned ""I should be the one to decide what is an isn't appropriate for my child"" would actually be ""Yeah man that seems right, I'm glad the state has me and my child's back!  Thank god that Rainbow Fish got removed""

Nonsense.

I will:  I don't want my kids reading Mein Kampf at their age, but I certainly don't want it banned or restricted because that's censorship.
