"We arrived in Chapel Hill in late 2020. It's been tough, especially with COVID to really see much. I really love the weather. The greenways are fantastic. The restaurants are fantastic. I have seen very little in terms of live performance, which is something I used to do a lot, but have been happy with what I've seen.

Most importantly, I've found it very hard to meet people. I'm an art photographer and a lot of my social interaction was with other artists (I was very active in our local art guild). I shoot models and didn't really socialize with them but acted sort of like the grandpa who could give them advice. Here, there is almost no model photography community and I missed the 2021 jury selection for the Orange County Art Guild, which is only done once a year.

I just juried into the Orange County Art Guild and I've joined a couple of local photography groups, so I am hoping that things improve.

"Unfortunately, a lot of places get taken within a couple days of posting. Many are same day. My husband and I moved across the country last fall and had visited the area in the summer to find a rental in the area. We could only look at places that had our exact move in date, because like you said there are others that could move in earlier if it was available. No one would allow us to make appts for showings over 48hrs in advance and the majority of our viewings got cancelled because somebody signed before we saw them. I recommend watching Zillow and realtor.com multiple times a day. A lot are duplicates but the major rental companies list their properties there so it is easier than constantly checking 5-6 rental company websites everyday. As soon as something is posted, and it checks your boxes, put in an app. I think Zillow only has a one time fee for apps so apply to as many as you can. On the last day of our visit, something popped up on realtor with an open house. Single family home in Carrboro, 3bd, 2 1/2ba, walking distance to farmers market and a bunch of other stuff. $1875/mo. $300 over what we wanted but it was perfect and not much else to pick from so we told them during the tour we wanted to proceed and signed the next day.

"Yes. I was on 54 just past Smith Level headed towards Merritt's Pasture when a vehicle went past me with a person hanging out the window with a rifle firing at the vehicle in front of them. It was a bit surreal. Naturally they were driving at a fairly high speed -- but not as fast as I would have been driving if I were in the front vehicle. I'm glad it was a rifle and not a pistol or there would have been a much great chance of a bullet coming through my rear window as they approached from behind.  

I heard the gunshots before they caught up to me but I didn't identify them as gunshots until they flew past. Thinking back, I believe I did discern two different kinds of sounds -- obviously the report from the rifle -- but possibly the sound of bullets striking the front vehicle.

"[The Station](https://stationcarrboro.com) in Carrboro used to have a great open mic.  Not sure when or if that will start back up again.

[The Kraken](https://www.facebook.com/KrakenBarChapelHill/) is a great roadhouse style / dive bar just outside of town.

[Local 506](https://local506.com) is more of a rock club but I've seen plenty of great country/folk/bluegrass acts there as well.

[Haw River Ballroom](https://www.hawriverballroom.com/#/events) is a fantastic venue about 20 min outside of town and they run outside free concerts on saturdays in the summer at the park/farmer's market.

Of course the legendary [Cat's Cradle](https://catscradle.com) has everything.  Be sure to check out their other venue in the same building, The Backroom.  It's easily the best sounding room in town. 

There are also a ton of ""private"" venues for dances, jams, and performances.  I obviously can't list them here but get to town, go to some shows, make a friend or two and you'll find them soon enough.

"Lived here for a few years. We have always felt welcomed. We have also had new neighbors move in who are more private and everyone is fine with that, too. An upside we didn‚Äôt fully expect when we moved here was North Forest Hills park and the small set of trails that go through. You can go on some nice walks through the neighborhood, or ‚Äúhike‚Äù up to the water tower and what not. It‚Äôs also fairly close to the Timberlyne shops, which is nice for quick grocery runs or grabbing food at some of the restaurants. Some folks walk over there from the neighborhood, too.

School districts vary a little across the area (at least for the area that I think of as North Forest Hills). Some go to Sewell, some to Estes Hills for elementary. One weird thing is that the Estes Hills students from parts of North Forest Hills do not go to Phillips for middle school (it‚Äôs right next to Estes Hills). They go to Smith, whereas most other Estes Hills students go to Phillips.

"We just moved and switched to spectrum, using their equipment. It's been about 3 weeks and I've replaced the router twice already (on their recommendation) due to connection issues. (Which kinda pisses me off on its own because I've wasted a significant chunk of time going back and forth to the store to replace brand new equipment and have nothing change.)

Still randomly having connection issues. When connected, we're getting full speeds, but the router frequently ends up in this loop where it can't connect properly to a device. For example, wifi will be working perfectly fine on my laptop/phone/doorbell cam, but when I go to stream my toddlers pre-k videos on the TV it won't load properly and ends up in a buffering loop. Restarting/reconnecting the device does nothing, reducing the amount of connections does nothing, resetting the equipment does nothing. It just randomly works and randomly doesn't, sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes for several hours.

"Make sure your equipment is up to snuff and what they sent you isn't old dog shit. Additionally are you in more crowded housing setup like an apartment/condo/town home? If so your wireless could be getting interference my your neighbors who are all also probably running Spectrum modems and WAPs.

When we lived in apartment in Carrboro for several years Spectrum was the only real option (AT&T did 15-20Mbps). We had 50Mbps or something and it was always anemic and terrible. I used my own wireless and also their provided equipment but I constantly had signal interference from my neighbors, as we were in a 2nd floor apartment with neighbors all around also on Spectrum. Even when I would get it tuned good a few months later neighbors would change and it would turn to crap.

When we moved to our house just outside of town Spectrum was still the only option (AT&T does 5Mbps here). Our internet still kinda sucked, but not quite as bad, as we had less signal interference from neighbors, but the signal would not cover our whole house, even though it is not a big place. Two months before Covid happened I decided to spring for a nice Eero Pro system to see if that would resolve the issues. I ditched any kind of wireless from Spectrum and have a modem that goes to my Eero via a cheap 5-port mini-switch. We have 200Mbps here and I get that and usually an extra 10-20%, both wired and wireless. I can get a WiFi signal into my neighbors yards and damn near 100+ yards from the router. 

Since the switch my desktop is wired, my laptop is wireless and my kids each have a wired desktop PC. They game and stream all day long, and often both at the same time. My wife has a laptop also on the wireless and she is usually streaming from my Xbox One S on wireless to the living room TV or has the Roku Ultra running on the back TV. I will use my iPad, my laptop and my desktop all at once, as well as a NAS box streaming out and sync. But my 200 Mbps from Spectrum is more than enough. The golden ticket for me was a good (and not inexpensive) Eero Pro system to manage the network traffic properly.

"Unfortunately yes.  As bad as housing and rent prices are rising around here, NC still hasn't caught up with other parts of the country.  This area is still cheaper than many other similar areas in the country.  That's just one reason of many that the market has gone nuts.

"Depends on what you're looking for. Chapel Hill is a small college town with all that entails. There are multiple highly respected graduate and professional schools at UNC so there will be older students, and of course other older populations, but there's also a lot of undergrads.

The areas further out from campus, especially getting away from a small number of major roads, are quiet. Nice neighborhoods, good bike lanes, lots of parks and trails. There's not necessarily going to be a ton of fancy things in Chapel Hill, but a lot of areas in town are being newly developed and are fairly new and nice.

If you want the amenities of a larger city, Durham is not far. Depending on where in Chapel Hill you are, parts of Durham are easily accessible within 15-20 minutes, or vice-versa if you wanted to live in Durham and work in Chapel Hill.

If you want even larger city, Raleigh is probably 25-45 minutes (depending on exactly where and what time of day you are going).

And secondly, how am I pricing out anyone else - that is again if you are referring to me here. The whole point is that the sub-renter would be actually paying less than they would if they were responsible for the whole rent.

"One concern about your survey:::

""How do you/your family most enjoy interacting with other UNC fans? ""

Your options didn't include the possibility that the local community members  may only enjoy discussing or viewing the games with other local community members outside of the arenas or other organized venues.  IE basic social gatherings or business meetings.

These are hands down the top  reason for me or my family members to interact with UNC sports.

It's important for my business/personal life  that I have some idea what's going on.  It's important that my children have the same understanding to ""fit in.""     I know that's minimal engagement but it remains an important subset of data.

"The UNC Visitor's Center is on Franklin Street now so it seems like that is the ideal place to start for a visit to UNC's campus. Not sure why you would want to start on South Campus??! Park at Morehead Planetarium in one of the visitor's spots or park at the lot on the corner of Columbia St and Rosemary St.

Franklin Street is definitely worth checking out to get the student vibe. We like Epilogue and their churros and chocolate. 

If you like bubble tea, there are three great bubble tea places on Franklin St. 

You might like a meal at Four Corners or Top of the Hill or Sutton's (for lunch) for a quintessential Chapel Hill experience.

"For campus: the basketball museum at the Dean dome is a fun little stop if you're into college basketball and some history, but they've got weird hours so make sure you look it up first. The museum is a pretty long walk from campus proper. The best way to tour campus, imo, would be to park in the southern area on Manning Drive or Ridge Road. If you parked on Manning, head east till you get to the dorm buildings and some academic office buildings called SASB. The southern road at this intersection goes down to the basketball arena and a student rec center (volleyball and basketball courts, there's also a pool), and the northern walk through SASB will lead up to the student walking areas where first year students are going to end up spending lots of time. This walking path will take you by the Morrison dorm into Ram's Plaza. This is the area with south campus' gym and dining hall, just south of the football stadium. If you choose to park on ridge road, you can just take an elevator or the stairs up to Ram's Plaza. Keep following the brick path north and you'll pass the football stadium and wind up on Stadium drive - welcome to mid campus. At the top of stadium is UNC's belltower which shows up in brochures and stuff all the time. If the belltower isn't your style, just cut straight across Stadium and keep following the brick walks. These either go around another student gym/pool complex (and the soccer stadium), or just keep you shaded up to South Street. South St is a major dividing line for campus. South of south (just walked that) is mostly gyms and rec centers, north of South St is the bulk of the academic buildings. You can enter the student stores or the student union from South Street and that's a good way of going here (student stores is a decent place to pick up some t shirts or a coffee mug or something). Take the steps up or ride an elevator/escalator and you'll be at the Pit. This is a huge area for campus life and there's an old saying that if you sat in the Pit all day, you'd see every single student at UNC walk through at least once. The school's largest library is on the northeast corner, and the northwest corner enters onto the main undergrad academic quads. Spend some time walking through the quad generally heading north and you'll come to Cameron Avenue. Cameron has UNC's Old Well (good photo opp) and another quad. Tucked away in the far eastern edge of Cameron is the Arboretum, and I'd definitely recommend walking around there for a little while - very peaceful. Head north from the Old Well through the last quad and you're on Franklin Street. Congrats, you just walked through the central bulk of UNC's campus onto the main recreational center of chapel hill. Franklin's got tons of bars and restaurants and shops to check out. From the campus entry zone, you're pretty much at the far eastern bit of Franklin and almost everything you'd want to see from here is to the West of you. Walk around to your heart's content, then grab a free bus back down South to your car.",t2_6ebq1,theluckyirishmn,0,1645832273.0,0,t1_hyg4vw9,hyg4vw9,True,hairycane01,t3_t1c0lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/chapelhill/comments/t1c0lj/visiting_campus/,Visiting Campus,/r/chapelhill/comments/t1c0lj/visiting_campus/hyg4vw9/,3,r/chapelhill,0,3

Yeah my ‚Ä¶. Initial reaction is this seems very NIMBY. The website talks about storm water than instantly reverts to traffic argument which is always used to stop all developments.

"Those thinking about supporting this opposition to high-density development should think long and hard about it - it's no clear cut issue. Especially if you're a renter in the area thinking about buying a home here someday. Protecting and conserving the environment are good things but so are affordable housing prices. As everyone knows, the triangle is a growing area which means many more people are coming here, and these people want places to live so if new housing isn't developed, prices will rise as people compete for the available housing. High density housing would allow for housing availability to match the growing population. 

Of course, it may be the case that you think the environmental cost exceeds the benefit of the impact on housing prices in this specific scenario, but that's no clear-cut or obvious thing. On the balance it seems to me like the importance of tempering housing prices exceeds that of the environmental concerns but I don't know about this particular case.",t2_if05w0it,talonmarks_,1,1645400854.0,0,t1_hxrmouq,hxrmouq,True,[deleted],t3_sxcd0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/chapelhill/comments/sxcd0k/help_save_the_eno_river/,Help Save the Eno River,/r/chapelhill/comments/sxcd0k/help_save_the_eno_river/hxrmouq/,8,r/chapelhill,0,8

"Second post about this here recently, but I'm glad to rehash. Arrow is having staffing issues for multiple reasons, in my opinion.

1) Covid and working in close proximity to customers is iffy in the best of times. I'm sure some staff members were uncomfortable with that and elected to seek employment outside of the hair industry in something that may have given them less exposure in a pandemic.

2) The pace is pretty grueling. While it is not Great Clips, the demand are just a below it. They have some pretty tight schedules with how many heads they have to cut a day. This probably also makes it tough to recruit people, especially in a tight labor market.

3) I understand in the last year Arrow as a company made a change to require stylists to sign a non-compete clause, both new and currently employed staff. It is not just for your salon but for all Arrow salons, which can leave a stylist with few options when your company operates salons all over the Triangle and even in Charlotte. If you left you would be unable to work in these markets for two years, I believe. I understand a couple of stylists left Arrow due to this, and it probably is a cause for concern when hiring.

4) Arrow had been using staff from other locations to help cover Chapel Hill. I think rather than stringing the current staff even thinner by keeping this location open, they decided to focus on the other locations until staffing improves.

As I said in the previous post, at the end of the day a ""free"" beer with my haircut could not keep me going in good conscience. I got some very nice haircuts when I was there and I really liked the stylists that I worked with, but I couldn't support the owners who would treat staff like that.

Contrary to what we were told, several of the stylists have struck out on their own. You can look online for them if you know their name.

Avoid that & anything with Joel Duval‚Äôs (owner of A2Z) name on it. But yeah, I relied heavily on chapelhillrent.com during my years living outside the dorms

Edit: forgot some stuff & clearly I‚Äôm not over my experience with A2Z that was 7ish years ago.
After signing the lease I was told about an HOA & given their rules. I had an indoor/outdoor cat, which they knew about, had to be accompanied while outside per the HOA rules. Would have never signed the lease if I had known about that bc the cat loved to spend at least half his time wondering around or laying in the sun outdoors. Also turned out that the HOA rules they gave us were not up to date. All animals outside were required to be leashed. Leash training him was not easy & he was super unhappy about limited outside time. Oooh, and there was the mold. Twice there were cases of black mold. They sent someone over to do something about the spots but never checked for greater issues. Same cat developed allergies to the point that he had scabs & had scratched off nearly all the fur on his belly. It took 3 regular vet trips & 2 specialist visits to solve the problem with meds that were about $200 a month. Once I moved his allergies suddenly I went away. Then there was the general attitude about repair requests. Once the ac unit got ice on it. Instead of being receptive to hearing the problem & offering a solution I received an accusatory response. The woman in the office (same woman who blamed me for them not having the place ready in time because  I should cover the power bill when the lease hasn‚Äôt even started) told me that if the repairman felt that the air filters hadn‚Äôt been replaced in a timely manner, I would be paying the repair bill. I was never sent a bill. It wasn‚Äôt my fault but she wanted to scare me out of asking for a repair. Also, they tried to not return any of the deposit after I left the house in better shape than it was when I moved in - I actually cleaned",t2_fvtj7pb2,Temporary-Double-809,0,1644465598.0,0,t1_hwbnc4r,hwbnc4r,False,abracapickle,t3_soohq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/chapelhill/comments/soohq5/best_ch_rental_companies_or_websites/,Best CH Rental companies or websites,/r/chapelhill/comments/soohq5/best_ch_rental_companies_or_websites/hwbnc4r/,2,r/chapelhill,0,2

"I have no connection to Chapel Hill from college or anything, I only live here because my partner is in grad school here. It's a pleasant place to live and all, but not very stimulating and if you're not connected to the university in some way, there's not much going on. I would suggest checking out Durham, which has more of a city feel with most of the pleasant-ness of Chapel Hill.

To mirror what u/emmolatesaid, I'm 29 and live amongst spoiled adult-children (I live right off Columbia in northside). Lots of shrieking girls and frat boys driving their BMWs at 35mph down our street (with no sidewalks for pedestrians). Luckily there are a few ""normal"" people on my block but I feel like that's an anomaly.

Carrboro area is way chiller but very expensive. I would look around there if you'd like to be in the area. if you're into cycling/hiking, it's a great area for that with lots of great routes close by, and the carolina north forest. food is pretty whatever IMO.

"Hey, I live in Meadowmont, moved directly from the ghetto a few years ago so a bit of a transition. It's basically just a rich suburb, and all the stereotypes that go along with it. It reminds me of the show ""weeds"" if you're familiar, and if not just look up the intro and that about gets the vibe across. Everyone seems to care about all the superficial things you'd expect like siding, lawns, nice cars, etc... so not much unique to the area. I don't know any of my neighbors, but that's probably just because I'm pretty out of place here being single, childless, and pretty young. I really like that it's nice and quiet, everything needed is in walking distance(I didn't drive for over a year after moving here), and it is very safe. I'm probably the biggest degenerate that lives here if I had to guess. If that appeals to you, can afford it, and can stand the ""rich asshole"" vibe of the place(seriously does everyone and their kid need a porsche), then yeah I recommend it.

Chapel Hill is very much a quintessential college town. The downtown turns Carolina blue when there's a home football or basketball game.

"retaining an attorney simply means hiring them for their services. my comment was meant to point out that your verbiage is false because whether you put a chunk of money in a client trust account that is billed by the hour & expected to be refilled or if you agree to a flat rate fee that's paid in advance or when the work is done, you're still signing a retainer. 

as an attorney, i can tell you that MANY people walk into an attorney's office expecting free legal advice and free legal services over the span of an hour or two. since time is money for lawyers, going into any potential lawyer-client consult with the attitude of ""i'm not signing a retainer"" you're going to immediately turn people off because you will come off wrong and your comment will read like you are about to waste their time. 

if you don't want a long-term engagement, you can say that BUT i encourage you to go into your attorney consult with an open mind. 1) because the professional will be able to tell you what you need (if you already know what you need, why seek a lawyer?) and 2) you may find that what you think takes an hour or two, may take ten. no accusations or name-calling was done on my part, I was simply asking why you would think you don't need to retain a lawyer.  as per my example, I wouldn't go to a mechanic, ask them to listen to a sound my car is making and then say 'welp, i'm not going to hire you to get it fixed, just wanted your opinion'. maybe that will make the example clearer.

Just saying that it's way more constructive to explain whatever payment structure you're thinking of than publicly accusing somebody of being cheap and entitled enough to look for free labor, without clear basis.

"I went to college in Austin and now live in CH. CH and especially Carrboro reminds me of how Austin used to be. 

As for neighborhoods, I would suggest looking at the neighborhoods across from Southern Village off Culbreth rd. Bigger lots and still walkable to the trails and shops in SV. Also Morgan Creek trail and Merritts Pasture are nice places to walk or run. 

Both the Oaks and Meadowmont are split between CH and Durham schools so if you want CH then just be aware. I'm not exactly sure where the cutoff is. We looked at the Oaks, it's a lovely neighborhood.

"Thanks for your reply. Im curious what parts of Chapel hill you‚Äôd recommend? The particular house we are considering is walkable to the pool and Rashkis elementary, we like walkability and some sort of neighborhood standard; we live in an eclectic neighborhood now and think we‚Äôd prefer a more organized feel (sidewalks, tree, maintained parks). We have one toddler and another baby on the way so school is important. I don‚Äôt want private school and I read the charter lottery is just that a lottery. So we liked the CCH District. We like those house on Pinehurst, the lots seem bigger. Unfortunately no inventory available. There‚Äôs one foreclosure under contract that we may try to buy if the existing contract falls through. My wife and I are both remote employees so a commute is not an issue. And for the most part in our fields the trend seems to lean remote with new hires so a commute isn‚Äôt a major factor. We do worry about the lack of access to performance arts, and realize Durham would be the closest option.

"I work in tech here and relocated here (Chapel Hill) about two years ago. CH is great as it‚Äôs truly a university town. Lots of local activities, great schools, college sports, and good restaurants for a somewhat small town (70k ish people last time I checked). It‚Äôs also nice to have Durham just about 15-20 min from Chapel Hill. It offers more restaurants/breweries/cideries, performing arts at DPAC, one of the most famous minor league teams (Durham Bulls). Durham is really becoming a popular spot for people in their 20s because of all of these amenities. Downsides to living in Chapel Hill are if you ever have to work in downtown Raleigh (Red Hat, IBM, etc), expect to spend 45 min to an hour each way, but you may be used to that already being in Austin. Another downside is that it is expensive compared to some parts of the triangle, but Durham is catching up for some of the trendier areas.

In regard to Meadowmont, it is one of the top, most expensive areas to live for families. There are other areas in CH that are very nice and cost less, but are not THAT neighborhood.

I personally am in a clinical trial for a mini copper IUD so I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have extra pain measures during insertion (def wish I could have) due to trial parameters but one thing that helped me get through insertion was thinking about how temporary the pain is. Essentially acknowledging that it‚Äôs going to hurt, but that it will hurt for a little while. I fully support you looking for a practice that will take your pain and anxiety seriously and I wish more places would do this.

"Hi All, thank you very much for your help, very much appreciated. Where I come from Indiana (now), grew up in small town Ohio the weddings were ""cafeteria style"" with farmer type recipes and helpings. Meaning you walked up to a line of say 8\~10 tables each being 10 feet long. The roaters are piping hot and the guests walked up went through the double line and piled their plates. It was traditional food...roaters of fried chicken/beef chunks, mashed totoes, salad or hot veggie, other fixings and then wedding cake. There was a kitchen in the wedding hall and the bride/groom (parents) hired the cooks but it was mass production. Yes very delicious. I have also been to the sit down and they serve you a plate wedding dinner (no lines). Anyway my daughter is very flexible, she will do what that area of country does and hire as she likes whether thats a) cafeteria style or b) sit down and be served more formal style. She will want to be resonable but make sure the guests are happy. Liquor and drinks is another item to tackle, lol. That said she will also:

1) honor dietary restrictions

2) it is an inside event

3) more casual, my daughter can be fancy but she is not fancy

4) choice of two meats, and from there traditional like a potato, hot veggie, salad, and desert cake prolly

5) budget...yea thats a good question. my son in 2015 was around 6 \~ 8$ per plate, cafeteria style, BUT that is small town usa in Ohio where we hired a cater, they made the food at the hall and there were some help from my son/wife's close friends bringing roaters out for hungry guests and it turned out great.

6) the meal will be 6pm dinner

This is traditional Midwestern style foodies and I would not know what Durham/Chapel Hill NC would be at a wedding...heard they have great BBQ, again these people coming from Midwest for my daughters wedding would ABSOLUTELY LOVE having NC quisine it would be great!

"1. Tell your friend to stop driving the car all over if it doesn't shift properly. 2. If your friend hasn't done so already, they need to contact the shop regarding the mess-up. They can't fix it if they don't know there is a problem. Technicians are human and, while not ideal, do make mistakes from time to time. However, most greatly appreciate the opportunity to fix their fuckups. 

I don't know of a single dealership that would tell your friend to pound sand to check out a problem that may have started after a service visit. If nothing else, they will bring the car back in and re-check their work at no charge. If they caused the problem, they will fix it no charge. There might be one or two shops that will, but 99.999% of shops out there will NOT fix whatever the problem is for free and will charge whatever it costs to diagnose and fix the issue caused by someone else. Also, if someone else besides the shop that may have caused the problem attempts to fix the issue and fails, it may absolve the original shop from having to take financial responsibility.

"I went to UNC for undergrad and grad school from 2004 to 2011 and I recently moved back to Chapel Hill to settle down. UNC and Chapel Hill over lap a lot due to most residents being associated with the university as students, faculty/staff or medical professionals. I‚Äôm an outlier as I work in Durham but chose to buy in CH. Your home-buying dollar goes a tiny bit farther in Durham but CH has better schools and is a safer city over all. Great food and drink options in town with even better options nearby in Durham and Raleigh (there‚Äôs a big foodie community here). Definitely bring a car because you‚Äôll want to visit more of North Carolina while you‚Äôre here. The mountains and the beaches are great, we have decent wineries/breweries in NC and RDU airport is close by for easy flights home when needed.

"I am a born n bred Tar Heel, but I did live in LA for a little while and still have friends there. Life is sooooo much easier here to me. People are very friendly and very smart. The towns of Chapel Hill and next door Carrboro are very progressive, can be a little expensive compared to rural areas, but it's very cheap for housing compared to CA. It's very pleasantly green and pretty. Not drop dead gorgeous like Yosemite or Big Sur, but very nice and chill. It does get very hot and humid in the summer and warmer months. And it gets chilly in the winter (supposed to snow tonight), but overall it's a somewhat moderate climate.

UNC is a good school but has its share of issues, too. I think it's definitely worth a visit if you can swing it. Come in late March or April if you want to see spring.

"Just putting this out there:
While CCNA is a worthwhile option and will be required for some roles, times are changing in IT and everything is going cloud-first and some companies are prioritizing remote options. 
To that end I'd encourage you to look into certifications in Google Workspace, Okta, O365, JAMF, and other similar cloud-based IT vendors. Those are the platforms that you can dive into, first from a frontline-support level and work your way up to a SysAdmin and beyond. There will always be a need for these systems in small companies and massive corporate environments. 
There are some great IT Slack groups that you can join as well made up of friendly, helpful IT folks, and always have job posting added:

"Hummm if you like Asian origin loose leaf, tenfu has a great site to browse through. For my European teas I do Harley and sons. 

Yes you do lose out on the ability to get smaller amounts and buy local, but it‚Äôs much cheaper. Also the issue is that tea ages and will oxidize when exposed to air. So in a shop that‚Äôs not keeping things airtight, always be wary of it going bad. This is why flavored teas are always pushed, the scents are heavy and doesn‚Äôt degrade as quickly as the natural tea flavors.

"I know people who have had extraordinary pain relief and other benefits from Kratom, including several people who have been able to refrain from using harder drugs (prescription and street opioids) because of Kratom. 

There‚Äôs a ‚Äúdownside‚Äù to everything- but this is a plant that can give people a lot of relief in a much safer way than many other ‚Äúdrugs.‚Äù I can tell you that as an ER doc I‚Äôve seen countless overdoses and deaths from opioids. Hundreds. I have seen tons of people come in with side-effects from other drugs. 

I have never, in 15 years of being in medicine (starting when I was an 18yo EMT, through med school, residency, and now) ever seen someone come into the hospital with complications from Kratom. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs for everyone or that it has no side effects or safety concerns, but to me it is extremely important that something like this stays available to people. 

Our government has demonized SO many helpful plants- from marijuana to psychoactive plants and mushrooms, and Kratom remains one of the few plants that can help people, immensely, and is legal and available in most states. It would be a shame to see a campaign that took this away from people. 

If you want to hear horror stories of Kratom, I suggest you visit the r/QuittingKratom subreddit. You‚Äôll find people there who will tell you all about how bad it is. 

At the same time I hope you show a balanced perspective for people whose lives this has saved. I‚Äôm not an addiction medicine specialist, but because substance use is such a large part of what I see and deal with in the ER setting, I spend a lot of time talking to people who use and work with social workers and addiction specialist to help people find programming and medications that can help them recover. I‚Äôve tried to educate myself about Kratom because I have seen how it can help people. Getting medicine like suboxone and other opioid replacement therapies has incredible outcomes, the problem is that it can be very very difficult for some people to get into these programs, find doctors who are licensed to prescribe them (there are limits to the number of patients a single doctor can oversee, so there are long waiting lists), and for some more transient people, staying in these programs can be really difficult. Kratom is an alternative, one that is much much safer and easier to access.  

I hope you‚Äôll present a balanced perspective. Like any substance, it can be misused and cause harm. But right now we are in a deep crisis with substance use in this country and I really believe more studies should be done to look at plants like Kratom to see how they might be able to help people. Especially people with opioid use disorders or chronic pain, although I also know of people who use it to deal with symptoms of PTSD and anxiety and they‚Äôve had great, safe relief from this. I‚Äôve even heard some people saying it helps them avoid cravings for alcohol. 

It deserves to be studied properly, but there is a lot of stigma around it. 

There‚Äôs a few places that sell Kratom in the triangle area you should maybe connect with to see if you can find people willing to talk to you. There‚Äôs Kibou Botanicals in Durham and there‚Äôs a cafe in Carrboro called Oasis that sell Kratom- the people at both of those places are very knowledgeable about their products and have a lot of people who come in asking questions or sharing their stories. If you really want a human story, talk to them. I think the elderly gentleman at Oasis suffers from several painful disabilities, and he is a huge advocate for Kratom. One of my patients said he even gives him a discount sometimes because he‚Äôs in recovery from years of heroin use and Kratom is the one thing that has helped him refrain from using for the last year. 

Good luck. Please take the time to talk to people whom this plant has helped- their stories are important too. It will make for a much more balanced piece besides ‚ÄúDrugs are bad and will ruin your life.‚Äù",t2_5t5hgskb,Wi_believeIcan_Fi,0,1642370884.0,0,t1_hsygn9f,hsygn9f,True,GladArgument7249,t3_s5llym,https://www.reddit.com/r/chapelhill/comments/s5llym/article_about_kratom_use_in_nc/,article about kratom use in NC,/r/chapelhill/comments/s5llym/article_about_kratom_use_in_nc/hsygn9f/,21,r/chapelhill,0,21

Some places to consider: Northgate Park neighborhood in Durham is quiet and green and close to the Museum of Life and Science; Carrboro is very liberal and a bit funky, has Weaver Street Market as a gathering place and several cafes and breweries; Hillsborough has a lot of lovely homes and cute restaurants plus great BBQ; Pittsboro is sweet and growing.

"Congratulations on being ready! There are many organizations around like Saving Grace, Hope Animal Rescue, and Orange County / Durham both have them. 

As someone who has helped many people start off their journey with their dog on the right foot - My biggest pieces of advice are :

* Rescue a dog 1+. Puppies will ALWAYS get picked up by someone. It sounds like you work in person (as you‚Äôre requesting time off), and you‚Äôre going to need to take a lot more than a couple of weeks off. Young Puppies (7 months and under) are a goddamn handful. 

* The money you will spend on replacing things they chew, cleaning carpets / kennels / clothes, cost of initial vet appointments and vaccines, additional trips to the vet because they ate something or have something wrong, and accessories (like collars) as they grow will be significant. Take that money and put it towards a 1+ year old dog‚Äôs training, that a puppy should still go through in the future too. 

* Decide the what energy level you can handle. With puppy mixed breeds, you‚Äôll never know how they will turn out. The calm puppy could be a crack head in 2 months. The hyper puppy could be calm after the first 6 months. The cuddly puppy may end up hating cuddling. With a young or adult dog you know these personality traits. 

* Reserve $1,500 for training. Yes this sounds ridiculous, but even the most friendly dog can become reactive or have issues after one bad interaction with another dog. My husky mix was attacked a few times in the matter of 2 months (dog park, day care, and while walking), and he started to become reactive around any dog. I brought him to a 3-week board & train + Offleash training ($1,600) and he‚Äôs been an amazing dog ever since. Honestly, I still recommend working with a professional trainer no matter what. Without the reactivity side of things you can expect to pay $700-1,200 for PROPER training. 

* Pet insurance - Get it, you won‚Äôt regret it. One bad instance in the matter of 5 years will pay for itself. My dog ended up having a lung infection, spread to the other, and then getting pneumonia. After 3 vet visits trying to treat the initial issue, and then 8 days in the emergency vet with a lobectomy surgery, I racked up $14,000 in bills. I ended up paying ~$3,000. 

* Finally, fuck rawhides. They are bleached cow skin and are dangerous for dogs. Don‚Äôt get ‚Äòem. 

Best of luck, and I have a list of ‚ÄúWelcome Home Doggie‚Äù items people don‚Äôt often think about if you want to PM me! Also have a list of the Triangle‚Äôs top force free trainers (from NC State‚Äôs Animal Behavioral Department).",t2_96uj9,Itsdawsontime,0,1642034894.0,0,t1_hsfard0,hsfard0,True,lollydaggle,t3_s2coh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/chapelhill/comments/s2coh2/how_to_adopt_a_dog_in_the_area/,How to adopt a dog in the area?,/r/chapelhill/comments/s2coh2/how_to_adopt_a_dog_in_the_area/hsfard0/,1,r/chapelhill,0,1

"Yay, so glad you‚Äôre choosing to adopt! First things first. Figure out what age dog you want. A puppy is going to take a LOT of time commitment - I‚Äôm in the midst of raising one at the moment. A senior dog is may not live as long but will certainly appreciate a warm bed the rest of its life. A lot of adoptable dogs are between 1 and 5. These are great options as well but may need some training due to previous bad experiences or poor training (look up positive reinforcement and start reading :)). 
I would recommend AGAINST saving grace as an option. There is no opportunity to get to know a dog before making the commitment - esp with regard to puppies. Plus the pups are spayed or neutered the day before their put out for adoption (far too young based on vet recommendations) and thus are drugged when you meet them. It‚Äôs really hard to figure out their personality based on that!
I HIGHLY recommend going to a foster based rescue such as Pawfect Match or Freedom Ride. These rescues know the dogs and carefully vet future owners to make sure they‚Äôre compatible. Also HIGHLY recommend fostering first to get a sense of what living with a dog is like!

"Hello! Seconding the opinions of those who had issues with Chapel Hill schools. I attended before COVID and many of the turnover and cultural issues seem to have gotten worse since then. Frankly, the state needs to do a better job funding education, so I don't always blame teachers/admin. My elementary school experience was ""meh,"" middle school fantastic, and high school pretty dreadful, so it's a mixed bag. 

I transferred to a Durham early college program halfway through high school because of a stressful HS culture and poor quality instruction. Got to finish my last two years taking Durham Tech (community college) classes and didn't regret it for a second. However, I know some of my friends coming from Durham and Hillsborough schools felt less prepared for college-level work, whereas I felt the workload was much more manageable than at Chapel Hill high schools. 

Wake County schools are messy what with the lotteries, assignment systems, etc, but my cousin likes her school thus far. If my family had to do it all over again, we'd probably still buy a house in Chapel Hill for the sake of my middle school experience alone, but not sure how it's going there now considering the vast majority of my teachers have left.

"I graduated from East Chapel Hill and there was a lot of pressure (from peers and teachers) to take AP classes and you were definitely in the minority if you didn't.

It really helped that none of that pressure came from my parents. They cared that I was doing well in my classes (aka not failing) but they never pressured me to take more AP classes. 

It always baffled me that their was so much pressure to take AP classes and then it was just expected that you could afford all the fees to pay for the tests at the end of the year.

"From what I've read, we don't know exactly why it works. Per [this article] (https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/01/no-omicron-immunity-without-booster-study-finds/) ""It‚Äôs not yet clear why an mRNA booster dramatically improves immune protection against Omicron, but Garcia-Beltran says one possibility is that an additional dose creates antibodies that bind more tightly to the spike protein, increasing their effectiveness. Also, a booster dose may generate antibodies that target regions of the spike protein that are common to all forms of SARS-CoV-2.""

To me, that and other studies and expert opinions seem to suggest that we should have a 3 dose regimen, and the CDC has already made that the recommendation for immunocompromised people. And they've approved those folks for a 4th dose already, so there must be data that shows that to be beneficial, I haven't looked for that yet. I think it's the variants that might make this into an annual shot, at least for a while.",t2_m5ybe,lushanthem,0,1641825993.0,0,t1_hs2gcm6,hs2gcm6,False,Early_Map_5409,t3_s09gr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/chapelhill/comments/s09gr7/leaked_unc_epidemiologists_project_4673_of_unc/,Leaked: UNC Epidemiologists Project 46-73% of UNC Students Will Be Infected in Next 30 Days,/r/chapelhill/comments/s09gr7/leaked_unc_epidemiologists_project_4673_of_unc/hs2gcm6/,5,r/chapelhill,0,5

"If you like Chapel Hill Chatham County, and your kids are already in school, then you may just want to stay there. The concerns we've had with CHCCS are numerous. We have children in 2 different schools, so these issues aren't unique to just one school:  
1) Staff retention. Both of our kids spent months without teachers in core subjects. My son had a French class for which he is supposed to receive HS credit, and for months they watched movies and surfed the internet. This happened because the French teacher quit just days before the school year started. The middle school principal also was removed midyear, and you may have heard about the instability at East Chapel Hill high school and its principal.  
2) Teacher experience. All the teachers we've met are spirited and kind, but many are inexperienced. As in 2-4 years experience. This is in stark contrast to NYC where most teachers were seasoned and had been at the same school for many years.  
3) Curriculum. CHCCS doesn't invest adequately in curriculum development. Our kids' lessons seem to be cobbled from handed-down worksheets and random internet sites. CHCCS doesn't invest in evidence-based programs and educational software. There is little continuity from year to year. This is odd for a district that receives extra tax revenue compared to neighboring districts. Where is the money going?   
4) Communication is poor. We are still on the email lists for our prior school in NYC, and we receive far more correspondence from that school principal and PTA organization than we do from CHCCS. Most of the correspondence we receive from CHCCS is from the superintendent rather than the principal/assistant principal.  The superintendent communication is more inspirational than practical. Our son has an IEP, and the combination of turnover in the special ed dept and turnover in staff has been laughable. Thankfully, NYC showered us with effective services from birth to age 10, so he is in a good state now and not really in need of the services anymore.  
5) Safety issues. I don't have a lot of faith that the schools are well equipped to deal with the increasing threat of school violence, primarily because of the above noted communication issues. Drop off and pick up is chaos. This is partly due to the layout of the schools and how they have been incorporated into the city design. At our middle school, signage is poor, crosswalks are faded and poorly marked, the crossing guard is overwhelmed. There is a paved path from the school that leads to the street out of the forest that kids race across without any supervision. Recently two children were struck near the school, and one remains in the hospital in critical condition. The ability for the district to coordinate with the city to ensure student safety overall seems poor. Can they not think to put down speed bumps, or add flashing lights to the crosswalk like they do on some intersections near the UNC campus?  


I should note though that we do like Chapel Hill, our kids have been quick to make friends, and this is a welcoming place to live. The school district is not bad, but it definitely does not deserve much of the hype that it receives. Those high SAT scores are due to a highly educated and mostly wealthy population and would exist no matter where these kids went to school. In fact, one could argue, and I've heard this argument here many times, that if your children are not super high achieving, and yet your family does have means and sets high standards, you may be better in the Durham school district, because when applying to college your kid won't be labeled as just another smart, privileged kid from Chapel Hill.",t2_43ojl5o,Globetrotter767,0,1641666174.0,0,t1_hrt1375,hrt1375,False,NuggKeeper,t3_rxuxol,https://www.reddit.com/r/chapelhill/comments/rxuxol/talk_to_me_about_schools/,Talk to me about schools,/r/chapelhill/comments/rxuxol/talk_to_me_about_schools/hrt1375/,2,r/chapelhill,0,2
