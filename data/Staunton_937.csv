"It’s quaint and was relatively affordable but quickly becomes stifling. Everything unique that there is to do or see can be accomplished in a brief visit. 

The difficulty occurs when people marvel at the quaint charm of downtown Staunton without comprehending how deeply entrenched white Christian conservatism is here. Power and wealth are held by a handful of old Southern families who attend the same schools, go to the same churches, and assure that jobs in local government and administration go to their cousins or frat brothers. 

The American Shakespeare Center is struggling to survive while the city spends $200,000 on golf carts for a select few mostly white men to use in a public park. 

The weather is nice most of the time, there is access to entertainment in other cities if you don’t mind spending 45 minutes+ each way dodging trucks on the 81, and people are generally polite. 

Augusta Health is nearby and offers some level of access to medical care, though anyone who has options is more likely to be seen by specialists or have procedures done in Charlottesville.

It’s difficult to assess what may be best for others, but I would tend to see Staunton as a good fit for affluent and active retirees until such a time as they need to move into assisted living.",t2_51jtsewo,WhatFreshHello,0,1646419970.0,0,t1_hzcm6ah,hzcm6ah,False,Sarcasm_and_Finesse,t3_sfug9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staunton/comments/sfug9w/convince_me_not_to_move_to_staunton/,Convince me not to move to Staunton,/r/Staunton/comments/sfug9w/convince_me_not_to_move_to_staunton/hzcm6ah/,3,r/Staunton,0,3

"There are some excellent teachers in every school, I absolutely agree. There are also plenty of ultra-conservative bible-thumping nepotism hires that make life miserable for kids who don’t fit the white Christian athlete/cheerleader mold.

In any case, the issues are top-down and systemic. There are incompetent, useless, and bullying administrators at every level. Instructional coaches and facilitators do zero teaching while $12/hr. instructional assistants are pulled from their critical roles to sub for classes they’re not qualified to teach. 

None of this began with the pandemic; the lone middle school hasn’t been fully accredited by the state for several years. The shiny new high school is a distraction from the violent assaults, drug dealing, and sex acts occurring at school and on buses.

"Grew up in Staunton, and living in Herndon now, but my folks are still there so I get back once a month.

First thing, your quality of schools will drop dramatically. I went to Staunton City schools, and while it has plenty of opportunities compared to the county schools, it will be a huge step back from even the dumpy districts in Loudoun/Fairfax.

Next big thing, ask yourself what grocery store you go to, that’ll be another thing to prepare to take a step back on. There’s no Whole Foods, no wegmans. Krogers ain’t bad, and Martins is in Nova as Giant, but your variety of items available will be lower.

While Staunton occasionally votes blue now in large elections, it’s still in a fairly conservative area. People are generally respectful of others’ views, but just be mindful of that if you want a progressive place to live. As others have stated, you might be better off in Hburg of Cville thanks to the universities skewing those communities further left, if you need folks around you to share your political sensibilities. 

Others have hit some of the additional highlights, you’re 30 minutes at least from any decent shopping, and events don’t often come around this way like they do in the DMV. There’s not quite the same abundance of diversity and cultural exposure as you get in Nova, but instead of access to stuff like Korean or Indian festivals and events you’re closer to the maple sugar festival out in Monterey, so culture is what you’ll make of it.

Staunton was an awesome place to grow up and I love it, but from what you’ve described about your situation y’all might be better off looking at Richmond and its burbs, Charlottesville, and Williamsburg if you want a good spot in VA that’s a nice move away from the idiocy of Nova.",t2_9sgg7,Appalachian_Murican,0,1643513901.0,0,t1_hut2zno,hut2zno,True,Sarcasm_and_Finesse,t3_sfug9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staunton/comments/sfug9w/convince_me_not_to_move_to_staunton/,Convince me not to move to Staunton,/r/Staunton/comments/sfug9w/convince_me_not_to_move_to_staunton/hut2zno/,6,r/Staunton,0,6

"I hate the inconvenience for some things - some may be fine with what’s here and ordering online for what’s not, but sometimes I just need or want something now that’s at Best Buy or a fabric store or something and it’s 35 minutes and 30 miles away. And sometimes they’re that far away and in opposite directions, so I can’t just go and get both (neither Charlottesville or Harrisonburg have everything). Another example, Apple store - over 1.5 hours away. 

Culturally, Staunton can be very different from the county that surrounds it, but there are still some things that get weird. I’ll put a couple of examples…

We moved to Staunton in the midst of the naming battle related to the local high school. There was one side fighting to ditch Robert E Lee HS (which had not even been it’s name throughout its history) and another fighting to keep it. Some businesses even put out signs. They started with “Save the Name,” then people made “But the Name Hurts,” then there were “Jesus Heals All Hurts” signs. These were all over town with lots of graffitied signs in the mix too. Ultimately “the name hurts” side won, because the school board got to decide. I guess it depends on your views how you take it, but it was bizarre to me to see how many people were so wrapped up in the old name and how many still bring it up.

Another thing to happen not long after we moved there - KKK recruitment fliers were left on cars downtown. 

Overall, I wish Staunton were thirty miles from a larger city instead of thirty miles each from two cities that are only slightly bigger. Entertainment options are more limited - mostly the outdoors, food and breweries/wineries/etc. I see posts often complaining that there is not enough for kids and teenagers.",t2_16aq8y,melonball311,0,1643499879.0,0,t1_hus7zbt,hus7zbt,True,Sarcasm_and_Finesse,t3_sfug9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staunton/comments/sfug9w/convince_me_not_to_move_to_staunton/,Convince me not to move to Staunton,/r/Staunton/comments/sfug9w/convince_me_not_to_move_to_staunton/hus7zbt/,14,r/Staunton,0,14

> I'm coming down on the side of this being an unsafe method of handing out candy.  Anything that encourages bystanders to approach moving vehicles, regardless of how slowly they're traveling, is undesirable.

"STAUNTON — An Oklahoma traffic stop led local authorities to search a Staunton home, where more than 30 guns were collected along with two bags of cash, according to a Dec. 15 search warrant filed in Staunton Circuit Court.

The search was prompted after the Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma recently initiated a traffic stop involving a Staunton man found to be traveling with $73,000 in cash, a pistol with a suppressor and two ounces of marijuana.

Sequoyah County is on Oklahoma's eastern border next to Arkansas.

The Staunton man told investigators he was headed to California ""to purchase a parcel of land to in turn sell to a local marijuana grower,"" according to an affidavit to the search warrant.

While under questioning, the man was speaking to a woman on a speaker phone and reportedly told her there was enough money in his safe to post bail if he were arrested. He also told the woman to speak with another man and have him send him another $70,000 once he was released, the affidavit said.

It does not appear that Oklahoma authorities arrested the Staunton man.

The traffic stop out west led local police to obtain a search warrant in an effort to have the man's Hudson Avenue home in Staunton probed. Numerous guns — eight rifles, two shotguns, one revolver and 24 pistols — were found in the residence, the search warrant said.

Police also recovered two bags of cash, suspected marijuana, a jar with white powder, mushrooms, and ammunition along with the 35 guns.

Local charges have not been filed against the man, according to an online court search.",t2_81pt41bq,BackInVA,0,1640102117.0,0,t1_hpfq21f,hpfq21f,True,BackInVA,t3_rlhkgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staunton/comments/rlhkgd/staunton_mans_home_raided_by_police_money_and/,"Staunton man's home raided by police, money and possessions seized with no charges filed",/r/Staunton/comments/rlhkgd/staunton_mans_home_raided_by_police_money_and/hpfq21f/,13,r/Staunton,0,13

"The most innocuous thing I can think of is that someone at some point found a Confederate breastplate during construction in the area. Why the marker would be labeled as a museum, I’m not sure.

Here’s an overview of Staunton during the Civil War: 
https://www.virginiarelics.com/information/staunton-va/

Or it may be that the decorative metal roofing on the building in the bottom right resembles a breastplate, though it seems these were mostly used by Union soldiers:

https://acwm.org/blog/artifact-month-armor-breastplate-tassets/

It seems these small medallions are what was more commonly referred to as a breastplate at the time:

https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/81680812_civil-war-confederate-virginia-breast-plate-buckle

I checked the local newspaper archives and came up empty-handed when searching for “breastplate of the Confederate” or variations thereof, so it was never an actual building or location. 

As anyone can drop a pin on Google Maps, it may be an anecdotal reference or someone’s awful notion of creating Confederate museum in Staunton.

"In a thousand words, you explained that the people chanting “hang Mike Pence” - and trying to fight anything that helps the disadvantaged in favor of the fallacy of a free market - are not related to white supremacy as whole. Yet the Republican party is home to it, and Trump refusing to ever disavow them made that reality unavoidable. We charged the people involved in the insurrection, now let’s charge those who incited and defended it. You yourself say that these people were stupid, I’d say they all perfectly embody the racist, capitalist, nationalist ideals that keep us from progressing. Change is painful, I get that, but fascist fear is not acceptable. I know my history, I know my economics. Semantics don’t matter when it’s this obviously hate inspired, to the extent that they want to hurt the liberals in Congress (and Pence) just because they continue the democratic process for the sake of our country.

These aren’t dumb, in the moment BLM rioters. This was a planned coup attempt supported by the President and we should treat it like that. Trump knew it was because the FBI was in their Discord, in their forums. It just feels like the insurrection was less absurd than that because we’re so desensitized by horrible media coverage. I agree with you on that one, I just don’t agree that there’s no connection between all of these things and white supremacy. That connection is fascism, and similar events that happened in the name of actual white supremacy. Trump either didn’t care or is stupid enough to make it excruciatingly obvious.

"There is a lot in there. 1) Your definition of ""white supremacy"" seems to be the diluted prevailing narrative that equates it with liberal democracy. This postmodern language game is getting a lot of people in trouble. White supremacy is the belief that the ""white race"" is superior to other ""races"" based on genetic dispositions. The argument for ""systemic racism"" is much more complicated, but the country, nor it's institutions, are *not* inherently racist. This is a red herring and a language game played by media and political groups in the interest of gaining power. To wit, this is not the description of the rioters at the Captiol. Some individuals maybe, but there is no way to know that from media coverage. In short Trump  supporter does not equal racist or white supremacist. 2) The President spreading conspiracies... I'm assuming you mean Stop the Steal. Listen, I work in Democratic politics professionally. It is not inaccurate to say that there was a political calculus in promoting universal mail-voting. The Dems work with a myriad of ""non-profit"" organizations that shift their workload over to ""get out the vote"" efforts close to a Presidential election. They do this in order to show that they have the ability to deliver votes *in order to build their own influence within the party*. Ballot harvesting is real. Trust me: I've been instructed to do it. Is it legal? Yes (unfortunately), but *that* is what people mean when they say the election was stolen: that group and the Dems were using dirty tactics to put their thumbs on the scale. 3) If we want to focus on violence, let's talk Antifa and BLM. I was in Antifa. I know how *their* insurrectionist tactics work: start with a legitimate protest, have a small cadre commit small acts of vandalism, and watch the violence snowball into what would other be a mostly peaceful crowd in the heat of the moment. Classic mob techniques. This is nothing new. The BLM protests had some of this as well. 4) The media talking point that Trump ""dog-whistled"" the ""alt-right"" is just that: a talking point. Google ""Trump disavows white supremacy"" and you can hear it from his own mouth. This Trump derangement syndrome that has infected the zeitgeist has become a poison. It is being used and taken advantage of to promote authoritarian policies. Again, if anyone expects a local government to condemn the Capitol riots then add on the Antifa riots in Portland, CHAZ in Seattle, and the burning of an entire city in Minneapolis among many others. The Capitol riot, which again was ill-conceived, immature, dangerous, and I do not support it, is being used as a gaslight by the media to distract away from the real enemies: the corporate-media-defense-industrial complex that is robbing you of your livelihood to redistribute the country's wealth to multi-national corporations.

All of this requires nuance and an historical understanding of the players and the context. The Capitol riot did not happen in a vacuum.

"Rioting, which is bad no matter whose side you're on, is bad. I hope we agree on that. But it would be irresponsible to categorize an entire group of people as white supremacists and terrorists, especially for a local government. Just because the social media mob and the media-industrial complex likes to stoke rage for clickbait using hyperbolic sensationalism to try to gain political power (FWIW which is using a tactic to make people afraid enough to hurt themselves to make a political point... i.e. kind of like terrorism), doesn't mean that elected representatives should appease them on behalf of an entire community. I do not condone the riot at the Capitol. It was stupid, ill-conceived, and dangerous. I also didn't condone the hundreds of BLM riots. It's not the role of local government to blanket categorize a political movement with the talking points of one party. If they did, we should be afraid.

"It depends. They still can work in places that are pretty populated, but even then, they usually need to have something to set them apart and make them a destination for people farther away to come, while having stores that aren't too crazy for locals.

Like Tyson's Corner Center is still doing fine. It's got a bunch of stores you can't get anywhere else, and a good movie theater that definitely attracts locals.

Staunton Mall, on the other hand, almost never had brands that made it a destination. Maybe Steve and Barry's since even at its widest, it only ever got to 300 stores, but that was very much a discount store, no matter how much I really liked their hoodies.

So Staunton Mall had to appeal to locals. And for a while, it didn't do too bad. Like my family would there to get school clothes from JC Penney most years until Steve and Barry's opened. And for the longest time, the mall was the place to see new movies unless you wanted to go to Harrisonburg or Charlottesville, but Zeus and the switchover to digital projection killed the Regal.

"The article says, ""Because people often experience fevers within the first several days of  contracting the virus, before they feel sick or get tested."" This is inaccurate. Symptoms usually show up 5-8 days after exposure and there is no evidence for asymptomatic transmission. To wit, the most vulnerable population by a >50% margin are those over 80. Now, if you're in a nursing home and reading this, yes. Stay inside. Otherwise, don't be frightened. We'll be fine. Social distancing is the best bet.

"I have taken identical drone shots from those overlook pull-offs on Afton Mountain!  Good stuff.  I have the DJI Spark however for a while now been thinking about upgrading but I love it.

Just read the other comments you got.  Make sure are get authorized to fly and you are at least partly covered from flying in restricted areas.  I'm sure your drone like mine won't fly in a restricted area.  I have gotten permission to do so however in the Myrtle Beach area under 200 feet.  No flying over people or cars/traffic unless the road is clear you can cross like you would on the ground.  I only see one photo in which you are clearly over the road I-64 on Afton Mountain.  In every other shot, you look fine or it is unknown if you are over people or traffic.  

The DJI Mavic Mini is not subject to the same rules and regulations as a regular drone as it is considered a toy due to the weight.  So you wouldn't have to get clearance to fly or register it.  I guess you still can and probably should, however.

"The original Western State facility is near the intersection of 250 and 11, across from Wright's Dairy-Rite.  That was a prison for a number of years after Western State vacated, and was turned into luxury housing after the prison closed.

Western State later moved to a location off of US 250 near where the current Commonwealth Center for Children and Adolescents stands.  The original buildings there no longer exist, as Western State built a new facility on the same site in the 2000s.

Then there's also the old DeJarnette Center, which is presently abandoned.

Trash Containers and Bags: All trash must be in metal or plastic containers that are in serviceable condition or bags at least 1.5 mils in thickness. Container tops should fit snugly. Bags must be tied shut.

"Originally from Virginia, but never lived in Staunton before. Wife and I are late 20s/early 30s and moved to Colorado in 2014, but wanted to move back to Virginia and buy a house this year. Staunton honestly wasn't our first choice, but as 2020 progressed and being in a bigger city closer to people seemed less important and appealing (along with house prices elsewhere), we widened our search and started looking seriously at Staunton. And I'm glad we did. It's small and quiet, but close to a lot of things and there's enough right here in town. Art, coffee shops, breweries, restaurants, parks...


Definitely politically and ideologically diverse. Not sure I've ever seen more political signs and various flags and banners on houses in any other town (though that is a mix of BLM and Pride flags across the street from confederate flags and hand made ""babies lives matter"" signs).

"The best comparison I would give it to Central Valley CA would be a smaller Davis, without the university. 

The surrounding area is largely agricultural and rural, but the folks are still pretty genuine and welcoming. Just conservative in the hinterland.

As for Staunton proper, it’s runs a little bit more diverse than the rest of the Shenandoah valley, albeit that’s diverse for rural VA, so still pretty white. 

What Staunton has done well, has invested money in arts and was on the leading edge of revitalizing downtown areas in the late 90s. 

That investment has played out in there being a great theatre scene for a town of its size thanks to the American Shakespeare company performing at the Blackfriars, and a quaint downtown with nice restaurants and boutique shops.

It currently does well as a tourist destination for folks from the Northern VA/DC region, as it is within an easy day’s drive, surrounded by beautiful countryside, and punches well above its weight in terms of restaurants and cultural attractions.

Been awhile since I was familiar with the educational scene there, but the schools tend to reflect the more city-like population and skew more diverse than the surrounding rural county schools.  Not to be mistaken for the diversity you would see in a more urban area like Modesto or Sacramento though.

It’s a great town that might feel bougey compared to the surrounding country side, but the whole region is filled with genuine and down to earth people for the most part.

"We visited recently for three days, so this is an outsider view (and during covid pandemic).

The downtown area is quaint, but economically depressed.  High vacancy rate for storefronts.  To me it is an area that shows great promise and will be rejuvenated over the coming years/next two decades.  Certainly some beautiful architecture and I would say it is moving in a positive direction in terms of property renovation.

I have lived in a similar town for two decades and I can see the path forward for Staunton to be amazing, but many things have to go right including city planning and economic factors.

I don't see much night life.  To deal with the pandemic, they are closing the streets downtown and allowing more outdoor dining which is great.  I would have no qualms considering this a good place for family, though I did not research schools.

While I see the promise, we are at a different stage in life so we are looking elsewhere, but if I were in my 20s-30s it looks like a good place to invest time and money, perhaps seeing a nice return in 20-30 years especially if the population as a whole works more remotely and moves to smaller towns.

BTW the downtown is blue, but it gets very red very fast as you leave town.  So if you are planning to live outside downtown, expect neighbors to be red.

It is worth checking out.  

Also an awesome Airbnb is right downtown, Stauntonstays.com I think is the website.

"From a 2016 NewsLeader article:

It all started when Debra and Frank Belloni decided they wanted to block out noise at their Augusta Street property and the best way to do that was to build a wall. They didn't just go and build it though — they got permission from a city zoning official first — which is a big reason why Debra Belloni can't believe this ordeal is still dragging on.

“We were very well aware of zoning, that’s why we went to the city to ask,” she said.

Earl Thompson, who was an authorized official of the zoning office at the time, told them they could build the wall and what the Bellonis constructed was what he expected them to, they didn't mislead him, according to his testimony from 2011 Staunton District Court. Yet, the city says the wall violates the zoning code, as it's greater than 3 feet high and sits on a street corner where it obstructs the line of sight for turning vehicles — this law needs to be enforced so as not to set a precedent, city officials say.

There’s been lawsuits, appeals, since then. Frank Belloni has passed away. 

TLDR, authorized city zoning officer approves citizen plan to build wall.  Citizen spends $35k to build a wall. City says “oops, this is too tall and violates ordinances.”  City and citizen get into lawsuit. City has spent north of $73k (per NL paper) trying to force citizen to tear down wall.",t2_44te5k8x,SlowDownToGoDown,0,1599871107.0,0,t1_g4vtnp6,g4vtnp6,False,SchuminWeb,t3_iqyvsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staunton/comments/iqyvsa/city_attorney_resigns_as_staunton_city_council/,City attorney resigns as Staunton City Council gang of four drops 'the wall' lawsuit,/r/Staunton/comments/iqyvsa/city_attorney_resigns_as_staunton_city_council/g4vtnp6/,8,r/Staunton,0,8

"I'm guessing your boyfriend will be in PT school at Murphy Demming.

There are some very nice apartments (for this area) right beside the school called The Apartments at Goose Creek.

These are very nice and there will be a lot of other grad students who live there with you also looking for new friends.

Downtown Staunton is nice but it's a bit more of a hipster vibe. It's historic so the places are older and more rundown for the most part.

The Villages are very nice apartments just outside downtown. This is an old insane asylum converted into a nice hotel and apartments.

Brittany Knoll (where you're looking) is very rundown and pretty much the armpit of Stuarts Draft. I would recommend you avoid these at all costs.

Stuarts Draft has some beautiful views and easy access to pretty much everywhere, but you'll want to avoid that specific area of town. 


I hope this is helpful for you.

Big Sky is great! I’ve lived here for a couple of years. Windigrove in Waynesboro is owned by the same company as well. Also would look at Goose Creek in fishersville.

"There is a grocery store and some fast food, dollar general, etc in Stuarts draft but for anything more you’ll be driving likely to Staunton or Waynesboro. Potentially further to Charlottesville or Harrisonburg depending what you want. We moved here from an actual city and lived in Staunton for a couple years then built a house in Waynesboro last year. Staunton has a lot of neat stuff in their historic downtown that we loved living near! If you want things to be more convenient to where you live I would recommend either Staunton or Waynesboro, which are both still super accesible to fishersville. I think the presence of people is a lot more apparent there as well. I work in Stuarts draft and the drive to fishersville would be easy as is the drive to other things, but there really isn’t much in Draft itself. One of my coworkers actually had good luck finding a cheap, but well located house for rent in waynesboro on Craigslist. Obviously you have to be careful with that, but his property manager uses craigslist for multiple places.",t2_16aq8y,melonball311,0,1599182103.0,0,t1_g3xlivi,g3xlivi,True,RealisticDonut,t3_ilv9p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staunton/comments/ilv9p7/whats_it_like_living_in_stuarts_draft/,What’s it like living in Stuart’s Draft?,/r/Staunton/comments/ilv9p7/whats_it_like_living_in_stuarts_draft/g3xlivi/,1,r/Staunton,0,1
Big Sky only has two bedrooms unfortunately but we’re still looking into it because it’s a little less than what we’re paying on the west coast for a small one bedroom. I’m in contact with the ones in waynesboro now!
