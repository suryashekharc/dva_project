"It's a short loop that I usually use for running instead of biking, but the [Malden River loop](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/32891434) is nice and doesn't require crossing any road intersections. It also connects to the Strand for easy access. I also do a slightly longer loop that circles behind the Gateway Plaza and around Encore, then back up Broadway and Main Street. But this one does require more road interaction. On a bike I would do this loop clockwise; This means you are heading south on Broadway, eliminating the need to cross it and using the raised cycle track instead of the unprotected bike lane on the other side.

The Strand extension to the Mystic is supposed to open sometime this year. It will also connect with both of the loops mentioned above.

When the GLX opens soon, the Somerville Community Path will as well. This will be pretty close to the southern end of the Northern Strand. Riding through Sullivan Square is not nearly as bad as it used to be, though I still advise being vigilant about possible right hooks going through it.

"Lots of people make things inspired by iconography from gravestones. However, it is disrespectful to do gravestone rubbings or clay pressings as you could easily break the stones. They often have cracks in them that you cannot see and putting pressure on them like that can damage them. Also do not put shaving cream or chalk on them. These substances stick around a lot longer than you think. In Boston it is illegal to do any of this to the old gravestones because of potential damage. 

I adore death's heads. My favorite stone in Massachusetts is the Susanna Jayne gravestone ([https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/susanna-jayne-headstone](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/susanna-jayne-headstone)). Its amazing and I own a pin inspired by it.

\+1 for Idle Hands, great beer, great people, and fun events. Love that National Grid-adjacent ambiance

Dairy Delight for delicious treats and charming cow murals

Big +1 to all our amazing parks, people skating on Fellsmere in winter is \*idyllic\*

I'm a big fan of the Eastern sections of the Fells, they tend to be much less crowded than west of the highway. 

* The Cascade (technically in Melrose) is a stunner if you catch it after rain/melt when it's flowing. 
* There is a small area in the Virginia Wood that has a really charming series of waterfalls, it's the ""Historical Trail"" (yellow blaze) on your maps. Around this area there are also old stone ruins in the woods you can discover.
* All along the rock circuit trail that follows the eastern border of the park, you get periodic clifftops with great view of the area, more dramatic than you might expect

"Do you have a car?

You're in a multifamily, so I assume that shoveling of the sidewalks is taken care of by your landlord. Is this correct? (This is a legal responsibility of the homeowner, and the cases where they can transfer this to a tenant are specific).

Main things: Plan on hanging out at home (or within walking distance) for 1-2 days. You do not need to panic buy a month's supply of milk, eggs, bread, and toilet paper, but you should have some food available. It's pretty rude to order delivery, and even pickup is a bit questionable. Don't make any unnecessary trips.

"That was the first place my wife and I lived and we got out as fast as we could*. Our second place is currently up for rent - it's rented out by the retired and suuuuper nice homeowners. We lived there for 3 years and they didn't raise the rent on us once. It's an incredible location too, in west Malden, like 20 min walk from Malden Center train, and very quiet. DM me if you want their contact info!

*edit to add more context. In all honesty, it wasn't horrible. It's just exactly what you'd expect for the cost. If you're relatively low-maintenance, those apartments might be a good fit. It was just sort of difficult to get Alpha Management to do anything, although their handyman was pretty responsive once you got his direct contact number. The location is decent, although one time we saw a shady guy literally walking the road trying to open people's cars at night. It's not the quietest part of Malden.

Honestly, the city had great intentions but it was pretty poorly planned. They told residents that they *could* walk up if they didn't have a vehicle, but that it was *primarily a drive-up event*. Combine that with one site/distribution center on a two lane street and the result will be fairly predictable: gridlocked traffic with everybody sitting in their oversized SUVs waiting for COVID tests.

"PART TWO

MVRCS Property Management and Malden  
=================================  
A number of questions have been raised after this weekend. They  involve both tenant rights and landlord responsibilities. And those concerns collide in the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.  
Is Mystic Valley Regional Charter School operating their significant residential property portfolio in compliance with the state sanitary law?   
The State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410, specifies the Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation. Various sections in this code cover areas which appear to have been substandard this holiday weekend: heat (410.200), hot water (410.190), kitchen facilities (410.100) and wiring (410.351).   
According to state law, “The purposes of 105 CMR 410.000 are to protect the health, safety and well-being of the occupants of housing and of the general public, to facilitate the use of legal remedies available to occupants of substandard housing, to assist boards of health in their enforcement of this code and to provide a method of notifying interested parties of violations of conditions which require immediate attention.”  
By definition, “Compliance means meeting all the requirements of 105 CMR 410.000. It shall also mean correcting any violations of 105 CMR 410.000 in a work-person like fashion and restoring all parts of the dwelling, or unit thereof, to the condition they were in before occurrence of any such violations. Compliance shall also mean in those cases where licenses or permits are required to perform work necessary to correct the violations, such as, but not limited to building, plumbing and wiring that the appropriate official certifies that the work has been completed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.”  
Under 410.351, “The owner shall install or cause to be installed, in accordance with accepted plumbing, gasfitting and electrical wiring standards, and shall maintain free from leaks, obstructions or other defect …”  and this is “ including, but not limited to …  water heating facilities, gas pipes, heating equipment … \[and\] ; all electrical fixtures, outlets and wiring…”.  
According to the City of Cambridge Housing Inspections webpage, “State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410). The most common types of complaints are: no heat, insufficient hot water, plumbing problems, cross metering, egress obstruction, rodent infestation, hoarding, rubbish, landlord maintenance responsibilities.” How will Malden’s Inspections department handle this?  
As the Lebanon Street story circulated, concerned residents asked common sense questions:  
\> Was this property inspected prior to purchase?  
\> Was an occupancy permit issued to MVRCS by the City of Malden for residential living?  
\> If there were lead lines into the property, were they replaced as required by ordinance?  
\> Are there other known maintenance issues related to water infiltration, electrical, or sparking risks?  
\> What lessons has the city learned from the Salem Street Parapet failure and other “no heat” situations, which might have been applied to this recent residential emergency?

"PART ONE

&#x200B;

It’s the middle of winter. Mystic Valley Regional Charter School seems caught up in some action. And the heat is on. Or is it?  
Twas the night before Christmas and days before Kwanzaa, but all through one MVRCS apartment there was no heat, no hot water, and no hot stove for a Lebanon Street holiday.   
MVRCS received multiple reports of substandard living conditions this holiday weekend. Did they respond appropriately? Did MVRCS do enough to protect the health, safety and well-being of their rental occupants? Who at Mystic Valley Regional Charter School is responsible? Does it matter this is a historical building MVRCS wants to tear down?  
Some of those questions may be answered on Saturday, January 8th. A protest rally will be held in front of 22 Lebanon Street. That event starts at 12 noon in Maplewood Square, followed by a short march to MVRCS. The rally is in response to terminations of tenancy and evictions now under way at MVRCS property. This will also be a victory celebration for another tenant association in Malden which reached a 5 year agreement for affordable rents  
So what happened these past few days in MVRCS housing?  
As we understand it this was a long, cruel weekend for Tatiane Damotta and her family at 22 Lebanon Street. On December 24th - a cold Friday and Christmas Eve - they began to notice some heating issues. The landlord, MVRCS, was notified of problems on Christmas day. By then it was clear there was no heat, no hot water and the stove was not working.  
With temperatures near freezing, and icing rain in the area, a shivering Lebanon Street family had no heat, no hot water, and no working stove for Christmas Day. To stay warm they resorted to a tangle of space heaters powered by dangerously dangling extension cords which ran through doorway jams and hinges to the only workable power they could find. It was outside their apartment in a public hallway.  
A coworker provided the family with a hot Christmas meal. Meawhile, MVRCS did not respond all day.   
These holiday events on Lebanon Street brought critical comment from one vocal resident: “MVRCS is a school. I don’t think they should be in the business of renting residential property.”  
Another resident highlighted the poor MVRCS response to this weekend’s heating emergency: “They are not set up for operating residential housing - they are not a charter rental.”  
MNN learned about the situation Sunday afternoon and asked Damotta about the circumstances. She told us “I called and texted \[Michael Leung, the building manager\] yesterday but no answer … I was worrying because \[it\] was so cold \[in\] the house … I called him again \[on Sunday\] and he answered but told me that the problem can’t be fixed today.”  
The MVRCS building manager finally answered a phone call Sunday afternoon. He told Damotta that a service response would occur, but not before Monday, December 27th.   
By Sunday afternoon, the apartment had been without heat for nearly two full December days.   
As the afternoon progressed, a small group of residents worked collaboratively to try and help. This included outreach (text, voice, email, social media) to city and state officials, and MVRCS officials.  
As Sunday evening arrived, Damotta became increasingly concerned about life safety issues. She wrote back to Leung again: “No Power and Heat at 22 Lebanon St”. Her message:  
“Hi Michael, \[In\] order to keep my house in a safer temperature we had to put extension cords and it’s very dangerous is a fire hazard I think this is an emergency that can’t wait tomorrow”.  Damotta included a tragic mainstream news story from the day: “Father and two sons die in a house fire likely caused by dried up Christmas tree and electrical issues.”  
The response came back from MVRCS property management:   
“\[D\]o what you must until the electrician comes tomorrow. Please stay safe.”  
Damotta would say the next day, “I couldn’t sleep last night because I was afraid of fire. But at the same time, I couldn’t turn off the portable heater it was so cold.”  
Friends gave Damotta contact information for city officials. However, there was reluctance and concern: If she made her heating complaints known, would there be retaliation? Would other tenants suffer a negative impact? Would businesses on the first floor have their tenancy revoked as a result? (According to some reports, two of the four businesses have been notified they must vacate by the end of January. At least one of those businesses previously believed they would be able to continue business at that address until 2023.) She was concerned for her own family, but also for the other residential and commercial tenants.  
Late Sunday night, a friend grew concerned about the lack of response from MVRCS. They sent MVRCS a late-night appeal by email. The subject: “No Power and Heat at 22 Lebanon St.” Recipients included Alex Dan (MVRCS Superintendent), Michael Leung (MVRCS Rental Manager for Lebanon Street) and Greg Kinnon (MVRCS Director of Facilities, since 2005).  
Kinnon responded quickly, around 10PM:   
“This is the first I have heard about this; however I have notified our electrician and he will be out there tonight to rectify the problem. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and we will address it ASAP.”  
By around 10PM, word reached Malden’s Public Health Director, Chris Webb. It appears many of the reported problems are governed under the authority of the State Sanitary Code, details of which are provided below. The Mayor’s Office and State Representative Steve Ultrino were also informed.   
Around 7:00 AM on Monday, Councillor At Large Debbie DeMaria reached out to Damotta and extended a breakfast invitation at Franny’s. DeMaria, a perennial leading vote getter who did not run for re-election this year, made a number of efforts to find assistance for Damotta. DeMaria reached out to Police Captain Glenn Cronin, who also serves as Malden’s Director of Emergency Management. Cronin quickly contacted Leung and MVRCS on the matter.   
DeMaria and Damotta met at Franny’s Monday morning. When Franny’s serving staff learned of the weekend ordeal, they offered Damotta a complimentary breakfast. DeMaria insisted she would pay.  
Soon after breakfast, Leung and the electrician arrived at 22 Lebanon St. Work began to fix the problem that cut off  heat, hot water and stove throughout the entire holiday weekend. For the first time, MVRCS offered Damotta’s family the use of an unoccupied apartment for heat and hot water - a neighboring apartment which was vacated days earlier.  
After several hours of electrical work, the heat, hot water and working stove had been restored. Damotta entered Monday night hopeful: “We are finally able to eat homemade food.""",t2_60xgo8fm,Jaspercy40,0,1640752505.0,0,t1_hqde76g,hqde76g,False,Jaspercy40,t3_rq7ula,https://www.reddit.com/r/malden/comments/rq7ula/another_travesty_of_mystic_valley_regional/,Another travesty of Mystic Valley Regional Charter Schools. . .

"So happy to see this. Improving infrastructure that supports bike/bus/walking is long overdue. The inconvenience to drivers is low while the benefit to other modes of travel is high. Drivers are spoiled across the country, and we can safely disregard their complaints.

Driving is so incredibly expensive, and it's wasteful when you live in the city. The expense has been normalized, and transportation infrastructure has caused it to be an artificial necessity. Everyone needs to recognize the difference between a street and a road. Malden is a place we want to be (we need streets), rather than a place to travel through (a place with roads). This change on Eastern Ave will be a major improvement, even if drivers do not see it that way.

The intersections along the Northern Strand have all been fixed as of last week.

I find that Sullivan Square is fine with the redesign from 2 years ago as long as you pay attention and make sure that people are respecting your right of way before you fully commit to going past an exit. I've done Main Street through Charlestown several times and it's not an issue. If you're willing to walk your bike, you can cut across the canal dams and get right to North Station from the park. Once you get passed North Station I haven't done it enough to say.

"> it seems like the republicans are running on culture war stuff (""unity"", supporting the police) and making sure that driving is the priority for transportation

Ward 4 here, and this fits pretty well with Jeff Donahue, who sent out a flyer a few weeks ago that kind of laid out who he is as a candidate, a lot of it, I felt, phrased in a way that seemed anodyne but belies some pretty seedy stuff. One thing that stuck with me was that that flyer was framed as ""what I heard"" when going door to door, and he said that ""our Asian neighbors"" (or similar phrasing) are concerned about marijuana business in town. That comes off as a pretty unsettling dog-whistle to me—it's not only Asian people (as a flattened group, as Donahue has them) who oppose that, and resistance to marijuana is often a dog-whistle for anti-Black sentiments, and pitting Asian people against Black people is a well-traveled trope that came up even just in the last year and half in this country. Why frame opposition to marijuana as a specifically Asian thing? Not a good look. Otherwise, it was a lot of fear mongering with transportation and density—something about people losing property to bike paths/lanes (which I later found out is bunk—people don't have the claim to land in those cases that they say they do) and other things resistant to environmental consciousness that I object to. Some ""government overreach"" stuff, too, if you weren't sure if he's a republican or not. (I also live around the corner from him and he has Spadafora and DiMarco signs out front.) I don't know the story of why he _used_ to hold this council seat, so I'd be curious to hear, if anyone knows.

Anyway, I voted for O'Malley (if that wasn't clear, yet, heh).

That's probably referring to the [""Complete Streets"" plan](https://mass.streetsblog.org/2021/04/15/malden-city-council-endorses-more-bus-bike-lanes-for-city-center/). There are sections of road where the number of lanes increase then decrease. Those are obvious targets for putting in something other than car lanes, since the bottle-neck from the merge *usually* makes traffic worse than if the number of lanes remains constant (exceptions being if it provides enough buffer to prevent grid-lock). The city council had a study done that concluded it would not harm driving but would improve other modes of commuting; but many people were not having it, and felt that less lanes = worse traffic.",t2_bd11ckz8,SecretHumanzee,0,1635519382.0,0,t1_hiipw87,hiipw87,False,Glasenator,t3_qi36je,https://www.reddit.com/r/malden/comments/qi36je/any_thoughts_on_the_city_councilors_election/,Any thoughts on the city councilors election?,/r/malden/comments/qi36je/any_thoughts_on_the_city_councilors_election/hiipw87/,3,r/malden,0,3
"Matheson was former Ward 3 councilor - he resigned a few years ago to unsuccessfully run for mayor. As councilor he never responded to any question or request (via email or call) from me or my spouse, who lived in his district, over the span of several years. In the public meetings I attended or watched, he was the most openly dismissive of comments from the public. (To be fair, plenty of public comments are irrelevant, anecdotal, or just wrong - but here I am just talking about his ""leadership"" style.) Many of our neighbors had the same experience.

So, leaving aside the content of what he supports or opposes - I am very skeptical that Matheson would be responsive to the people if he gets elected citywide (At-Large), since he wouldn't do it when he represented only a single Ward.

By contrast, Amanda Linehan has been very responsive as Ward 3 counselor and done tons of outreach, including to neighbors who aren't native English speakers. I like that she has a kid of her own currently in the public schools. She's very easy to reach online and is always accessible at community and school events. Although I don't know much about her challenger, I plan to vote for Linehan again because she's done a really good job representing us.

"Thank you for this, I watched the debate last night and  more or less came to the same conclusions.

https://youtu.be/zEh3VcP1PVI

As a new Malden resident, I find it very concerning that most of the candidates brought up increasing parking and decreasing density in town as their number one issue (including my own ward councilor). I take the orange line to get to work and part of the reason why we chose Malden as a place to buy our first home was the amount of density and how walkable it can be thanks to the T stops and Malden Center. I think something like almost half of residents don’t have cars.

Trying to remember from last night so take this all with a grain of salt, but I believe Roberto brought up that he didn’t like that bike lanes are taking away precedence from cars (?!). Matheson hand waved away the importance of the orange line stops and mentioned in his opening we should be focusing more on the highways surrounding Malden as main entry points to the city. Spadafora was very concerned about zoning and did not seem too enthused about the new Malden Center developments (huh?).

I want to reiterate that I am a realist and by no means anti-car. We can’t all be on the T. But to be so hostile to more public transportation solutions instead of more parking spots is baffling to me, and makes me feel like a second class citizen.

I will be voting McDonald, Colon Hayes, and DeLacey. Although I was not super enthused by any of them.",t2_53p0x,Glasenator,0,1635517379.0,0,t1_hiikzyk,hiikzyk,False,Glasenator,t3_qi36je,https://www.reddit.com/r/malden/comments/qi36je/any_thoughts_on_the_city_councilors_election/,Any thoughts on the city councilors election?,/r/malden/comments/qi36je/any_thoughts_on_the_city_councilors_election/hiikzyk/,10,r/malden,0,10
"For at-large:

[Karen Colon Hayes](https://www.karencolonhayes.com/) and [Carey McDonald](https://mcdonaldformalden.com/) are democrats and organize with other Democrats. Karen Colon Hayes has a fairly long history of activism and government work in Malden, and from what I can tell is fairly well-regarded even by many republicans.

[Brian DeLacey](https://www.facebook.com/briandelaceyforcitycouncil/) is basically a democrat but is somehow philosophically opposed to organizing with them, so he's doing his own thing.

The democrats running for at-large would all be first-timers.

[Craig Spadafora](https://www.facebook.com/CouncilorSpadafora/) and John Matheson are republicans. Spadafora is an incumbant, Matheson previously ran for mayor and is former ward 3 councilor. The Spadafora clan in general owns a good bit of Malden, and Craig Spadafora seemingly has a permanent op-ed spot on the Malden Advocate. Roberti DiMarco is seemingly aligning himself with them in his campaign, although I know basically nothing about him.

&#x200B;

I'm in ward 3: where my sitting councilor is [Amanda Linehan](http://amandalinehan.org/), a democrat.  She is being challenged by [Glen Curtis](https://glencurtisward3.com/). I've found Linehan to be very responsive to questions.

&#x200B;

As a relative newcomer to Malden and someone who has sat in on a few city council meetings and tried to pay attention to the campaign, it seems like the republicans are running on culture war stuff (""unity"", supporting the police) and making sure that driving is the priority for transportation. The democrats are running on ramping up public transit and biking. Everyone is fighting over what to do with the old hospital site. It's sitting empty now and people want to do something with it, but generally there is a lot of fear that it will be developed into apartments/condos and create a ton of traffic in an area where the streets wouldn't support it. In part because the republicans prioritize driving, it seems like they are generally more resistant to bringing in more housing (they tend to try to limit it more, put more restrictions on construction, etc).

"My husband does a similar ride, and yeah, he says it's a lot of crossings. If you do it a few times, you might find some tricks to smooth things out.

He says that where the trail is torn up down at the Everett end, he can go through a gap in the fence to cut through a City Services building parking lot, then turns left on a one-way after Bone Up Brewing. That takes you to a nice bike lane that meets back up with the Broadway bike lanes at the traffic circle, which saves you some carrying.

He doesn't go far enough into Charlestown/Sullivan to have any real advice there, unfortunately.

Hopefully all that construction is done soon! It's driving him nuts, too.

"As another poster said, their landlord wouldn’t renew with them and they moved to wakefield. I’ve checked out the new location a couple times (once on opening day and once more after they had some time to settle in) and it’s pretty neat. It definitely lacks some of the charm of the old bunker and is a bit more cramped, but I honestly feel like their selection of some things has increased (namely warhammer and board games, at least compared to when I was regularly going there a few years ago)",t2_8pmg1,commissarchris,0,1629921914.0,0,t1_hac2nor,hac2nor,True,hobosox,t3_pb0v90,https://www.reddit.com/r/malden/comments/pb0v90/anyone_know_why_the_hobby_bunker_relocated/,Anyone know why the Hobby Bunker relocated?,/r/malden/comments/pb0v90/anyone_know_why_the_hobby_bunker_relocated/hac2nor/,3,r/malden,0,3
"If you’re nearer to Oak Grove, Wood + Fire in Melrose is *amazing*. Choice bougie pies that way. This was my top choice to treat myself before going vegan. There is no vegan substitute - this is where you go to find out there is more than one type of mozzarella and apparently you’ve been eating the wrong one your whole life.

Famiglia Fornaciari Wood Fired Pizza in Revere is also excellent, and a good medium between bougie and townie pizza because it’s wood-fired, but the toppings are more like townie pizza options. This is my current top choice because they offer a vegan pizza (it’s too heavy on onion, but otherwise delicious). This vegan pizza is of the no-cheese variety, but because the dough is top notch and the sauce is really good, *and* the wood firing provides extra flavor, this is one of very few pizzas I feel satisfied with without a cheese substitute that I can get at a restaurant. Even if you are not vegan or gluten free, it is helpful to have this one in your back pocket if you have friends or family who are, because they won’t give you crap for ordering a pizza minus the cheese. Besides, if a pizza can stand without cheese, that is pretty damn impressive from a crust and sauce perspective.

Pre-vegan, DiPietros was absolutely my number one choice for townie pizza. I only ordered from Pisa Pizza once years ago, because I had to call them. I’m not sure if that’s still the case, but I remember them being good. I haven’t found a good townie pizza substitute that fits vegan needs - what I’d want to see in that is a nice, thin crust pizza with a decent cheese substitute, same as “normal” pizza but with a compromise on the cheese.

LongCross just opened in The Intersection of Death over in Medford, near the Qdoba. They have a Detroit-style pizza that I am dying to try as a Michigan transplant, as “your-pizza-is-mostly-crust” style pizza is difficult to source out here. That said, I’m not sure if it’s possible for me to order from/evaluate this one - a key component of proper Detroit-style pizza is the crisp the crust gets from the pan, including the crispy bits of cheese at the edges. But it should be a very different variety of pizza, if you want to take a chance. I would give it a try in a heartbeat if I hadn’t switched to vegan before it opened, and will probably investigate to see if it’s possible for me to get a pizza there without the cheese because I’m still super curious. Serious Eats has a great write up on what you should expect from a Detroit-style pizza if you’re not familiar with it. Note that this is not to be confused with Chicago-style pizza, which is terrible and a disgrace to pizzas everywhere.",t2_7i8lb,MrsEaves,0,1629874538.0,0,t1_ha9iv3x,ha9iv3x,True,BStills87,t3_pan9wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/malden/comments/pan9wp/best_pizza_in_malden/,Best Pizza 🍕 In Malden?,/r/malden/comments/pan9wp/best_pizza_in_malden/ha9iv3x/,4,r/malden,0,4

Which yeah, is the Alford/Washington street that you mentioned. The bridge isn't too bad though if you go in an off time you might hit it while they raise the draw bridge and have to wait like 10 minutes. Sullivan Square is fine heading south as you'll stay in a seperated lane the whole time but returning home is worse as you have to go around the other side without a track plus cross more exits/entrances. You should really keep an eye for cars exiting without yielding. 

Sweetser Circle (near the Main Street/Route 16 interaction) is another iffy spot. Again there is a bike track when you are heading south but not coming back north. Fortunately this will soon be obsolete, as the Northern Strand is being extended south from its current endpoint. The work is supposed to be completed this year, and will allow you to continue on the path all the way to the Mystic between Costco and the Casino (i.e. not getting on Alford street until just before the bridge).",t2_e7r7x,Stronkowski,0,1624977925.0,0,t1_h3g07rb,h3g07rb,True,_ursuppe,t3_oa8y23,https://www.reddit.com/r/malden/comments/oa8y23/bike_from_malden_to_cambridge_kendall_sq/,Bike from Malden to Cambridge (Kendall Sq),/r/malden/comments/oa8y23/bike_from_malden_to_cambridge_kendall_sq/h3g07rb/,6,r/malden,0,6

"Don't forget the pretzels from Mystic Station!  I was surprised to learn that, what was supposed to be an appetizer was almost a full meal when I ordered one of those.  Bigger than your head with a nice amount of mustard and beer cheese to boot!

Both 110 Grill and Eviva Trattoria are chain restaurants and their new locations are just getting their feet off of the ground.  I can vouch for their bar and beer selection personally, which include a lot from Boston area microbreweries and a bartender that makes some pretty good cocktails.  I haven't explored their menus enough to vouch for their food, though, so your mileage might vary.

If you're in the area and want a high quality chinese restaurant, District Kitchen is right around the corner and I've always enjoyed everything I've ordered from there, though I don't know if that's exactly a tourist spot.  Their mapo tofu is amazing and they've got a pork belly dish that is absolutely mouth watering that takes an immense amount of willpower to keep me from ordering it on a regular basis.

"Malden's great, and I agree with everyone's pros here.  


The biking infrastructure sucks, and it's a driving pass-through community so you get a lot of road noise and traffic that you wouldn't get in other places.   Malden is MUCH louder than somerville because of cars, and it looks like it will be so for the forseeable future because most of the city councilors still seem to believe cars == prosperity or something. There's only one city councilor that respond positively (or at all) when you write them about people oriented transit issues.  


The north strand is incredibly exciting though; down to the mystic by this fall, all the way to lynn (and nearly to nahant!) this summer? I think?

"Another thing worth considering is whether or not you're buying or renting. If buying in Malden there's a residential tax exemption that drops your property taxes by quite a bit. You have to sign up for it, but it's definitely a nice thing to have.

If renting, you'll want to find out more about the management company for the building, there's shady one's in every town.

"I've been living in Malden almost ten years and I really love it here. As others have mentioned, it's wonderfully diverse, there's a strong food and drink scene in Malden center as well as a growing ""gaming"" sector - there's Boda Borg, 8D Escape Room, and Mixer eSports/Wanyoo Gaming Cafe across from New England Comics. There are lots of public parks and walking trails around town; and I've found most things I might need (groceries, doctor, dentist, barber, shipping services, pet supply, etc) are easily walkable or on a bus route. The commute into Boston is fairly easy on the Orange line - and between here and Boston on the Orange line is Assembly Square. 

There are also a lot of active community groups in town if that's your thing - a Malden running club, Malden LGBTQ, Malden Neighbors Helping Neighbors, 2nd Stage Players (a community theater group), Malden Reads, Malden CORE (Community Organizing for Racial Equality), LOTS of regular events run by the public library, community trash cleanup days, the list goes on and on. Or you can do none of it and just mind your business and people will leave you alone. It's up to you!

"For the commute, Malden will definitely be better. Honestly, I personally wouldn't even consider Salem unless 1)you won't have to commute more than twice a week or 2) your office is within a 10 minute walk of North Station. Besides the Orange Line, in Malden you've got better options for biking, driving, busing, or even running to work, and actually even a commuter rail option as well. I'd give you more info if I had specifics like budget, desired housing size, interests, office location, etc.

Pros:

* commute, as described above
* great selection of Asian restaurants 
* one of the most diverse cities in the state 
* some good breweries/bars in the Center
* quick access to Night Shift/Short Path/Bone Up
* good biking/walking paths
* access to highways north of Boston
* the Fells for outdoor recreation
* much more space than lots in Camberville
* cheaper than Camberville
* similar to commute, very easy access to downtown for fun
* Costco!
* Boss Borg

Cons:

* cost is higher than Salem (I think? I bought 5 years ago so haven't been following housing prices that closely for a while)
* Less access to the ocean than Salem",t2_e7r7x,Stronkowski,0,1618888143.0,0,t1_gv5tqte,gv5tqte,True,memot1,t3_muf1l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/malden/comments/muf1l8/living_in_malden/,Living in Malden?,/r/malden/comments/muf1l8/living_in_malden/gv5tqte/,5,r/malden,0,5
"If you can find a place in/around the downtown core, then it can be great. Incredibly accessible to Boston with the T, slowly revitalizing downtown, some decent restaurants beyond the standard Mexican/Italian stuff, and yes, a couple of breweries and good quality pubs. Bike path cuts right through the centre and ultimately will go all the way to Boston and up through Revere to the water. 

If you're a fan of urban grit, Malden has plenty of that but not so much that it gets to be like bad old 1970s NYC. Very diverse population too – lots of Asians, Haitians, and the like. Go down to Everett for a mini Brazil, and lots of microbreweries, and go north to Melrose for a little more of a middle-class urban scene and a couple of great restaurants (Turner's being the best). 

Want to get away and go for a hike? Middlesex Fells is right there. Can also climb up to the top of the hill in Pine Banks Park and Waitt's Mount for a decent view of the Boston skyline.

It's actually a pretty good middle ground between all the extremes.

In 1889, a standpipe, or water tower, was built on Waitt's Mount. At the time it was the largest water reserve tank in the United States with a capacity of over a million gallons.


During the Second World War, the War Department repurposed Waitt's Mount as an anti-aircraft coastal defense site with a battalion of ten gunners.

"Supporting Victims of our Namesake City of Malden, Washington
The City of Malden is partnering with the Malden Fire Department to help support the victims of the devastating fires taking place in Malden, Washington. Incorporated on December 20, 1909 the town was established as a station stop and was named by railway officials after Malden, Massachusetts.

The blaze has destroyed 80% of Malden, WA completely decimating its Post Office, Fire Department, City Hall, and Library. Many homes have also been badly damaged or destroyed. The scale of this disaster has devastated the community.

As a result, a number of fundraising efforts are underway, and our city will be working to assist the many victims of our namesake city. The Lions Club of Malden is accepting donations of Visa/other prepaid cash gift cards which can be dropped off at the Malden Fire Department Headquarters, 1 Sprague Street during regular business hours (Monday through Friday 8 AM-5 PM).

"If you're on the west side of Malden the Fells can be fun for a little bit of bouldering and some short roped climbs. I wouldn't spend much time travelling to it though. If you're getting in a car,  Lynn woods has much better bouldering.

There are definitely cool views along the skyline trail in the Fells. Depending on your hiking comfort (and your knees) you might consider it a pretty rugged trail. I think the old stone towers around the Fells have some pretty good views too.

As far as just hiking and being out in nature, they're both great. I suspect you can find a place pretty easily to hang a hammock, but I doubt they will be completely quiet. Almost everywhere in the Fells I see some people wandering around if it's a nice day.

As far as the RMV goes, I've had a lot of success just completely giving up on life every time I need to go.

"The bike path would be great for roller blading. Most people I see there are running/walking/biking but some roller bladers too.

If you want some hiking or walking in the woods, I would recommend the Fells or Pine Bank Park. Much closer than Blue Hills. Also might be worth the short T ride into the city for a walk along the Esplanade.

Things in the area right now are hit or miss because of Covid, but all the breweries in the area are open (Nighshift, Bone Up, Idle Hands, Faces) and the local distillery (Short Path). Under the normal circumstances they have a lot of events and stuff going on like live music and trivia, some have run clubs. The new-ish restaurant The Porch also does live music, and has great food. Then there's Encore if you're into that.

I agree with the poster before me on Bikeeny. They have some great stuff. Also highly recommend Jitter's Cafe right over the Malden/Melrose border on Main Street. Their breakfast sandwiches are incredible and their coffee menu is awesome.

"This is all my POV, not grounded in experience since my child is only at a daycare age here. 

The mystic valley charter high was rated top ten in MA by US news. I live near the other high school, and it’s wonderfully diverse every time I walk past (precovid!) 

My cousin teaches elementary school in Malden and she said she thinks the system is good but needs improvement. Specifically, as Malden is so diverse, the educators are predominately white - so she’s working on trying to bring in more diverse educators. 

In terms of families - she’s mentioned that it’s like every middle class neighborhood. There are families who care, and families who don’t care as much.

"I have lived in the Bellrock neighborhood (southern end of Malden) for 4 years. Prior to that I lived in between Davis and Porter square for 5. When It was time to buy I kept getting outbid on any of the places I tried in Somerville/south Medford, even with a bid 40k over asking. Eventually we broadened the search to include a few places in Malden, and ended up getting the place I live in now for over $100k less than anywhere we saw in Somerville, twice the lot size, and a real driveway.

I was apprehensive about moving away from the Davis area, which I loved, but Malden has been great. It is a little less busy than Somerville, but still walkable, better brewery access, and it's actually easier for me to get downtown than when I lived in Davis. I can still go out in my old area, with a 15-20 minute Uber. Malden Center isn't Davis, but it's a viable nightlife option.

For the slight downgrade in nightlife I got a huge upgrade to space and property quality. Places renovated like the one I got and that large would have been like a million dollar condo, and absolutely none of them would have had the backyard.

I currently (well, outside of Covid) commute to Kendall Square for work. It takes me 20-25 minutes on a bike or 45-50 minutes running. On the rare occasions when I take the T there, it's about 55 minutes (with half of that being the walk to/from the T).

"My wife and I bought in Malden 2 years ago in the Forestdale neighborhood about a 10 minute walk to oak grove. Like you we were leaving Somerville so we could actually afford to buy a place. I have slowly realized the few offers we lost and a lot of the buyers in Malden are former renters from Somerville and Cambridge who are looking to buy and can’t afford that area. This has made the market a bit hotter and led to some bidding wars on more desirable locations and houses. 

Since moving here I have grown to love Malden. It is a nice community with a lot going on and the orange line has really easy access to the city. As they start to incorporate the new trains and other fixes on the orange line it will only get better too. The food is great with all the small and local food from all over the world.

"Hello! My husband and I spent a good 5+ years in Cambridge (near central/harvard) and Davis Square. We loved that area and wanted to buy but obviously could not afford it. We needed to be t accessible because we both did not want to car commute to work and we wanted a single family home. We spent some time searching winter hill in somerville, medford and then started looking in Malden where we bought 2 years ago - a single family home, newly renovated with a huge yard that was in our price range.

I love Malden. It's extremely diverse and being Chinese with a White husband and a half Chinese toddler, I didn't realize how nice / important it was for us to be in this community. We live on a street that has black, brown, Asian families on it. THere are some really great restaurants with more opening up - Faces brewing for example. 

I live on the side of Malden near the high school that's closer to the salemwood area. I did NOT realize this (agian because we weren't super familiar with the neighborhood) that there's a wealthier side of Malden and a not-as-wealthy side of Malden. We live on the not-as-wealthy side of Malden. Doesn't impact how we feel about it, but just so you know when you're looking because we had lost out on a bid on a house that was on the wealthier side of Malden and assumed that was the going rate for that size of a house etc. We then placed a bid on a similar sized house etc on the not-so-wealthier side of Malden and the appraisal came in lower than our offer (we still went with it! and are very happy that we did) but it wasn't something we realized.

"Malden is a hidden gem. I grew up in Medford but have lived in Malden for about 8 years total. It’s very diverse which is a great asset for the city. The downtown on Pleasant Street and Malden Square have been in transition for a while and is definitely getting better with some great restaurants, bars, and a new brewery and beer garden. We also have Idle Hands right bear the Malden Center T. The city is full of excellent authentic Asian restaurants and lots of other cuisines too. There’s Fellsmere Park which is a nice Olmstead designed green space with pond and a bike trail along the Malden River. 

It’s so close to everywhere too. Downtown Boston is a 15 minute T ride from two stops on the Orange Line. Rt 1 takes you up the North Shore and 93 is nearby too.

You may want to have a personal vehicle if you move here; I find that makes life a lot easier.

"I grew up in and spent virtually my entire life in Somerville, only moved to Malden a couple years ago. My wife initially had to drag me kicking and screaming, but the house prices had grown so insanely expensive in Somerville over the years (we were renting in various hoods, mostly in Winter Hill/Union Sq), that I could no longer justify it.....

Honestly, I really, really love it here. Malden reminds me a lot of the Somerville I grew up in, by virtue of its diversity and blue-collar roots (which are still fairly prominent). Malden is really big and I can’t claim to know every neighborhood very well, but where I am in the West End, it’s like having one foot in the city and one in the burbs. I’ve got a beautiful pond and park right across the street, I’m 5 mins south of the Fells, and 5 mins north of Assembly. I can walk to the T and be downtown in 20 mins, and Malden Center itself has a lot of amenities, with plenty more in the pipeline. And we actually live in a single-family house! With a yard!

"Well, like anything else, it's been a bit quieter around here for a while. I feel like Malden is like a quieter Somerville.

Pros: The orange line is generally fine (I don't know about the driving commute). Being close to the Middlesex Fells hiking trails is really nice. There are some really excellent places to eat if you like regional Chinese food.

Cons: Not always a ton to do here, but easy access to the city, like anywhere in the Metro Area.

"I must have missed the notification for your response, sorry I didn't get back to you earlier. 

It's weird that you got hit 2x with the excise tax, but leasing companies tend to really suck at dealing with it. 

Since they own the car, they get the bill for excise tax and are on the hook for it. Most likely they pay it, then send you a bill. Or they collect it up front. One way or another, they charge you for it. It's hard to say why they hit you 2x, but maybe they're collecting it quarterly?

You may be able to get a better idea by seeing how much tax has been assessed. It's based on the model year and MSRP (not the out of door price). You should be able to find MSRP by going to kbb.com and entering in your car's details. Excise tax is $25 for every $1000 of MSRP, but that amount gets discounted depending on the age of the car. 

Assuming your car is a 2019 model and the MSRP is $30k, then your excise tax is:

25 * 30 = $750

But since it's a 2019 model it's assessed at 90% 

$750 * .9 = 675

This year, it will be assessed at 60%

$750 * .6 = $450

The info for how it's calculated is here:

"I'm not sure if you're looking for an answer still, but just in case:

Excise tax is a form of PPT. For your car, it's the only local tax you need to worry about. 

The reason it went up in February is because that's when the payment is due to the city. It is pro-rated to the length of time your car was registered in Malden in 2020. 

Unfortunately, few finance companies make clear your obligation about excise tax. A few years ago my wife and I were finishing up a 4 year lease and were hit with the entire excise tax bill for the lease period. We now understand it was our responsibility to know about it, but we had no starting point. 

Your excise tax bill ought to have been an additional $30-$60/month last year if it was a 2019 model, and will be $15-$40/month this year, and even less next year. 

Depending on how cool your leasing company is, you can calculate how much in excise you have left in your lease term, divide that amount by the number of months remaining in your lease term, and add it to your payment. That helps spread out the cost.",t2_26sszazj,maamyoudontknowme,0,1591228460.0,0,t1_fsszi2t,fsszi2t,True,eitakesor,t3_gdnzca,https://www.reddit.com/r/malden/comments/gdnzca/help_with_personal_property_tax_and_excise_tax/,Help with Personal Property Tax and Excise Tax,/r/malden/comments/gdnzca/help_with_personal_property_tax_and_excise_tax/fsszi2t/,1,r/malden,0,1

">Malden — where the average one-bedroom now costs $1,960 — had the fastest-growing rent between January 2019 and 2020, up 15.3%

I'm guessing that this average increase is largely driven by additional units added to the top end, rather than an across the board increase in the price of existing units. I.e.: the new units opening in Malden Center, which are obviously high rent 

The article seems to agree with this hypothesis:

Recycling in this country is experiencing a reckoning and I don’t think single stream is going to be any benefit.

> Some noteworthy features of the new location include:
 
> *  **Picnic Table Hall** – The interior of the establishment will feature open picnic-table style seating and a fire pit where customers can stand in line and pick out their Redbones barbeque.
 
> *    **Outdoor Beer Garden** – There will also be a spectacular deck outside the restaurant for beer garden activities.
 
> *    **Full Service Bar** – Similar to the original Redbones in Davis Square in Somerville, the new bar will have the same selection of craft beer, margaritas, and more.
 
> *    **Redbone’s Nano Brewery** – The most exciting feature of the new location, as Redbones will have their own Nano brewery as part of their first venture into craft beer brewing.
