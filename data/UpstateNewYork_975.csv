Vinny told me they were always ready to run it and gun it off the staties showed up. We lost Dave Shanks to a deputy with a grudge and some trumped up tax evasion charges. He did three years in Elmira and came back having found Mormonism in the clink. That put and end to his brewing days.

This is a great breakdown. Could you go a bit more into the net time and money cost of pleading not guilty? I'm genuinely curious how the two approaches stack up, and it's often hard to find clear numbers. Let's say pleading guilty to a speeding ticket costs you $200 out of pocket.

"Independent contractors can voluntarily opt into the NYS Paid Family Leave by purchasing a disability and PFL policy, although she would have already had to have done this as there are opt-in deadlines and waiting periods. Disability would pay for her being unable to work before birth. After the birth, PFL would be able to kick in. https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/self-employed-individuals

However, if you work in NYS and have been with your employer for 26 or more weeks full time / 175 days part time, you can apply for bonding leave once the baby is born. Bonding leave can be taken anytime within the first 12 months for up to 12 weeks at 67% of your pay: https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/eligibility and https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/bonding-leave-birth-child

Unfortunately due to the nature of how disability and PFL is funded, if you or your employer are not already paying into the system, you won't be able to utilize it. If she is going to remain an independent contractor, it might be beneficial to start a disability/PFL policy for any future issues (especially as it can take up to 2 years for the PFL policy to be able to pay out).",t2_6jw5j,rowan72,0,1647990721.0,0,t1_i1q5o9y,i1q5o9y,True,gazingjar,t3_tk7dim,https://www.reddit.com/r/upstate_new_york/comments/tk7dim/does_my_wife_qualify_for_unemploymentdisability/,Does my wife qualify for unemployment/disability after giving birth if she is an independent contractor in NYS,/r/upstate_new_york/comments/tk7dim/does_my_wife_qualify_for_unemploymentdisability/i1q5o9y/,2,r/upstate_new_york,0,2

"If she's been paying into some system for either, then yes, if not, then probably not is my best guess.

Unemployment insurance and disability insurance are both programs that employers pay into (or provide some conduit by which they may arrange for employees to purchase it for themselves, typical broken up into short term disability and long term disability insurances, and they aren't cheap) so it may very well depend on what the employer is offering.  

One of the major reasons independent contractors are used though is because the costs of benefits and many other costs fall on the individual/employee rather than the business/employer.

">Visit in the winter and mud season to see if you like It first.

I've told people EXACTLY this, whether its north country NY or anywhere in VT. Spring is kinda gross and depressing here. Lots of wet, lots of mud, lots of sand on the edge of your property from the salt trucks. Snow totals vary quite a bit depending on where in north country you are. 

The cold is also WAY different in certain areas. For instance, where I live, there is a 10 degree difference even just 5 miles away, simply because we are in a basin. It's not uncommon for us to hit -20F in Jan/Feb, -30F with wind chill. There is no keeping your place toasty at those temps lol.

"I live just north of Saranac Lake - if you have any specific questions regarding the area, don't be afraid to DM me!

To quickly answer some of your questions in order:

\- Saranac Lake will feel small to anyone moving from an actual city. It will feel more like a small town.

\- Lifestyle in Saranac Lake is very much the typical ADK lifestyle with some younger vibe in areas. Hard to explain, but each of the lake towns have a certain atmosphere to them that can't quite be explained. 

\- You said you like nature, which is good because the area caters to that lifestyle. You have tons of trails all over and lots of mountains to conquer. You have Pauls Smith right nearby too that will have events all the time as well.

\- Schools are decent, there are better, but Saranac Lake isn't bad by any means. Pretty standard school district for the ADK region IMHO, nothing really sticks out with them to me. You will see more rivalry between Plattsburgh, Saranac, NAC, etc... than you will Saranac Lake.

\- Property values are skewed all over this area because each spot has its own charm. For instance, I live on a lot worth $100k with 15 acres, 4 bed, 2 bath, cottage style home. Just across the street that is towards the lake, houses double in value simply because they can see the lake. Lakefront property goes up even further. Definitely want to get a realtor who knows the area well because some people overvalue their property, especially with how the market is now. Lots of downstaters like to come up and buy vacation property, so some people try to cash in on that.",t2_6e6pj,SlateRaven,0,1646876461.0,0,t1_i01vnq2,i01vnq2,True,wizardyourlifeforce,t3_ta9upb,https://www.reddit.com/r/upstate_new_york/comments/ta9upb/anyone_live_in_saranac_lake/,anyone live in Saranac Lake?,/r/upstate_new_york/comments/ta9upb/anyone_live_in_saranac_lake/i01vnq2/,4,r/upstate_new_york,0,4

"Sorry, I’m not a milk expert, but I am a milk enthusiast who prefers local sourcing! I’m in Albany right now, and Byrne Dairy is a great supplier of milk for western NY (and whoever supplies Stewart’s milk, credit there too) BUT I whole heartily prefer the dairy from Hudson Valley.

Ronnybrook Farm Dairy has the creamiest, most fullest tasting whole milk out there. It’s so dense it comes with a little milk fat you have to skim off the top sometimes. I swear by this milk

Battenkill is also good, but is far away- also not Hudson Valley based.

As for your “macro upstate” … so you’re assuming the rest of the NY state uses NYC as its metaphorical North Star? 

Because actual Upstate, is linked in many ways to NYC, obviously less the farther north you go, but a large population of actual people in real Upstate are tied to NYC or “down state.” 
And people in buffalo most likely have more in common with people in Pittsburgh and Toronto than they do with NYC. So to say Buffalo is Upstate, which we all know and use the term for up the state from NYC, is wrong. You’re just saying everything in NY state, north of NYC, would be upstate.

There are so many beautiful and affordable houses in Albany itself, which is what I think you’re looking at, but those will stay low in price because because the school district is well funded (awful teacher salaries though) but has meh outcomes.

"The primary industries in the Capital Region have been government (including military) work, healthcare and education for a long time so there's an economic stability here that's allowed the area to mostly withstand the rust belt decay that's hammered Western and Central New York over the past 60 years. 

The actual cities of Albany, Schenectady and Troy aren't fountains of wealth but the amoeba of suburbs that surround them (like Colonie, where you saw Trader Joes, Latham, Niskayuna)  have good schools and nice neighborhoods. The cities are all down about 30% from their peak population count in the 1950's but the recent census showed the decline has finally stopped and even indicated modest growth for all three since 2010. Steady and relatively unexciting development is the Albany way!

The real growth is happening just north in Saratoga County.  It's not exploding in the same way that cities in the US Southwest are but it's the only upstate county outside of the lower Hudson region that I'd classify as thriving.  Global Foundries in Malta keeps expanding and bringing in this higher income, higher education workforce while Saratoga Springs has been a tourist destination and second home for wealthy folks for a long time. I don't know that it's statistically significant but anecdotally, as someone who works a local builder, there definitely seems to be a steady stream of tri-state area folks headed north.

He’s got zero tolerance for tint now; risking a fine and getting shut down. I was legal at 35% (to match the factory rear) and even tried without doors (Jeep Wrangler).

"For context, here's a regional breakdown according to the US Census Bureau.

""In counties in the Northeast, the average of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree was 29.8%, compared to 25.4% for those in the West, 21.9% for Midwest counties, and 19.7% for counties in the South. Counties in the Northeast had the fastest rate of growth (4.2 percentage points) over the 15- year period compared to slower rates in the counties in the other regions - Midwest (3.6 percentage points), West (3.1 percentage points), and South (3.0 percentage points).""

So that gives us:

19 above average counties 

28 perfectly cromulent counties in line with the national average

10 counties that resemble Alabama

This all tracks with what I know, love and loathe about our state.

"Someone else suggested it below but I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and *totally* fell in love with Ithaca in college. 

In all honesty, idk about it being warmer elsewhere in upstate but I don’t know that it’s much warmer. A bit warmer than Albany/Schenectady area in my experience but not sure otherwise. 

I will admit too that it’s potentially a bit pricier than elsewhere in upstate but, being from the Bay, I’m definitely not the best perspective on that.

* Will we have a mild winter or a cooler summer. Not uncommon to have winters where it’s in the 30s and 40s and dips below freezing a couple times per month. Coming from Texas you might never end up using the AC. Only a few days where it gets above 90 per year.

Sounds like you might like the outer Buffalo suburbs. Plenty of land and the outer towns are still declining in population.

Lots of hunting spots in the Southern Tier. The rural counties surrounding Buffalo are all pretty conservative, with some liberal college towns and resort towns thrown in. Tends to be more fiscal conservatives than religious conservatives.",t2_3lku2,Eudaimonics,0,1644289373.0,0,t1_hw17ttm,hw17ttm,True,damnyankeeintexas,t3_sk7pm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/upstate_new_york/comments/sk7pm3/possible_move_to_upstate_from_houston_texas/,"Possible move to Upstate from Houston Texas, expenses questions",/r/upstate_new_york/comments/sk7pm3/possible_move_to_upstate_from_houston_texas/hw17ttm/,1,r/upstate_new_york,0,1
