"I would actually like to add that this is kind of a misconception. Our PP in town administers the pill form of abortions (commonly used to terminate pregnancies that are under 10 weeks) 
I know this because I took one of those pills there! And I just want to add that the medical professionals and staff are so wonderful and sensitive.

Society as a whole views abortion as acceptable under certain circumstances.  We know this because it is legal and has been for 50 years.

"Absolutely agree! PP offers a wide variety of services including family planning like you mentioned, as well as sexual health screenings, PrEP for hiv prevention, and hormone reassignment therapy for trans people. And just a fun fact, PP is already legally not allowed to use any federal funding for abortions, and when their budget gets cut the first things to go are their community outreach and education programs. Our PP actually had a sex ed program for teenagers about 5 years ago, that taught COMPREHENSIVE sex ed instead of abstinence based sex ed. It discussed all types of sex, sexualities, the various forms of birth control, the specifics of how/where STIs can be transferred, and more than anything promoted educated, safe, healthy sex instead of the traditional “if you have sex you’ll get pregnant or die of aids, so don’t have sex until you’re married :)” curriculum that MOST teachers teach. Studies have shown that comprehensive based sex ed is more effective in preventing STIs and pregnancy than abstinence based programs. And when PP’s budget was cut back in 2016/2017, this sex education program was cut all across Montana, with the exception of Missoula. 
ESSENTIALLY, when people are anti PP because of abortion, they are really just making the issue worse by stopping people from getting the services and education they need to prevent unwanted pregnancy in the first place.",t2_5s542a7r,sassy-tornadoes,0,1648231016.0,0,t1_i23dl5t,i23dl5t,True,logonomics,t3_tnn0i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFalls/comments/tnn0i8/to_the_prolife_protestors_showing_up_at_planned/,To the “pro-life” protestors showing up at Planned Parenthood on Ninth St,/r/GreatFalls/comments/tnn0i8/to_the_prolife_protestors_showing_up_at_planned/i23dl5t/,15,r/GreatFalls,0,15

I moved here from a city surrounding portland and honestly love the area. Only negative things about great falls are the lack of popular shops and food places. I have been here a few years and constantly drive to some of the bigger cities for things I can’t get here. I’m also a big outdoorsman and there is plenty of activities to do very close by.

"Great Falls is a blue-collar town and is always about 20 years ""behind the trends."" It's dry, windy, and can be bitterly cold in the winter. The shining jewel of town is the Calumet refinery built on the river, the Air Force base, and the County Prison on top of the hill before you come into town. Lots of turnover here because of the conditions and because of the Air Force. Also a much older population than say Bozeman, Kalispell, or Missoula. There is also a heavily statistically under-represented Native American population that has moved here from off the Rez and a few can be troublesome, but there are just as many (or more) troublesome white people here as well. We also have a larger percentage of Black people in Great Falls than all of the other Major cities in Montana ...except maybe Billings. EDIT: We also have a small but established group of Koreans that live here and you see them mostly running restaurants. I am not being racist or trying to sound superior, I am just sharing my observations of growing up here and also having lived in other parts of the state and the people in those areas.

In my observations, the native troublemakers mostly steal/shoplift in broad daylight from stores and the white troublemakers are more inclined to be meth heads wandering the streets in the middle of the night stealing whatever isn't bolted down from your yard so they can hawk it for more drug money. People have had their holiday decorations stolen, outdoor furniture, barbecues, etc. There are parts of town that are better than others for crime, I'd stay away from Downtown/Central Great Falls and some parts of the Northwest Side/Riverview. Abandoned vehicles are also very common in Great Falls, you'll usually find at least one every dozen blocks or so. The volunteer police division is pretty good about tagging them for removal though if you report them and keep a log of how long they have been sitting on the street.

That said, there are lots of very decent, good-natured people (of all races) here and Great Falls has a heavy Catholic presence and attributes much of it's origins to the Sisters of Providence.

You also get to see the military running convoys through town on occasion hauling nukes/doing drills from the local missile silos...

"I just drove here on Monday from Spokane, WA in a 2wd car and honestly would not recommend (during the winter). Maybe it's because I was on my own but it was scary AF. Very difficult if not experienced in those conditions. Perhaps at least stopping in Missoula for a night would've been better. But once you're here, driving around in the snow is fine, fortunately everyone drives slow. However on the mountain passes, more experienced drivers in 4wd insist on passing you at high speeds which can be stressful.

Anyway, I haven't explored much but I quite like it here so far. Not used to being in a small town nor where it snows / is so cold. Happy to experience something entirely different. It's a fun adjustment. Most people have been friendly or give off the minding-their-own-business vibe which is fine.

"Arrived in Great Falls in 2002, after spending 35 years living in many places (SF Bay, San Antonio, Ohio, Florida, SoCal, and more). I was stunned at how amazing the community was and is. Overall - the friendliest people I have ever met. And Great Falls is not so small that it doesn't have ""modern"" conveniences (DoorDash! Instacart!), and not big enough to cause major traffic, long lines, etc. Plenty of fun things to do - indoors and outdoors - lots of new eateries (and a few classics from decades ago), museums, events, etc. Natural beauty is in ever direction. And the other large Montana towns are close enough for easy day-trips if you want to check them out - same for skiing :-) Crime is not something that has ever worried me - had a police scanner stolen from my (unlocked) vehicle a few years ago, but that's it.

"There certainly is some cool stuff an hour or more away, people tend to round up even if it’a only like 20 minutes, but just out of town as opposed to being in great falls itself. That being said, there is a dog park I used to go to quite frequently with my pup on rivers edge trail (queue the Segway) which happens to be a sweet walk along the river all through town. Something I really took advantage of in my younger years on a bike with friends. A big issue with Montana (and I mean that literally) is just the pure landmass of the state itself. For example, the southeast corner is closer to texas than it is to the northwest corner. Because of this, a fair amount of people only know some of the bigger landmarks or sights/attractions. Those that really could even explain more than me probably aren’t on Reddit too much. 

With all of this being said, I don’t want you to come in with too high of an expectation or you may be disappointed. Gf is quirky, can be a bit gross, and certainly has its downsides. I just think most people have on rose colored glasses when it comes to their own areas and don’t want to grow to love it like it deserves.

"Hello from a born and raised Great Falls native!

A lot of people in Montana will have something to say about GF, but it seems to be very rarely positive. I love to hear these critiques, but rarely do they hold water. 

In terms of crime, it is on par with most of the state. It is important to note that certain parts of town are worse than others as stated in the reply above. Locals will give you crap for being from somewhere else, but as stated in every sub related to Montana, as long as you don’t try to bring your home state policies and ideals with you, it will never be more than in good fun. 

There is much more of a “night life” scene than in the past with the newberry bringing in some artists like plain white tees, hinder, red jumpsuit apparatus as well as some bigger country names like joe nichols. There is some seriously fantastic food options which people seem to forget. (Smoked, roadhouse, 5 on black, the block, along with a ton of breweries which have delicious food). Not to mention the classics like best wok, taco treat, and of course Howard’s pizza. 

It also has some of the most fascinating history of anywhere I have been but I will allow you to look into that more so I don’t spoil anything. 

The big plus for Great falls, and something most people who leave either don’t have interest in or don’t understand the value of is the outdoor scene. The Missouri River runs through the middle of town, the smith is a coveted float trip for many, access to some of the best fishing and hunting in the nation within a short drive of town. life in the plains with the Rockies just 30 minutes west and the high wood mountains with the sluice box state park 30 minutes to the east. That’s just the tip of the ice berg.

"I was born and raised in GF and love it! I live out of state now but just went home about 3 weeks ago for New Years. In the past few years, the night life (especially downtown) has improved and there are a lot of cool bars in the downtown area, and even a nightclub-esque venue that opened less than a year ago. There is also a tiki-themed dive bar downtown that has mermaids! 

Great Falls is definitely more conservative, and has a big military presence due to Malmstrom Air Force Base. If you are looking for a more liberal part of Montana, Bozeman and Missoula are great choices.

Living an hour outside of Great Falls makes it more practical to do our food shopping in bulk.  My family is also from out of state, but we learned to live like the locals and didn't bring our original states politics with us.  Out here it is a ""mind your own business"" mentality.  The one thing that Montanans seem to dislike the most are out of staters that come in and buy up housing, driving up the housing costs so that native Montanan's can no longer afford to buy them.  At least for us, we don't fall into that camp;  we moved here (escaped our previous, miserable state) by racking up debt in order to do so... we are still renting and are years away from being able to purchase a house (if ever).  At least renting a house on a working ranch gave me a crash course in Montana living.  I also help out when I can on the ranch, which is hard but rewarding work.

"My wife is a teacher and she has a 40 mile commute to work... I work from home (thankfully have decent internet), so it isn't an issue for me.  Everything is a drive for us though... food shopping is about an hour away (Great Falls) as our local grocery store is a joke -the new owners are out of staters (originally from Idaho, Utah or Oregon, I forget which) that don't give a crap about their employees (my wife worked for them for a short time, which was miserable) and they are driving the multiple stores they own in Montana into the ground.  For instance, these owners think it's ok to sell food way past the ""best buy"" date at full price, they sell moldy bread and produce, they refuse to use computerized inventory management which in turn they can't keep basic items stocked (heck, the last grocery store they bought had the computerized inventory management and they ripped it all out... now that store is garbage).  So... back to the main point... proper food shopping is about an hour away (got a little sidetracked there).  Finding a good paying job can be difficult, so I suggest finding a job BEFORE moving here.  A lot of jobs in the more rural areas tend to be low paying or minimum wage jobs.

"Grew up in Great Falls in late 90's and left in 2007. I have been back twice since then (still live in MT). \*Disclaimer\* my opinions are that of my own. 

**People**

Great Falls is a blue collar town. Lots of working class folks who are all pretty chill but still have some MT grit to them. Politics have certainly divided folks there but for the most part people still get along pretty well. In Montana, its our cultural pastime to complain about the wind and out of staters. People may rib you for being out of state, but I have never seen straight animosity towards anyone. People in MT are generally very welcoming and friendly. 

**Crime**

Great Falls definitely has some good areas of town and some not-so-good areas of town. You should research which areas are which prior to purchasing a home. In general Downtown (central ave & 5th st) can be sketchy, which is a shame because it has so much potential. Violent crime and property crime has risen in recent years, but its still on par with national averages. 

**Nightlife**

Not much going on here compared to other cities with better music/arts venues. If your not frequenting bars and casinos, then options are a little limited. Maybe its improved since 2007?

**Outdoors**

Mountain biking along the rivers edge is awesome. Other than that, its a bit of a drive to the big belts, showdown ski area, Holter lake, or the Missouri river (Craig area) for great recreation. An hour drive is pretty common to any of these places. You honestly get used to it (at least I did when I was a kid).",t2_38ikpzyf,TigersL0VETuna,0,1643659283.0,0,t1_hv1c005,hv1c005,True,Then-Vermicelli-1684,t3_sh92v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFalls/comments/sh92v0/hello_people_of_great_falls/,Hello people of Great Falls,/r/GreatFalls/comments/sh92v0/hello_people_of_great_falls/hv1c005/,16,r/GreatFalls,0,16

"Montana law does not allow withholding money for cleaning charges unless the landlord gives the departing tenant written notice of cleaning which needs to be done, and gives the tenant 24 hours to complete the cleaning. A landlord also cannot withhold money for cleaning or damages unless the landlord gives the tenant, within 30 days after the tenancy is terminated, a written list of any rent due and damage and cleaning charges. 

Note that they are not allowed to charge for  “Normal Wear and Tear”, defined as deterioration that occurs as a result of use for which the rental unit is intended and without negligence, carelessness, accident, or misuse or abuse of the premises or contents by the tenant or members of his household, or their invitees or guests. It can include minor issues, such as gently worn carpets, loose door handles, fading wall paint and flooring, stained bath fixtures, lightly scratched glass and dirty grout that occur naturally as a result of the tenant using the property as it’s designed to be used.

"Great Falls is seen as the last (urban) holdout of Old West Montana. Not the mining town Old West, the agricultural Old West. A lot of the locals see what's happened to other Montana cities and they are reactionary to efforts that try to attract in-migrants. For example, the new conspiratorial resistance to the [Big Sky Country National Heritage](https://www.bigskycountrynha.org/) Area designation. That prevalent and, politically supported, sentiment doesn't facilitate the kind of urban environment you seem to desire. These people want their kids to be able to move back home and that's about it for newcomers. If they could, they'd try to turn back time to 1960-something and keep GF stuck in Pleasantville. GF has improved over the past decade but it's slow going because of the conservative resistance to change here. If you want immediate gratification, you should probably move somewhere else.

They also state you get 30% off childcare if you work there. Which is $900/month. 

So lets assume you work 40 hr/week at $10/hr. You make $1600 BEFORE taxes, insurance etc. 

Realistically I bet you take home $900/month AFTER taxes and your health insurance premiums. 

Then you pay $600/month (that’s the discounted rate) to put your child in school there.

"Id like to reply as someone who did similar.  We left a big city to move here.  I used to travel an hour each way for work and it was only 10 miles each way.  Now its 10 to 15 minutes anywhere around town.

Crime is up but thats anywhere, like others said lock up your stuff and you will be fine.  The major occuring crime is theft.

We have 2 walmarts and other stores around town.  Dont have to drive out of town for groceries.  We are also able to drive out if town to go camping fairly easily.  I personally dont like to visit the cities on a single day as 8 hours roundtrip can be a lot of sitting.  We usually get a hotel and spend a whole day out there instead.

Definitely different from the big cities but so worth the quality of life improvements.  Are you used to cold weather?

Great Falls is a decent little town that has activities to do. Especially during the holidays and such where the city will have fun little events.

"Depends on how much you want to pick through the pros and cons lol. Like the other guy said there's been a nice influx of more game businesses which is great, if you like the outdoors there's miles of trails, parks, and some more great things that you have to spend a little time driving to. There's an axe throwing place that's pretty fun, if your a social drinker there are plenty of bars to go out and meet people at (sadly too many of them lol) there's not much to do if your in certain age ranges but overall I'm honestly surprised with how much it's gotten better. Depending upon when you move here and if covid let's up you might even be here when the fair comes around.

As far as people go there's plenty that are fun, welcoming, and overall great people but there are also plenty of snakes around here so I'd tread with a little caution as well. Plenty of people around here can be too much drama sometimes lol.

"Born and raised here, spent summers living in other cities in and around the state and my conclusion is... there are better places and also worse.

What makes it worse here though is people have a knack for backhanded ""compliments"" their tone will say more than the actual words they say.

On religion there are some welcoming churches but then there are some where I'm pretty sure most of its flock will be burning next to me lol

 On jobs I agree with the guy earlier because there are a lot of jobs....just not much that give a livible wage outside of certain fields.

With activities If your outdoorsy there's trails around the river after that unless you're really dedicated to a something this place gets boring fast.


And as far as politics go.......no one here can have a difference of opinion without someone getting bent out of shape to high hell and turning it into a screaming match...

It’s more fun in the summer, but can still be enjoyed as apart of the Rivers Edge Trail during the “winter” we are having! If you like history, I would check out the CM Russell Museum, History Museum, and The Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center . CM Russell is a famous painter from the area, and the museum is a nice art museum showcasing many artists! The History museum is more about the history of the area. The Lewis and Clark Center is about Lewis and Clark and their experience traveling through the area. Our Downtown has some fantastic dining like The Block, Enbar, Burger Bunker, and Taco Del Sol. If you want some drinks, the Sip n Dip is a cool nationally recognized bar that features Mermaids swimming behind the bar! Hopefully that’s a good start for you!

* Don't fear pressing the brake, abs will apply the brakes just enough to prevent slipping.

* Don't brake/accelerate and steer at the same time, wheels have much more braking force/traction when they are straight.

* If you must steer during a skid, be prepared to snap the wheel straight if it suddenly regains traction, the counter-steer will put you in even less control

"I think if you’re the type who cultivates relationships such as close friendships etc., I think as with anywhere else you will find good, worthwhile people to have in your life.

Wife and I are both white and don’t exactly feel like we fit in, being born and raised/lived most of our lives in Southern California. In that setting, there are so many people of various backgrounds intermingling that the people everywhere are just other people.

In a place like Great Falls, anyone who isn’t white stands out. That isn’t to say that people are harassed and gawked at. I’m sure that does happen, but it’s more like a quality that will be noticed as different. I think you might have a much better understanding of what that is like than I would, as my differences with the population of the town are not physical.

Lots of Republicans and conservative minded folk, and lots of libertarian types, but it’s not like a liberally-minded portion of the population doesn’t exist, and not everyone is a stereotypical Trumpet firing their guns in the air. However, there are *some* folks like that; more of them are just people with conservative values. Not robe-wearing KKK, but people who don’t want to pay taxes, people who value the philosophies of independence and self-sufficiency. Those can be honorable good people or absolute pieces of shit, just like any other group of people. 

Most of the population is similar, so their own weaknesses and shortcomings are less apparent, and they have less of a reason to have experience with different cultures or be imaginative  enough to conceive of how people who are different as a category can also be just fine.

We like it here. We miss our family and friends more than anything, and while we’ve made some good ones here there’s just no substitute for the people we love most in life. It’s affordable for me (registered nurse) and we love Montana. People from similar backgrounds to me would probably prefer to live in Bozeman or Missoula.

The issue of our children and their education/future is a good one. I think it is foolish to believe that they would be at a real disadvantage having been born in Great Falls, but they also have 2 university-educated, degree-holding, professional parents. That matters FAR more, and is really a separate issue.

">Id like to know whats the diversity like in Great Falls?

Great Falls is a little more diverse than most of the rest of Montana due to the close proximity to several indigenous reservations. Great Falls is a service hub for these communities and is also the home of the landless Little Shell tribe. The rest of the diversity is largely due to Malmstrom AFB. Some employers in the area bring some diversity such as Benefis (the hospital) and the small colleges might provide a little diversity as well. One thing you will find, as a result, is that the diversity here is very transient. Most people come here and stay a little then leave. The only people that really seem to stay are the ones who grew up here. According to the 2019 Census estimates on Great Falls, the black community makes up 0.9% of the population. With an estimated population of 58,835, that means there's only about 530 black folks here. I wouldn't call that diverse.

>Are people overly racist?

I'm not sure what *overly* racist looks like to you but I can tell you about a couple who are friends of my wife and I. They are an interracial couple and both work in the medical field. They are about to have a child and, after the last state election, they decided to move within the next two years. They've shared stories about their treatment by people here and the election result was the final blow. They do not feel welcome in this community. There's an overwhelming majority of ""Back the Blue,"" ""Blue Lives Matter,"" ""Trump"" signage on cars, yards, and houses. Rarely will you see anything like a BLM sign or other symbol of civil rights issues. The county (Cascade County) is far worse than Great Falls in this respect but Great Falls has too much of it for my comfort. The racism has probably always been there but it was hidden before. Now, these people are proud of it and want to show their colors.

>Are there job and business opportunities for blacks?

I knew of two black business owners. One was a married couple (veterans) that opened up a barber shop (they closed the shop and moved away). Another owned a Carib-Jamaican restaurant that was wonderful (they closed and moved away). I think their businesses did just fine but they didn't feel compelled to stay in this community and I think that says something. A lot of the good employment opportunities here are got through nepotism and cronyism. There's a good ol'boys club here. This is especially the case in the county. Unless you work in agriculture, military contracting, or medical services there's not a lot living wage jobs. There's plenty of jobs available, they just aren't good jobs.

>Do people openly carry guns?

On occasion you will see someone doing open carry because, deep down inside, they are a frightened chihuahua trapped inside a human body. There's a strong ""2A"" cult presence here and for a sample of it you can check out the Facebook feed of one of the local gun stores [Mitchell Supply](https://www.mitchellsupply.com/). Full disclosure: I own several firearms and hunt.

>What can I expect?

Expect to have a hard time fitting in and [expect your children to be set back in life](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/03/upshot/the-best-and-worst-places-to-grow-up-how-your-area-compares.html) merely for having been raised here. My wife and I are not minorities but our political views alienate us in this community. We are also not Christian. If you are Christian, you might find welcome arms in the churches but I can't speak to that.

"Not quite.

So as a military brat, I went to a middle school, Jr High School, High School, and Sr High School.

High School is typically any school that holds 9-12 grades. A Sr High typically only hold 10-12 or 11-12, and a Jr High is basically a middle school that includes 9th grade.

Most school systems won't have both a Middle School and a Junior High, because the inconsistency in where 9th grade is located causes problems if you have some students coming from a middle school without it and others from a Jr High that had it. There's overlap, but they're not quite the same thing. And that's not just pedantic - as I said, I ended up going to all four types as I moved roughly 11-12 times by the time I graduated 12th grade. The focus of a middle school is very different from that of a Jr High.

So while they used the same name, Paris Gibson Jr High and Paris Gibson Middle School are two separate institutions. The two terms aren't casually interchangeable, and it's not the same institution simply using two slightly different names.

Anyways, it doesn't matter.

"[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Gibson_Square_Museum_of_Art) says that the building was built in 1950 as Central Catholic High School, but closed in 1973. It became PGMS in 1976:

“The junior high school vacated the premises in June 1975 for a new building at 2400 Central Avenue.[23] Several local Catholic parishes joined together in the late 1940s to construct a Catholic high school, named Great Falls Central High School. The low brick, steel, glass, and plaster building, constructed in 1950, occupied half a city block next to the Ursuline Academy. Two large wings were added in 1966. However, the building closed in 1973 due to lower enrollment, rising costs, and fewer volunteer priests and nuns to act as teachers. The Great Falls Public Schools purchased the structure in 1975 for $1.4 million. It spent another $800,000 renovating the building and adding an industrial arts wing on the southwest corner. Paris Gibson Junior High moved there in 1976 from the old high school building.[24]”",t2_6lrjwp9,giddycharm,0,1611724675.0,0,t1_gkwza37,gkwza37,True,JakeFromSkateFarm,t3_l5wjy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFalls/comments/l5wjy2/anyone_familiar_with_paris_gibson_middle_school/,Anyone familiar with Paris Gibson Middle School?,/r/GreatFalls/comments/l5wjy2/anyone_familiar_with_paris_gibson_middle_school/gkwza37/,4,r/GreatFalls,0,4

"(let the downvotes commence)

The article in itself is political ... just look at the source ""NPR.""  I choose not to wear masks (I don't even own one)...but... I never leave the ranch we live on, so don't throw your hissy-fits.  My wife does the shopping (once per month) and she will wear a mask when required.  I don't have a problem with health care workers, I have a problem with health care workers that try spewing their political B.S.  I don't care what side of the isle you are on, health care should not involve politics.  Being that this is a logical comment, I'll probably get downvoted - has happened already (some people tend to not actually read/understand the entire comment, they just see one thing they don't agree with and immediately downvote).  I've already had the Chinese Wuhan disease... so has my wife... no big deal for us... just a couple of days that sucked.  Yes, I know, it affects people differently.  My wife is a teacher and she picked up the Wuhan disease at her school, making ""packets"" for her students when nobody was near her (school was closed) and she was wearing her mask.  Masks are a joke... all you need to stop the spread are face shields - if you sneeze, a plastic face shield blocks more than a mask... yet, the health department ""dictated"" that face shields were no longer ""good enough,"" and you had no choice but to wear a mask.  Funny, she didn't get sick when around others for months (and while school was in session) that were confirmed to have the Wuhan disease, it wasn't until she was required to wear a mask instead that she got sick (and spread it to me)... no, she didn't get it from somewhere else, as she ONLY went to the school once after 3 weeks of the school being closed... and had gone nowhere else... no shopping, and no visitors either...  

My point is... masks hardly do anything, there are better options like face shields... though, with this virus, it will get you no matter what you do, even if you live on a ranch far away from people and are a recluse like me...

I wish we could be civil with each other again and have the ability to work together... unfortunately that doesn't seem likely given the political climate.  

This is not a pandemic, btw, it doesn't meet the definition.

You can eat and drink before taking flight and wear the mask the whole flight for a trip to Arizona. It's not a long flight. They were looking for conflict just like all these other Trump goons and, when they had to suffer the consequences of their immaturity, they got kicked off. Suddenly, they're the victims now.

That sounds like a made up name for a place in the Supernaturals TV series.  


""Bob Kelly, the mayor, said people had not been overly worried about how the jail outbreak might affect the rest of town when it started.

“I think that by the very definition of a jail, **hopefully, the disease will be incarcerated**, as well as the patients,” he said. “Is there concern? Sure, there’s concern. But is there overreaction? No.”

OYE!  It's like it's written for a cartoon strip.  I sure hope that poor doctor who's been working 16 hour/day doesn't get sick.

COVID aside, the saddest part for me is how the inmates are treated.

To me, this seems inhumane.  Why aren't there enough beds there?

"Well, according to the Montana Recall Act, the office of City Commissioner is subject to recall on the following grounds: ""Physical or mental lack of fitness, incompetence, violation of the oath of office, official misconduct, or conviction of a felony offense enumerated in Title 45 are the only grounds for recall. A person may not be recalled for performing a mandatory duty of the office that the person holds or for not performing any act that, if performed, would subject the person to prosecution for official misconduct.""

According to Article III, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution as well as Section 7-1-4137 MCA the oath of office for a municipal elected official in Montana is to support, protect and defend the United States and the Montana Constitutions and to discharge the duties of their office with fidelity.

Article II, Part 2, Section 4. of the Montana Constitution reads ""Individual dignity. The dignity of the human being is inviolable. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws. Neither the state nor any person, firm, corporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil or political rights on account of race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas.""

If you can catch him publicly (recording) denying a member of the public of their rights based on LGBTQ status or some other protected status, then you could push for a recall following the process provided in the Montana Recall Act.

I would suggest looking into these laws so you and others can be equipped to hold him accountable for any conduct he performs in official capacity that would make a case for recall.

Edit: Just another FYI, Montana has strong public information laws for public processes. Request all of his communications and documents from his public email and other documented communications. Unless he's really careful, you'll probably find something juicy. Also, I'm not a lawyer and this isn't legal advice.

"Wow, you really get around with this. How many subreddits are you posting this to? I will copypaste my billing post here because you still didn't answer my question as to whether you are even from Montana:

This might be a valid cause but this post seems so sleezeball. I dislike when people try to make political points using emotional language. It's so condescending. People can make their own decisions based on the substance of the bill, they don't need the livejournal blog post about it.

For anyone who cares about the actual substance of this bill without anyone's slant on it:

**Current law**

*MCA Section 7-1-111(9)*

""A local government unit with self-government powers is prohibited from exercising the following: … any power that applies to or affects the right to keep or bear arms, *except that a local government has the power to regulate the carrying of concealed weapons.""*

*MCA Section 45-8-351(2)(a)*

""A county, city, town, consolidated local government, or other local government unit has the power to prevent and suppress the carrying of concealed or unconcealed weapons to a public assembly, publicly owned building, park under its jurisdiction, *or school, and the possession of firearms by convicted felons, adjudicated mental incompetents, illegal aliens, and minors.""*

**Proposed law under LR-130**

*MCA Section 7-1-111(9)*

“A local government unit with self-government powers is prohibited from exercising the following: … any power that applies to or affects the right to keep or bear arms.”

*MCA Section 45-8-351(2)(a)*

""A county, city, town, or local government unit has the power to prevent and suppress the carrying of *unpermitted* concealed weapons or the carrying of unconcealed weapons to a publicly owned and occupied building under its jurisdiction.""

"No problem. I am very sorry to hear that both of your parents have passed. They sound like very amazing and interesting people, and your dad shared many of the hobbies that I enjoy, such as camping, hunting, fishing, and just getting outside, and enjoying the great outdoors in general. 

Thinking about your hypothesis as to how the flyer ended up in the book, I believe that you are right. The back side, which I didn’t show in the pictures, has some writing on it; an address of a Mr. Frank Skeirka, of Pitcher Creek, Alberta, Canada, if I was even able to read that cursive correctly. I believe that it was probably written on the flyer/book mark near the end of her senior year, so she could write to him. I also believe that the flyer could be from the late 50s because as I was told, in 1958, my Grandma left Great falls for Portland, Oregon to attend nursing school, and later marry my grandpa Bernie, who has since passed away in 2013. She would later move in with him in the year 1960, and live with him in the same house that she still lives in today, and have three children, two girls, and one boy, who is my father. I may be wrong, but I believe the flyer to date to 57’, 58’, because it would match the timeline of when your father moved to Great Falls, in 1956. Although if I was told wrong, the flyer could very well be from the early 60s, as you said. 

Anyway, I very much appreciate you telling me about your father, as well as your other friends and family members mentioned. I also find it rather interesting how we are sort of connected, in a way, as my grandma may have very well seen your father in person, or even voted for him at her high school election.",t2_5w20aaoh,ultimatefritzbitz,0,1593127679.0,0,t1_fw0ac9f,fw0ac9f,False,ultimatefritzbitz,t3_heub6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFalls/comments/heub6z/i_was_recently_looking_through_my_grandmas_old/,"I was recently looking through my Grandma’s old books while on vacation at her home in Oregon, when I found this Orange slip of paper, which looks like a 50s voting ballot.

"First I'll tell you it was startling to see this on reddit. I rarely visit this sub, and almost never post with this user name. I mentioned it last night to one of my brothers, and he gave me a little extra information.

The flyer/poster may well be from the 60s. My father was on the school board for - I'm guessing here - at least a decade, and was a member when it was decided to construct CMR high school. 

Dr. Jourdonnais was an orthodontist and family friend. I know of his profession only because he was my orthodontist. Can't really tell you more than that.

From my brother I'm told that Mr. Gray was an attorney. You now know everything I know about him.

Dr. Charles H. Steele was my father. The H was for Harold. He was born in South Dakota to parents who were educators. My grandfather - who I never met - taught high school, eventually making his way to being a college instructor. At the university in Aberdeen, South Dakota is a building named after him, N.E. Steele Hall. My father was the youngest of three brothers, Hugh and Granville.

My father enlisted during World War 2, following which he attended medical school in - I think - Vermilion, SD where he met his future wife/my mother Catherine. They lived in Birmingham, Alabama and Detroit before moving to Great Falls. By then they were parents to two boys and felt Montana would be a better place to raise them. Two more boys were born in Great Falls, the last one being me. 

After working at the Great Falls Clinic my parents opened their own practice; my father was an ear, nose & throat specialist, my mother a dermatologist. They retired in - I want to say '97 - but let's say the late 90s.

You ask what he was like. What is anyone like? We're all simple and complicated and hopefully doing our best. The first answer to your question that comes to mind, though, is he was a good man.

He was raised in the Lutheran church, was politically conservative. He was rural rather than urban. He loved dogs and horses, hunting fishing and camping, his wife Catherine and his 4 sons. 

He was cut of a different cloth than is common now. He was a medical doctor who would take breaks between seeing patients to duck out for a cigarette. He shunned vegetables but loved steak with a ""Bombay gin martini, up with a twist"". In his mind 70s, told to quit smoking his Tareytons, he switched to a pipe which he smoked until the day he died.

As mentioned, he loved dogs and trained them. He loved the pulp fiction westerns of Louis L'amour. He loved to travel - not to Paris or Puerto Vallarta, but rather in his pick-up out on a back road hunting trip, or anywhere he could make an excuse to visit.

He died on April 23, 2008 shortly after returning from a wild turkey hunting trip with one of my brothers. He was cleaning his shotgun when time caught up to him with the news that he'd enjoyed his share of birthdays. He was.88 years old, and I think about him every day.I

I was last in Great Falls this past January for my mother's funeral; she died late last December at the age of 95. En route to the airport afterwards it struck me that I'll probably not return to Great Falls, but I'm glad I saw your post yesterday.

Any other questions, feel free to ask. I'll probably be quitting this user name soon, since I think I've pretty much doxxed myself, but until then, ask away. (The name Heffern is unfamiliar to me, but I'll ask my brothers). My guess as to why the flyer was in the book: probably a bookmark stuck in and forgotten about.
