I am a valid handgun permit owner I was stopped and detained without any suspicion of doing a crime. They said they saw a handgun on my hip and that’s enough. Never been in trouble with the law I served 20 years in the US Army. They had absolutely no right to stop me coming out of cvs on foot walking to my car. They happened to be in the parking lot and saw me come out and saw a handgun on my hip. I personally think they were bored and had nothing better to do. This is the second time this has happened in Elkhart. I frequently go to Indianapolis and have never once had a problem. I work in south bend and have never been detained there unlawfully.

These RVs, if you even watch what was put into them no mater the decade or year they were built, no one would ever buy one.

they are held together using 2x2 and hopes and dreams. Maybe wood glue if you are lucky. the fact that they even charge as much for one is laughable

"Old Farm isn't terrible but like most lower priced apt complexes, there's a lot of young and stupid there.  You're also right in that most nicer apartments will cost more.

It all depends on what you're uncomfortable with and who you are.  If you're just an average Joe with an average car, lock it up and you will probably be just fine.  There are much worse places to live.

"I will help keep an eye out for you in Goshen. Sometimes at the coffee shop or some of the other downtown stores, people will post fliers about looking for roommates. 

Would you be opposed to moving into a house that already has roommates and just has a room available? If I come across any postings. I’ll make sure to let you know. 

This may be a spot if they have any openings. Half of the Hawks building is more affordable and even though it says artists and entrepreneurs, they still often accept others that don’t fit into that category. Here is what they state in their FAQs “Anyone who qualifies for affordable housing may apply to live at The Hawks; but, we give preference to applicants who participate in and are committed to arts and/or entrepreneurship. Applicants do not have to earn their income from their art or business idea.” Such a cool place.

The other half of the Hawks building has just been recently remodeled and made into apartments that are not as budget friendly. They are just now finishing up construction on that other half of the building.

"Hey man, i don’t know much about rentals in Middlebury but check out Goshen which was a big Mexican population including myself lol 👍🏽

I think rentals are hard to find as it’s been a busier real estate market. There’s a new apartment complex called Park 33 Apartments on the east side of Goshen but a quick Google search should give you more options. As to if they have openings is anyone’s guess.

Also, Elkhart county has been my home for my whole life. My family is from Mexico and we speak Spanish to one another, in private and public. There’s nothing to be concerned about. You may have the occasional stare or rude comments but I assure you they are seldom. As with any conversation, I advise staying away from the topic of politics.

"If you’d be willing to commute 10-30 minutes (depending on where you work in Elkhart) you could rent from GT Properties which also has properties in Goshen. I used to live in their Woodhaven apartments. They were small, two-bedroom apartments that for me at the time were $550 a month. Super chill. Everyone kept to themselves. I was there for almost 3 years before buying a house. Shit, I’d still be there if it weren’t for having a kid and needing to buy a house. 

I also made a mistake and rented a trailer for a year. Rent/lot rent was $675 at the time (‘16) but expenses increased quite a bit with utilities as they aren’t built worth a shit. 

Before that I rented a home on Middlebury St in Elkhart. I was naive and didn’t realize how rough that part of town is which accounted for cheap rent. That being said, no one bothered me, but there was plenty of lights and sirens weekly. 

I have friends at North Pointe apartments. Sounds like they pay $800 per month for their two bedroom. No complaints from them. 

Elkhart is fairly sprawled out. You could easily live in another town and still have a short drive to work depending on where that will be. Keep that in mind if you don’t find something you like.

Correct.  But I think that's what they should do.  Mishawaka rd rework that to the overpass and just close 13 tracks.  Link mishawaka to 13 across the tracks.

"Your friend is misguided, honestly. 

The current mayor of Elkhart, Rod Robertson is Black. Three of the City Council members are black, The City Attorney is Hispanic.

This is not a full list ofcourse, just something I looked up with 5 mins of googling. Your friend did not do this prior to solidifying her position and calling the whole town as racist.

I am a first generation immigrant , a brown one at that. I have lived in 3 different cities in America (West Coast, East Coast and now Elkhart). Been in Elkhart for 18 years. Number of racist encounters ...0.

Politically, (like most of Reddit) I skew liberal. But I also do not immediately assume any City, state or person that votes Republican is racist. This is a mistake IMHO. It is difficult to address systemic racism with this false equivalency.

"I have lived here my whole life. Honestly, don't move downtown Elkhart. There is a homeless issue and there is alot of drug use going on with that. I have nothing against people living their life as they choose but when certain areas are being used as a public toilet and you get a brick through your car window because $5 is visible - there's a problem. 

I would try to go to Goshen if you can. Their parks department puts everyone else's to shame. Good restaurants downtown. It's walkable. They did have way more shopping and restaurants than Elkharts downtown but that was pre-covid. Yes they also have homeless and crime but I guarantee you will like it. Plus there was live music at Ignition and Goshen Brewery  pre-covid. Biggest issue is housing. 

I will give Middlebury a ""meh"" - pretty clicky if you ask me. I don't think there is much going on there unless you want to watch Amish or go to some summer festivals?  You could drive from Goshen.

Granger -Mishawaka - South Bend? Yes to all these. Lots to do, places to eat, theater, music and art. Just depends on what kind of job your husband will have if he can make the commute. Morning traffic is busy especially in the winter. If you have to use county roads they are guaranteed to be icy in the mornings.",t2_1350om,zingaro_92,0,1608289319.0,0,t1_gg8oez7,gg8oez7,True,spunkysis,t3_kf9gpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Elkhart/comments/kf9gpz/moving_to_the_northern_indiana_elkhart_area_soon/,Moving to the Northern Indiana / Elkhart area soon — help with location!,/r/Elkhart/comments/kf9gpz/moving_to_the_northern_indiana_elkhart_area_soon/gg8oez7/,4,r/Elkhart,0,4
"If I had to pick one place to live in that area, it'd probably be Granger. It is somewhat centrally located between Elkhart and Mishawaka -- though to be fair, it might be more expensive and it is not in the same county as Elkhart. I actually joined this group because I grew up in Elkhart County, but I have long since moved away to North Carolina. 

I say that because of what comes next: If you've lived in Alabama for a large chunk of your life, be prepared because you're in for a bit of a culture shift, as well as a weather shift. It snows quite a bit in Elkhart, and you will be expected to go to work in the snow. Make sure you have good tread on your tires, and warm coats to wear from November to March. You will need to learn to drive on not-completely-clear pavement. 

As for the culture shift, the southeast vs the midwest is an interesting thing. There are many things in common, and generally you'll probably like it. I feel like people are slightly more friendly in Michiana and many will stand on civility. You should know though that many people in the midwest like a little more personal space and punctuality is generally more expected. One of the reasons I moved to North Carolina was I like to sleep in and discovered that getting to work at 8am meant I was one of the early people.",t2_90c35,baubaugo,0,1608266097.0,0,t1_gg7x40u,gg7x40u,True,spunkysis,t3_kf9gpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Elkhart/comments/kf9gpz/moving_to_the_northern_indiana_elkhart_area_soon/,Moving to the Northern Indiana / Elkhart area soon — help with location!,/r/Elkhart/comments/kf9gpz/moving_to_the_northern_indiana_elkhart_area_soon/gg7x40u/,2,r/Elkhart,0,2

"Churches do in fact have employees - and most of the time it's not just the pastor/minister. There's some finicky bits regarding tax-exempt status that I don't really understand and won't pretend to, but basically the deal is that while tax-exempt organizations don't pay income taxes, employees of these organizations (the three churches mentioned, not including Church World Services, all run schools as well as the ministry) do get taxed on their income, but ministers get X amount of funds towards housing, and anything between what they do spend and X is taxed according to whatever their income is with that. These organizations DO pay property taxes, however, from what I can tell.

Haven't looked into CWS to see but it appears that they're not actually a church but more an evangelical organization that does a whole bunch of outreach, feeding the hungry and doing disaster relief.

In Elkhart, Ind., where the unemployment rate has fallen to just above 2%, for-hire signs sprout everywhere. PHOTOS: DAVID KASNIC FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL; DAVID KASNIC FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL""
Shelley Moore, an Elkhart urban planner, said the city has been in a “race against the clock” to build a more diverse and sustainable economy. The pursuit is complicated by the RV industry’s success.

Jobs are so easy to get that fewer in the region are enrolling in college, a risky bet against another downturn. Elkhart ranks 335th of 380 metro areas in percentage residents with a college degree, the Brookings Institution found.

Enrollment in the Elkhart branch of Ivy Tech Community College has fallen by nearly half since the recession. “We’re up against a great economy,” said Kyle Hannon, executive director of the local campus. “It’s kind of weird.”

But even in good times, memories of the last recession—and fears about the next one—shape business and personal decisions in Elkhart.

Residents squirrel away money, not sure whether to trust the boom. That makes sense, according to Mr. Hicks, the Ball State economist. In the next recession, he said, “they will be clobbered.”

Few RV makers want to invest in factory automation, given the industry’s past peaks and valleys. Without large capital spending, “we are highly variable,” said Robert Martin, Thor’s CEO. “We can ramp down if things get really bad.”

There are almost no places to rent in and around Elkhart, but few builders will risk erecting homes or apartments that will sit empty in what has been a boom-and-bust economy. 

“There are a lot of people with the money here to put up housing,” said Mr. Lippert, the RV parts maker. But with nine years of economic recovery, he said, many say, “What if it ends next year?”

Matt Stump, who builds RVs at Jayco, said he returned to Elkhart in January after living with his family in Peoria, Ill., for 15 years where he worked at Caterpillar . He couldn’t find a rental to house his family, so he stays at a bed-and-breakfast and, on weekends, makes the 4 1/2 hour drive to Peoria.

The housing shortage has sparked “something we haven’t seen in our careers here,” said Mr. Decker, the real-estate broker. “Multiple offers.”

"ELKHART, Ind.—The self-proclaimed RV capital of the world gives a glimpse of what the American economy looks like when operating at full tilt.

High-school students around here skip college for factory jobs that offer great pay and benefits. For-hire signs sprout like roadside weeds. And workers are so flush that car dealers can’t keep new pickups on the lot.

At the same time, the strains are showing. Employers can’t hang on to employees, and house prices are zooming. The worker shortage prompted a local Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant to offer $150 signing bonuses. A McDonald’s failed to open for lunch last fall because managers couldn’t corral enough hands at $8 an hour to serve the lines waiting at the door.


From Bust to Boomtown: Life in a Comeback City

Elkhart, Ind., was once the poster child for the recession. Now the economy is booming thanks to strong sales of RVs, the main industry here. And that's created a new challenge: a shortage of qualified workers. Photo: David Kasnic for The Wall Street Journal
No place in the U.S. has seen a labor-market turnaround like this metropolitan region of 110,000 workers, a mix of blue-collar whites, Mexican immigrants and Amish. “It’s like 1955,” said Michael Hicks,  a Ball State economist. “If you show up and have minimal literacy skills, you can find a job here.”

Elkhart has unique economic conditions—its good fortune is tied to a central role in the revival of the recreational-vehicle market, where neither automation nor foreign competition is a threat.

But the consequences of a high-pressure labor market may soon be common. As the U.S. turns the page on a decade of postcrisis underemployment, Elkhart, Ind., points to a future of labor shortages and fights over workers.

The jobless rate in the Elkhart region plunged from 20% in March 2009, worst in the U.S., to just over 2% in January, half the national average. The local unemployment rate is actually closer to zero: some 9,500 jobs have no takers. Each day, about 25,000 workers commute into Elkhart city, population 50,000. A county economic development agency is hunting for job candidates across Appalachia and as far as Puerto Rico.

The local jobs rebound is the largest among 403 metro areas analyzed for The Wall Street Journal by Moody’s Analytics. As the national unemployment rate drops toward 4%, the Elkhart region has been at that level or below for 34 consecutive months. The rest of the U.S. might never match Elkhart’s sizzling pace, but the region could show what lies ahead.

Average weekly wages overall were up 6.3% in the third quarter of 2017 from a year earlier, the Labor Department said, compared with a 0.6% decline nationally over the same period. In Elkhart’s RV industry, which employs 12% of local workers, average annual salaries in 2016 rose 17% to $68,000. Pay is still going up.

Some job perks sound more Silicon Valley than Rust Belt. LCI industries, an RV parts maker, employs four “dream managers,” counselors who help workers plan vacations or handle family problems. “We want people to have a deeper purpose,” said one manager, John Ferguson, a former minister.

Another company, which makes shelves, advertises a free health clinic to lure new hires.

Chasing scarce workers has fueled inflation elsewhere. Median home prices have risen about 6.5% annually over the past two years, said Gary Decker, former president of Elkhart County’s board of Realtors, about twice as fast as in past recoveries.

Elkhart city, located at the junction of the St. Joseph and Elkhart rivers, is booming in a conservative Midwestern way, said Arvis Dawson, a former Elkhart city council member: “People here make enough money to buy a Cadillac, but they buy Chevys.”

Not at Zeigler Ford. The dealership usually stocks a half-dozen Ford Expeditions, which sell for as much as $85,000, and Lincoln Navigators that top out at $95,000. In February, the pricey SUVs were sold out. The Ford dealer, which usually stocks 20 to 30 top-end F-150 pickups, had three on the lot.

“All the high-line series have taken off,” said Mike Simmons, a sales manager. The tight labor market has created problems in his own office, which is short a full-time worker. The dealership is making do with three part-timers.

Hand made
Jayco Factory 44 looks like a giant woodworking shop, punctuated with the rat-tat-tat of staple guns firing and the buzz of electric saws. The site, which produces $475,000 Entegra motor homes, belongs to Thor Industries Inc.

Thor buys steel chassis, and Jayco workers build the RV housing. Workers push the 45-foot-long motor homes by hand along a rail system. The vehicles move from station to station, where specialists assemble various parts by hand: cabinets, wiring, walls and roofs.


A worker installs the front section and windshield on a recreational vehicle under assembly at a Jayco factory in Elkhart, Ind. Justin Rogers, lower left, installs inside walls. A line worker cuts floor tiles for an RV.
Amish ride their bicycles for the 5 a.m. start of the workday and head home to farms by 1 p.m. Thor, the region’s largest employer, takes extraordinary steps to locate workers. The company seeks prospects in Youngstown, Ohio, and other Midwestern cities with higher unemployment. It also hires county jail inmates in work-release programs.

Looking ahead, the company invites eighth-grade students to visit its plants, and sends finished RVs to tour area grade schools.

The RV industry sets wages at levels others find hard to match: Eight of Elkhart’s 10 largest employers make RVs or RV parts. Workers are paid based on units produced. At full production, that translates to as much as $90,000 a year for assembly workers at RV plants and $100,000 for foremen.

The work is tough. The posting for an assembly job at LCI industries says the work “requires walking, bending, kneeling stooping, crouching, crawling and climbing all day,” plus lifting “items over 50 pounds.”

Older workers gravitate to less demanding jobs at other RV firms that make parts and where the base pay is around $15 to $20 an hour.

Lamont Blackwell, the manager of a local McDonald’s restaurant, said he used to work at LCI for more money. “I have thought about going back, but I can’t keep up,” he said. “I’m 40 years old, and my body is breaking down.

Employees job-hop frequently in this workers’ market. Turnover in the RV industry is roughly 100%, according to local manufacturers. Bonuses of $500 to $1,000 are commonly offered to new hires if they stay 90 days.

Rick Collins, president of Cleer Vision Windows Inc., which makes windows for RVs, said that so few people stick around for three months that he pays a $100 bonus for finishing four weeks. The company buses in workers from out of town and generally doesn’t require any pre-employment drug testing.

Mr. Collins also hires laborers from work-release programs. He said demand is so high that even inmates are hard to retain as workers after their release.

‘Joblessville, USA’
The Elkhart metro region operates like an oil economy—a Kuwait in the cornfields—said Enrico Moretti, a University of California, Berkeley, economist. The RV industry sets wages and standards to a level few competitors can match, making diversification difficult.

When bad times hit, they hit hard. In 2009, RV sales fell by half, and so did RV employment. Organizers canceled the Elkhart RV show, the first time in more than 50 years.

Signs of decline during the recession were stark. Mr. Collins, of Cleer Vision Windows, employed about 40 people in 2009 and wasn’t hiring any more. Even so, he said, day after day, another 40 or so people lined up in his lobby and out the door, to fill out applications.

The Independent, a British newspaper, declared Elkhart “Joblessville, USA.” Elkhart school district enrollment fell by 1,000, about 7%, when families left town to find jobs, especially those from Mexico, whose population had grown from just 2% of the Elkhart City’s population in 1990 to 24% by 2010. 

Jose Chiquito, a Goshen College sophomore, said his father and five of his siblings had moved to Elkhart over the years from the Mexican state of Aguascalientes for RV jobs. During the recession, three returned home.

Many who stayed in Elkhart lost their homes. More than a third of home sales in 2010 were foreclosures, said Mr. Decker, the real-estate broker.

When President Barack Obama put together an $800 billion stimulus plan in 2009, he traveled twice to Elkhart to illustrate the recession’s despair. “We were the worst in the country,” said  Jason Lippert, chief executive of LCI Industries.

Slowly at first, Elkhart’s economy improved. The stimulus plan helped, although some projects flopped. Three companies set up shop, got pledges of more than $50 million in government funding and produced just two working electric vehicles before folding.

Starting around 2012, the RV industry—and, by extension, Elkhart—started to rebound sharply, largely because of the improved U.S. economy, say economists and RV industry executives. RV shipments last year tripled to 500,000 motor homes and trailers from 2009, the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association said.

"This is the worst flooding I've seen in my 28 years in Elkhart. Half of my neighborhood is underwater and the National Guard was here early this morning evacuating people from the back half where the flooding is worst.
