"No, but you can approach a group of people with whom you’ve never spoken (r/Abbotsford) with a bit more tact and decorum. 

As I mentioned in an earlier comment, I suspect that you lack awareness of the current opioid crisis in BC. This is a province-wide problem that requires a provincial solution. It can’t be solved by individual cities of varying wealth cobbling together one-off solutions. BC desperately needs increased mental health availability and addictions treatment centres. 

Many of us (myself included) are helping the marginalized one-on-one, but we are no match for the steady stream of fentanyl pouring into BC. In case you’re not aware, fentanyl is the cause of the “people standing like crooked statues” that you witnessed. You can see that same scene in every BC community today. We are engulfed.

"I used to live in Guelph and needed to do customer visits on a regular basis in Toronto. Back then, the highway had two lanes (very much like we have now) to Mississauga and it was general congestion every time I did the trip.

I went back just before the pandemic on a business trip to Guelph and from there went in the morning to Toronto. They had added an extra lane and it was even slower than it was when there were two lanes. Exact, same, thing will happen once Highway one will have three lanes to 200th Avenue.

The problem with roads is that availability drives demand. So, more lanes = more cars. The great thing is that with trains, availability drives demand and so, more and better train service.

Yes, the population of Abbotsford is higher, but Chilliwack is 60% of the population of Abbotsford and definitely doesn't have 60% of the number of Mennonite churches, especially when you consider whom Yarrow actually serves.

There's then a Russian Orthodox, an Ukrainian Orthodox, and two Dutch Reformed churches in Chilliwack. Abbotsford, despite it's larger population, has just has one Dutch Reformed and one combination Ukrainian/Russian Gospel church.

The big thing that has always stuck out to me, though, is that if you want to go to a speciality shop carrying products from any of those countries, it's traditionally been Chilliwack where you would find them over Abbotsford.",t2_13j2t,Flash604,0,1647823469.0,0,t1_i1h1rjk,i1h1rjk,False,ItisIandIloveme,t3_tikx49,https://www.reddit.com/r/abbotsford/comments/tikx49/what_is_abbotsfords_view_on_immigrants/,What is Abbotsford's view on immigrants?,/r/abbotsford/comments/tikx49/what_is_abbotsfords_view_on_immigrants/i1h1rjk/,1,r/abbotsford,0,1

Media Release- Fatal Collision Involving Cyclist

Today, March 18th, 2022, just after 3:30 pm, Abbotsford Emergency Services responded to a serious collision involving a cyclist and a vehicle in the 2500 block of McCallum Road.

Upon arrival, emergency service workers located the cyclist who had sustained critical injuries. The cyclist was transported to hospital where he was pronounced deceased. The AbbyPD are currently confirming the identity of the cyclist and have no further details at this time.

The driver involved in the collision remained on scene and is fully cooperating with this investigation. The driver did not sustain any injuries but is very shaken by this incident.

AbbyPD Patrol Officers, with the assistance of the Integrated Collision Analysis Reconstruction Service (ICARS), remain on scene and are in the early stages of this investigation. Both directions of McCallum Road Rd are currently closed between Braun Ave and South Fraser Way. The AbbyPD will provide an update on our social media once the road re-opens. 

Investigators seek witnesses and dashcam footage from those who may have been travelling along McCallum Road just before the collision. If you can assist, please call the Abbotsford Police Department at 604-859-5225

Make sure to bring rash guards, they help a lot with keeping warm because they hold the heated water more than they chill you from being wet.

">The government has been using excessive force against the Indigenous population since they started colonizing.

and you saying you approve of that right? Because if you don't then why would you approve of someone else being abused or having their rights taken away? You can't have it both ways, either it's wrong then and wrong now or it's fine in both cases. 

>Also you seem to be completly glossing over the fact that changing the federal mandate would do nothing, because the US still has the same mandate in place. 

well if that's your argument then why bother putting it in place at all? Make These guys happy and cancel it, it makes no difference. According to you there's absolutely no reason to have it in the first place because if we didn't things would be exactly the same. So why pick this fight?

The fact is it does make a difference of course. It would pressure the Americans to drop theirs tremendously. Their truckers would push for it very hard. So either you're right and you're wrong or you're wrong and you're wrong

>And yes once a protest becomes an occupation, the rules do change. 

no, the rules change when a judge rules that a protest is illegal. That's it. And that is how these things are handled, someone goes to a judge, Judge says the protest is illegal, the police do what they need to do.

As to the indigenous people if you can keep your racism and bigotry out of this conversation it would be helpful. And as to other protests, first Nations or otherwise, there has never been a time when emergency act was used to suspend their civil liberties. Ever. Nor have their bank accounts been seized, or people who support them threatened. Many people have lost their livelihoods permanently just for saying they support them.

I'm sure given your comments that it bothers you to know and that these people have been treated even worse than the indigenous protesters but that is actually where we are at.

Take a scroll through some older posts from the Wetsuweten Check point Instagram page, to see the militarized forced used against Indigenous people simply trying to defended their unceded territory, from the unlawful construction of a pipeline. Unceded means it was never lawfully surrendered to the crown just fyi.

Also you seem to be completly glossing over the fact that changing the federal mandate would do nothing, because the US still has the same mandate in place.

I have been taking my family there for years (up until C19 hit) and have always purchased tickets at the gate. That said, not a bad idea to confirm with them directly.

While you are there check out Main Beach and if you're into it the boat rentals - it shares the parking lot with Cultus Lake Adventure Park. Waterslides accross the street which I believe shares ownership - I think waterpark tickets used to get you discounted admission to the adventure park.

"If it's just a 2.1 system (2 speakers and a sub) you'll be looking at anywhere from $100 - $200 for setup from a business as a minimum fee. Best Buy, London Drugs, or Visions should be able to do this for you. 

It is easy to set up a speaker system that small though, I've done audio installations for nearly ten years now and taught people how to do this level of setup in 15 - 20 minutes. 

Make sure your receiver is off.

If your receiver is at least 20 years old, it will have [Digital Optical](https://www.the-home-cinema-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/optical-digital-audio-connection-0.jpg). If your Receiver is older than that, you'll need an [Analog-Digital adapter](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ucYLUu7SL._AC_SY355_.jpg) which are roughly $30-$50 depending on quality. A better quality unit will give your analog signal a better pass-through, meaning a better quality sound, but the digital side either works or doesn't, there's no in-between. 

Unless your receiver is <5 years old and has HDMI eARC (google ""your receiver's model number + HDMI eARC"" and it will tell you) you'll want to connect optical for the best bandwidth. Your receiver also may require a setup connected to a TV. If it's just a 2.1 setup, it's not really required, you can generally skip this by hitting the back or cancel button, but if you want to go through it your receiver will walk you through with instructions on your TV.

Connect the speaker wire to your Towers, hopefully, your wire is color-coded, red for positive and black for negative, but if they aren't it's not terribly important as long as you are consistent. Then route the cable over to your receiver and connect it to the Front Left and Front Right, respectively for each speaker. 

After everything is connected, you'll want to go into your TV's audio settings and change the output to either Optical or HDMI eARC (whichever you connected). Then power on your receiver, select the audio source you're connected to, and you should have sound and bass. You can tweak the receiver settings afterward to get better audio results.",t2_78skr,westleysnipez,0,1647367822.0,0,t1_i0s1xu4,i0s1xu4,False,meish_7,t3_tep1tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/abbotsford/comments/tep1tq/speaker_install/,Speaker Install,/r/abbotsford/comments/tep1tq/speaker_install/i0s1xu4/,3,r/abbotsford,0,3

"What about just waving the same flag that 99% of us do on a daily basis? None. 

You can be a good, loving human being and positive community member without any flags. 

Remember that the majority of people who are using flags lately are trying to generate a feeling of self-determination and control during a time when all of us feel that we’ve lost some of that due to COVID and other global issues. The operative word: *trying*. They’re still just as out of control as the rest of us are, but being angry and getting together in groups and sharing that anger in brash, “in your face” ways, is making them feel better. 

If you need to wave some flags to make yourself feel better, that’s truly okay. But ask yourself *why* that particular action will make you feel better, and whether a simpler, kinder, and more constructive action could take its place instead.

"This guys got money.

The Fraser can produce some nice fish when it's open, but salmon openings are rare due to the run sizes and conservation attempts. You can fish for Sturgeon from the shore above Mission; might not get the monster fish the guides will help you locate but still fun.

There are several rivers that are hot for Coho salmon for a month or two (late September to the end of October if you want silver fish that aren't already turning). The Chilliwack/Vedder is popular but easily accessible spots can be crowded; Dewdney slough (lots of room along the canal to fish from shore). There are other streams and rivers in the valley, that are productive. Unfortunately the increased population and pressures on the stocks have reduced the number of locations that are open and not overly crowded.

There's several lakes that you can catch trout in year round. 

I would suggest a boat would increase your options. Read the regulations for Region 2, talk to the guys at Fred's maybe. If you are on Facebook there's a page ""Fraser Valley Fishing Addicts"" but it's mostly about bragging, not sharing locations.

"Fishing in BC really peaks around the fall salmon runs, so the hype is a bit different from what year round pike and muskie in Ontario get you.

For year round fishing itches I definitely recommend Jones Lake for trout, which is generally good. The Vedder Canal under the HWY-1 overpass is great for float fishing (obvious snags everywhere) but I've pulled some great catches out of there with roe bait. Trout, salmon, catfish, and even a little 3ft sturgeon who was promptly released. Personally I still believe the game is at its best with the amazing fights you get from Pinks and the giant Coho salmon.

On that note: if you're a career fisherman taking a day to catch I giant white sturgeon is something that should be on your bucket list. I did it once when I was 15 and it was a game changing experience.

Tl;dr: trout game is good, but it's just holding you over for some of the best salmon fishing around.

It doesn't. You butchered what I said. Try again, slow down and work on your comprehension.

>You keep saying changing rules is some big sin.

No, I keep pointing out that when you though it was being done, you said it was a big sin.  I've been very clear about that. Comprehension isn't your strong suit, is it?

>Once again the Liberals are the ones that created these rules in the first place.


That's not a valid reason to ignore the rules.

>Secondly, yes we should be clawing back from those who can afford it.

Perhaps, but the courts would shoot that down. You can't make the rules and then change them after the fact.

>Getting support out quick was a necessary evil that corps didn't need it where able to take advantage.

Sigh... I already pointed that out to you. You responded with ""Like was said before, using rules liberals wrote as an excuse isn't a good argument."" Quit contradicting yourself.

>The point the Liberals are clawing back from individuals while letting corps that don't need the money take advantage.

That might be your new point now that multiple people pointed out your old point was wrong, but that was to be argued at the time and perhaps get change at the time. Adjustments were made due to the public feedback at the time. Those adjustments, however, always only applied to things going forward; it would be illegal to backdate it. To try and state that it should be changed after the fact demonstrates you have no idea how our laws and courts operate.

See, you're constantly a dickhead, and then try to play the victim when, in response, someone dishes it back to you. It's time to stop acting like a 13 year old. When you're clearly wrong, say ""Ops"" like an adult. And stop with the constant insults to try and ""win"" an argument, it just make you look worse.

Next time, be better informed so you can get the facts straight the first time. That way you won't have to keep modifying your ""point"". If you had, I could have simply said ""Because that would be illegal"" right from the beginning.

"The only real solution is a high speed rail link. When I say high speed, I'm not talking TGV kind of speeds, I'm talking 150-180km/h trains.

An interim solution is to modify the HOV lane. I get the purpose, and I understand the green passion for these things, but they really only work when there are alternative transport methods. Furthermore, for 80% of the day, they are occupied by cars that aren't removing a car from the road. Which is the entire purpose of an HOV lane.

How do you modify? Dynamically with lights, or static with times. In other words the HOV lane into Vancouver is only active during rush hour. 7am-9am. At other times, it's a regular lane.

Dynamic is even better. The lane is always HOV unless traffic controllers see a need to alleviate flow. For example, an accident, an intersection blockage, etc.

The best bet would to call a 24hour limo service based in Abbotsford and have them pick you up and drop you off. They are used to driving from Vancouver during those hours. They have smaller luxury cars as well. The airport lists more options on their website.

"My personal experience with Abbotsford with jobs in Abbotsford has been the opposite. Plenty of work, it is very industrial/ horticultural based but there is work. I agree it's not for everyone.

For the recreation I totally agree. There is no great place for a walk around the commercial centres. It feels as if downtown is used more as a thoroughfare then a destination. It has so much potential for restaurants, bars and shopping. Potentially shutting lanes off for walking traffic would be nice. Have seen them investing in some areas though. 

The homeless issue isn't specifically a Abbotsford problem either. Every city in the Lower Mainland have been struggling with it. It's such a nuisance subject that probably needs federal and provincial help to resolve the issue.

My biggest issue with Abbotsford personally is how car centric it is. Public transport is lacking and it's a hassle to buy tickets. I still can't understand how being 70km from Vancouver without public transport is good for the city at all.

Otherwise, I love the mountains around and the access to some real wilderness. So many clubs to join, people to meet up with and go on a hike. Made many great friends.

It doesn't take much driving to be in the country and to enjoy small roads, hiking trails, lakes, and beautiful scenery.

There are also good restaurants, a big movie theater (two if you include Mission) and a number of sports facilities. So, Abbotsford has a lot to go for.

However, if you don't have a car, you can't enjoy the area that much. If you're cash poor because you're house ""rich"", you can't enjoy what entertainment/food the businesses have to offer. As well, the people are more reserved here than I have ever seen anywhere.

"You still haven’t answered my question.

I do appreciate you taking the time to respond, though. It’s interesting to see your perspective.

If you think that people with cancer or cardiovascular disease choose to have those illnesses however, you are sadly mistaken. There are personal choices that can increase an individual’s risk (I.e., smoking), but the vast majority of cases are linked to genetic factors (things out of our control).

In my experience, people who are overweight or obese willingly admit that they know their lifestyle is unhealthy. Usually they don’t know where to begin with changing things or they find the whole process incredibly daunting. A lot of instances where people are obese are a result of a mental health illness (I.e., depression or an eating disorder).

Suicide is definitely caused by a mental health disorder (depression has the highest rate of causing suicide, but bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are also common culprits). 

Are you willing to admit that you acknowledge that your choice to not get vaccinated is a health risk? Or, If you’re willing to admit that you have a mental health Illness, where your delusions of persecution cause your distorted thought content/ process, then you can compare yourself to these other people.

"Before everyone gets up in arms, be aware that the story is shit journalism designed to rile you up.

That's not to say that prices aren't out of control, but this uses techniques to make it sound even worse.

You can see that right in the first paragraph. The 2022 assessments have been out for a couple of months now, but they use the 2020 assessment to make the price discrepancy seem worse.

Additionally, any journalist should have suspected something was up and looked more deeply into what is going on. This guy does lots of these real estate stories, he definitely should know to delve deeper.

When a property with an older home sells for that much, it is almost always just for the land and the house can be considered a tear down. That price for that land is ridiculous even if it's a bigger than normal lot, so I had to wonder if the lots are subdividable in this area. I didn't even have to look at the zoning, a quick look at the area shows within a block of this property there are two different properties that have been recently split into two smaller lots. This is a case of someone paying $1.7 million for two building lots; or $850,000 a lot. Call it $900,000 after costs to tear down the house and subdivide the property.

That is still way out of many people's price range; but it makes a lot more sense. And the article author is likely fully aware of it.

It's worth noting that this lot and it's immediate neighbours have more street frontage than most of the other lots in the neighbourhood; I wonder if the developer that purchased this might be also working a deal for a neighbouring house with hopes to get 5 lots out of 2.",t2_13j2t,Flash604,0,1645776294.0,0,t1_hycugu7,hycugu7,True,xlxoxo,t3_t0wlrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/abbotsford/comments/t0wlrl/cute_abbotsford_home_sells_for_512k_over_asking/,Cute Abbotsford home sells for $512K over asking price,/r/abbotsford/comments/t0wlrl/cute_abbotsford_home_sells_for_512k_over_asking/hycugu7/,21,r/abbotsford,0,21

"Most vaccine mandates that impact people’s lives on the day to day are provincial. Some of the premiers are straight up dropping all restrictions soon, which has nothing to do with the Prime Minister nor the convoy, but the fact that the destructiveness of Covid is waning and the majority of citizens are vaccinated (the number is unlikely to go up much at this point). 

Unless if you travel within Canada much, then federal mandates aren’t a huge deal. And international travel IS federal, but is also largely impacted by mandates in other countries. Unvaccinated Canadians are allowed to come and go as they please; they just have to take extra precautions right now (eg quarantine upon return). Canada can’t help that some countries won’t accept unvaccinated travellers, etc.

"\>More's the reason we shouldn't let unvaccinated truck drivers drive allaround infecting and spreading the virus and why the mandates shouldstay in place.

first off, no. That's stupid. If anything having them out of the country more is to our benefit.

Secondly you understand that they actually run around in a sealed enclosed Right, with no contact with other people right?

You need me to explain any further why that statement was kind of dumb?

If anything you've just proven that it was utterly pointless to have the mandate. Rather than having them out of the country and insecure sealed boxes where they can't infect anyone, you would rather have them walking around on the streets.

>Also, no Canadian sources?

right, because medicine works entirely differently outside of Canada. No medical research done outside of Canada would have any application Here.

if you don't feel especially ashamed of your stupidity for saying that, there is something wrong with you.

Yes life went fully back to normal after the Spanish flu. You are probably the only person in the entire world that doesn’t recognize that. It preceded the roaring 20s ffs.
