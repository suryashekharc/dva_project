"Mill Creek Park is amazing for hiking! I’d definitely check out the Cascade Ravine area which has two small but beautiful waterfalls in it. East Cohassett Trail is also really nice. The Gorge Trail loop is cool too - you can park at Lanterman’s Mill to access it and it loops back to the mill when you’re finished with it.

In terms of live music, definitely Westside Bowl. If you like vintage stores, check out Greyland Vintage in Downtown. In terms of art, the Butler Art Institute is actually very impressive for a city our size and I believe it’s free! 

I’d skip the Mexican food here, but if you’re up to trying middle eastern/Mediterranean food, we have lots of options around here - my favorite is Sauceeino in Boardman.

"Your last pic is not of the super bowl. That is only the Bahamas.  Super bowl is literally a giant bowl with hill climbs on all sides. It's closer to hoffmaster road side of hillsville quarries.  Awesome place. Everyone who rides atvs/dirt bikes/etc from the area knows about it. Lots of ppl that dont ride also know about bc theres big parties out at the Bahamas every wknd during summer.  Ppl walk in to Bahamas from hilltop plays on 224.  Technically illegal to b back there. Mainly bc of all the assholes that litter and do stolen vehicles. 

Yes there is a crane down in the quarry in front of Bahamas. My dad scuba dived in there a cpl times and can confirm. I've seen stolen boats, jet skis, trucks, u name it back there.  Kinda unfortunate bc otherwise they prob wouldn't try to close it all the time.  Cops seem to go thru phases of cracking down and then not. Plenty of ways in if your a local.  U can even park down on the railroad tracks by mahoning river and ride up from there too. Awesome place but very dangerous if you're not careful or familiar with it. 

Also, the back part of the quarries along hoffmaster road is hunting co-op with game commission so they actually patrol that side from time to time. It's only a small percentage of the entire area so not a big loss to just stay outta that part.  There's some cool videos on YouTube from a guy that goes out there n films.

Growing up there for 18 years, I honestly didn't hear many distinct nicknames for the suburbs. 

* Austintown gets shortened to ""A-town"" in many instances. 

* I'd also maybe toss in Canfield as ""Poland Lite"" (or vice versa honestly), as well as not-so-appealing but not-necessarily-historically-inaccurate ""Ku Klux Klansfield""

"I'm hesitant to answer this question because my experience/background is different than what yours could be.

With that said, I didn't learn as much as I thought I would. But that's because my background was in business anyway (I have a BBA). Much of the program felt like a review of undergraduate work. In fact, you use the same books/do some of the same assignments.

There were very few written papers, a decent amount of tests, but lots of weekly assignments. Lots of spreadsheet calculations for the finance and accounting course. The Econ class was the most difficult but also the most interesting. For some reason, very few lectures. The lectures that were provided (with the exception of the Econ and Corporate Finance class) were pretty much useless. Basic format was ""read this chapter, do these homework problems"".

All the classes seem to be run by TA's who work for the university and 95% of all contact is through those TA's who aren't even at the school. (the TA's were like lawyers, other MBA holders, and stuff all around the country...kinda weird... Practically impossible to get a hold of sometimes, too).

The only interaction you have is the interaction that you make. To me, discussion boards don't count as ""interaction"". In the course that I started out with several of us formed a group chat and had Zoom study sessions on our own. That group pretty much stuck together through the whole program, but I have since lost touch with most of them. I recommend that you start one with some classmates that you enjoy talking too. Definitely makes things better.

I know all of that sounds bad... but...

...that doesn't mean the program can't be good for you. It depends on your goals as I said before, but lots of people in that program did not have bachelor's degrees in business. In fact, there were a lot of people in the healthcare industry with nursing degrees that came in. So for them, they learned a lot because they did not have a background in business.

I think it also depends on who's paying for it, too. It's a great value for what it is. It's a great school too. I would also argue that there are certain MBA programs that definitely WILL bump up your salary. You might have to move, but I would try to get into the best program you can - even if it's not local. Even if it's not AACSB. IMO, you will learn more in an in-seat IACBE or ACBSP program at a smaller school, than you will an online AACSB program.

"The greater Youngstown area is mostly homebodies who stick with the same social groups they've grown up with their whole lives and don't stray from those too much, so it's a tough market. When you're 21, bars might open some better prospects. But really, it's a dying area, and the only people who stay there (for the most part) are those who epitomize suburbia in sticking with their same friend groups from HS or college in their 20's/30's, and the parents of their kids' friends thereafter. 

Are you a student at YSU? Maybe try joining a regular club instead of just one time events & see if something sprouts from that. That or via the workplace (typically only recommended for less-than-consequential jobs).

"Your best bet is, before you have to actually rely on the bus, take a trip to and from the destination you will be going to. A test ride so to speak.

I spent more time waiting on my connections than I did actually riding the bus so give yourself plenty of time. Also, while waiting for the bus, don't stand close to a building or tree. Damn pigeons love crapping on people waiting for the bus. Take a book, mind your own business, don't look people in the eyes. Don't watch the movie 'Speed' before getting on the bus.  
  
Edit: I took a look at the website. Yeah, you're right. Your bus maps are seriously effed up! Such low resolution. Doesn't help that I've been away so long, I no longer know the streets. As best as I can tell, you get on the [#26 \(west?\)](https://www.wrtaonline.com/schedules/route-26-boardman-east-loop/) bus, take that to the Southern Park mall, get off, and change buses to the [#8 \(north?\)](https://www.wrtaonline.com/schedules/route-8-market/). Ask the bus driver to be sure.  
  
 In the old days we had to get a token from the bus driver when changing buses or trolleys. Now we have smart cards, five bucks allows us to go anywhere in the county for the duration of one day, just have to scan our card when we get on.  
  
I put the west & north because I don't know if your buses run both directions or if you have to take the loop. Doesn't look like it by the time schedules. If they do go both directions you can save time by waiting an extra 15 or 20 minutes for the bus going in the direction you want to go. That Boardman loop looks like a time sucking bitch. Learn your route, make sure you have exact change (if your buses still use money), you'll be fine. Good luck.

"The easiest thing to do is just put where you want to go into Google maps, hit the bus option, and it will tell you the buses to take and when. Right now it's free to ride. You'll have to wear a mask. 

It looks like you would walk to the red roof inn at 6am, take bus 26. When you get to Walmart, you get off and get on to bus 24. It will take you to McDonald's by 7:20.

Edit: I read 730. To get to the McDonald's at 7:02 you'll have to take 26 to the southern park Mall, get on 5, and ride it to market & Midlothian, and walk wherever from there. The McDonald's would be twenty minutes walk. 

If you can walk down to the shops at boardman park by 5:40 you can take bus 5 straight to McDonald's by 6am and wait.

"TLDR: After the city invested $10 million into cleaning up an ugly abandoned industrial brownfield and converting it into a park and amphitheater, First Energy plans to ruin the new park's aesthetics by running massive 60-135 foot power lines right behind the amphitheater on the park property.

>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio – A proposal by FirstEnergy Corp. to erect an approximately six-mile transmission line along the Mahoning River is facing pushback from city officials and downtown stakeholders, who object to stringing the lines along the area were millions of dollars have been invested in recreational development.  
>  
>If FirstEnergy’s preferred route for the project is approved by the Ohio Power Siting Board, American Transmission Systems Inc., a FirstEnergy subsidiary, is expected to begin construction later this year on the line between the utility’s Riverbend and Lincoln Park substations in the city, spokeswoman Brittany Al Dawood said.  
>  
>The transmission line would help enhance reliability not only for downtown but also for surrounding wards in the city by providing an independent 138-kilovolt line between the two substations, Al Dawood said.  
>  
>“Benefits of a second electric source include improved performance, quicker and safer restoration options and more flexibility to conduct regular maintenance while minimizing service interruptions,” she said.  
>  
>Additionally, the project would support the existing distribution network that provides service to thousands of residential customers, St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, Youngstown State University, the Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre and other commercial and industrial facilities, she continued.  
>  
>FirstEnergy evaluated 49 possible routes, presenting a proposed and alternate route to the state panel that were preferred for minimizing impact on the environment and developed areas while enhancing reliability for downtown and the surrounding area.  
>  
>“These improvements will not only help reduce outages but will also increase capacity for future economic growth as new opportunities for employment and business development evolve in the Mahoning Valley,” she said.  
>  
>Economic issues are among the factors that opponents of the plan point to. Some shared their objections at the quarterly meeting of Downtown Youngstown Partnership, a Youngstown CityScape program that convenes downtown stakeholders including businesses and residents to address issues. They point to concerns about FirstEnergy siting the towers and power lines on the north bank of the river, where nearly $60 million in public and private money has been invested to develop the Covelli Centre and neighboring amphitheater and urban park, and the Handshake of the Century Statue.  
>  
>An alternate route, according to a map circulated at the DYP meeting, would follow the southern bank of the river.  
>  
>Sharon Letson, Youngstown CityScape executive director, acknowledged the need to address electrical issues in the downtown area.  
>  
>“We often lose electrical service,” whether by planned or unplanned outages, she said. “It’s because you’ve all done your job, and we’ve grown as a city.”  
>  
>However, placing the towers and power lines where public and private partners have made investment in the downtown area and, particularly, the river corridor, “just raises lots of red flags,” she added. It would jeopardize the investments that have been made that drive people downtown.  
>  
>“Utilities have a lot of muscle,” she remarked. “It’s important for us to take a stand.”  
>  
>Letson also raised concerns over the land clearance that would be required for the towers and questioned how the city could have park concerts with the construction noise.  
>  
>“I do know some of these other routes cost more money,” she remarked. “We’ve all invested a lot of money.” Additionally, she complained that the public hearing on the project was held in Campbell, not Youngstown.  
>  
>The Ohio Power Siting Board held a public hearing Nov. 3, 2021, to obtain community input, said Matt Butler, public information officer for the Ohio Public Utilities Commission of Ohio’s power siting department. Two years earlier, it held a public informational meeting in Youngstown to discuss the project with interested individuals and property owners.  
>  
>“FirstEnergy has worked for two years to gather community input through advertisements in local newspapers, letters sent to landowners along the proposed route and public outreach,” Al Dawood said. In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on in-person gatherings, outreach and information efforts moved online, and a virtual presentation, including information on the OPSB approval process and how to contact the board, has been available since December 2020.  
>  
>She also said FirstEnergy did not choose the location of last November’s public hearing.  
>  
>“Throughout this process, FirstEnergy has remained in close communication with city leaders,” she said. “We are committed to working with city leaders as we go forward. Our goal is to provide safe, reliable power to the downtown area and surrounding wards while supporting economic growth in the city of Youngstown.”  
>  
>Those city officials don’t appear to be sold on FirstEnergy’s preferred path  
>  
>In written comments to the power siting board, Mayor Jamael Tito Brown expressed his opposition to “any transmission lines” crossing the city property that includes the Covelli Centre, Wean Park and the amphitheater, and recommended the transmission lines be installed underground.  
>  
>“\[A\]esthetics in the affected area is a strong component to attracting patrons of the arts, business developers, restaurant owners, and outdoor enthusiasts. A 138-kilovolt transmission line in the sight line will be onerous,” Brown said.  
>  
>“We’re overwhelmingly opposed to it,” added Charles Shasho, Youngstown’s deputy director of public works.  
>  
>Shasho cited multiple issues with the project, among them that the towers would be placed on city property. He also pointed to the effect on the aesthetics of the area, where the city most recently built the Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre and Wean Park.  
>  
>“I’m not excited about having aerial high-tension lines behind what should be the anchor of downtown,” he said. He also cited environmental concerns that haven’t been investigated on the property and pointed out that the proximity of the towers and lines could restrict crane access behind the amphitheater.  
>  
>Shasho, Letson and Eric Ryan, president of JAC Management Group, which oversees the riverfront venues for the city, also pointed to potential issues with the transmission lines disrupting the audio systems of the Covelli Centre and amphitheater.  
>  
>“In the event of any type of power line failure or malfunction, the impact upon human life could be catastrophic,” Ryan added.  
>  
>“No radio or television interference is expected,” Al Dawood responded. “The design of the transmission line will be in accordance with National Electrical Safety Code standards, allowing access through the right-of-way for maintenance vehicles and equipment at the amphitheater.”  
>  
>She also said the structures used for this project would include wood and steel poles ranging between 60 feet and 135 feet above ground. “Placement has been evaluated to reduce the impact to the amphitheater by moving the poles as close as practical to the tree line and railroad tracks,” she said.  
>  
>The siting board has not set a date for making a decision in the case, Butler said. The board typically meets on the third Thursday of each month and the agenda is set approximately a week before each board meeting.  
>  
>The board “takes all public and local government input into consideration,” including comments in the case record and public hearing testimony, he said.  
>  
>CityScape’s Letson urged those in attendance at the DYP meeting to contact the power siting board.  
>

Another cat, they refused to see her when she was having seizures and she had to be put down in the emergency vet.  They also handled another cat with bird gloves.

They may have been around forever, but I would advise anyone to NEVER trust those assholes with their cat.

"Branch Street Roasters is number one for me. They are consistently rated as some of, if not the best, coffee in the state of Ohio. They put a lot of care into their craft and it’s always a great experience going there! Everyone’s super friendly there and I always look forward to going back. Honestly, even compared to most coffee shops in bigger cities I travel to, Branch Street is way better. 


Sauceeino is my favorite restaurant in the area. It’s a mediterranean/Lebanese restaurant with a Chipotle-style ordering system. The food is super good and also really healthy. (They have really good vegan options too) The food is unlike anything else I’ve tried and the owner is a really friendly guy. 


Tebo’s Caribbean is another favorite of mine. Again, the food is excellent and the service is always great! I recommend the curry chicken!


Culturehouse Coffee is another great option if you want to try high quality coffee from a locally owned business. It’s on Elm Street just above YSU. They always have really good flavors, and like Branch Street, I’d say they beat out most coffee shops I’ve been to even in big cities.",t2_x1535,Dblcut3,0,1642177684.0,0,t1_hsn949x,hsn949x,True,Dblcut3,t3_s3w8jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/s3w8jy/whats_one_youngstownarea_business_that_youll/,What’s one Youngstown-area business that you’ll always go back to?,/r/youngstown/comments/s3w8jy/whats_one_youngstownarea_business_that_youll/hsn949x/,24,r/youngstown,0,24

"Midas in Austintown on Mahoning Ave. Went there for an oil change and tire rotation maybe 8 years ago, guy had a weird attitude and tried to lie to my telling me I had black electrical tape over a dashboard warning light.

"I’ll pass on entertaining this Karen topic.

Instead, I’ll say I like going to Kebab House in Boardman, it was like an eternity when they were closed during the move. 

I like visiting the bike shop ORE in north Boardman. They are extremely helpful, and can diagnose any bike issue I seem to be having. 

West side bowl makes some killer grub and puts on great shows. 

The north side doesn’t have too much, but I guess Belmont could be considered? The Knafa restaurant is cool. The auto zone guys are always helping everyone out it looks like.

The place is a walking healthcode violation. They'll wipe their nose then handle your food with ungloved hands. One lady (seemed like maybe the owner) was visibly very sick and walked through the food prep area, in front of hungry customers, coughing and sneezing and handling food.

One patron there was so openly and overtly racist that even as someone who grew up in a staunch red state I was still taken aback. The staff nodded their head in agreement with the filth coming from his mouth, so clearly they were in good company.

"Article without paywall:

>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio — Standing narrow and tall near a busy intersection in Youngstown, Glenwood Grounds Café will celebrate its grand opening Saturday.  
>  
>Located at 2906 Glenwood Ave., Glenwood Grounds has been open for about a month. Built in 1925, the brick building is flanked by parking lots and has a modern, trendy and humble look to it.  
>  
>Inside, the walls are white and adorned with colorful art. The original tin ceiling is still intact, and hardwood floors add to the coffee-shop feel.  
>  
>It was a calling to serve a Youngstown community that led Gary Koerth and wife Cindy to start a new chapter. Koerth, a former pastor, worked on revitalization within the Glenwood-area neighborhood over the last decade. As the Koerths got more involved, they decided to sell their Austintown home and purchase one closer to the café.  
>  
>“We just fell in love with the neighborhood,” Gary Koerth says.  
>  
>Together, the Koerths began a new ministry, Hope for Renewal, a nonprofit which runs Glenwood Grounds Café.  
>  
>“We wanted to bring hope and peace, to try and restore that,” he says. “Our desire is that Glenwood Grounds will be a comfortable place for our neighborhood to gather for a great cup of coffee, awesome food and experience an atmosphere of community, care and hope.”  
>  
>It’s the Koerths’ mission to do community outreach, providing a sense of encouragement and belonging, they say. Hope for Renewal hosts weekly picnics from June through October as a way to bring the community together. “Our goal is to build community and build relationships,” Koerth says.  
>  
>They acquired the building in August 2017 and renovated the structure over the next four years, investing more than $150,000, Koerth says. Donations and volunteers have made Glenwood Grounds possible, he adds.  
>  
>Glenwood Grounds is in a food desert, Koerth says. Located near the corner of Glenwood Avenue and Canfield Road, it’s several miles until the nearest store or community place for gathering.  
>  
>It’s the first project of several in that vicinity, says Ian Benniston, executive director of Youngstown Neighborhood Development Corp. “We’ll be building more energy at that intersection” with a fresh market going into the plaza across the street from Glenwood Grounds.  
>  
>Branch Street Coffee is used at the café and is roasted on Glenwood Avenue in a YNDC-owned building about six blocks to the north of Glenwood Grounds, Beniston says.  
>  
>“I see this as another important piece in the overall body of work underway on Glenwood,” he says of the coffee shop. “It’s a good project. We’re excited to have them.”  
>  
>It’s within the busy Glenwood corridor, which commuters use to travel between Boardman and Youngstown, Koerth says. The hope is that word starts to spread about the coffee shop and people stop in on their way to work or to meet and talk business over a cup of coffee.  
>  
>“People can come experience care and encouragement,” Koerth says.  
>  
>While fresh-ground coffee and a few sweet treats are on the affordable menu, Koerth looks to expand offerings once business picks up. Baked goods, ranging from bagels, cinnamon rolls and muffins, will be served at Saturday’s grand opening, along with specialty coffee drinks, tea and hot chocolate.  
>  
>Glenwoods Grounds Café is run by a group of volunteers, and is open from 7 a.m. until 1 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.",t2_x1535,Dblcut3,0,1641756320.0,0,t1_hryb8zo,hryb8zo,True,Dblcut3,t3_rzz88l,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/rzz88l/new_glenwood_grounds_coffee_shop_opening_in/,New Glenwood Grounds Coffee Shop opening in Youngstown's South Side,/r/youngstown/comments/rzz88l/new_glenwood_grounds_coffee_shop_opening_in/hryb8zo/,12,r/youngstown,0,12

"Who else is wondering what his criminal history is like and if he was even allowed to own a firearm? 

He had to have fired quite a few rounds if he was firing his gun when he was called in on and still firing when the police showed up. 
I’m interested to see what the toxicology tests say was in his system at the time of his death. 

What kind of neighborhood did he live in? We’re there surrounding houses that could be hit with gun fire? Did someone’s home get struck with gunfire? Was he shooting wildly into the air in all directions?

"No store will get their puppies from a good breeder. There are some people who are 100% against breeding and I won’t go that far because I know it’s a battle that will never be won—not a good use of energy. But good breeders will keep their animals in the house as part of a family. The parents will have their health vetted to make sure they aren’t passing down genetic issues, the puppies will be well socialized and the parents will live good long lives. They will be kept as pets once their breeding years are over. No good breeder would ever sell their puppies to a store. They usually have waitlists a mile long. It is a fair assumption to make that if a store is selling puppies, they are coming from a puppy mill. 

I always want people to adopt instead of buying from a breeder. Even for a purebred, there are many breed specific rescues, but if someone insists on buying a puppy, the breeder should be happy to invite you over, show you the facilities, and let you meet the momma dog. If they won’t let you do this, that’s a big red flag!

There are a few pet stores that will partner with a rescue to showcase animals at their stores. I know Petsmart does this with cats. I don’t know much about this process but they always seem comfortable, clean, healthy and well cared for. 

Puppy mills, or dog breeding facilities fall under the USDA umbrella. There are only a handful of inspectors in the whole state of Ohio tasked with inspecting these breeding facilities. The bar for passing inspections is incredibly low, and still many facilities fail. The reports are disgusting. Usually they are given X months to fix the issue or fined. In the unlikely event they are shut down, often owners will simply open up a new place with a new name.  I don’t think there are any inspections for the stores themselves. As terrible as it might look to you, they are nowhere close to being in violation to the minimum requirements. 

Sorry for hijacking this thread. It’s something I did a lot of research on (kind of wish I hadn’t) and want to spread the word.

"To be honest I've only recently learned about the link between the Amish and puppy mills. Regardless, it is VERY frustrating. Partner and I decided to check out some beagle/aussie mix puppies. There were some available over in Apple Creek. Found them on the puppy website Buckeye Pups. I realized that, wow, there were actually a LOT of puppies available in that general area... I wonder why. We drove to see the pups at two different locations there. One had them inside in the basement -- it was on an Amish dairy farm. Second place, they kept the pups in the barn -- also an Amish farm. We left without purchasing a puppy and I did a bunch of Google research on the way home, and that's how I came to realize that, whoa, I almost bought what were most likely puppy mill pups, and how puppy mills are one of the main sources of income for the Amish. Sad.

Unfortunately my partner (and I, technically) had purchased a puppy from Harbor Pet Center back in 2020, which was probably both of our first times there. This was before either of us really understood where the puppies came from, and also before we were more rescue-aware and rescue-conscious. We love our dog to bits, and she's wonderful, but I do regret purchasing from that store, not only because they're so horrible to their dogs but also because there are just so many rescue dogs available that we hadn't even thought to look into, even for specific breeds.

"This is sensationalist precisely because she is a professor, specifically one that specialized in mental health.  Animal abuse is heart-breakingly common, and rarely news.  You might see cases pop up when there's extreme hoarding, or particularly cruel and graphic acts, but most don't make more than a line in the police blotter.  

This article states that a cat corpse was in the freezer, and that Williams' home was in disarray.  We have very little knowledge to form judgements, but it is fairly safe to conclude that this is a person going through a crisis, and in need of help and intervention.  You *do not know* if that cat was tortured or treated maliciously.  You *do not know* the state of the cat when it was placed in the fridge.  

The article's author, from Turning Point, has highlighted specific sections of the charge against her with weasel words.  This charge ""can include"" (description of terrible thing - highlighting torture and mutilation).  Here is [the Ohio code in question](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-959.131) - which also covers neglect, inadequate shelter, and causing physical harm which leads to death or injury.  

The cat is dead.  Williams likely (but, as this is America, has a presumption of innocence) contributed to the death of the animal.  This is tragic.  However, the article author uses rhetorical tricks to heavily imply that Williams ""tortured"" and ""mutilated"" the animal to get you outraged.  Look, this (implied liberal) professor is teaching your children, and she tortures cats!  Look, this PrOfEsSoR gave an interview about SELF-CARE.  Look, this professor was yelling at police officers and carted off in handcuffs!  Why don't we head the article with the picture of the professor, and a stock image of a KITTEN?

It's propaganda, dude.

Also, a similar-level misdemeanor in the same part of the Ohio Code is Section 959.19 - Prohibition Against Servicing a Mare in a Public Street.
