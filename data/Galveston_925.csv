"Lupitas used to be known by a different name. I did not realize that there was a name change. When Galveston attempted a street repair they were instrumental in forcing this place out of business because the streets were like a warzone of concrete. It rained a lot and made it even messier. I am sure the pandemic did not help, either.  

I guess Denver Court must have lots of people moving in and out. I did not realize there was so much movement over there.

"IMO The county government, led by Mark Henry, actually shows very little interest or care for the tourism industry. The county doesn't collect a hotel tax or a sales tax, so a lot of that direct revenue from tourism businesses isn't coming in to the county.

The redistricting also arguably weakens the power of tourism interests. Before, three commissioners represented parts of Galveston, Bolivar and Kemah — the three main tourism areas. 

Now one commissioner represents all of Galveston and Bolivar, and another has Kemah. Joe Giusti, the commissioner who represents Galveston and Bolivar now, lives in Santa Fe, which is part of the same precinct. (Giusti has the closest connection to tourism among the commissioners. He's the former director of security for Landry's.)

On the other side, League City is split between three commissioners.

"Was surprised when I heard this on NPR this morning, and so glad to hear it.

Between this, the black man who was marched around the strand some years back by police on horseback, and the judge who said illegals should be hunted and shot, the mask is off about how some of our officials feel about the minority community here.

As long as the tourist dollars flow into the right pockets and local workers are underpaid/exploited I suppose this is business as usual for here.

Edit: “target practice” is what was used by the Galveston county judge. Not what I said earlier:

"I lived in Galveston for 6 years. I found my first apartment there in the local newspaper. It was not very nice and not in a nice part of town but I could afford it. As I got to know the island better, I moved to a place called Somerset Village which has affordable all bills paid apartments five minutes walking distance from the beach. It is at most 15 minutes from UTMB. I would say closer to 10 minutes to be honest. The closer you are to the strand, the more likely you are to be subject to the tourist events so it just depends on how you feel about being privy to wild festival type activities such as Mardi Gras and Lone Star biker rally. Personally, I dreaded the times that the island was taken over by tourists and I couldn’t get out to eat or shop. I had to plan my life around when those festivals were coming and going. If you don’t mind driving 15 to 20 minutes, on the West End there is a place called Cove view. There are a couple different complexes and those are considered pretty nice yet still within affordable budget for most people. If you do really want to live right by UTMB, you may want to look for a place near Fish Village or the Galveston yacht basin. There are also loft apartments above businesses near the Strand in the off shooting streets. I would check out 22nd and Harborside and the streets in that vicinity. Like the other people have said, I would check before you move in because there are some pockets of town that are shady and quite frank, uncomfortable to live in.

"You probably want to get a little bit beyond Houston, since it doesn't really have a good track record with hurricanes (mostly Harvey) and it has a history of hurricane/polar vortex power outages (a reliable supply of power will be important if working remotely....I have family whose homes did not flood during Harvey, but they were without power for about one week), and the streets and freeway underpasses all over Houston are prone to flooding during hurricane events, meaning you might not be able to go back to the island right after a hurricane, even if the hurricane doesn't hit Galveston. And avoid Katy, because....it's Katy (inside joke for Houstonians looking to evacuate).

I heard something about the Woodlands having a different power supplier than Houston, but I don't know if that is actually true or not. But if it was me, I would start looking around the Woodlands or Conroe areas. Maybe Tomball. Keep in mind that if a hurricane is looking like a direct hit, some people from Houston will be evacuating as well, so hotel rooms north of Houston are going to fill up quick.

And to get back to Katy, if you wait for evacuation orders, it's going to be too late and you can expect to sit in traffic for a while. Find someone who lives north of Houston, become really good friends with them, and then get them to agree to house you and the cats for a couple of days, if needed....or become good friends with someone on the island who has family north of Houston who can house a couple of evacuees for a while.

Edit: After Harvey and the polar vortex, Houstonians panic buy groceries and water any time they think another disaster will hit, so be stocked up on that stuff and cat food if it looks like a hurricane might come to town (Galveston dodged a couple of them last year).

"> it's hard to persuade someone who's making money from a thing

I'm not involved in the sales side of real estate at all. My day job isn't even involved with this in the least. Just saying what it's like from the perspective of an experienced homeowner.  

When you own a home and are ready to sell, you're going to get offers from corporate buyers who will pay asking (or over asking) with no complaints/as-is all-cash, or an average-joe homeowner who will always find reasons to negotiate a lower (even ever-so-slightly lower) offer. The community-minded will bypass the $10-20k higher bid of a corporate buyer and go for the individual buyer. But that $10k-20k hit to your profit doesn't get you any kudos. It doesn't benefit you in anyway. All it does is help that neighborhood not be full of commercially-owned rentals with come-and-go families.  
Few sellers go that route because everyone is looking out for their own self interest. ""I'm moving away, why should I give up $20k?"" Would you give up $20k for the ""morality"" even though you're moving away or do you keep it for self-interest?    

Dealing with individuals is more back-and-forth because of the things their inspectors will always dig up. Always. (My first house was damned-near perfect, but the inspector *still* found things to point out.) It's the natural give and take of these sort of transactions. A selling agent is going to earn their money by sifting through was is reasonable and what is not. They understand what's worth turning down and what's worth consideration.  

But one day when you own a house and are ready to sell, I wish you luck selling it on your own with no representation and caving to every whim of a buyer because of your impeccable morality. You're a good egg.",t2_2hn6g,grendelt,0,1647123051.0,0,t1_i0f69tv,i0f69tv,False,ReindeerMiserable165,t3_tcivlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/galveston/comments/tcivlm/buyers_beware_of_illegal_sketchy_sellers_37_san/,"Buyers beware of illegal sketchy sellers: 37 San Jacinto Dr, Galveston, TX 77550",/r/galveston/comments/tcivlm/buyers_beware_of_illegal_sketchy_sellers_37_san/i0f69tv/,1,r/galveston,0,1

"*All real estate works this way*.
  
It's legal protection. ""I'm acting through an agent so they can handle all the details. Call me in when I'm absolutely needed.""  

The legal insulation is a benefit but not the primary reason you go through an agent. It's the same reason why professional artists, athletes, actors, speakers, etc have agents. To handle all the details and insulate them from ever saying anything that obligates or commits them beyond what was intended.  

An agent is going to know all the ins-and-outs, contingency plans, special cases, how long to put in for an option period, what is standard and not standard for a contract... all that stuff.  
I'll use an agent every time -sure it costs money- but it's far less headache for scheduling showings, handling the back and forth with title, etc. Some renters might balk at the idea of paying a real estate agent when they don't see all the behind-the-scenes effort, but anyone who's bought and sold will know the value of a good agent.

"Right I totally agree with you. All the little details that were not up to date with the code like plumbing, shingles, AC, etc. were not a worry for us. Those minute issues we could fix on our own. However, the biggest worry for us was the foundation because the house was tilted at an angle per the inspection. This was an issue we could not as easily fix on our own. We were worried that if we did buy this house, we would have trouble selling it in the future because other home buyers would also realize the foundation issue in their inspections. I’m also 100% positive that other homebuyers discovered similar issues with the foundation before us. Thats why its really unfortunate we had to waste time and money to find this out when other previous home buyers have already discovered it and also the agent probably already knows about it too.

If it's safety, I'll address it, but I'm not going to rip out the drywall on my house to run more outlets because the latest electrical code calls for it.

"Yep. Good agent doing their job.  
Tax records show their names, but unsure if they're the current owners. You'll have to do some Googling.  

I honestly wouldn't bother with it. When buying property you have to look out for you, don't worry about what some sellers are doing.

In a market like Galveston where there's a lot of investment property, there's a lot of people that treat it as a box to rent out and not a home.

"The west end is like a Jimmy Buffet Wild West nightmare. Perpetually drunk Jack asses on golf carts, almost every house out there is a vacation rental which makes summer a tourist nightmare. Those people keep the lights on here but god DAMN they can be the most inconsiderate worst of the worst. There are no grocery stores out there, no delivery services, no restaurants that serve anything besides frozen fried food, no drugstores and most of all no sea wall. It’s 20 mins to get to town which doesn’t sound like a lot and to some people isn’t a lot but it gets old. I used to have a one and a half hour commute to town (ONE WAY) so 20 mins started out not being a big deal but it gets old fast, especially in July when you’re just trying to get to the grocery store and you’re behind a group of slingshots going 40 in the fast lane. I STILL am grateful some days that we rented out there first and didn’t get stuck there. I don’t think I’d love Galveston as much as I do if I were still out there. For some people the rural beach thing works, but if you’re used to Baltimore and having readily available services the west end might suck for you. It did for me and like I said i previously lived hours from civilization. All that being said though, we rented out there first because we loved it- there will be places here that seem awesome until you’ve actually spent some time there. This island as a whole is pretty damned magical though and all the people on this sub talking about how great it is are not just blowing smoke.",t2_d4l6eifu,No_One7894,0,1645720131.0,0,t1_hy9bc1n,hy9bc1n,False,Xhosa1725,t3_szxzdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/galveston/comments/szxzdk/baltimore_to_galveston/,Baltimore to Galveston,/r/galveston/comments/szxzdk/baltimore_to_galveston/hy9bc1n/,3,r/galveston,0,3

"Depending on where you choose to live, walking/biking to work is definitely in the realm of possibilities, same goes for daycare.

Something else you may want to consider when choosing where to live is the periodic nuisance flooding which can occur from a combination of high tide, rapid/intense rainfall. Hard to pinpoint exactly where this occurs on the island because the drainage infrastructure is old and in various states of effectiveness.

Generally affects the lower-lying areas closer to the bay (northwest side of the island, or near the bayous).",t2_d0bkjila,Henry_Rosenburg,0,1645717522.0,0,t1_hy94dlb,hy94dlb,False,Xhosa1725,t3_szxzdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/galveston/comments/szxzdk/baltimore_to_galveston/,Baltimore to Galveston,/r/galveston/comments/szxzdk/baltimore_to_galveston/hy94dlb/,4,r/galveston,0,4
"I love Galveston. I think it’s important to recognize the good and the bad, and if you still love it, you know it’s right for you. On the West End, you are going to feel like you have the beach to yourself. It will be a haul to any sort of store (besides 7 Seas), but it is pretty great. The downside is that many homes out there are 2nd homes or short term rentals, so you won’t have many neighbors, and obviously occasional crappy tenants. Sea Isle is one neighborhood that has a significant group who live on island full time and corresponding amenities. On the East End, you can get amazing historic homes, and you are much closer to everything. Shops, restaurants, work, etc. But you will also see a lot more day-trip tourists, so it can be busy. 

The hardest part of Galveston is, IMO, the schools. Some people have wonderful experiences with the schools, and of course any education can be what you make of it. There are great opportunities for the students to take advantage of. But the inescapable fact is that the schools have a poor reputation in the area. It is a major factor that keeps people from moving full time to the island with young children.",t2_ozvhn,IDoPots,0,1645717324.0,0,t1_hy93uo1,hy93uo1,True,Xhosa1725,t3_szxzdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/galveston/comments/szxzdk/baltimore_to_galveston/,Baltimore to Galveston,/r/galveston/comments/szxzdk/baltimore_to_galveston/hy93uo1/,2,r/galveston,0,2
"West end is nice. Places like Jamaica beach are good for having neighbors but easy access to the beach. The commute from the west end to UTMB can be a pain given they are on opposite sides of the island. But, I know plenty of people who do it. Same sort of thing with going for groceries or target. Again not too hard. But you lose a bit of the ease of being on the mainland. 

&#x200B;

As for schools, for a 16 month old. You'll be fine, all the Day Schools are great. Elementary schools seem good too, the Jr. Highs here are a bit of a mess, especially since they are doing some restructuring but, that should be good in the long run. Ball High is solid, it had a bad reputation maybe 30+ years ago that seemed to stick. But, they have some really great STEM opportunities now I haven't seen elsewhere.

"On the insurance front, there are some pockets of not-as-bad flood zone on the island, you can save a lot of money focusing on those.  Even if the bar scene aint your thing downtown has a lot going on besides bars.  There are loads of condo buildings that are very nice on Strand, Mechanic, Post Office, and elsewhere.    The island is fairly thin, so almost everywhere 'can' be walkable.  I was about a mile from the beach.   

You cant really go wrong looking in this area, much of it is chock full of historic homes.   This is by no means the only section of the island to look.   The city is small, and if you are at all used to giant cities (like Baltimore) the idea of a 3 mile commute being ""long"" will seem silly at first.

"If you want to have your car *on the Seawall* during the parades for tailgating purposes, you'd need to get down here by 5 a.m. Thursday. That's when they start allowing people to start claiming parking spots for the weekend.

If you're just going to drive up near the seawall, parking and walking up, maybe try the Academy/Goodwill parking lot — I *think* I've found spots on there on parade day. 

Street parking in Galveston can seem a little convoluted. Permitless street parking is most legal, except in the places marked in yellow here https://www.galvestontx.gov/ImageRepository/Path?filePath=%2fdocuments%5cIntranet%5c369%2fSeawall+Res+Parking+Dist+010516.jpg.

So for instance, you could just park on the street around 41st Street and Avenue S, about six blocks from Seawall.

If you're looking for a lot that's open off Seawall, maybe look up the Galveston ISD parking or the Galveston College lot.

"I mean using a medical pass to get to work is not the purpose of the pass and many people see it as an abuse. If you use a medical pass in that way, it can get confiscated if you get caught.

However, the system is obviously broken at this point. 

I can understand the need of people who are commuting to work to find a way around summer traffic. I personally think that there should be paid priority passes; but the last time that was tried no one bought them and the program died.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Rent an antique golf cart at Carriage Haus for a couple of hours. Definitely worth it. Circle the Strand (downtown area) and give the aooha-ga horn and wave. Head up to the Seawall and cruise there. Pull over an get a nice snack at Longboard’s Beach Bar. If you’re not hungry pull over at the Grand Galvez and watch the renovations taking place. There is a small museum of sorts on the ground floor “basement”. Just take the steps down. You’ll see old photos and memorabilia from the Queen of the Gulf. You’ll still have time to cruise around before your time is up.  23rd/Broadway. 
The Bryant Museum is one of my favorite museums. The site of one of the original Children’s orphanages. The interior is beautiful. 
Stop at the Tremont hotel and sit in the lobby and enjoy some live music from a quartet. Always a treat. 
Koops BBQ is great. They have a creative menu beyond brisket and sausage. They have sauce but you won’t really need it. They are in the process of renovating a building they just purchased but they have their food trailer setup. 45th/Broadway. 
Texas weather, Galveston in particular, can be finicky. Bring a jacket. Trust me on this. Could be jacket in the morning and shorts in the afternoon. Also when the cold wind blows across the water, it’s a wet cold which kinda cuts through ya. 
Have a good time and welcome to our little sandbar.

Great shops on the strand and it’s easy to walk the whole area quickly. check out La King for some nastalgia, but there are great boutiques everywhere. Go to DTO (Daiquiri Time Out) for unbelievably great hand crafted cocktails. 

Galveston has tons of community events, so check out what’s happening downtown while you’re here- anything from an art walk to a chili fest. It’s a small town at heart so they are wonderful. 

Soak in the beach - you can rent a cart, historic car, sling shot, or bike to ride the sea wall or go through some of the streets to just look at stunning historic homes. Swing by Murdoch’s on a weekday to sit in rocking chairs, drink a beer, and stair at the ocean below you.

"When the cruise ships leave port, which is almost daily (and sometimes twice a day), they hit the starboard-side thrusters to push the ship sideways into the harborside channel. That seems to flush out all of the small baitfish that were using the docks as shelter and it pushes the fish into the channel, which the dolphins then feed upon. Checking the port itenerary for cruise ship departure dates & times, and positioning yourself on the dock by Willie G's, should give you an increased chance of success for dolphin sighting. The dolphins aren't there for every cruise ship, but they tend to show up at that time fairly often. When feeding, they're usually about 50-150 feet in front of the ship and to the port side, about the 11 o'clock position from the captain's viewpoint (edit #1: That's after the ship has started the thrusters but really hasn't started moving much yet.

"No, 61st does not get sgut down. Stor clear of Heard’s Lane on the west of 61st and Saladia on the east of 61st. Also, all neighborhoods about 2-3 blocks east of 61st from Ave. S on the south to Saladia on the north- stir clear.  There is a segment of Ave. Q to Ave S thst should be avoided as well. Going to about 56th. 

Now, on the west side of 61st  the neighborhood Driftwood is good - no flooding on regular rains. You must be careful of Heards Lane - fast rain will cause it to flood. Back side of Driftwood - Driftwood Lane Both sides go down a decline on the west  side - the low area could flood. 

Bayou Homes Drive - one street before Driftwood. It is low and does flood. 

Biovu - one street before Bayou Homes . I know people over there . I do not believe it is a normal flooding street. Many people have built up. Thos street has both high end beach type homes and lower end duplexes. 

I can give you opinions on different neighborhoods. Have lived here 40+ yrs. used to live on Wimcrest in 60’s and 70’s. Parents bought old house to fix up and then they moved.

"Galveston versus... where did you get *that* list?! Geez

South Padre, Galveston, and Corpus are probably the only cities I'd mention to anyone coming out of state.  
In between those spots is all very rural (sometimes swampy) beachfront.  

Galveston has the history (and proximity to Houston, but it ain't *real* close),  
Corpus has... um... newer touristy stuff? (is ""the beach"" for the Central Texas crowd). It's a bigger place than Galveston but it also isn't *right* on the beach. It's on a bay and then the beach is out on a barrier island at the mouth of the Bay,  
and South Padre definitely has a more party town vibe. Hell, even if you fly there, you're gonna go to the Brownsville/South Padre airport which is listed as BRO on your ticket.  
Also FWIW, Mexico is *right* there by the airport, but it's Matamoros and apart from a little gun violence, drug running, and staggering poverty isn't really a lot of fun.

I wouldn't drive to South Padre from out of state. It's a fair drive even from Galveston. You'll want to fly. If you must drive, then Galveston is kinda you're only option. Corpus isn't all that much further, but if you're already coming from FL, it's gonna add several more hours to the drive.",t2_2hn6g,grendelt,0,1641501917.0,0,t1_hrjhlg5,hrjhlg5,True,Odd-Entrepreneur7976,t3_rxkmpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/galveston/comments/rxkmpa/nightlife_in_galveston_im_planning_my/,Nightlife in Galveston?

Two things that stuck out to me; 1) I'd hope they'd go the route of treasing out those red wolf (rw) alleles via splicing, CRISPR, etc v diluting the existing rw genes by breeding these hybrids with existing rws - with so few left, I hate the idea of any loss of pure rw genetics. 

And 2) this really illustrates that, as important as core wilderness areas are, especially for mega fauna predators, we can't underestimate the importance of sub- wilderness, marginal habitats to wildlife clinging to existence on the fringes of human-dominated land- and seascapes.

"I no longer live there but did for ten years and absolutely loved it.

1.  You just never know.  Hurricanes do provide fun conversations and you get pretty good at knowing when you need to really think about evacuating.  You've been watching it for a week and about 2 days before you decide and then you just leave the day before landfall.

2.  Absolutely.  The diversity of Galveston was one of the things I really loved.  

3.  Non-existent.  There is a gun range.  You would need to drive for hunting.  

4.  No longer live there so can't say.

5.  Homes are so weird everywhere now.  The market is just so insane I'm not even sure I ever want to buy a house again...and I've owned 3 of them.  From friends I've heard that people are getting tired of neighborhoods basically becoming a long row short term rentals.  Air BNB or something like that.  Definitely would not buy online.

"Galveston proper has all of the negatives of living in a big city with none of the positives. Vagrants, high housing costs, and poor city services with high taxes. At the same time you get none of the positives of the big city, like concerts, sporting events, choice for food out is relatively limited and there is one proper grocery store and one Walmart for a city that routinely has a tourist population of over 200,000 visitors on weekends, it sucks. The far east end is all UTMB and UTMB housing and west end is all retirees or rental homes. 

The school systems suck so raising a kid here? I wouldn't. 

The seawall is in obvious disrepair and the roads suck but nothing gets done about either because the tax revenue from the hotels and airbnbs can only be used on projects that directly benefit the hotels, so the beaches get dredged with new sand every year meanwhile there are a half dozen guys asleep in the cold in my back alley downtown because they never reopened the homeless shelter. 

Housing prices are ridiculous and it's ridiculous to insure a house here against flood. Expect to evacuate every year and expect some sort of devastating loss in the next decade, we are already on borrowed time when it comes to a bad hurricane. 

I've lived here 2 years and the only reason I've stayed is because I found a cheap house mid pandemic and my landlord never adjusted my rent when housing prices went back up. 

Unless you're super experienced in the restaraunt or service Industries or in a health career suitable for UTMB work you'll struggle to find somewhere to pay enough to support a kid, childcare, and housing. The restaraunts are the only employers and they pay like shit.

"Local restaurant recommendations:

Seafood: Katie's is top notch, Gaido's is legendary, both are pricey

Lunch: Nick's is good as well as Maceo for a great sandwich. Shark Shack on the Strand is great with a variety of options.

Views: Food is ok at both but the views/people watching is great: Jimmie's and the Spot

Mexican: Original Mexican Cafe and Taquilos.

Others: If you want to try cajun food, try Cajun Greek. For Sushi, Yamato is our go to place.

Dessert: La Kings is a must stop for your sweet tooth.  For ice cream, go to Hey Mikeys, worth every calorie.

If you want to walk, stay near the Strand, it will be more the most bang for the buck.  For staying options, there are tons, before we moved here we did Condos, VRBOs/AirBNBs and hotels, they are mostly decent, just look at the reviews carefully.  If you want to stay near the beach, hard to argue with the Grand Valdez.

Must see: Go out to the east end to see the big ships (and others) coming into the channel.  We frequently head out there and just watch the ships for a bit to relax.  If you want to see the  grand old houses, Bishops palace and the Moody Mansion are good stops.  There are monuments around the island and some parks that may be walkable.
