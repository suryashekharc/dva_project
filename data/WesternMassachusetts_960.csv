I would personally avoid living in Springfield, Holyoke, and West Springfield for poorer education, urban, people, and higher crime and drug use, they are better for entertainment, shopping, or working in.

I think East Longmeadow, Granby, South Hadley, Belchertown, Wilbraham, Hampden, Palmer, and Ludlow are the best bang for your buck they are smaller, more rural safer, cheaper, suburban (to varying degrees) and all still good for education just like the more expensive towns, and all either border or are close to bordering Springfield or the towns where the colleges are.

I also think Westfield, Chicopee, and Agawam are still good but they are more urban and have more traffic, crime, and people then the small suburban cities and towns

"I love the Berkshires but for me, Franklin County is the best area in western mass. It's more affordable and still full of beautiful landscapes. Here you can be in huge old forests living the quiet life yet be 15 minutes from the valley town centers on relatively peaceful roads. If you are trying to live rural, you still end up needing to go to a big town for commerce, medical treatment, etc. and I find Greenfield to be a more pleasant place to go for such things compared to most other big towns in Massachusetts. For me, Stockbridge has too much of the gaudy consumerism b.s. thanks to the fancy vacation homes that are everywhere, owned by city folk. This means more people driving like idiots in big SUV's, higher prices everywhere, the negative effects of vacation homes are extensive despite the property tax income they generate. Towns with higher rates of owner occupied homes tend to have more community and business that cater to the locals instead of people that are only around for special occasions.

* Art scene: A lot of local artists in the area and some small art venues like the [Greenfield Gallery](https://www.thegreenfieldgallery.com/) and the [LAVA Center](https://www.localaccess.org/). There's also [Artspace Community Arts Center](https://www.artspacegreenfield.com/)
* Food: [Rise Above](https://www.facebook.com/riseabove413/) (an excellent local bakery), [The People's Pint](https://thepeoplespint.com/), [Namaste](https://namastegreenfield.com/) (an Indian/Nepalese restaurant), [Thai Blue Ginger](https://thaiblueginger.com/), [Kobe Hibachi and Sushi](http://www.kobemass.com/), and a number of Chinese restaurants
* Tons of BLM and LGBTQ+ support (though, like anywhere, not 100% universal)
* Schools: You might be interested in [The Center School](https://centerschool.net/) and/or [Four Rivers Charter Public School](https://www.fourriverscharter.org/)
* Can definitely find a house in that price range. We just bought a 3 bedroom house within walking distance to downtown for <$200,000, though it needed a little bit of work, but nothing major.
* Swimming: [Green River Swimming Area](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/greenriver.html) or just drive up Green River Road and find a spot to wade in the water
* Outdoor activities: A number of [parks, playgrounds, and publicly-accessibly hiking trails on conservation](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/parks.html) land in town. The best hiking being [Griswold/GTD Conservation Area (PDF trail map)](http://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/pdfs/Griswold_Trail_Map.pdf) and [Highland Park/Temple Woods](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/pdfs/trails.pdf)

i love it here. if someone offered me a free house somewhere else... well i would take it because i'm not a complete idiot but i would take a while to think about it!

Crime is low in most of the valley, lots to do, great schools pretty much everywhere. if you're looking at holyoke that is a GOOD idea - good prices on homes, good school system afaik, and a diverse community. my friend had a lot of choices as to where to open his new resturant, and he chose holyoke. even though the pandemic has been kicking his ass on it, he has never ever said that he wished he opened somewhere else. 

oh, and my aunt and uncle - who lived in DC for most of their adult lives - wanted to move somewhere? they came here, saw what was available, and almost immediately decided. they've been in amherst for like 12 years now.

as to where you want to live, the options here are wild. you've got city life in springfield or holyoke, farm life in sunderland or hadley, suburbs in south hadley, college town in amherst and hamp. we have pretty much every kind of place you'd like to live, all within a 15 mile radius.

"I am not in criminal justice, so I don't want to use the wrong terms, but in my layman's way I'd just say general crime.

I don't *think* we have a ton of gang activity, though I could be wrong. Our city is an old working class hub with lots of abandoned mills and factories and a downtown that reflects that. There have been/are efforts to rehab the industrial areas, COVID didn't help those efforts. 

I live kind of on the border between the ""nice"" part of town and the less nice part. I have had a skateboard stolen off of my enclosed front porch, and once my wife left her car doors unlocked and found that it had been rifled through. I called the police one time because there was a woman wailing on the corner outside my house in the middle of the night. Literally wailing. I'd never experienced that before. Someone stopped and convinced her to let them drive her to the hospital before the police arrived.

"I spent 12 years in Northampton before moving to Holyoke. I have been here for almost 7 years.

I thought I would miss living in Northampton, but I really don't. I can get there in 10 minutes whenever I feel the need. In Holyoke you get a *lot* more for your money - both in terms of real estate prices and city services. 

We have curbside trash & recycling (In Northampton you either have to hire a company to take it away or do it yourself). Plus you get a card that allows you to take bigger items to the city facility.

We have municipal gas/electric that is cheaper than any of the big private utilities. Most of our power is generated in house via solar and hydroelectric! The customer service is great, the service calls are cheap, you get a discount for paying on time, and there are drop boxes all over town where you can pay your bill.

&#x200B;

OK, so all that said, the schools here are not in great shape and there are also sections of town that are troubled. I don't know what your budget is, but it's probably a fair trade off to consider private schools in exchange for all the money you save by *not* buying in Northampton.

"I work outdoors in the woods in the summer in western mass in an area with MANY ticks and have not have one embedded. Some tips I can share:  
\-  wear pants during outdoor activities where you might be frolicking through grassy areas or meadows, and go full dork and tuck your pants into your socks. Don't give them an entry point up your legs - those little hell beetles love shady areas  
\- do a tick check before you get in the car and a thorough one when you get home. Try to remove clothes when you get home in one area (like a mudroom or basement) before going inside  
\- consider using a Permethrin spray or clothes with permetherin baked in. Permethrin is a chemical compound made to emulate chemicals found in the chrysanthemum and has little systemic absorption, and is considered very safe.

"I've had lyme many times...

1. Bugspray, it does stop them from grabbing you. Use it whenever it's above freezing and you're walking anywhere that plants touch your ankles or above (walking mown grass is not much of a risk, everything else is, including sitting in a lawn by the edge near a forest).
2. Know the symptoms, it's not just a bullseye rash. These are the symptoms I and my brother have had of lyme: Bullseye rash, swollen/painful knees, painful shins, popping joints (touching my nose made by shoulder pop), headache, leopard style rash (head to toe ring rashes), bells palsy (my mom thought I had a stroke). I've had it enough that I know, joint issues or anything really weird, if not obviously associated with something else, is worth a lyme test.
3. And go to the doctor when you get symptoms, most doctors in the area are very familiar, I had them regularly diagnose it over the phone, and tell me to do a blood test and pick up the prescription before coming to the doctors. But if you have it and you're outside the area, you often need to tell the doctor to run the test.

I will say, long term affects are overblown, I have had it many times (5+?), I think I have minor arthritis in my hip from lyme (started in middle school from lyme), but it's pretty rare that I notice anything.",t2_3oq97,edman007-work,0,1627403057.0,0,t1_h6q0wij,h6q0wij,False,totalbeef13,t3_osh9pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/westernmass/comments/osh9pw/scared_of_lyme/,Scared of Lyme,/r/westernmass/comments/osh9pw/scared_of_lyme/h6q0wij/,2,r/westernmass,0,2
"Ticks don't actually live in trees. It's a common myth so a lot of people hear that. You need to worry about tall grasses, brush, and shrubs.

I've been living here about two years, and I'm super paranoid about ticks. We check our dog after almost every walk, unless she's only been in a super clear area of the yard. She can get a tick just from brushing against some brush on the edge of our yard for a second. But she's on flea and tick medicine, so ticks that bite her die pretty quickly.

Taking a shower at night helps because you can wash off any ticks you might not have noticed. Proper clothing and bug spray helps a lot if you're taking a hike.

I would not spray my yard with chemicals personally. It seems like it would be bad for our health, and it would hurt other wildlife and insects. Some people spray with natural things, like garlic, to keep ticks away. I don't know how well it works. And it gets pricey because you have to do it often. Thoughtful landscaping seems like a better idea.

"You're overthinking it. YES you should always check for ticks and what-not, but you don't need to do a full-body search everytime you go outside. If you hike or walk in forested areas, that's when you want to be thorough, especially in the fall but also whenever it's warm.

As long as you catch a tick before too long you should be fine. You can get tested if you're paranoid without symptoms, and if you do have symptoms, as long as you nip it in the bud quickly you should be okay. I had a rash last month and talked to a couple doctors and we discussed lyme disease at length. It ended up not being that, but that's where I got most of my information. Antibiotics are very effective in treating Lyme. My dog had lyme pretty bad a few years ago and the day he got prescribed antibiotics he was literally fine that same evening.

I would imagine you should really pin down exactly what you want this place to be and what you will offer, before you worry about competition?

the Prodigy Gameroom in Easthampton is in the Eastworks Mill building and is right next to other bars and breweries there, and it seems to be doing quite well. seems like the businesses and foot traffic boost each other, people go from one to the next? would putting your place near a regular game store amplify both of you, instead of competing?

anyway, I don't actually know anything about running a business, but a gaming/brewery place would be something my friends and I would be very interested in going to, especially if it was in a convenient location with other interesting businesses nearby. we would not go at all if it was way out in Ware, to be honest",t2_3q54g,addressunknown,0,1626719522.0,0,t1_h5s5tw0,h5s5tw0,False,magical_beer,t3_onif5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/westernmass/comments/onif5m/looking_for_feedbackadvice_on_game_cafebrewery/,Looking for feedback/advice on game cafe/brewery,/r/westernmass/comments/onif5m/looking_for_feedbackadvice_on_game_cafebrewery/h5s5tw0/,2,r/westernmass,0,2

"I wrote this for someone else who was thinking about moving to the area and I was suggesting Greenfield:

>* [GCET](https://gcet.net/): municipal broadband so you'll have fast, local internet for remote work
* Music scene: [Hawks and Reed](https://www.hawksandreed.com/) (where I've been to concerts, large comic book events, a play, and a watch party for a Greenfield mayoral debate), [Root Cellar](http://www.rootcellarbar.com/), [Green River Festival](https://www.greenriverfestival.com/)
* Art scene: A lot of local artists in the area and some small art venues like the [Greenfield Gallery](https://www.thegreenfieldgallery.com/) and the [LAVA Center](https://www.localaccess.org/). There's also [Artspace Community Arts Y
* Food: [Rise Above](https://www.facebook.com/riseabove413/) (an excellent local bakery), [The People's Pint](https://thepeoplespint.com/), [Namaste](https://namastegreenfield.com/) (an Indian/Nepalese restaurant), [Thai Blue Ginger](https://thaiblueginger.com/), [Kobe Hibachi and Sushi](http://www.kobemass.com/), and a number of Chinese restaurants
* Tons of BLM and LGBTQ+ support (though, like anywhere, not 100% universal)
* Schools: You might be interested in [The Center School](https://centerschool.net/) and/or [Four Rivers Charter Public School](https://www.fourriverscharter.org/)
* Can definitely find a house in that price range. We just bought a 3 bedroom house within walking distance to downtown for <$200,000, though it needed a little bit of work, but nothing major.
* Swimming: [Green River Swimming Area](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/greenriver.html) or just drive up Green River Road and find a spot to wade in the water
* Outdoor activities: A number of [parks, playgrounds, and publicly-accessibly hiking trails on conservation](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/parks.html) land in town. The best hiking being [Griswold/GTD Conservation Area (PDF trail map)](http://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/pdfs/Griswold_Trail_Map.pdf) and [Highland Park/Temple Woods](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/pdfs/trails.pdf)

"I obviously don't know the state of your cat's teeth or other factors but we got a similar quote for our dog a while back. This was right before 2020 quarantine. When everything went into lockdown we realized it would be hard to get the dog in for that procedure. You know, they knock them out so there's a risk involved with it and it was already getting stressful around here with COVID.

Trying to make up the difference and hold her over until we could get past quarantine we started putting this dental additive to her water every day on recommendation of the vet.

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CWY3TLW/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CWY3TLW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

We took her recently, about a year later now, to the vet and he said her teeth actually look fine now and would not need to be immediately cleaned but could just be done when it was convenient. I'm not some shill here, I really thought the additive would be total bullshit because there is just so much crap out there in the pet world... but it really did clean a lot of the tarter off and helped her a lot.

"It's been 8 years since I lived in Western Mass so I couldn't tell you how much things have changed, but I recommend looking into Easthampton and Greenfield. They both have a great vibe and great community, but much more affordable than Noho or Amherst. Greenfield is a great town. I lived in the South End of Springfield too, and as someone mentioned you could get something in a beautiful Victorian. I lived in some ghetto ass apartments on Belmont Ave, and one block over was the most beautiful Victorian homes I've ever seen. Forest Park is right there and it's a fantastic park to live near. I never got fucked with living there, but you never forgot you were in the hood, especially during summertime. It depends on how important the sense of community is for you and what you're into. If you like the country and mostly solitude, Leverett is beautiful.  I think Greenfield was my favorite place out of all of the towns I lived in.

"I will say that scenario #1 of transitioning from a random conversation into friendship/hangout territory is very rare (and probably not the best option to hang ones hat on) but it can happen. If you try to strike up a conversation and succeed, you can get a sense that there is good social energy being returned. If that's the case, it can be worth seeing if there's an option to continue the conversation.  
Examples could be: ""I'm always looking for a \[activity relevant to your conversations like walking/hiking/gardening/crafting/etc\] buddy. Can I give you my number and you can feel free to text if you ever want some company?"" or ""I'm about to grab a \[beer/coffee/donut/shot of whiskey/whatever at public place X\], want to join?""

"I grew up in the area, left for 10 years, and moved back. I absolutely agree that it's a tough spot to make new friends.  Western Mass is full of GREAT people, but I do think there is a general northeast-ish mentality that everyone is busy, is in a rush, and that the courteous thing is to not take up too much of someone else's time and energy. I realize that this is a generalization, and the pandemic has done no favors to warm social energies in the region, but I do feel there are extra challenges in this area for an individual looking to forge new friendships.

As I've thought a lot about this, I have a couple things that have been helpful for me (though I need to follow my own advice on this more):

1. Keep going out. Even if its by yourself. Going to the gym, to the farmers market, out on hikes, to the local swimming holes, etc - you never know who you might bump in to and strike up a conversation with, that you never would have otherwise
2. Seeking out consistent activities (art or fitness classes, for example) with recurring people can be a great way to strike up some friendships. Shared experience and common time spent together makes for great friendship kindling.
3. Make friends with that one magical person who is super friendly AND has a giant social pool - if you find this person you don't have to follow any of this.",t2_c3f6hjkg,ANGRYmoundofmoss,0,1622595516.0,0,t1_h09cugb,h09cugb,True,saucyminiseries,t3_npsf4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/westernmass/comments/npsf4l/friend_making/,Friend Making,/r/westernmass/comments/npsf4l/friend_making/h09cugb/,5,r/westernmass,0,5

Amherst is lefty and intellectual but still pricey and has lots of old money. Easthampton seems to be where everyone under 30 wants to hang out and has some really amazing shops (e.g. book moon).

I don't live in turners falls but I have some friends there. There are a lot of nice restaurants and shops on the main stretch with a lot of good places to get drinks. Turners is just a neighborhood of the larger town of Montague which is pretty rural outside of the turners falls area. I've been in western ma for 12 years and I'm noticing that the neighborhood seems to be going through somewhat of a renaissance as it was a bit run down when I first came to the area but now it has a very nice walkable downtown. There definitely is a drug problem but it's a pretty small town so not a lot of violence. It's nearby Greenfield which is the hub for Franklin county but outside of turners and greenfield there isn't much (outside of absolutely gorgeous outdoor and recreational things to do). You'd be about a 45 minute drive from Springfield which is a mid sized urban area and you're right on rt 2 which would get you to Boston in an hour 45.,t2_67zbw,notmyrealname17,0,1621544233.0,0,t1_gyvaeq6,gyvaeq6,True,TeacherFew424,t3_nh8dl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/westernmass/comments/nh8dl5/turners_falls/,Turners' Falls?,/r/westernmass/comments/nh8dl5/turners_falls/gyvaeq6/,3,r/westernmass,0,3
"I live in Williamstown, MA. I moved here from Eastern MA about 4-5 years ago. I'll say this: love the town you're in, but expect to drive to other towns often.

The Berkshires and Franklin, Hampden, and Hampshire have A LOT of wonderful places to explore -- in nature and businesses, restaurants, etc. But you'll have to drive.

For example, I love driving out to Montague to visit the Montague Bookmill. You might like driving out to North Adams and Williamstown for the museums (Mass MoCA, Clark, etc.), or Northampton for music shows.

From Montague / Greenfield, you'll be about an hour to Williamstown (the nw corner of the state) and Springfield (towards the Southern edge). Pittsfield or South County like Great Barrington is likely slightly longer, as there's no fast route there.

Before I moved out here, it'd take an hour to drive 15 miles or less around the Boston metro.

"It's a great place to live, just keep in mind that you really need a car to get around in Franklin County. There's a grocery store in Turners so if you live in downtown proper it isn't as challenging but to get out of town you really need a car.

Also keep in mind that in such a rural area, the culture you experience is less specific to the town itself. You'll spend a lot of time in Greenfield too and Hadley, Amherst, Northampton, Brattleboro, and Keene aren't too far away. Being on the Route 2 x Interstate 91 makes it super easy to travel.

"Turners Falls is cool if you want to live in an eclectic town. It's one of the old mill towns that used to be supported by the paper mill industry. Once those died out, Turners Falls kind of died too, but now it's reinventing itself with some artsy people leading the charge. It's true that it does have below average incomes and above average poverty, but I think it has a lot to offer. You've got:

* [Canalside Rail Trail](https://www.mass.gov/locations/canalside-rail-trail) right in town
* [Montague Plains Wildlife Management Area](https://www.mass-trails.org/towns/Montague/montagueplainswildlifemanagementarea.html) just outside of downtown
* [Barton Cove boat ramp](https://www.connecticutriverpaddlerstrail.org/crpt7/node/6738) right across the river
* [The Upper Bend](https://www.upperbend.com/) is a fairly new, but awesome little cafe in town. They're expanding right now too!
* [The Shea Theater](https://sheatheater.org/) right downtown has a lot of concerts/plays/etc normally (non-COVID times)
* [RiverCulture](https://www.riverculture.org/riverculture/) is a way Montague (the town that the village of Turners Falls is in) promotes the creative economy.
* I have to put in a plug for [The Montague Reporter](https://montaguereporter.org/) too, a local nonprofit newspaper that does excellent work covering Turners Falls and the surrounding area.


And while you may not ALWAYS have something to do in Turners, you can always go to Greenfield right next door: [Hawks and Reed](https://hawksandreed.com) is a great place to go to a concert, coffee shops/cafes/bakeries including: [Catalpa](https://catalpacoffee.com/), [Rise Above](https://rise-above-bakery.square.site/), [Shelburne Falls Coffee](https://shelburnefallscoffee.com), etc.

"I use a couple of slurs in this comment in order to relate my experience. I'm not using them gleefully.

Growing up, my best friend's father bragged about the LNB he would keep in all his cars. He was referring to a mini-bat and LNB stood for Little N-word Beater. He would explain this every time he mentioned it.

A bunch of guys on the football team got together to make t-shirts about immigrants going home. Half of those guys had parents that emigrated from Poland. The shirts weren't ironic.

I dated a Portuguese woman in my 20s when I lived there and the number of times she was called a ""spic"" in daylight hours was astounding. It's not even the right kind of racism.

One of the guys I knew that joined the Army and came back would delightedly tell a story at parties about dragging a child out of his house and beating him in the street with his ""Haji-be-good stick"". That story always got a lot of laughs.

Once while working customer service at a grocery store in the middle of the day, a repeat customer came up to the desk just to tell me the ""what's the difference between a tiger and an n-word"" joke.

Racist language about Asian people was so normalized while I was growing up, that I didn't realize calling someone a ""slope"", ""gook"", or ""zipperhead"" was particularly offensive until I was in high school. I thought those were just another way of saying Asian.

Those are just a few things off the top of my head.

"I think all of the towns you've listed have pretty similar vibes but it'll depend how close you want to be to amenities and how rural you want to feel. Sunderland and Pelham will have you closest to shopping and restaurants in Amherst and Hadley. 

Conway, Leverett, and Shutesbury are all farther out. Leverett is famous for their municipal broadband internet and they have a small co-op. Shutesbury is gorgeous but you might not have great cell reception. Figure out how important public utilities vs well and septic are to you, because in the smaller towns that will narrow your choices a lot. Also figure out if you care what county you're in. Franklin County is the most rural county in the state so everyone bands together and identifies as a county more so than hampshire county. 

All of the towns you listed will have access to great hiking trails and swimming holes nearby and are generally progressive.

"I lived in Sunderland when I was going to UMA. I‚Äôm pretty familiar with that whole area from like 10 years ago. I‚Äôd steer clear of the direct surrounding towns of Amherst, just with how filled of college kids they can get. 

North Hampton sounds like the kinda little rural city y‚Äôall might love. So maybe a town close by there? It‚Äôs got Smith College there but they‚Äôre not nuts like UMA kids and the campus is super gorgeous. Definitely recommend walking the campus in the spring time. Also, North Hampton has bunches of cute restaurants of all sorts of varieties along with some very chill adult drink spots (the tunnel martini bar for example)

You really won‚Äôt be in short supply of hiking opportunities. I‚Äôd be surprised if anyone in western mass wasn‚Äôt within 15 mins of some kinda hiking üòÇ

As for politics, it‚Äôs very progressive out here with pockets of conservatives. If you just check out the town by town voting results you can see it pretty clearly. Some western mass towns actually had the highest vote margins in favor of Biden in the whole state this past election.

That being said, not everyone chooses to go by the phases. You will never be asked for proof of eligibility (as long as you don't claim to be a senior citizen).

"Go to /r/CoronavirusMa - they constantly post tips and tricks. I highly recommend the Twitter bot to alert you the moment appointments are released.

The pre-registration site for the state only covers the mass vaccination sites. For all of the smaller locations at pharmacies, grocery stores, health departments, etc, you still need to look for appointments directly. Having a way to access those as soon as they're posted, or know what time they usually drop, is your best bet.

There's also a Facebook group that is very active in helping people get appointments successfully. They are often mentioned in that subreddit, I can't remember their name right now. Personally, I'm not that excited to give my name, date of birth, and insurance information to a stranger, but they claim to be good-hearted volunteers, and many people have had success with them.

Just about anyone with a clean criminal record and over the age of 21 can get a LTC Class A with the Hunting and Target Practice Restriction (I am guessing that is what you mean).

To get an LTC A, All Lawful Purposes (actual license to conceal carry) it really depends on the Chief of Police who is signing off on the application.

"I also moved to Western Mass for a job at UMass. If you like cheaper, old, and boring, check out a little north of Amherst like Greenfield. It's definitely cheaper than Amherst and there isn't really a big college kid population. It'll only really work if you don't mind commuting to UMass about 20-25 minutes by car. It's a nice drive though, no interstate or anything. I like Greenfield because it is closer to more outdoor recreation. It's right on Route 2 so you can easily head west on a scenic route toward the Berkshires. Here's a comment I wrote in response to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Greenfield/comments/k7waic/potentially_relocating_to_the_region_from_metro/) asking about Greenfield:

>I'm a transplant to Greenfield from Ohio, originally. I love it here. Some reasons I think you'd like it:

>* [GCET](https://gcet.net/): municipal broadband so you'll have fast, local internet for remote work
* Music scene: [Hawks and Reed](https://www.hawksandreed.com/) (where I've been to concerts, large comic book events, a play, and a watch party for a Greenfield mayoral debate), [Root Cellar](http://www.rootcellarbar.com/), [Green River Festival](https://www.greenriverfestival.com/)
* Art scene: A lot of local artists in the area and some small art venues like the [Greenfield Gallery](https://www.thegreenfieldgallery.com/) and the [LAVA Center](https://www.localaccess.org/). There's also [Artspace Community Arts Center](https://www.artspacegreenfield.com/)
* Food: [Rise Above](https://www.facebook.com/riseabove413/) (an excellent local bakery), [The People's Pint](https://thepeoplespint.com/), [Namaste](https://namastegreenfield.com/) (an Indian/Nepalese restaurant), [Thai Blue Ginger](https://thaiblueginger.com/), [Kobe Hibachi and Sushi](http://www.kobemass.com/), and a number of Chinese restaurants
* Tons of BLM and LGBTQ+ support (though, like anywhere, not 100% universal)
* Schools: You might be interested in [The Center School](https://centerschool.net/) and/or [Four Rivers Charter Public School](https://www.fourriverscharter.org/)
* Can definitely find a house in that price range. We just bought a 3 bedroom house within walking distance to downtown for <$200,000, though it needed a little bit of work, but nothing major.
* Swimming: [Green River Swimming Area](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/greenriver.html) or just drive up Green River Road and find a spot to wade in the water
* Outdoor activities: A number of [parks, playgrounds, and publicly-accessibly hiking trails on conservation](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/parks.html) land in town. The best hiking being [Griswold/GTD Conservation Area (PDF trail map)](http://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/pdfs/Griswold_Trail_Map.pdf) and [Highland Park/Temple Woods](https://www.greenfieldrecreation.com/pdfs/trails.pdf)
* Another perk is that you can take a train to NYC from Greenfield if you feel like having a big city adventure sometime.

"I think it depends on how much town you want and how much driving you want to do. Parts of Amherst and Belchertown have some pretty rural areas where you could rent a farm house and a few acres if that's what you want (but very pricey). 

Northampton and Amherst have the most restaurants and entertainment. Greenfield is much smaller than both of those but there's a handful of restaurants and bars. Agree that rental prices are much better there but I think housing stock isn't great so apartments will be on the older side but you might luck out. But in most towns out here it goes from small town to rural very quickly. 

Take Ashfield for example. Probably too far to Amherst but doable especially if you have some remote shifts. Small town center with a pizza shop, a cool restaurant that serves breakfast occasionally, last time I checked but maybe not anymore idk, a gas station, a sweet lake in the middle of town with a lakehouse bar and restaurant, some golf courses. But most of Ashfield becomes rural farm land within a half mile and is really gorgeous.  A lot of artists live there, and a lot of transplants give the town more of a sense of culture than you would expect, if you get to know people. There are some great community activities like a Fall Festival once a year, and for a lot a people it's just the right speed of life. Shelburne Falls would be your go to for light groceries and maybe a night out. 

I think there are a lot of places like that in west county (western Franklin County) but also Montague is kind of like that, Leyden is like that, Sunderland, Leverett, Deerfield, Greenfield to an extent. So depends on how much driving you want to do and how much town you want vs rural tranquility. But there is an abundance of natural beauty here that I would try to take advantage of.

You can get all the pads you need for it right in the rental shop too. You start with as coarse a grit they have and even it out and then and make your way up to a finer grit. Make sure to watch a video of how to do it before you start though! Between sanding the floor, staining and all the layers of sealant it took about 2-3 days (depending on how many layers of sealant you go with. It requires awhile in between coats to cure) if you have any other questions let me know!

"Pioneer Valley towns are a blend of old-school rural and blue-collar culture and liberal-urban-lgbtq-social justice college culture.  The former culture was historically blatantly racist.

I find the Greenfield is blended with more of the former. The police chief was found to have a huge confederate flag hanging in his garage several years ago.  The schools there are lower quality than Northampton schools. There some nice private options there if you can swing it.

Montague, is a sub-section if Greenfield, bit more rural/ spread out, a reputation for being more liberal. 

Northampton thinks it‚Äôs really woke, which can sometimes lead to it becoming more woke when the ignorance bubble is pierced.

"Hi, I live in greenfield myself.

I joined this subreddit solely for the fact that I love western mass in all it entirety. Ive been all around, and I can gladly offer you some guidance in your search.

Greenfield, in my opinion, is an acceptable choice for those a part of the LGBTQ+ community. But Northampton holds pride parades, and is much more small city-like if that‚Äôs the type of vibe you‚Äôre looking for. Northampton is great for being fairly close to Springfield or Holyoke, which are even more city like, and I would argue that Northampton, is a great fit for your given requirements. It should be worth noting, though, that Northampton‚Äôs surrounding towns tend to be more ‚Äúredneck‚Äù and such. Seems odd, but it is the truth.

Greenfield offers MANY different cuisine of cultures. Highly recommend Mesa Verde, super good food. There‚Äôs a good sense of community, and while they certainly don‚Äôt lack any pride in loving the LGBTQ+ commmunity, it‚Äôs not as strong as Northampton. I feel at Greenfield, there is no shortage of things to do, since there are look out points such as Sachem‚Äôs Head or Poet‚Äôs Seat Tower, and neighboring Shelburne Falls offers local eateries, the Glacial Potholes, and The bridge of flowers. Being at Greenfield, I feel so close to everything I could want. With that being said, its right on I-91, a two-lane highway that goes through all of western mass‚Äôs city-towns (with the exception of Pittsfield, though I don‚Äôt recommend there), but greenfield is right on MA Route-2, which westbound is scenic in any season, and goes right to Mass MoCA in North Adams.

"I used to do a lot of winter hiking, mostly in the valley state parks (Tom, Mt Holyoke, etc). Same rules apply as in the summer, but often the parking areas close much earlier or roads are closed at certain points.   
I highly recommend some type of crampon/stabilizer and a pole (although a found stick often works well). Depending on how the winter weather goes, most trails will get packed down within a few days of snowfall and can become very slick.  Once there is any level of snow, hiking in sneakers/boots alone will be extremely difficult. Some of the steeper inclines can become quite slick, and at times impassible. I've only ever needed snowshoes when going off trail or within 24hrs of significant snowfall.  
Hiking alone in the winter is ill advised, but knowing when to stop and turn back is the most important. I love the eastern side of Mt Tom in the winter along Lake Bray, Lost Boulder Trail, Keystone Trail. This area can be very quiet with lots of animal sightings and the tails don't go along the sharp cliff edge of the western side. Early spring when things start to thaw and refreeze is the most dangerous.  
If we get snow, there are some great maintained areas for cross country skiing and snowshoeing at Northfield Mountain and Notchview, they offer affordable rentals.  
Right now the long range forecast is for a mild winter, so you might be hiking in sneakers all winter.",t2_wizgk,PolarBlueberry,0,1606233442.0,0,t1_gdgcbce,gdgcbce,True,kenncann,t3_jzsu0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/westernmass/comments/jzsu0u/questions_about_winter_hiking_in_western_mass/,Questions about winter hiking in western mass,/r/westernmass/comments/jzsu0u/questions_about_winter_hiking_in_western_mass/gdgcbce/,3,r/westernmass,0,3

"1. I guess it depends on ""the area"" specifically, western mass is a big place with lots of different parks, state parks, state forests, land trusts, etc. generally wherever hiking is allowed in summer, it's allowed in winter. you might find some hiking trails have turned into cross-country ski trails or snowmobile trails though, it just depends where you go.
2. I don't imagine you'll need full blown crampons unless you're doing some ice climbing, usually microspikes or snowshoes are fine on all the normal trails, again it just depends on the conditions and where exactly you're going
3. state parks like Mt Toby and Mt Sugarloaf will have lots of visitors and foot traffic so those are safer to do alone, since someone can find you quickly if you get hurt. there are some much more remote trails up in the hilltowns, without cell service, where you won't get found for days if you can't hike out on your own",t2_3q54g,addressunknown,0,1606174383.0,0,t1_gddtmgg,gddtmgg,True,kenncann,t3_jzsu0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/westernmass/comments/jzsu0u/questions_about_winter_hiking_in_western_mass/,Questions about winter hiking in western mass,/r/westernmass/comments/jzsu0u/questions_about_winter_hiking_in_western_mass/gddtmgg/,5,r/westernmass,0,5

For affordability I would say Chicopee or Holyoke. They also have a lot of places for music and such. Holyoke has nice hiking areas with Mt. Tom being there. South Hadley is nice but I don't think there's as much of a night life scene. It seems like more of an old people's town but it depends on the area. $1000 could get you a nice one bedroom apartment in all of those areas except Northampton. I don't know about Holyoke but Chicopee does have cheap electricity. I was paying at most $60 a month in the summer with window unit A/c for a 800sqft apartment.

>he spotted a 2017 Toyota Sienna minivan merge onto the off-ramp and driving around 50-miles-per-hour.

>The speed limit for the ramp is 30.

Those 20-30 mph ramp limits are bullshit. No one takes them that slowly, including the cops. And if you try it, you'll have an angry driver up your ass in no time. Hell, I've had state troopers zip up my ass at 50 when I was doing 35 or 40 on a ramp before...

In rain, freeze, or snow, those limits become much more reasonable. But in normal dry conditions? 

If you had to follow those limits, you'd be trying to merge onto a 65mph road from 30 mph. Unless you're in a sports car that's not even reasonable.

So basically it's just another excuse for cops to pull over people they think look sketchy, as seen here.

Gotta say, that concept is way too central to US policing. Which, interestingly enough, they don't even do in other ""westernized"" countries. As I was just pointing out in another comment... I spent an entire month in New Zealand, and I think I saw a cop car with lights going after someone **once**. They were going after drag racers.
