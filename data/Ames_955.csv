“That’s bone,” I point out. “And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.”

"> Their country has been resistant to join under any organization since they’re claimed their independence in the fall of the SU.

#**This is a straight-up lie.**

##**Ukraine has been openly and vocally trying to join the European Union since 1993, and NATO since 1992.**

In 1994, the two parties signed a formal Partnership & Cooperation Agreement, which is sort of the bottom rung on the ladder towards future EU membership for countries with unreliable democratic institutions. They have held dozens of summits together since the late 1990s, as Ukraine grew into a better partner for the EU. 

In 2002, the Ukrainian president stated that his country wanted an Association Agreement (the last step before membership) by 2004, and promised that Ukraine would meet all membership requirements no later than 2011. 

The 2004 Orange Revolution happened because Ukrainians were furious about a rigged election taking them further away from Europe instead of closer to it. 

In 2005, Ukraine said it would apply for EU membership ""soon"". 

In 2008, Ukraine applied to begin the NATO membership process (which normally takes about 2 years to complete).

In 2009, the EU and Ukraine agreed on a roadmap for association.

In 2014, Ukrainians overthrew the pro-Russian puppet government and elected a pro-European, pro-EU, pro-democracy government, headed by president Petro Poroshenko.

Later in 2014, after Russia invaded southeast Ukraine, the Ukrainian government stated that joining NATO was a high priority.

In 2019, Ukrainian voters got rid of Poroshenko because he wasn't moving *fast enough* toward EU membership. Zelenskyy was elected instead.

Also in 2019, Ukraine's parliament **amended the national constitution to make pursuing EU and NATO membership a constitutional requirement**.

Throughout the 2000s, Ukrainian diplomats continued to chip away at other states' objections to Ukrainian membership. Year by year, they got more and more states to publicly announce their support for Ukrainian membership in the EU. This work has been culminating in the last week, as I believe the last holdouts have changed their minds and are now in support.

**On 28 February 2022 (yes, that's today) the Ukrainian president went on worldwide television and asked the EU to fast-track Ukraine's membership.**",t2_gicmz,ornryactor,0,1646070034.0,0,t1_hysww3f,hysww3f,False,skanzen69,t3_t2ww36,https://www.reddit.com/r/ames/comments/t2ww36/show_support_for_ukraine/,Show support for Ukraine,/r/ames/comments/t2ww36/show_support_for_ukraine/hysww3f/,3,r/ames,0,3

"Everyone I've known who has lived under Haverkamp (including myself) have been pleased. First Property Management was the bare minimum, if that. I absolutely loved living at the Quarters. Like someone else said, avoid Triplett as much as you can.

As broke college students, we frequented Perkins for half priced apps, Boulder Tap House for half priced apps and drink deals, Jethros and Buffalo Wild Wings for BOGO wings, Fuji for sushi and drink deals. Cornbred is a pretty good fusion BBQ place. I've heard lots of good things about Szechuan House, Thai Kitchen is good as well. Macubana is wonderful for drink deals and drunk food, we also often order tea/coffee and studied there during the slower afternoon hours. Cafe Beaudelaire is probably my favorite place in Ames, they are owned by the same people as Macubana. Amazing brunch, decent drink deals (they have gone up a couple dollars in the last few years, understandably), good food all around.

If you want to get a drink and prefer to avoid the chaotic younger/student population on Welch Ave/Chamberlain, Mother's Pub is a decent place. Also The London Underground. If you want to get wasted with college students, go to AJ's/Sips/Paddy's. Thursday-Saturday at 11pm (correct me if I'm wrong) is Sips O'Clock (edit: at Sips), where they give out shots/drinks on the house.

"Hickory Park and Casey's pizza will become staples of your diet. Do not resist.

Ada Hayden Park makes for wonderful walks around a large lake. ISU central campus is also always great for walks or bike rides; it's truly beautiful.

If near campus at 11:50 AM on weekdays, stop and give the Campanile a listen. Dr. Tam always delivers.

If of the nerdy persuasion, Mayhem on Lincoln Way will be your new favorite shop.

Local bars typically have had bands performing in the past (not sure what the status currently is with COVID) and a pub crawl around Campustown is always enjoyable thanks to a plethora of bars and restaurants.

There's an apartment building behind a retirement home and the Habitat for Humanity place on Grand Avenue, almost at the edge of town. 3500 Grand Avenue.

"If you are renting, expect Year long leases… basically no exceptions. It’s a college town and the rental companies all do it.

If you are young and like the college scene, I’d suggest trying to live near the college or west Ames, preferably near Lincoln Way. That the major East/West street and has consistent bus traffic to get you around.

If you don’t care about campus town, then try and get something near Mainstreet, being able to walk around is undersold when considering places to live.  Not to mention there is a grocer and the hospital near downtown.

"Here's the thing. People are quick to point to anything and e everything a homeless guy does and try to accuse it of being some sort of scam. Just because a group of homeless people are working together doesn't mean they are doing anything dishonest. They're just pooling their money together at the end of the day so that maybe they can get a hotel that night or something. People act like there's some moral code that says thall shall not work together while panhandling. Well, why they hell not? Other people work together and pool money together all the time. Why is it suddenly wrong when the homeless do it?

Also, theres not that many true scam artists out there. Guys who arent really homeless or at least poor, I mean. Now, there tends to be more of the scam artists when you go to the south, especially to major tourist destinations like Florida. This is because being a scam artist can net you big money in Florida. But this here is the upper Midwest. Most of the homeless people you see here are from the northern half of the United States. 

Also, even if you are being scammed by a homeless guy, you aint getting scammed for much. You only lost two or 3 dollars, generally speaking. If youre gonna get mad at someone for scamming you, get mad at your insurance agent. You know, the agent who keeps coming up with inventive excuses to raise your rates every year?

"Our two cats were regularly treated there. We described the symptoms of our cat and I was told they couldn't see our cat until late the following week.

If they allow an assistant without training to determine whether the symptoms of an animal are serious, they definitely have a huge problem. Especially since there were pandemic restrictions and we were not allowed to walk in with our pet. 

I called another vet to see if they could see it, they couldn't but I described the symptoms, and they told us it was an emergency and I should go to ISU immediately. ISU then contacted Sommerset for follow-up treatment which, of course, we did somewhere else.

"Contrasting opinion on Somerset: we were impressed with them when we first moved here but their quality of service became disappointing during the pandemic.  They're not horrible people or anything like that, but they were not particularly responsive or attentive, and they didn't want to invest time in diagnostic work to figure out what our last cat's actual issue was.  

My understanding is that their workload at the time exceeded their staff's capacity.  That was last spring, so things may have improved for them since then.

The Ames housing market is crazy. Good houses are on the market for days sometimes hours. Our housing prices are lower than other parts of the country. I have heard of more than one person over buying because of how cheap it is and regretting it. 

 We live in Old Town. Main Street and the Library are within walking distance and one major grocery chain called Fareway. There is also a farmers market on main street in the summer (and winter). Old Town is centrally located so close to everything. And it is well established so lots of trees and charm. Brookside park is a 5-10 minute walk. The food co-op is also located downtown. Plus the parades are on main street. We walk to all of these. I honestly park my car Friday night and don't take it out again until work on Monday.

There is also south Ames, but there isn't much there. Expect a 10 min drive for groceries. It is semi established, but missing the charm. Sam's Club and Lowe's are there and it would be a quick commute to your husband's work.

West Ames is dominated by new houses and college apartments. There is some groceries stores on that side. It could be a quick drive to your husband's work via highway 30. It lacks charm since it's so new and so full or apartments.

The posh part of town is in the north, but getting there is a hassle because the roads were not designed to handle the traffic that goes there. It has major congestion in the early evenings and morning.

"Good! Maybe the feds getting involved will force the hand of this backwards state and make them do the right thing. Too many of the people living in these places could be better served in home-like environments, in their communities rather than locked away, warehoused in institutions, but our “leaders” refuse to do anything about the low pay, lack of benefits and protections for the jobs. Who wants to do a job like this that is mentally, emotionally and physically exhausting for no benefits and part time hours when they can just go work in retail or a warehouse like Amazon for better and conditions? Iowa is and always has been one of the states with lowest Medicaid reimbursement, lowest paying for healthcare workers and no protections or benefits, all while those running these places are allowed to pocket millions off the backs of the most vulnerable among us. Some of the little things that have happened in these institutions are nothing short of horror stories! For all the employees who care and want to do a good job, there are so many more who are just there for a job and don’t treat the people right. 
Iowa legislators do not care about healthcare workers or patients. If changes are going to be made, it will have to be by force because they were not given a choice.

"I'm brown, hispanic. 

Mad because no one can defend the poor guy and then the story doesn't have me all that convinced. There were tons of people leaving and he wasn't keeping any track of them.

Facebook post on Ames people from a young interracial couple. (This is my version)

He is African American and she is white(American?). Owner told the husband ""100"" people in front of him, he asked ""really 100 people"" and the owner said yeah. He was sort of discouraged to wait (I got the same feeling personally and saw the owner telling this to everyone in front of me and behind me) but I did not think of it as racist and more overwhelmed and trying to cut down the line.

Guy goes back to the car explains everything to the wife, gets on the phone with parents who aren't there yet to maybe go elsewhere and the wife decides to walk in (EXACTLY 120 SECONDS AFTER HIM ACCORDING TO HER) and the owner tells her 20 minutes and points to the round table that should open up for their party size of I think 5. 

They GO BACK in and are seated and waiting for the parents (some places won't seat you without everyone being there by the way) at which point they decide they will not be eating there due to the racist acts that took place.

"The good: 
- Pancakes were REALLY GOOD! Saw someone that had some wicked looking milk chocolate/black and white ones. Will probably try that. 
      - syrup with these was nice and warm!!
-Food came out quick for being so busy.  
- overall good flavor to the food
- The meals we ordered you can choose a side, wife was happy biscuit and gravy was a choice as she said that it's usually a meal choice.
- The environment/Vibe did have a nice feel to it compared to before

The things I would have never tell the owner but hopefully someone shows him this:    
- I chose the carnivore skillet, some of the larger chunks of potatoes weren't cooked all the way. (Rookie mistake but it happened to both of our plates)
-I think they make the meal first and then cook the egg after, it was room temp when it got to our table and the eggs were hot (Again rookie mistake) 
- it's only one Pancake for the side.
- Ordered a stack of 2 afterwards and for some reason they didnt come with syrup? (Not sure if they forgot but seen a comment on FB that they were charging)

"I felt the need to share my experience at this location  due to a post made on Ames People about this establishment. Sadly the wife is afraid of backlash if I post to Facebook so can someone here please share for me.

My wife and I (Hispanic couple) visited this establishment twice this weekend. I have been waiting for MONTHS to eat here. Tired of needing to go to Ankeny/DSM. In no moment did I ever feel/see anything remotely racist directed towards me or my wife.

Saturday at about 10:30 we arrive and as usual when eating at a breakfast spot I get down to check how busy things are. I walk in wearing sweats and a hoodie. The entrance is packed... (doesnt take many people for it to get crowded) I squeeze through and get to the counter. I ask the owner how long for 2 people, he looks down at a paper and tells me 35-45min. (I got a feeling like he wanted to clear out his lobby and was blowing smoke) I think he could tell I was bummed and we were in a hurry anyway so I told him not to worry I would be back. The owner put his arm on my shoulder, looked me in the eyes apologized and we left. It was one of the most genuine apologies I've ever had.

Sunday we arrive at 10am and I was prepared... just like Saturday he told the couple in front and myself 35-45 minutes in the exact same tone with his lobby just as full. I told him it's fine and to write my name down. Went to my car and waited for about 15min while I observed tons of people keep leaving, then noticed the couple ahead of us gone. Walked in again at 10:15 without my wife and the entrance was even more packed. I finally made eye contact with the owner from behind the glass door he smiled and immediately he grabbed two menus and had us seated. While eating, I saw countless people LEAVE while waiting.

Two things I know... I KNOW the people who left are the reason why we got in so quick and I KNOW THAT THE GUY JUST OPENED SO HE HAS NO CLUE HOW LONG THE WAIT REALLY IS... what restaurant does.

There was another Hispanic family eating when we arrived and there were Hispanic employees that I spotted. I assume the family has some roots from another country, the guy looks like an Italian mobster (kidding but not kidding). Point being he isn't your typical Ihop/hickory park hostess which may be the position he needs to hire for next.

Now aside from my experience here. I'd put my money on white privilege/american female privilege.

"It’s good for people who want a quiet neighborhood. Price is not really reasonable considering they still advertise to ISU students and it happens to be literally on the edge of the city.

Great if you have pets with the dog park nearby, but pricy for the deposit and monthly fees if it is not a dog. Amendities are weak, but their “arcade” lounge is fairly fun. Quality of the apartment is mediocre but comfortable, so overall it was OK. It worked out just fine, main complaint was the price, I would’ve picked a different apartment in hindsight.

Also, Ankeny absolutely is not 20 minutes away. Get Google Maps directions end-to-end before you make a decision. The timing on Google maps is accurate to within 2-3 minutes. It's probably about 35 minutes on average.

Ames is a difficult town to characterize. 4-5 months out of the year it's rough with the winter/cold. Almost the whole town feels dead and everyone's inside 85% of the time. The rest of the time, it's pretty chill. But you really have to be willing to commit to the 'chill' idea fully, because you won't have a choice. It's quiet/not much going on.

"From an Ames High student... if administration doesn’t change soon (again!), it’s gonna get a lot worse. I’m a senior, and have gone through 3 principals now, each worse than the last. Staff is unhappy with administration, students are unhappy with administration, and generally Ames High just isn’t as good as it was my freshman year. 

We are treated like elementary schoolers, forced to waste 30 minutes of instruction time on homeroom activities that would work better in 5th grade. Apparently this time is going to be transitioned to “excursions” which are supposed to be supplemental/enrichment activities, but there was nothing wrong with our old Plus Periods. The same treatment is allegedly applied to staff as well, who spend their meeting times participating in icebreakers. I have yet to talk to a single teacher that is agreeing and happy about what this new administration is doing. 

This administration seems hell-bent on changing things for the sake of changing things. Val, as our principal is *affectionately* called, is trying her best to block our traditional “Coffee House” talent shows. She wore a Hawkeyes hat during the Little Cy-Hawk game. We have hall monitors and restrooms without doors. Next week will be our 5th different schedule since the beginning of the school year. Fights are apparently a common occurrence now. For the first 2 weeks of the school year, there was not enough room to eat in the cafeteria.

"Ankeny commute isn't bad - around 20 minutes?  I personally hate Ankeny quite a bit, though.  If you like cookie-cutter sub-divisions and bland soccer moms, though, it may be up your alley.

Big daycare shortage.  The big centers are full and the smaller in-home daycares tend to fail for a variety of reasons.

&#x200B;

I've never had water in my basement here, but all over central Iowa it is a fairly common problem - a few puddles here and there.

I've had good experiences with Martin Properties for rentals, but your mileage may vary.

Roads are cleared fine if you're in town or commuting from Ankeny.  The winters are icy, snowy, and cold as a mf.  I detest them.

Teacher pay is stagnant but better than in most places in the South and South-Midwest.

"Teacher pay in Iowa is pretty consistent.  New teachers can expect to make $35-40k, eventually rising to about twice that.   Finding daycare is an issue for sure.

"Teacher pay- unknown, sorry. I have a friend that teaches at Gilbert and loves it. If you live in ames she may choose to teach at an ames school. 

Daycare- a f****** nightmare. Got on waiting lists while pregnant and still barely found daycare before returning to work. We chose a center since we were not from ames. Expect to pay 1300$/month if you have an infant. 

Ankeny-commute will be 20-30 min

Winter- ohhh boys you’ll be in for a rough ride lol. I would recommend an all wheel or 4 wheel drive vehicle. I work early and a lot of things aren’t plowed when I go to work (6 am). 

West Ames- there is nothing inherently bad about west ames, just mostly for students. I’ve lived there and it’s not crime ridden or anything- just not best for busy professionals with children. If living in ames I would aim for north or north/central. I would personally avoid near the mall and by Target/Walmart due to crime. 

Rental homes- depends on your budget. Another weird thing about ames is most rentals will run August-July due to high influx of students

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

A more general comment not directed at OP -

I was a strong supporter of the Healthy Life Center bond (having moved from a community that had a nearly identical facility that was the lifeblood of the community) and I was pretty bummed the disinformation campaign around it by Ames Fitness was so effective. One of my frustrations at the time was that the general public kept saying ""just build a pool without the other stuff!"" as if that would make the cost be 1/3rd of the HLC plan.  So here we are, spending $11M on a pool when we could have had it all for $19M on free land from ISU.  The city gym and rec facilities are 85 years old and will have to be rebuilt at some point in the near future.  Once that happens, you get to do maintenance and general staffing activities in two facilities instead of one (or not have the gym anymore, and all the nice programs they do there for families and the elderly), and it's sure as heck not going to cost <$8M to do it.
