"It's an interesting question. Most pet snakes are (should be) bred in captivity. So in theory they wouldn't have the same territorial association as a wild-born snake since they wouldn't have a ""natural birthplace"" and would never have had to find their own food. A lot of those pet trade snakes live in plastic shoe boxes until they find owners, so if they wind up in a suitable, proper enclosure as someone's pet, it's definitely an upgrade. (of course maybe they didn't need to be born in the first place...)

But it is understood that transport *is* rather stressful for them, and most husbandry guidance advises leaving them alone for a while after major events (shipping, feeding, illness) so they can adjust and recover. 

It's a terrible idea to capture wild snakes (or anything else) to keep as pets; animals found in the wild should be left there.

From what I understand, the research into snakes' ability to ""bond"" with people (in as much as you can actually investigate this), would suggest they don't have the capacity to feel emotions or form relationships with people, but they can definitely be conditioned to accept handling and human interaction. Folks who keep them as pets might disagree though, and say that their snake's behavior demonstrates some level of connection.

In general, I have mixed feelings on keeping pets that live in cages. On one hand, it seems terribly sad that an animal might live out its entire existence in a box, when in nature it would freely roam a much larger territory. But in the wild it would have to be a successful hunter/forager and evade predators to survive, while as a pet these challenges would be no concern. Attentive owners are likely to identify medical issues that can be treated, whereas the same condition in the wild might be fatal. But again, is it right for us to raise animals simply for the purpose of storing them in cages for our own enjoyment?

I think the increasing popularity of pet snakes has done wonders for improving their ""standing"" and reputation among the public. More people seem to care about and respect them, and take an interest in educating others about them. All of that helps relieve some of the fear and dislike that has led to unnecessary and ruthless destruction of wild populations. Although that still goes on at a depressingly large scale.

The biggest downside to the pet trade is the black market. So many wild reptiles & birds are captured around the globe and shipped illegally. Many don't survive. But since they're ""just snakes"", there isn't as much public concern or outcry. There are also a lot of careless and uneducated owners, who keep their pets in miserable, substandard conditions.

And because the ""relationship"" is pretty one-sided (your snake doesn't greet you at the door wagging its tail like your dog), there is often a desire among owners to ""get more"". People are prone to start ""collecting"" snakes, as if they were objects instead of living creatures. People seek out increasingly rare or dangerous snakes, perhaps out of some need to impress or conquer. I think it's pretty selfish, and often just a form of attention seeking, because it is ""cool"".

I had a pet snake a long time ago. I initially got her because I adored snakes and thought it was ""cool"" to interact with something that most people feared. She was a good ambassador for her kind. Many of my friends and family overcame their fears by being around her and finding out she wasn't scary or slimy, but soft and harmless and fascinating to watch. Having her definitely increased my fondness for snakes. So much so, that I'd never own another. I prefer to spend time in nature, hoping for a chance encounter, and supporting local science museums and nature centers that are perfectly suited to continue the public education and outreach- at a much larger scale.

"We get dealers bringing cars in doing the same all the time, so it's not uncommon. Like you said, laugh and move on.

Here's the rub:

There are a set of monitors that are reset when you clear the check engine codes. At that time they read ""Not Ready"" and must be driven to confirm everything is working okay. Every car and every sensor has different drive cycles so the mileage will vary but we're supposed to tell people a couple days of normal driving.

Sometimes you'll get some that clear in a couple trips around the block, then there's the van I had that did almost 600 miles of varied driving with no luck.

Snakes help that. Rabbits eating your garden? Snakes help with that. Voles eating your roots of plants? Snakes help with that. See a snake and freaked out?

"Yes, you’re a conservative. People that say the government is just filled with lazy people, are libertarian, think public colleges are worse than ever and far left propaganda machines, and characterize the government as the “nanny state” is what I and most people associate with american conservatives. I’m genuinely surprised to hear you voted for Clinton and Biden and not Trump. That’s the only surprising part of this post that could have been written by any baby boomer fox news viewer or WSJ reader. It’s just generic conservative nonsense that doesn’t hold up to even light scrutiny if you have a more diversified media diet and engaged with progressives in a way where you actually want to learn and understand our positions. Enjoy being outraged by trans people and critical race theory and all the other things that conservatives dupe stupid people into caring about so that they can focus on cutting taxes for wealthy people and gutting SS and Medicare because “we can’t afford them” even though we can easily afford if we taxed people in the 1% more like me. I should be thanking you really for spouting off views that reinforce a world view that people like me should be coddled even more by the tax code because government is evil. It’s sad but I shouldn’t waste my time arguing with conservatives, because you’re a lost cause. I spent time engaging with you because I thought you were a moderate and were amenable to changing your mind if presented with evidence and research. I don’t think you’re interested in anything that counters the notion that “government is always bad and a waste of money”.

"I really don't have a strong opinion on that particular county, or its elected officials, one way or another.

What I do believe is that whenever you have a county like Rutherford, where the population tends to skew very heavy in one political direction, it puts a county more at risk with having public officials who make political points in a way to be be popular with the residents of the majority viewpoint, and often neglect the viewpoints of those they are supposed to serve who have a different way of seeing the world.

This is especially common with Sheriffs who are directly elected. It could filter down to police chiefs of cities and towns who are hired by an administrator who serves at the pleasure of elected officials, but there are more layers in between to somewhat buffer the politics.

Sheriffs in counties like Rutherford tend to be very brazen in using their position as a political/cultural war soapbox because if the voters love it, they aren't going to look too deeply in some of the stuff that might be going on behind the scenes and the sheriffs know this since they don't answer to another official above them, unless they do something extremely crazy, and even then, they aren't as accountable as one would think.

I can't say this is or isn't happening in Rutherford County with anyone who is currently in office. All I'm saying is it has the demographics to put it at higher risk for this kind of thing.",t2_s1jkky6,SCAPPERMAN,0,1648247010.0,0,t1_i24gbsm,i24gbsm,True,Lukeract,t3_tmofiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tmofiv/does_rutherford_county_have_a_reputation_outside/,Does Rutherford County have a reputation outside of itself for being corrupt?,/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tmofiv/does_rutherford_county_have_a_reputation_outside/i24gbsm/,1,r/NorthCarolina,0,1

"Wrong.  I dont watch Fox news..  Most people know the government is packed with an unreasonable number of lazy people who are overpaid with too many benefits.

I am also not in favor of expanding them when we are already in a severely underfunded position.  I also am against a nanny state.  You might call me conservative.

"Looks like it might have been a bit of performative politics to not look soft on guns / gun violence on Coopers part then if it truly was redundant like you say then I am not a fan of that. 

However it sure doesnt back up your original comment which is somehow implying Cooper supports Jim Crow. You know what you were doing. 

At any rate I can tell you right now, ive got plenty of conservative black people in my family and if Republicans wanted to capture more black votes it would take time but start with the obvious. Do their best to purge racists from the party. 

Within a 5 mile radius of my house me and my black brother in law can drive around and find several houses with Trump 2024 flags sharing a flagpole with one of multiple variants of the Confederate States of America flags. I have never seen that treasonous flag sharing a flagpole of a Biden or Obama flag. 

White Republicans either are:

A. Outrageously, almost unforgivably ignorant of what that flag means to many black people in this country or

B. They know what it means and they actively support the original institutions the treasonous Confederacy fought for

"> The earliest Homo sapiens date back 150,000 years.

TIL homo sapiens are the only humans ever to have existed.

> prior to the agricultural revolution (~6000 years ago) humans spent on average significantly less time “working”

That sounds nice. I bet it gave them plenty of time to run from predators and hold their loved ones as they died from a bacterial infection. If time spent working is the only metric for measuring a successful society, there's still plenty of hunter/gatherer tribes in southern Africa for us to emulate. If we're lucky, maybe they'd take a little time off from murdering each other and enslaving women to teach us a thing or two!

> Exponential Scientific advancement and globalization is what has led to humanity’s current level of “prosperity”, not fucking Adam Smith.

This is just false. The timeline of technological advancement shows a precipitous increase (one might call it ""exponential"") with the advent of free markets across the globe.

"My side is not a political party. 

My side is one of compassionate sound policy, not hyper-partisan cheerleading.

Want to know why I opposed medicaid expansion?

two reasons...

First there is no guarantee that the feds keep their end of the deal. They could at any time decided to A) cut the budgets leaving the state on the hook for the balance and busting our budget or B) start to tie funding to other mandates essentially holding the state hostage for the funds. 

Next there is the issue fraud. Lots of people seem to dismiss it but there has literally be **billions** in medicaid fraud in the last decade or so, and I'm not aware of how the expansion bill put forth before NC really addresses that.

"Please read my comment carefully. If you see MTG or Madison Cawthorne as similarly extreme or bad as AOC or Bernie, than yes, that’s an indefensible position. Nobel Prize winning economist David Card just had an NBER working paper come out that showed VA health care was more efficient and higher quality than private sector health care, which isn’t even a novel finding. I don’t think you’re as up on health policy literature as you think you are. Most other developed countries have MORE public investment and regulation surrounding health care and enjoy lower costs and better outcomes. Medical debt (like student debt) is largely an isolated phenomenon found in the US. Programs like Medicare involve higher payroll taxes but are much less costly for average people and businesses. Our more privatized system is unusual and much more inefficient compared to other countries where medical bankruptcies are rare (not here where they are the cause of the majority of people declaring bankruptcy report that’s medical bills is the reason why). Frankly, I’ve never met or read a health economist or health policy analyst that has argued for less public investment or regulation in health care as a way to control costs and improve quality and achieve greater

"Lol dude you sound like either a DARE cop or someone who's never seen drugs. There is no differentiation between 'crack' and 'crack-cocaine.' Those are the same thing - a 'free base' version of cocaine made by processing it with sodium bicarb to remove the hydrochloride.

""Cocaine and crack look different to the naked eye but these drugs have no pharmacological differences, according to Drug Policy Alliance. You may wonder how these drugs differ and if one is more dangerous to use than the other. In short, the answer is no.""

Most cocaine is already pretty dirty, even the stuff drug addicts used to think of as pure. None of this stuff is made to laboratory standards.

"It is a sham because the core values of Conservatism boil down to pedantic bullshit and/or bigotry. 

It can't claim to be the party of freedom when it attempts to police freedoms away from certain groups, such as marriage, abortion, or adoption. It can't claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility when so many of its policies are rooted in spending money in the least productive ways possible. It can't claim to be the party of small government when it is so intent on growing aspects of the government to execute aforementioned policing of freedoms. It can't claim to be the party of family values when its leadership flouts those same values consistently while trying to codify what family values are to a very narrow definition.

Yeah sometimes more than once a season now🙃. I mean there’s a lot of other things. I think what people don’t realize is there isn’t a law or regulation that’s just gonna straight out say farmers give up your land. However I do find there are many things that tend to benefit specifically developers and push out farmers. Or developers will use current legislation loopholes to their benefit to get land they see and want. Like I’ve stated under other previous comments. Every farmer has a right to sell their land and do whatever they want with it as any landowner can do. I find a problem when the farmer gets backed into a corner to sell and it turns into being their only option they have and usually they are pricing the land for just the land not the profitability of the land as farm use land. Also the alternative is lawsuits and it just hasn’t always gone in the farmers favor when trying to go up against developers so usually losing with lots of debt from court stuff also. I understand the need for more housing and such but I just wish the whole process was being handled better.,t2_hn7almmu,Louise41698,0,1648227916.0,0,t1_i235m78,i235m78,False,gaukonigshofen,t3_tm31ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tm31ng/local_farmers_being_pushed_out_of_wake_county_as/,Local farmers being pushed out of Wake County as demand for land soars :: WRAL.com,/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tm31ng/local_farmers_being_pushed_out_of_wake_county_as/i235m78/,1,r/NorthCarolina,0,1

"I’m fairly new to NC, but I’ll share what I’ve learned so far. Basically this DD is “I’m not walking away from this offer” money the buyer puts down. For any reason…. It could be black mold and satan’s doorway to hell spawns daemons in the basement. DD goes towards the total cost.

Then comes the due diligence period which is set with the offer. I can say 0-21+ days to do any inspections I want. If after this period I walk out I lose my escrow payment. So that’s 2 kicks in the dick.

Ready for number 3?! If the appraisal comes short I have to make up that difference in cash. Or I can walk away from the due diligence which some people are offering $25k+.

Also if the seller knows something is broken they can just play it cool and wait it out. They can just not say they have black mold and if the buyer finds it they can take the seller to court to recoup that due diligence…. But good luck proving they knew.

"She was wrong for the decision she made and she definitely brought on unnecessary costs to the situation. Having said that, it’s kinda pathetic to throw her to the curb the second something goes wrong. Marriage is supposed to be about supporting each other and being there through tough times. Sure they’ll have to pay more for this but it’s not crippling considering as you say they both have good jobs. Adjustments should be made in her decision making and if she can’t adjust going forward then sure maybe further action should be taken. People should be given a chance to recover and improve after they make mistakes they shouldn’t be thrown away. It feels like when people ask others opinions on these types of things everyone is too quick to tell you to run. A real man would be there for her and help her grow from this. It’s also worth considering the effect it will have on the kids to abruptly separate. Five drinks over 3-4?hours is not a crazy amount, she was probably close to the limit, still should’ve got an Uber. Everyone makes mistakes, time heals these wounds and people learn.

"I worked for one for 1.75 years. Pay was the best I had by that point, but still fell short for the type of work. My biggest qualms were that the offenders got away with too much due to the possibility of being sued or making them angry. The administration almost always sided with the offenders and not the officers, so us officers were left feeling like we didn't matter, that our safety was not a top priority, and we did not feel like our concerns we being heard or answered.

The offenders have more rights than we do, and can get away with assault and other actions without any repercussions. You could try to write them up for something they weren't supposed to do, and DHO would throw it out - a few examples: not long before I left, we were told we could no longer write them up for smoking in the blocks, they got rid of unauthorized movement (they wouldn't get in trouble for being in an area they weren't supposed to be), and would get away with having smoking paraphernalia.

Also, there was a fellow officer who was assaulted with one of those thick handled wooden brooms - hit at the base of his skull and neck, knocked out, and the offender didn't get any charges even though the officer tried to, and the prison wouldn't help him with it. The prison administration wouldn't help one of the nurses who was trying to take charges out on an offender who was released and started stalking her, and the issues had begun while he was still incarcerated and she had even reported it to them. The state has also eliminated retirement for any future officers, effective from around May of 2020. 

What incentive is there for anyone willing to risk their life and not get anything in return when they reach retirement age? I'm still in that line of work, except I work for a county jail, but at least I will get retirement, everyone there has your back if you need help, and administration is awesome.

"I left NC DPS Prisons last year for a ton of reasons. I worked at the Harnett Correctional 3805 facility for 3.5 years. I was an officer there for a while. 

To start off, just like every prison, we were grossly understaffed. Overtime was mandatory whether you wanted it or not because ""the needs of the state come before your own."" If I got a day off, I  couldn't enjoy it because I was either having to work OT the next day or I was afraid my phone would ring with a lieutenant telling me I had to come in. The only excuse that seemed to work was to tell them I had been drinking. Still, seeing the number come across my screen started causing my heart rate to increase. The understaffing had gotten so bad that they had announced at lineup that not only would we be covering OT for the other night shift but we would also have to cover a full 12.25 hours for day shift as well. Crying in the car in the driveway, crying myself to sleep or crying before I left for shift became more common as time went on. 

Want to get promoted? Forget it unless you're a day shift officer and you're being buddies with the captain on the 1B shift. Management was basically the ""Good Ol' Boy"" club. A lot of officers leaving was due to them. Some weren't part of this posse but were just as terrible for God knows what reason. I've seen other officers breakdown over the treatment they were given. Not all of management was bad but they were easily outweighed by the bad ones. It also didn't help at all that the bad ones stayed friendly with the assistant warden of custody.

If you have the unfortunate luck to be assigned as a disciplinary officer, you had to do a lot of work normally done by a sergeant for no extra pay. You had to conduct investigations, interview inmates and possibly other staff (which was even more difficult if they were on an opposite rotation from you), type a report, assign charges and run a dorm at the same time. You often had to come in on your day off just to complete an investigation. It did count as overtime but who wants to come in on their day off? Plus, you risked being stuck and forced to help if they felt like making you stay. 

Pay was definitely low. I was just barely breaking $35,000 a year when I left. Overtime will definitely get you over that mark and possibly make more than a captain does but it comes at the expense of giving up your home life. You get the standard health benefits package. New hires don't get retirement benefits anymore which is horrible. I think that started in 2019.

Correctional officers have a ""pretend union"" called SEANC. Long story short, they never did anything for us. You could opt to pay monthly dues for them to do nothing. 

Harnett Correctional was originally a sex offender camp but had started to introduce gang members to it especially after the Pasquotank incident and Bertie Correctional being a total shitshow. Gangs, especially the Bloods, hate sex offenders. Can't blame them on that but it made for a hostile environment considering that the significant sex offender population were part of the general population. 

Inmates in general are what you might expect and are just like anyone you would meet in public. There are bad ones and you have good ones. Luckily, I didn't have many issues with the inmates as I tried to treat them like human beings. As with any prison, though, fights, stabbings, drug use and gangs are constantly adding to the stress. 

Stress from the prison adds up overtime leading to a lot of burnt out officers. And some of those I've seen try to push through the burnout have suffered some type of health issue like a stroke or heart attack and there's even a few who have committed suicide or attempted to. There is little support for correctional officers because we're told to ""grow a pair and get over it"". Some even become alienated from their families due to their behavioral changes from working in the prison. Governor Cooper established a Correctional Officer Appreciation week which is the governor's equivalent of a pizza party. I'm now dealing with severe depression because of the prison and I left NC just to try and get far away from it.

So is the pay and the benefits worth it? No.

My post may get buried or forgotten over time but please understand that correctional officers need better pay, benefits and a support system and the state legislature does not care. Corrections is always put on the backburner for everything. There needs to be a push for these things but I'm just afraid they will never care.",t2_fgb7l,realgloriousleader,0,1648221987.0,0,t1_i22q9ut,i22q9ut,True,The_Bow_Dasher,t3_tnjb5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tnjb5v/why_are_so_many_nc_prison_employees_leaving_their/,why are so many NC prison employees leaving their jobs?,/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tnjb5v/why_are_so_many_nc_prison_employees_leaving_their/i22q9ut/,1,r/NorthCarolina,0,1

"I'll entertain your POV a little bit more, but I do recognize that your position on this matter is probably set in stone for a long while. That's fine, but just make sure you're well equipped to discuss this with people in the future.

It seems that you're falling back to what are considered juvenile and incorrect notions on what it means to be ""pro-life."" Your arguments against the movement are similar to a pro-life person equating pro-choice people as nothing but barbaric and animalistic in nature. A) it totally doesn't actually address the argument; B) It's rude, shallow, and not going to move the conversation above poor, *maybe mediocre? though that is giving the argument style too much credit*, communication skills.

The first argument you've brought up is that because someone chooses a living person to save over an embryo, the embryo is now not a person. This argument is silly for a few reasons. For example, human to human, I would save my children over yours. That doesn't make your children have any less value. It doesn't make them any less human. You're embarking on a mostly emotional argument that is meant to distract from the root of the debate. Another reason why that argument doesn't hold up as much as people would like to think is that the rational answer to save the human over the embryo is due to pain. It's a no-brainer that you would save a young baby over an embryo because of our concept of suffering. We are able to recognize that the embryo wouldn't suffer in a burning fire, but an infant would feel the pain of being burned alive. Again. That doesn't actually address the argument, which is that both are equal in intrinsic value.

The argument around being pro-choice and pro-life *is* about the philosophy of when life begins and when a person is considered to be a person with rights, and what that looks like in practice. It's about consistency, and being able to apply the logic in a consistent fashion. Your follow up on pro-life politicians not in favor of certain social programs doesn't actually address the argument. Of course, the two can be discussed side by side. There should be far more responsibility and accountability for men in the situation of carrying a child in the womb, and the law should reflect that. But even if the law reflected that, you're still probably going to be pro-choice because that's not where your logic is held up. Your premise is body autonomy, regardless of what the law is able to provide when it comes to social programs. So, while I agree with you that there should be more effort towards holding men equally accountable and *certain* social programs, I see it as a moot point you are making because that really isn't the argument when it comes to pro-choice and pro-life debates.

People aren't pro-life because they have this misogynistic, patriarchal, ""women are the WORST, let's make them suffer the MOST"" idea. How self-centered to think the argument it is about you at all. The argument is about the sanctity of life. I implore you to research the matter more. Good day.

"I don't really agree that electoral politics will meaningfully save us, or that the Democratic party is salvageable (or was ever anything worth investing in)... but I would still welcome and support a Sanders style changing of the guard that would make us better off than before. That being said, the Democratic party is exceedingly gifted at fighting class consciousness with virtue signaling, inclusion politics and scapegoating... so I think the youth is plenty angry enough, their anger is just funneled into outlets that ultimately don't challenge the capitalist class.

Similarly, when we discuss the GOP - you have to consider that the 100+ years of gutting I mentioned above was also taking place in rural areas. You have places that have been absolutely ravaged by capitalism... starting with extraction economies (coal mining, forestry, farming) for metropolitan neighbors, moving towards industrial jobs that ultimately got moved out of country for larger profit margins and ultimately ending with the only jobs existing being service industry (Dollar General and Food Lion, etc.). A lot of these people saw their communities go from places where their parents and grandparents had economic dignity to living a shell of what their home used to be... and without the social/economic history education (purposefully so, as mentioned above) a ""strong man"" coming on TV saying they were going to ""make American great again"" was a tantalizing prospect. Especially because he was more than happy to offer scapegoats to fill the void of understanding why conditions are worse now. Take a place like rural West Virginia, where coal miners were organzing under socialist banners and having the biggest armed worker uprising in American history... only for their progeny to think fucking Joe Biden is a communist in earnest.

"Breaking down the belief there’s some invisible barrier between hard and soft drugs is a prerequisite to ending the failed War on Drugs. The entire system is a joke; marijuana is Schedule 1 with no perceived medical benefits whatsoever yet my monthly prescription of Adderall is harder to obtain than weed. There’s functioning addicts of all drugs, people obviously only see the non-functioning ones or those whose co-existing conditions magnify their drug use. At any rate, consenting adults should be allowed to put whatever they want in their bodies so long as they are not interfering with the safety or health of others. 

The Black Market brings guns into many situations that would otherwise not have them. That fact alone shows that non-violent drug offenses are oftentimes for personal use or a responsible member of society making a calculated (doesn’t imply it’s not stupid though) risk in order to better their lives or the lives of their family. 

Oftentimes it’s the existence of the social stigmas that lead people to hide their drug use; this feeds into the “ritualization” of using and multiplies the chance of the drug having a stronghold. Normalize drug use and treat addicts as people with a health issue (most drug use is started as self-medicating). Of course this loses all those sweet payouts and profits from the cartels, major dealers, private prisons, all the companies up charges for providing basic services to private prisons (phone calls, e-cigs, etc).

"The only time you run into an issue is if your tags are still active/valid and you cancel insurance on the vehicle before turning in your tags - then the NC DMV will fine you for not having insurance on the vehicle.  That would be the only ""fee"" for not turning in your tags that I'm aware of.  This is why you need to turn in the tags before you cancel insurance.

If your tags are no longer valid (meaning they're expired or something like that) you can cancel insurance, not turn in the tags, and nothing will happen.  Or if you switch from one type of license plate to another (from a ""regular"" plate to a personalized plate, for example), nothing will happen if you don't turn in the old one.  I've lived in NC for well over 30 years and never turned in a license plate to the NC DMV in my life.  I've never had to pay a fee or fine or anything.

"I understand what your asking and I could have worded it better. I meant there are laws and regulations that have come about that will cripple a farmer to where they can barely even farm correctly anymore to make a profit which basically forces them with 1 choice…to sell up. I will admit it’s not really state guidelines it’s more federal and it’s been this way my whole lifetime. I’d have to create a whole class on different laws and regulations and how now compiled together are damaging the ability for a farmer to even farm. I will say one thing it’s comes out of the farmers pocket to be audited now. We have to do this every single year to even be able to sell our crop which I get they want to check the fruit to make sure it is proper for consumers but out of country imports are not required to to the extent of local farmers. However these are now at the farmers expense and it has gotten more and more expensive. No there is no specific law where they can be like okay we will take this land from a farmer and give it to a developer. However there are many regulations that basically have allowed loopholes for developers to gain land from farmers because it is making it incredibly hard for the farmers to even farm and I think developers are using it to their advantage to get land they want. I will share a story that maybe will help explain some of situations. I had a friend who was approached by DOT saying they needed her land to put in a new road. They were offering her $30,000 for her entire farm lot in the beginning (which is ridiculous for the amount it was and would not cover her input debts for the season. They said if she did not accept the offer now then the next time they would force her leave because they needed the land. She didn’t accept the offer and a few months they deemed her property necessary for her and she was sent a letter to move.

"Just FYI, we don't have BLM land in NC. It is primarily a West Coast thing - BLM was created to manage all the land the US Federal government bought from France during the Louisiana Purchase (and other acquisitions since then), and by that point in time, all the land on the East coast was owned by somebody. It's not like out west where any empty patch of unfenced land in the desert is fair game. (sorry if you know this already, my gf is from AZ and was surprised when I told her this). 

All camping has to be done at a designated campgrounds. Yes, some places allow dispersed camping, but they're still within a specific park and require a permit/reservation. There's a few private campgrounds, but I have no experience with that. 

I recommend:  https://northcarolinastateparks.reserveamerica.com/welcome.do

This is how the NC state parks manage camping reservations.

There's a handful of Federal campgrounds in NC as well (national forest and national seashore), and they do reservations as well: https://www.recreation.gov/

Cape Hatteras and Ocracoke come to mind for National Seashore camping. 

I believe you can ""camp"" overnight on any beach on the Atlantic, but the catch is you can't pitch a tent, so you'd have to sleep in your car or on the ground with no tent. I don't believe fires are allowed either, but I've never done beach camping, so I could be wrong. 

Unfortunately, since corona, a lot more people are trying to go camping and hiking where they otherwise would have stayed home and sat around, and so parks and campgrounds are packed, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. I would not leave it to chance that you can just show up at a park and have available campsites. 

I recommend booking a weekday night for camping as it'll be easier to get the reservation.",t2_7gqauhk4,ThisAmericanSatire,0,1648214278.0,0,t1_i227ztw,i227ztw,True,Kaegan117,t3_tnekxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tnekxk/is_there_anywhere_to_just_pitch_a_tent_on_the/,Is there anywhere to just pitch a tent on the beach with no reservation and no ferry?,/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tnekxk/is_there_anywhere_to_just_pitch_a_tent_on_the/i227ztw/,1,r/NorthCarolina,0,1

"Part of the problem is that we don't respect law enforcement of any kind, especially now. We also have a skewed sense of the work that police and sheriffs actually do on a daily basis and how much TRAINING they have to go through to be able to wear a badge (often unpaid too). Additionally, prisoners act out more with the rising trend of videos showing officers as asshats (not disputing this, sometimes they are). What we rarely see are videos of the officers when they are doing amazing things for their communities and, in the prison setting, helping people get the services they need to never come back to prison. This lack of respect leads to a lack of pay since, well, Fuck the Police. Resulting in a lack of esteem and lowered quality of a job well done - imagine telling someone you are an officer and that person immediately starts reading you the riot act about (insert whatever atrocity that's occurred with a police officer or about guns or about their shitty neighbors that the police won't do anything about). Communities want to be safe and keep people who commit horrible crimes off the street but aren't willing to do it themselves (joining Neighborhood Watch, sitting on a jury, or volunteering in needed areas) or admit that their lack of respect for officers results in failed tax measures for salary increases, additional officers, or even tools to do their jobs. This lack of funding is going to result in more officers leaving which will have an effect of letting prisoners out early due to overcrowding.
