"I grew up in highland and have been staying with relatives here for the last ~2 years (I'm in my late 20s). Excellent place to grow up - I've got lots of great memories playing with all the kids up and down my parents' block. These days I'm really appreciating the great access to nature - Crosby is a frequent weekend hike for me and the hidden falls loop trail is great for a quick after-work lap (not to mention the glorious Winchell trail just across the Ford bridge in Minneapolis). All less than 10 minutes by car and easily accessible by bike when the roads are clear.

Still, as a late-20-something it wouldn't be my first choice of neighborhood. With a few exceptions, most of the food options are either fast-casual chains or fairly pricey. The Lunds & Byerly's is just expensive enough to push me to midway Cub for most grocery runs. Bar scene is pretty limited. All my local friends around my age live in Cathedral Hill, Midway, or Minneapolis, and I'd probably be looking in one of those places if not for the generosity of the family members I'm staying with. 

So I'd say it depends on your life situation. If you're a parent (or plan to be) and can afford a house here, it would be a sweet place for your family. If not, there are plenty of places in either city that will have a little more going on and probably save you some money, too.",t2_4vi21fc4,bikeisaac,0,1648259410.0,0,t1_i256rr6,i256rr6,True,Code_E-420,t3_tnvayc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tnvayc/what_does_everyone_think_of_the_highland_park/,What does everyone think of the Highland Park area in St Paul?

"I completely agree with that last paragraph. Riders act with impunity on the train and at platforms. 

On Sunday, a frail senior on the Green Line  was attacked by a raving lunatic who wanted to unleash his latent hostilities on an easy target. He had moved seats to evade the verbal tirade, but was reapproached and smashed in the face without any interaction. He dusted himself off and stepped to an exit, but as the door was about to open, he was kicked in the head and fell to the floor, and lost the chance to disembark. He suffered multiple kicks until he was able to crawl out the door at the next stop. 

He suffered multiple lacerations, a broken cheek bone and a concussion. 

What’s ironic is that he had intended to disembark at the West Bank station and catch a bus rather than to disembark at the Lake Street station and walk just steps to his home—because he wished to avoid the enclosed platform areas there that are known to be unpleasant and unsafe, always filled with troublemakers and never a transit officer in sight.",t2_3c7fw1gc,Voc1Vic2,0,1648255968.0,0,t1_i24zm9n,i24zm9n,False,runtheroad,t3_tnxhpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tnxhpj/metro_transit_confirms_they_are_searching_for_a/,Metro Transit confirms they are searching for a suspect who shot someone on an eastbound Green Line light rail train shortly before 2pm this afternoon.,/r/TwinCities/comments/tnxhpj/metro_transit_confirms_they_are_searching_for_a/i24zm9n/,22,r/TwinCities,0,22

"> Are you sure the contract actually contains these?

Yep. I actually read the whole thing shortly after Floyd was killed. It took a little over an hour. It's not light reading, but it isn't a hard slog either. More importantly, I've read analyses of comparisons between the MPD contract and those of other cities with fewer disciplinary issues. Most rules aren't even in the contract, but rather in the employee manual. The contract is more about processes and procedures, and general rights.

The whole precedent issue is overblown as well. While it's true that stealing a doughnut off of the chief's desk resulting in a five-day suspension will be overturned because a precedent had long ago been set by regularly suspending officers for one day, that precedent can be overcome by handing everyone a simple memo as follows: ""It's obviously clear that a one-day suspension isn't enough to keep you bastards from stealing doughnuts. Henceforth, any doughnut-stealing bastard will be slammed with the full five-day suspension.""

This issue isn't any different than that faced by many large companies that don't even have union contracts, which can face wrongful termination claims even though the greater punishment is outlined in the employee handbook.

FYI, if it's been announced that an officer has been immediately fired, that's a *bad* thing, not a good thing. *ALL* firings require due process and they *will* get their job back after waiting 59 days to appeal while taking a nice vacation.  Then they'll get all that backpay. After that, they'll continue to get paid while the firing clock *actually* starts. The contract does allow for immediate suspension without pay in very limited circumstances, but mostly requires suspension with pay during the firing process.

The words we want to hear are ""the offending officers were immediately suspended and the firing process has been initiated.""",t2_zy07b,Iz-kan-reddit,0,1648234054.0,0,t1_i23l8f9,i23l8f9,False,BevansDesign,t3_tn7bme,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tn7bme/minneapolis_city_council_approves_police_union/,Minneapolis City Council approves police union contract in divided vote,/r/TwinCities/comments/tn7bme/minneapolis_city_council_approves_police_union/i23l8f9/,1,r/TwinCities,0,1

"Article without the paywall, and with edited links to unpaywalled articles:

Minneapolis Public Schools and its teachers and support staff have reached tentative contract agreements that could end the strike that has shuttered schools for weeks.

The school district and the union both announced the news early Friday and the district said students would return to class Monday, pending discussions with the union.
										 

Minneapolis Superintendent Ed Graff called the tentative deal ""fair and equitable"" in a written statement Friday morning. He praised teachers and educational support professionals for their commitment to the district.

""I'm extremely grateful for their work, determination and dedication,"" Graff said. ""I am equally grateful to families and community organizations who supported their students through enormous difficulties during this time out of school.""

A news release from the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers said the union will hold a ratification vote this weekend on the tentative agreement. Union leaders will have a news conference at 1 p.m. Friday.

""Details will be coming out shortly, but it is important to note that major gains were made on pay for Education Support Professionals, protections for educators of color, class size caps and mental health supports,"" the union said in its news release.

At a news conference Friday morning, Graff said the tentative agreements came together between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m. He said district would be meeting with the union midmorning Friday to discuss plans for returning to school, as well as plans for how to make up days of class students missed during the strike.

School Board Chair Kim Ellison thanked students and the community for their ""persistence, patience, ideas and advocacy"" and thanked both negotiating teams and the school board.

""The last few weeks have affirmed what many of you already knew — Minneapolis is a place of passion and compassion, a place where people will do anything for our children,"" she said.

Gov. Tim Walz, a former teacher, welcomed the news of a deal on Twitter Friday morning and praised the state Bureau of Mediation Services for working with the district and union.

""Now, the legislature must pass my budget that includes $2.5 billion for our public schools,"" Walz said.

About 50 educators picketed across the street from Roosevelt High School Friday morning. Some expressed cautious optimism about the tentative deal.

""Hope is in the air,"" said Roosevelt High School digital art teacher Holly Thorstad, who carried an ""invest in educators"" sign shaped like an apple.

Roosevelt music teacher Nick Wilson added that teachers still need to see and vote on the new contract.

The strike began March 8, after months of stalled contract negotiations between the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers and Minneapolis Public Schools district officials.

The district's 28,700 students have not had classes since then and many [families have scrambled](https://www.startribune.com./minneapolis-and-st-paul-parents-brace-for-more-turmoil-a-teachers-strike/600152167/) to find daycare and other activities for children — just the [latest twist](https://www.startribune.com./with-teachers-strike-minneapolis-families-navigate-another-twist-in-uncertain-school-year/600155478/) in an uncertain school year.

During negotiations, the union sought [higher wages](https://www.startribune.com./minneapolis-teachers-union-pushes-support-staff-raises-district-questions-how-much-it-can-afford/600154521/) for teachers and education support professionals, [class-size caps](https://www.startribune.com./why-class-sizes-have-been-a-sticking-point-in-minneapolis-st-paul-teacher-contract-negotiations/600157820/), and additional [mental health supports](https://www.startribune.com./student-mental-health-support-is-sticking-point-in-minneapolis-st-paul-teacher-negotiations/600153602/) for students, among other things.

But the district, which is projecting a [$21.5 million budget shortfall](https://www.startribune.com./minneapolis-public-schools-predicts-enrollment-decline-budget-shortfall/600149534/?refresh=true) in fiscal year 2022-2023, said it could not afford everything the teachers sought.

The two parties exchanged multiple proposals during the strike. The discussions sometimes [grew tense](https://www.startribune.com./minneapolis-teachers-strike-standoff-intensifies-as-talks-stall/600158824/) and a school board member resigned [citing broken trust](https://www.startribune.com./minneapolis-school-board-members-under-intense-pressure-board-member-resigns-citing-broken-trust/600156678/).

The union organized pickets outside schools each weekday morning, and also held rallies around Minneapolis and at the state Capitol. Groups of students also [held sit-ins ](https://www.startribune.com/students-hold-sit-in-at-district-office-on-day-8-of-minneapolis-teachers-strike/600156934/)to support the educators.

The strike is the Minneapolis district's first since 1970.

A teachers strike was also planned in St. Paul this spring, but it was averted when the district and the St. Paul Federation of Educators came to [a last-minute deal](https://www.startribune.com./in-st-paul-deal-that-keeps-teachers-on-the-job-brings-relief-for-schools-families/600154190/).

"Minneapolis teachers, district reach deal to end strike

Minneapolis Public Schools posted on its website early Friday that a tentative agreement has been made with union teachers and education specialists.
Author: Alexandra Simon, Dana Thiede, KARE 11 Staff

MINNEAPOLIS — Minneapolis Public Schools and the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers have reached a tentative deal after a strike that kept students out of the classroom for 14 days.
The agreement was announced early Friday on the Minneapolis Public Schools website. No details were released, but MPS said the district is looking forward to ""welcoming students and staff back to school on Monday, March 28."" A vote by the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers (MFT) is needed to ratify the new deal. 

The work stoppage began on Tuesday, March 8 following months of contract negotiations between the teachers and school district failed to come up with a solution.
Throughout the duration of the strike, the union negotiated for things like enforceable contract language surrounding class size, mental health support, living wages for hourly educational Support Professionals, or ESPs, and competitive pay for licensed staff.
Before reaching a deal Friday, some of the lingering sticking points were seniority protections for ESPs and teacher pay scale.
The big question that remains is how makeup days will be handled. Students have missed 14 educational days, the majority of which will have to be made up. 
KARE 11 will have reaction to the tentative agreement from both the district and educators later Friday. 
This is a developing story. KARE 11 will provide more details as new information becomes available.",t2_a4nbx,Tmadred,0,1648215385.0,0,t1_i22adhi,i22adhi,False,RyanWilliamsElection,t3_tnjtdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tnjtdr/minneapolis_teachers_district_reach_deal_to_end/,"Minneapolis teachers, district reach deal to end strike",/r/TwinCities/comments/tnjtdr/minneapolis_teachers_district_reach_deal_to_end/i22adhi/,8,r/TwinCities,0,8

I've been watching housing (mostly on the low end) on the southside myself.  There were a lot of houses in more than questionable condition that were purchased far above asking and then put back on market within the last couple years (Zillow).  This is stuff like a property being on the market and being purchased for 17% above asking price in 2020 and being relisted at +35% and relisted at +43% and then dropping down to +37% and sold at -6%.

The irony here is hilarious. How much should the average teacher make in your opinion? And what should the average teacher do? Should they coach a sport? Have a masters? Have 10 years experience? 20 years?

It makes way more sense to ask yourself “how much should an entry level teacher make?” or “how much should the most experienced teachers make after 20 years”

"Yes, I am aware of everything you just stated. I formerly worked for the union. My MIL works in the MPS district office. I used to be a teacher.

You are mostly correct re: district organizing. There are select district staff who are on the teacher pay schedule because they do not qualify as ""administrators"" under the Admin CBA even though they work in the Davis Center. These tend to be employees with a valid teaching license who are not working in the classroom. Many of them have masters or PhDs and make ample income, thus raising the ""average"" teacher salary in OP's image. For example, my MIL works for the district and has a PhD. She is also on the teacher pay schedule and, therefore, currently on strike. She makes around $90k/year, I believe. That obviously pulls up the ""average"" teacher income on the payscale.

**Editing to add language from the MFT contract. The contract covers ""teachers,"" which is defined as the following (and includes several jobs that laypeople would not consider to be traditionally ""teachers""):** 

*1.4.2 Teacher: The term ""Teacher"" used in this Agreement shall mean all professional employees of Special School District #1 as defined by MN Statute §179A.03, Subd. 18, which states: ""‘Teacher’ means any public employee other than a superintendent or assistant superintendent, principal, assistant principal, or a supervisory or confidential employee, employed by a school district: (1) in a position for which the person must be licensed by the Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board (PELSB) or the commissioner of education; or (2) in a position as a physical therapist, occupational therapist, art therapist, music therapist, or audiologist”. All teachers on leave of absence shall be included.* 

Therefore, the contract covers anyone with a job that (1) requires licensing by PELSB and (2) is NOT a principal/supervisory role. This includes some coordinator positions, curriculum staff, consulting positions, design positions, data positions, etc. There are tons of possibilities.",t2_5y6b9u99,manicpixiehorsegirl,0,1648142932.0,0,t1_i1yf4c1,i1yf4c1,False,futilehabit,t3_tku2q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tku2q6/the_average_minneapolis_teacher_makes_80_what_a/,The average Minneapolis teacher makes 80% what a St. Paul teacher makes per day of instruction!,/r/TwinCities/comments/tku2q6/the_average_minneapolis_teacher_makes_80_what_a/i1yf4c1/,1,r/TwinCities,0,1

"This kind of makes sense. The pricing out in the suburbs and excurbs was already a lot lower than it is in the city. That's probably the main reason why those areas even exist in the first place. Property values in the city are simply much higher, in general, so that means that there's a lot less room for them to increase before prices become too high for buyers.

I'm sure after you've re-read and posted you've noticed the discrepancies with  what you originally stated and the data you're providing.  (You listing YOY vs the 5 yr avg StarTrib used, cost per sq ft vs total home value, etc.)

With the cost per sq ft and the sample size being as low as 80 units on a number of these exurbs for the Star Trib (Hi Minnetrista), a single business and a handful of contractors moving in can inflate that number significantly, which would be independent from velocity and potentially total home valuation.

I'm still finishing up a deep dive that I'll edit into the original post that asked for data, but the material shifts align almost perfectly with Covid and remote work increase vs any other noticeable external factors. Especially when you consider the entire state's lack of growth vs the country. It also appears Minneapolis doesn't lack behind suburbs in value growth, but very much vice versa.

When we break out YoY growth valuations in a per neighborhood basis in Minneapolis (via redfin) its made immediately clear that they're just averaging all neighborhood's YoY together. This matters because East Calhoun (BMS) saw a YoY rate of -45%, along with West Calhoun's -5% slide. No other neighborhood in Minneapolis saw these declines (only Nokomis was also in the red @ -.093 YoY) which are the obvious products of a few pieces of hyper expensive inventory (>2mm) selling below value - deflating YoY for the entire city according to Redfin since it calcs in aggregate.

When we remove those two outliers the avg Minneapolis YoY valuation is at 8.3% vs the .7%. So essentially a handful of discounted mansions fuck up the entire data pool.  Regardless - since we have such extreme swings in a few very specific areas we should be going with median as opposed to avg. Median YoY growth in all Minneapolis neighborhoods is 7.4% (this includes the aforementioned upper crust Bde neighborhoods. Also note that Powderhorn was at exactly 7.4%.) 

When we look at the city's /u/4d39faaf-80c4-43b5 provided we're at a median of 8.6% YoY. St. Anthony is doing a lot of heavy lifting with this number, and since it exists between Mpls and St Paul (utilizing a number of both city's muni services) one would be hard pressed to earnestly call it a suburb in the context of this conversation. No one can say with a straight face anyone living there is trying to avoid Mpls/StP - its very much the opposite. That's further exacerbated by its incredibly tiny inventory size. So removing that curious outlier we're now at 7.35% YoY growth - *less* than Minneapolis.

Going a step further, Minnetrista is another interesting outlier in that it is incredibly tiny and barely moves 5-8 units a month, clearing under 100 in '21. (Its also hyper inflated with multimillion dollar mansions.) Removing this outlier brings the suburb YoY valuation growth median down to 6.1%. I understand that I'm flirting w/ p-hacked territory, but if I was presenting this info to a stakeholder I would absolutely remove it for a more accurate figure as its approximately 80 homes out of tens of thousands that drastically alters the results. (.001% of the data is resulting in a 10000% swing.)

Eric Moore is qualified on paper, but he also is behind the CCD (largely considered a failure), his research output is pretty crappy (coming from another researcher), and he often deflects criticism he should own. A common thing for him to say was that site councils are where change should be happening, yet he knows that site council has literally zero power. They are simply advisory to a principal, who chooses the site council, sets the schedule, and can choose to ignore everything the site council says. Moore knows this, so why does he deflect responsibility from MPS onto school site councils? Makes no sense.

"You’ve summed it up well. A quick Google search can turn up a number of recent articles and statistics about the problems we’re facing with recruitment and retention. For example:

Yes, increased wages for new teachers would help the problem, but it’s more complicated than that. Without teachers who have taught ten to fifteen years, there are fewer mentors and supports for new teachers struggling to find their footing. The teachers a year or two from retirement aren’t often the ones volunteering for those roles. Also, teachers contribute a lot of their own money for food and supplies for their students. The tax write off doesn’t even begin ti cover expenses. Also, premiums for insurance are increasing and outpacing the proposed pay increases so accepting the districts contract would likely result in earning LESS money next year than this year. There aren’t many solutions here that won’t require substantial taxpayer investment in fixing the system. The pandemic has laid bare the fact that public education is on life support, and if we value it as a vital institution of a thriving democracy, then we need to do a whole lot more to address this problem than put a band-aid on it.",t2_2vjyrr8j,Ope_Just_Sneak_By_Ya,0,1648092553.0,0,t1_i1vys5n,i1vys5n,False,PeterNjos,t3_tlrbtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tlrbtz/average_and_median_mpls_teacher_salary/,Average and Median MPLS Teacher salary?,/r/TwinCities/comments/tlrbtz/average_and_median_mpls_teacher_salary/i1vys5n/,4,r/TwinCities,0,4

From what you said then the average teacher age/experience at a school kept going up until they did start retiring...but because they filled those spots there were no mid-experienced teachers and they had to start hiring in new folks. 

Really interesting, thanks for sharing. I'll argue two sides on how to solve this.

1.) Increase entry level pay. This would cost more, but make it more bearable for the new teachers in their hardest years. Negative would also be would not be able to use ""new teachers only make XXX"" when advocating for increased wages. I know I might get some shade for saying that, but that's politics.

"Minneapolis teacher here. I agree that the median would show a better picture. I don’t have that information for you, but honestly what upsets me more is the difference in days worked. Our contract has us working 2-3 weeks more than some of these other districts for less.

Though I don’t have more useful data, I’m very aware of what teachers in Minneapolis make versus those in Saint Paul based on our contracts. This doesn’t give the whole picture, but Minneapolis teachers make more in earlier years, but it eventually levels out with Saint Paul passing Minneapolis. And then pay levels out at around $10K more per year for Saint Paul teachers. Based on these averages, it’s likely that many teachers in each district have been around for a long time. A Minneapolis teacher with a Master’s basically caps out in the 70s. They reach 70 by year 10 and 75 by year 20, while Saint Paul gets into the 80s. This can be lower if it’s just a BA and higher with additional Master’s credits or a doctorate. I’m in my third year of teaching, but many of my veteran colleagues in the district are upset that the district hasn’t prioritized giving them incentive to stay (and as a newer teacher, I can tell you just how important it is to have veteran teachers around). Why wouldn’t someone jump ship if they could make 10,000+ more a year? The district isn’t giving them any reason not to.

Salary tracks are way, way more aggressive than teachers, it's not even close.

Anecdotally, I’ve heard many SPPS district officials used to teach (therefore have a valid license and are included in the statistic) and have been on the administrative side for a very long time, resulting in salaries in the mid to high $100ks.

In addition, I’ve heard (but can’t confirm with data) that more SPPS teachers have masters degrees than MPS. 

On the other side, MPS has fewer district staff with teaching licenses to “pump up” the average salaries like other districts do.

"I was surprised to find out after Googling that there are over 2,300 (2375 according to my 2 second Google search) teachers for Minneapolis Public Schools. I really want to know more about some things behind the data, such as:

* How are we defining ""teacher""? 
* What differences, if any, exist in tenure between districts? 
* What differences, if any, exist in retention bonuses or perks offered to teachers between districts?

The reason I'm wondering these things is that there might be a reason why the average salary is lower for Minneapolis teachers. Hypothetically, if the average age or tenure of a teacher in Minneapolis is 20% lower than in St. Paul or other districts, that could account for the difference in average pay. So maybe there's a higher turnover issue in the Minneapolis district which needs to be addressed - or at the very least considered when making these comparisons.

And usually when people say its the one of many steps to fixing a problem they usually stop carrying once they get what they want. Which is what they do every year. It's why our salaries as so much higher than anywhere else. It didn't fix the problem. When they could have been saving the money to fix it they choose not to and that's the issue.

Did you not go to public school or something? There are absolutely good teachers and they can make all the difference in the lives of their students.

"I worked there (within M&R, so UHC technically) for a year and a half in 2013-2014. It's a behemoth of a company, and making anything insightful happen requires ridiculous amounts of red-tape and oversight. I also sensed a toxic disconnect between executive leadership and individual contributors; nothing mentioned in town hall meetings was even remotely applicable or interesting to the bottom 99% of the company. We often joked about the CEO sitting in a throne on the top floor of HQ, being fanned with giant leaves and fed a bundle of grapes into his mouth. He was just legitimately not present, and when he was, he was so economically/professionally/mentally removed from everyone else and couldn't dumb down his corporate jargon for us peasants at the bottom.

Worst of all, the working conditions for entry-level employees were laughable. Several teams, including mine, worked out of conference rooms and didn't have desks despite the plentiful unused cubicles across multiple floors in the 9700/9800 buildings. The entry-level pay wasn't great either. And just knowing that you're feeding the massive, greedy corporate troll that avoids a symbiotic relationship with its customers and never pays claims fairly stings a lot.

Needless to say, my direct manager was awesome, and I remain in touch with him to this day. The colleagues were nice enough - maybe a little more ""bro-ish"" than I'd have preferred but overall everyone had a good head on their shoulders. The benefits were acceptable enough, as a healthy 22-year-old at the time.

"Ah, yeah, wasn't thinking of the summers off.  I get paying teachers more even though they don't work ""full time.""  They have lesson plans to do and a lot of prep to do between class years.  

These ESPs though as far as I know just have the summer off with out any expected off the clock duties like a teacher would have.  

So if they only work at school for 40 weeks a year, at $18/hour they will have $28,800/year.  In July of 2022 the minimum wage in Minneapolis will be $15/hour, so if they add 12 weeks of minimum wage work in the middle that is another $7200/year, coming out to $36,000 year.  Again, the school district is meeting their demands in my mind.

Since they are saying the school district isn't meeting their demands, then they must be asking for $22/hour?  $22x40 weeksx40 hours = $35,200.  

That begs the question though, is the school day even 8 hours for these ESPs?  From what I remember, the school day is something like 6 hours.  

If so, are they demanding $29.25/hour?  ($29.25/hour x 40 weeks x 30 hours = $35,100).

In response to question 2: COVID money can actually be spent on a lot of things, not just hand sanitizer and masks.  Supplies, food, utilities, postage, repairs/maintenance.  And while I disagree with district on many, many things and think that they have terribly mismanaged their budget for a long time which has brought us to this breaking point... they're right that it would be a really bad idea to think of COVID money as a pot they can dip into for wage increases.  That money is a one time thing, and this contract is ongoing.  When that money runs out, the district will still have an obligation to pay employees at that higher rate.

Going to be an armchair administrator here: MPS desperately needs an increase to the per-pupil funding formula so that they could have an ongoing source of revenue for increased wages.  They also need to close under-enrolled schools (although that could backfire because it is going to piss. people. off.  Closing North High - with its enrollment of about 450 students - would be a massively unpopular decision, even though it makes a lot of financial sense).  Unpopular decisions = declining enrollment = declining revenue.",t2_ot7ef,catscatsnekocatscats,0,1647968220.0,0,t1_i1okjxw,i1okjxw,False,BevansDesign,t3_tk4isx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tk4isx/union_balks_at_minneapolis_school_districts_final/,Union balks at Minneapolis school district's 'final' offer for education support professionals,/r/TwinCities/comments/tk4isx/union_balks_at_minneapolis_school_districts_final/i1okjxw/,46,r/TwinCities,0,46

"I have a LOT of questions/comments, but my biggest two are this:

1. In the last 3 years districts have been UNDER budget by about $10 million, why does this ""providing $10 Million to ESP's"" is some huge undertaking? If I take into account this information, you've just made your budget that has ran in the black now even. How are you compromising anything here?
2. You received HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars in Federal aid for COVID, ON TOP of regular budget. How has that funding not helped ease this issue? How can we account for $240 million in masks and hand sanitizer?

I am genuinely concerned that focus has been by administration. Hands down, the greatest resource for our students are the adults making classrooms work. How can this not be your greatest concern? But in a Nation where the highest paid state employees are Football and Basketball coaches this isn't so surprising, I suppose. \*sad sigh

Here's some recent information compiled by KARE11:

>American Rescue Plan Spending  
Minneapolis Public Schools got $261 million dollars overall, but the biggest chunk of $159.4 million came last March from the American Rescue Plan (ARP).  
Among the biggest expenditures so far:  
Nearly $75 million just to fill this year’s budget gap.  
$14 million on Air Filtration Systems and HEPA filter maintenance to guard against COVID  
Millions to summer school and related programming  
And $4.2 million for improving literacy

\- the budget gap is listed as $21.5 million by Star Tribune. So we need TRIPLE the funds to cover that shortfall? Where's the other $54 million?

\-Meanwhile the MFT, the teacher's union, isn't saying the schools need a crapton of more money. They're saying administration's priorities on spending are way out of touch.
