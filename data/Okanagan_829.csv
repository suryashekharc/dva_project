"i am older then you and would visit relatives in Summerland every summer as a child. My cousin and I would walk over to Main street and go into the five to a dollar store.

Did you know that for many years there was a set of stairs that took you downstairs and the entire floor below was a toy dept? It was awesome. The store was always very very popular place to shop for not just Summerland locals, but people from Penticton, Oliver and to some extent, Kelowna. Especially when Crazy Day Sale began in 1970.

\- Ask someone who is a Summerland local that is in the 50-80s age range and i'm sure they will tell you that Five to a Dollar and maybe even downtown Summerland was more interesting place , especially in the summer months. I think that when Walmart , Home Depot and other big brand chain stores opened up in Penticton, people started ignoring the local Summerland stores/shops/services/eateries and just said Fuck It, Better shopping in Penticton! Even the last 20 years Summerland lost the bowling alley and there was a Field's dept. store in that same shopping complex where the bowling alley was ( where the royal bank, iga, dollar store and former McDonalds was. )",t2_8b5q0xu2,eatmyass_reddit,0,1646064941.0,0,t1_hysjp52,hysjp52,True,sayitinsixteen,t3_suep3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/suep3y/summerland_five_to_a_dollar_commercial/,Summerland Five to a Dollar commercial,/r/okanagan/comments/suep3y/summerland_five_to_a_dollar_commercial/hysjp52/,1,r/okanagan,0,1

"Check out wineries (some close or adjust hours or require booked tastings, so best to search in advance)   
Lake country wineries- Arrowleaf, 50th Parallel, Gray Monk  
Kelowna Wineries- Ancient Hills if its open(very close to UBCO behind the airport), Vibrant Vines, Priest Creek, St. Hubertus. And if its open- Nagging Doubt has some excellent red wines. Its a small, out of a barn operation, so doesn't quite compare with the views and setting of the bigger wineries, but I recommend their wines.   
West Kelowna, or even further into Summerland, Naramata or Okanagan Falls all have many good wineries.   


Hiking:  
UBCO Flume trail (access from by the UBCO daycare) Nice views of the Glenmore valley from here, good chance to see birds of prey.   
Mill Creek Park- Beautiful cedar forest along a creek to waterfalls. Its not hard, unless you go beyond the first waterfall, then it gets more rugged. Access is behind the airport off Old vernon Rd.   
Spion Kop- Multiple access points in Lake country, and network of trails, so you can choose your length and intensity.  


Rent bikes for the KVR trestles or bike along the Rail Trail in Oyama along Kalamalka lake. 

 Good places to eat close by to UBCO- Kelowna Brewing Company, Upside Cidery (features wood fire pizza and good vegan options), Kaya Sushi.

"How old are the kids? Kettle Valley rail trestles is good if you have bikes. Uncertain if local bike rentals will be up at the parking lot in the off season?

Kids in mind still, the Kangaroo farm. As an adult I enjoy going here. Hanging out with inbred albino wallabiesbeing chased by pocupines is a good time.

If you're active, Bear Creek is a short, but intense hike with great views. Only takes an hour or so and the drive is pretty. 

Others covered the brewery and wineries and that's easy stuff to find around any corner. If you are into wine, I'd recommend the drive out to Penticton or at least West Kelowna for their wineries. If you have kids in tow, hit up The Vibrant Vine. It's gimmick is their wine labels and their art in their tasting room is all 3D. It's done well. It also keeps the kids entertained whilst you taste. 

Go to Bohemia for breakfast and take the kids to Skinny Duke's for a time travelling trip to the late 70s. 

It's shoulder season. Your best bets will be hikes, walks and sightseeing through the local provincial parks and such. I'm trying to rack my brain for good, local insider tips for tourism fun, but this time of year is tricky.

Very welcome ! Hope it works out for you. And yeah unfortunately lots of things are who you know around here. As some positions don't even get posted but just go by word of mouth. Once in awhile you'll be in the right place at the right time but that's like picking winning lottery tickets.  Only item I can say is don't apply for something that you have zero experience in if they haven't said they would train you. Seems that happened a lot for us in the engineering consulting firms. Ie. Chemical/civil engineers looking for work at as a mechanical building systems engineer. Wants the same 10 yr experience pay yet they had no idea of our building code or how things go together in our world.

"Welcome to the Okanagan! 

I am originally from the Okanagan, and wanted to move back to be closer to my ageing parents. 

I have two degrees. One in economics, and another in agriculture. I have a solid background with experience working in the finance department of one of Montreal’s biggest commercial real estate companies. When I left the company I was the #2 in their internal auditing department, responsible for overseeing over 300 buildings throughout Ontario and Quebec.

In my gap years, I spent my time teaching the second grade in a private school. 

I have excellent references. 

After two months of searching, the best I could find was a ‘management trainee position’ at Enterprise that started at $18 an hour. (I mean that is not actually true, I contemplated just taking up house painting again, which I did in college, because there is a lot of money in that and there are a bunch of contractors looking to hire apprentices, especially apprentices with some work experience. I also thought about just going back to waitressing because that pays better than a lot of the “professional” positions in Kelowna.) 

Guess what, I am living in Prince George. I’m in property management again. I make way more than I would in the Okanagan, much less than I did in Montreal, but the cost of living is way lower than either place. 

The boomers created an economy that revolves around making money on real estate speculation at this point. 

Unless you bring your own job or are willing to spend six months looking for work, (that is how long it took my brother to find something and he’s from Kelowna), prepare to make way less than a similar position in any major city but know that it is going to be just as expensive to live in Kelowna as a major city. 

And even though the Okanagan is technically ‘home’ it feels less and less like it every year. Most of my friends are gone and many like me, would like to return but cannot afford to. 

It’s kind of become a playground for the rich. And rich people have their financial services, accountants, lawyers etc… in places like Vancouver or Toronto which they can jet off to whenever. All they are looking for in Kelowna is to be served. 

They want someone to make their coffee, they want good restaurants, delivery, wine tours, jet ski rentals and a decent salon. They want an idyllic après ski at Big White. They want someone to do the grocery shopping for them. I’m sure there are mountains of service jobs with crappy wages.",t2_7de9d8w2,Far_Scientist_5082,0,1634290885.0,0,t1_hgpxlgp,hgpxlgp,True,[deleted],t3_q8eiby,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/q8eiby/new_to_kelowna_looking_for_a_job/,"New to Kelowna, looking for a Job",/r/okanagan/comments/q8eiby/new_to_kelowna_looking_for_a_job/hgpxlgp/,6,r/okanagan,0,6

" Reputable farmers pay by the weight/bucket so it all depends on how motivated/fast you are. This year they were paying around 10$ per bucket  good pickers can pick 60+ a day and most farmers do not pay cash.
You start eaaaarly (4am) so that you can get it a full day of picking before it gets too hot at noon .
Once the cherries are ripe and picking starts you usually don't get any time off for at least a week /10 days. Accommodations are very basic - again it will vary from farm to farm but usually a small pickers cabin with kitchen/bathroom etc and then tents in the orchards.

"I did a summer season of cherry picking up in Lake Country. 

* The pay was bad (probably averaged less than minimum wage, every single farmer will try and rip you off, junkies will get up early and steal all the easy low hanging fruit off your trees leaving you only the slow, unproductive bullshit, and yes you'll still have to pay taxes). 
* The living conditions were bad (cold ""shower"" from a hose, portable toilets only emptied when the shit mountain comes up to the seat, no toilet paper, set your tent up in between a row for shade and get sprayed with pesticides every day)
* It's expensive buying ingredients every day or two since you can't stock up and make batches really (different if you have an RV maybe)
* It's a tiring, boring, dangerous job

The farmers were proud of their flock of Jamaican ~~slaves~~ ""helpers"" on TFW's, we were the only people from BC we met along the way, everyone else was ""Quebexicans"" as the farmers call them. It's no wonder the farmers can't get any locals to do the job, they get absolutely no sympathy from me.

It was something different/a little bit fun but there's no way I would do that bullshit for $10/h in this labor market.

"This hit home for me. I lost my mum 10 years ago to ovarian cancer and she also refused a funeral or anything that would put her family through more sadness. We actually had a celebration of life with a keg in our drive way and shut down our street for the block to party. We had a tree put up in the park of my hometown (Saskatoon) in her honour, but recently it got taken down so they could put up some commercial property… it is extremely difficult not having a place to visit. I’m going to go visit your mum for the both of us ❤️

"I can't say specifically where near kelowna has cheaper rent, because I'm in the southern Okanagan, but I will say you need to consider all angles and expenses. Sometimes it's actually cheaper and more realistic to pay a bit more in rent and be closer to your work. Gas money is the obvious one, but your insurance rates will also go up if your work is over 15km away from your home, and the extra milage on your vehicle will end up costing more in maintaining and eventually needing to replace your car sooner. Also worth considering is how much you value your time. If you need to commute even just half an hour to work, that's 3/4 of a work week per month spent just driving.

"You did not mention if you have canoeing experience. Hopefully you know at least the basics.

Its a very big lake and more susceptible to big waves and bad weather than smaller lakes and rivers. I have been twice and one time there was a crazy storm and the lake have large waves as we had to paddle out.

you can right click and measure on google maps and get an idea of the distances then research and based on some rules of thumb for how fast you can paddle you can figure out the time, then add time because things always take longer. A lot will depend on the wind direction and you would ideally want to take a route where you can be sheltered from the wind if the wind is bad since paddling against the wind all day would be awful.

1. wheels for the portage, or backpacks etc and a plan to carry all of that and the boats.
2. dry bags for everything that cannot get wet.
3. float bag for the canoe if the boat does not have built in foam/air pockets (so your boat does not sink with all of your gear).
4. same as other backcountry make sure you know what the bear cache situation is (it was bear caches up in the trees when I was there years ago).
5. not dog friendly according to BC parks which is a shame.
6. have your required boating gear. The parks service was checking when I was there years ago. 

not to overstate this and make it sound more scary than it is but there are no motor boats on the lake (besides the parks service), there will be at times no other boaters in sight. Its a large lake, it can be cold in the summer. If you tip/swim and you are unprepared you might die. So if you are not experienced I would suggest to rent a canoe ahead of time and practice. it wont do to have your canoe full of gear sink if you have some stability issues. I have seen people go right in as soon as they step in the boat. Know how to do a canoe over canoe rescue, stay near the shoreline.",t2_1s908u2,introvertedhedgehog,0,1626196287.0,0,t1_h5227mn,h5227mn,True,alanis864,t3_ojit2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/ojit2i/5_day_canoe_camping_trip_murtle_lake_advice/,5 day canoe camping trip Murtle Lake Advice,/r/okanagan/comments/ojit2i/5_day_canoe_camping_trip_murtle_lake_advice/h5227mn/,3,r/okanagan,0,3

"I didn’t really find much that was pet friendly. 

And half the time when the place says it is ‘pet friendly’ it stipulates dogs must be under 25 lbs, so my 65 pound lap dog just doesn’t conform.

There was a place that was about 1500 up at Apex but it had no internet, cable or anything. Which, if you have to spend 14 days sequestered in a place internet is pretty handy for staying sane and especially since the government wants you to do the covid tests while video chatting with a nurse. 

I have a cousin with a piece of land out near sugar lake that i was going to put my parents fifth wheel on, but there is no internet or cellphone service out there and no real address so it doesn’t count as an approved place to quarantine. Your place of quarantine must have some sort of address so purolator can pick up your tests and so the government can call/visit you periodically and then there is the issue that every morning you need to go-online in order to prove you are alive. 

We looked at the motel option but figured that what we would save on accommodation we would end up spending on take out and the like as the cheaper places dont have a real kitchen, just a mini fridge and microwave.",t2_7de9d8w2,Far_Scientist_5082,0,1624324087.0,0,t1_h2lozwy,h2lozwy,False,breezygiesy,t3_nr0bb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/nr0bb3/has_anyone_heard_of_decent_places_for_short_term/,Has anyone heard of decent places for short term (6 months ish) rentals in the valley?,/r/okanagan/comments/nr0bb3/has_anyone_heard_of_decent_places_for_short_term/h2lozwy/,1,r/okanagan,0,1

"I’m currently in a similar situation. I just arrived from the US two days ago and I am staying in an AirBNB up at Big White. When I researched places for the two week quarantine, It was actually cheaper to just rent the place for a month than two weeks during the summer of course. 

What’s nuts is both me and my husband have been vaccinated for two months and my parents are both now fully vaccinated but because the entrance to their basement suite is shared with the rest of the house all four of us fully vaccinated people can not live together even though the bulk of the living spaces would be different.

"hi. I just checked out your blog, and i like what i see so far. 

Very nicely written style, i like the way the  black font against the white background is easy to read, your words are are simple and easy to read and understand, right to the point without being confusing and frustrating to comprehend. 

\- Great photos! 

\- So a bit of background why i am interested in your okanagan blog: I love in Vancouver, have long term family members going back 65 years in Summerland, Penticton. My own parents lived in Princeton, Penticton , Summerland, Oliver when they came to Canada from Italy. Got a brother born in Oliver, the other two born in Penticton. Eldest bro retired 8 years ago and moved back to Penticton .

\- For the last 10 years, i've been lurking online FB, reddit and other sites related to all things Okanagan . My plan is to move to Penticton , get employed, rent a home/buy a home and retire there. So Okanagan blogs like yours help with the decision making process. 

\- Look forward to reading about your lives and adventures not only in Kelowna, but in the other communities such as Vernon, Summerland, Penticton, Oliver, Princeton and more. Actually, i hope to read on off the beaten path explorations, diners/restaurants/bakeries you try out, the Kettle Valley bike trail excursions and even little weekend side trip destinations.

One idea which i wish to do myself ( when i live in the okanagan) is to travel from Penticton to the further outlying BC communities 3-6 hours out, such as Nelson, Rock Creek, Greenwood, etc. I'd like to read about the highway in good and bad weather, sights to check out along the way, eateries/gas stations on the way, the actual visit in and around the town, honest thoughts and opinions if worth visiting, even if just for a day trip back and forth or an overnight stay.

"i hear ya. It's all relative. For instance, the crime levels in Penticton would be more acceptable and tolerable for a guy like me born and raised in East Van.  ( not that East Van is some Detroit ghetto, but we have tons of vehicle break ins, car thefts, bank robberies, shoplifters, junkies,  vandalism, assaults , some shootings, rapes, bike thefts, stolen property rings,  arsonists...etc). 
- I too like the South Okanagan, not just for Penticton, but because i could scoot on over to Oliver, OK Falls, Summerland, Osoyoos, Peachland and even go for a longer drive to Princeton just for added variety . Each community has a few treats worth at least visiting , from outdoorsy stuff to eating, shopping, recreation, blah blah. 
- I've chatted with my own relatives in Summerland, Penticton and on online okanagan forums and they laugh if i bring up traffic congestion as it is very mild and intermittent compared to the shitshow in metro vancouver.

Be aware that while crime rates may not be as bad a Vancouver, its a bit more in your face in most of the cities in the Okanagan. With smaller towns its more noticeable, its a shift for people, but it sucks to have your car constantly broken into or not being able to keep a bike for it gets stolen.

"thanks for your insight . I'm not totally dismissing Penticton, it is on the top of my  ''move to list''. I do realize it will be much quieter and limited for a variety of things i may enjoy in Vancouver, but i am realistic and realize i need to have lower expectations in terms of the restaurant and shopping, quantity of work and pay. But overall, i would look forward to less crime ( versus Metro Vancouver) , friendlier people, wayyyyyyyyyyy more yearly sunshine hours, fresh clean air, uncrowded beaches, parks, streets and one of the most important things of all, a much more affordable cost of living. The major items that drain the bank account in Vancouver are rent/mortgage, car insurance, price  of gas for the daily work commutes , condo insurance/condo stratta fees, etc. The daily traffic commutes , depending how far, can really be mentally exhausting as with the general attitudes of the people here. That can make one just get fed up and cocoon , not wanting to do other things after work hours.

"For the faults that you find with Penticton, they will be worse for Vernon. High population of seniors, a few not very special tourist traps, and many homeless and drug addicted people roaming the streets. 

Personally I think Vernon is very dull, even more so than Penticton and I've tried to give it a chance. Vernon missed opportunities to build up a brewery or winery scene. They even have one of the original Okanagan beers brewed there- Okanagan Springs, but haven't done much to encourage that. I can't even name a local restaurant that I like in Vernon (I liked Little Tex but that's closed now). Vernon does have good access to outdoor activities (fishing, hiking, biking, skiing) but reinforces that idea, that Vernon is better when you leave it! 

Penticton at least has some excitement in the summer months with the farmers market, smaller businesses/restaurants, brewery and winery scene etc.

We chose Vernon because of all the outdoor activities it has to offer - skiing, mountain biking, hiking, and two beautiful lakes for summer beaching. So far it has not disappointed. I still marvel at the mountain smells when I step outside of our house - a big difference from living on a busy street in Toronto. We thought about Kelowna, but decided against it as we wanted something a bit quieter yet close enough to Kelowna to go whenever we need anything that Vernon doesn't offer.

Penticton can sometimes be kinda dull and not much going on, too much geared towards retirement living or Summer tourist months.

You have any personal living experiences in Vernon? ...trying to figure out between the two, which city be a better overall fit for me ( middle aged man, 12 more years to go before retirement so i need to be able to find work and pay for either rent or a small house mortgage, own a vehicle, single/no kids)",t2_8b5q0xu2,eatmyass_reddit,0,1617819989.0,0,t1_gtptm33,gtptm33,False,hrrosie,t3_mltp29,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/mltp29/help_need_pros_and_cons_for_kelowna_vernon_and/,"Help!

"i live in Vancouver but i am familiar with the Okanagan. I have long term family members in the region, a brother who moved to Penticton 8 years ago, a cousin who moved to Westbank, my own parets lived in the okanagan communities on and off thru the decades. Also i visited every year for 3-4 days up until the covid. I read Castanet News online and i am on many facebook okanagan groups ( i too wish to move to the okanagan/ doing my research till then).

\- I would say if you want better employment opportunities and /or higher education facilities, go to Kelowna. Same is true if you want a ''big city lifestyle'',  transit buses, better shopping, restaurants, etc. But it will be the most expensive overall for your cost of living. You should look that up before deciding and really think if it is financially doable for the both of you. 

\- Kamloops and Vernon both are good smaller cities, but kamloops has twice the amount of people versus Vernon. Kamloops has about 90,000 population versus Vernon at around 45,000-50,00. Kamloops is more blue collar but has pretty much everything you might want in a small city, including a much more affordable cost of living versus kelowna. Mortgages and rents are cheaper and sometimes the employment situation is better or pays better then kelowna. Kamloops can be a ''pretty, scenic'' place to live, but my opinon, the okanagan communities of Penticton, vernon, kelowna are far more scenic and more interesting. -

I can't say too much about Vernon, cept what i read and see online, but it does look like a nice city for it's size and location. Not as touristy as kelowna or even kamloops, more of a working class/family type of a city. House prices and rents are cheaper then kelowna, not sure about the employment situation , my guess is that it is nothing special. But it seems that the people who live in Vernon love their city and has many positive things going for it.

Yes you can but there are only massive carp and a some bass. If you’re in Osoyoos and don’t have a boat try casting off the bridge; there I’ve caught rainbows. Also you can cast in the river channel at the north-end of Osoyoos lake but you’ll have to drive to Road 21 and drive down the channel until you find a spot to cast.

"If you’re into hiking, I’ve found that some trails in and around Kelowna/West Kelowna have plaques that highlight some of the stories passed down. It’s very interesting to me to learn about the First Nations stories that tie the land to dramatic tales about friendship or war or what have you. As someone who is interested in navigation, by understanding these stories it gives me another tool to help understand where I am in relation to other landforms or geographic features. For example there’s an interesting tale about how mt boucherie and black mountain were formed, if I remember correctly there was a  character something like a bully (I forget the traditional names) and another character stood up to him and defeated/destroyed him and boucherie is his upper body’s and black mountain is his head... maybe vice versa, but it’s a neat way to relate things and appreciate the culture",t2_6m2th,frently_tacos,0,1614324284.0,0,t1_got1gfw,got1gfw,True,moreglue,t3_lsmrsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/lsmrsu/first_nations_stories/,First Nations stories,/r/okanagan/comments/lsmrsu/first_nations_stories/got1gfw/,3,r/okanagan,0,3

"So your (presumptuous) inclination is to assume that because someone has changed their opinions over time they’re involved in a cult? It’s kinda sounds like you’re the one who’s closed minded, assuming that everyone around them has to think exactly to the tune of your beat; jumping to the most outlandish theories, unable to process how someone could have autonomous beliefs. There is a large part of the population (worldwide) that believes in a monotheistic God. Instead of assuming that your ‘friend’ has encountered an extremist version of Christianity, ponder upon the possibility that she walked into a Pentecostal Church — which are heavily populated within the general Okanagan area. Better yet, simply, genuinely, ask her how her views changed. If you want to know the truth, and your sincerity is evident and unthreatening, I’m sure you will uncover some information that will inform you better than your attempt here. You say she’s your friend? Be a friend; ask her. If you don’t like the answer you get, question your own reaction before assuming the person drank laced-Koolaid. People change, for various reasons.

"I think you can say that for a lot of the lefty speakers too. Intersectionality, critical race theory, victim hood and oppression olympics, shutting down speech that they seem “dangerous” like men and women and fundamentally and biologically different, like personal responsibility makes a huge difference in the outcome of ones life, throwing violent temper tantrums when someone presents them with an opinion that’s different from what they hear in their echo chambers, the entitlement that comes with making huge assumptions about people based on their race, religion or political leaning, the inability to properly defend a position without shutting down... I see all of this and more on the “left side” of the political aisle and I still won’t call it a cult, because that’s the wrong word for it and it’s a very extreme view.  I just think it’s objectively untrue that Jordan Peterson is alt right in anyway. I am a black woman, I am offended by alt right speech, naturally.

The more immediate trails, which I tried to represent with the arrow but which was unclear, are usually the Youtube algorithms that lead from Peterson's, Shaprio's, etc. videos to more explicitly alt-right/incel/white supremacist content.

We have our news delivered to us via algorithms. These are aimed at keeping you online as long as possible and provide you with similar stories.

If you click on something a little different than you would typically read, and say there is something you may not agree with, but it catches your eye so you follow a link to read more on the subject to find out what this is all about. You find a similar article and perhaps there is something in that article that resonates with you. You typically wouldn't have agreed with the stance prior to reading this, but it was worded differently and this time it connected with you. So, this is new, best to learn more so you look for it. Articles are now written with algorithms and specific words to grab your attention and keep it. It's also worded so it sounds researched and informed. It's too convincing. 

These new clicks lead you to information you're curious about and that leaves a trail of cookies which tells your web server that you should read more on this topic. Now you've fallen down the rabbit hole and since there is so much information, it must be at least a little bit real. Suddenly you're well informed and you're worried why no one else can see what you see. 

These tiny erosions of your true self are reshaping us into a very divided world. *Us VS. Them* is more commonplace and more angry than ever. 

Is it their fault? Are they just a victim? How do we collectively handle this 1 on 1 with friends? How do we handle this when it's the entire world? Extremist views are now normalized thanks to unchecked news and opinions being uploaded every second of the day. 

I have friends and 1 family member who have moved from being very liberal minded to Trump loving, climate change denying, all Asians should be killed - kinds of people. Extreme opposites. It happens in months. There's no reasoning with them. You can't. 

I had a friend speak of a murder in a small town. Another friend asked if the victim was black. When she said no, his answer was ""too bad"".

I kicked him out instantly. He spewed information about sites to look at for ""truth"" and I'm just a follower. Dude, who I've known for a decade, was otherwise a kind guy. He joined Facebook last year.... 

I'd say the cult is social media. It's dividing us as reasonable people who can have normal discourse, including opposite opinion debates, into raging know it all's based on ""news"".

The physical stand off stuff of your friend is concerning. But the other bits are sounding commonplace today.

I'm hoping your friendship survives and your friend is safe and ok. If it's a personal change due to ""reading information"" you just have to hang on to the ride, or jump off when it's too scary.

"Holy assumptions. First the bike pulled out of the same stop sign, then the car blew through it. Second I was not in enhanced drive so I have to break. The bike was already cutting it close before the car blew through. I never comment on my skills or implied mine were great. The Tesla has lots of cameras to record with, it is the only reason it is brought up. I am not a rookie, never had an at fault accident it 20 years. I have had a guy do this before and cause an accident, you know how that went for them in court.

  


Wife was hit crossing a cross walk by a guy that blew through a stop sign though, I guess that counts towards some of my rage with drivers like this.

"""Look at me I drive a Tesla and someone made me slow down and I'm upset"". This was the least extreme, anti climatic dash cam footage I've seen in a while. Yes they shouldn't have came out in front of you at that distance making you apply brakes, if the bike wasn't in the way they probably would of accelerated faster hence the brakes, so it seems you'd be braking for either vehicle anyways because you could see the bike through the orange cars windshield still. That wasn't a malicious brake check or ""stomp"" as you put hah. But if you think this is some extreme situation narrowly avoided due to your amazing braking skills in your self braking vehicle, then I think you're the obvious rookie behind the wheel as this is a normal occurence, some people make bad judgement calls, and you have to drive accordingly.

Having been a dad to 3 kids for many years, plenty of family road trips included, if your kids were crying I can't help but wonder about other potential causes because braking is a normal part of driving that shouldn't bring children to tears. Even hard braking that pulls you forward in your seat because of some jackass brake-checking is more of a ""WOAH!"" moment for kids.

"Armstrong: Rural farm community. Safe, lower rent, close enough to Vernon for shopping and services. Some services / shopping available in town centre. Home prices are slightly lower than Vernon. There is no real condo/townhouse option.

Lavington: Even more rural than Armstrong. All services and shopping are in Vernon. Known mostly for it's lumber mill and farms. House prices a little lower than Vernon. Zero condo/townhouse options.

Lumby: Basically a much less pretty version of Armstrong. Some services / shopping but Vernon really is the shopping centre. House prices a little lower than Vernon. Zero condo/townhouse options. I perceive it as much more redneck than Armstrong, but that may just be my experiences there.

Enderby: Closer to Salmon Arm than Vernon. Limited services/shopping. Kinda backwater. Lowest house prices in the area. Great river float...but little else. No proximity to a lake.

It really comes down to how rural you want to be. All these options are rural areas. Their house prices are impacted by proximity to Vernon. The more north or east you go from Vernon, the more rural you get. The more south you go the more urban you get (Oyama being the one exception to the south). All the rural communities are safer than Vernon. If you want land and home, you will get better bang for your buck north or east of Vernon.

"There’s not too much for diversity but there is a fair amount of Punjabi and Native families. Osoyoos is absolutely bogged for tourists so they come up here and a very large amount of people from Quebec come to pick fruit but end up homeless on the street in the park by the skatepark (rendering it unused by families). A lot of people have problems with the schools, but Tucelnuit is better than OES, and Senpokchin is the best of all (a school on the reservation that is open to any kids, lots of community feel and teachers that genuinely care and go out of their way). There is the main Hike&Bike trail everybody uses that goes trough the town and out to osoyoos, and I’d consider people to be pretty open to newcomers, but we don’t really see them much as most people grew up in Oliver (a lot of people feel stuck tbh). The main way to get involved as I’ve seen is through kids activities, depending on how old your son is. Senpokchin is absolutely beautiful and very good for that as they host all sorts of activities for families and you get a chance to experience First Nations traditions. They are very welcome to families of all origins and there are -plenty- of white kids there. The highschool was a bit of a transition from a that school though, as it’s bigger and less personalized. But it’s extremely beautiful though, being very new, and it offers a lot of clubs and opportunities for students. It doesn’t usually have a real snowfall until the week of Christmas, so the last couple years or so have not been white christmases.

"Source: I lived there for 25 years up to 2017.

Pros:

20 minutes to Silver Star for riding and skiing

Great outdoor activity potential with Ellison and Kal Park only a few minutes away

Good people overall.

Much better traffic than Kelowna but still only 45 minutes from Kelowna.

Cons:

Homelessness and drug issues are rampant in the core. This brings crime to areas like East Hill and the Landing.

A car is pretty much a must to get anything if you want to live in a nicer area.

City governance is poor since their focus is reduce taxes at the cost of roads and services.

\-------

Areas to live in: Coldstream, Foothills and Middleton Mountain.

Areas to avoid living in: Mission Hill, Downtown, Alexis Park, East Hill.

Best schools: Coldstream.

Diversity: Like most of the Okanagan, it's pretty caucasian. I have not seen much in the way of red neck racism so it is inclusive.

Rent: pretty much the same throughout the Okanagan: mid-high. Vernon falls in the middle of the Vally with Kelowna being the most expensive.

Recommendation: If you must be in Vernon, live in Coldstream. If you don't have to be in Vernon, go to Lake Country, Kelowna or Peachland.

"To add to what the others' have written, schools are now shut down. Registration will happen in the last week of August. Always keep your pupper on a leash while hiking, you're in rattlesnake country. And those pear cacti are super jumpy. They're found low to the ground, in clumps that look little until you look closely; then you realise you're almost surrounded by them. They have a kind of hooked barb that is no fun. They can be weensy, the size of raisin, or big and fat like a peach or avocado pit. Summer is hot as hades, like they said. The south Okanagan is Canada's only desert. Our snow is usually nice and dry, champagne powder. Great for skiing, but absolute crap for snowmen and snowball fights. I live in Penticton, so I can't tell you about the people who live there or community things, but there's a ton of sport in the valley. If your son is mistaken for Indian/West Asia, he probably won't find he sticks out so much anymore. Portuguese are slowly selling off to South Asians, so that population is really growing there now. I think there's a lot of rodeo/horse stuff there. 3 of my cousins grew up there, and I've spent summers and Christmas/Easter/Thanksgiving/spring break... at my grandparents' at Gallagher Lake since I was born. The BIGGEST change you're going to notice, is time moves differently here. People are not in any rush to go or do much. The entire south Okanagan is like that. Chill. The movie theater there shows older movies and a lesser price - when it opens back up that is. And ya, LOTS of religious choices.

"Grew up there, so I'll give any insights I have in addition to the other comments.

School offices are still open this week as admin work an extra week, so if you contact the schools today or tomorrow you'll reach somebody. Or you can wait until the last two weeks of august, and admin will again be back.

Both Tuc-El-Nuit and OES are good schools. OES is the bigger of the two, but ultimately it depends on where you live in town that decides where they'll go. Probably around half of the students at both schools walk to school, since it's such a small town. Personally, I don't think there's any big division between the two. SenPokChin is the Indigenous school previously mentioned. It's a beautiful facility and would be a unique experience for your child.

Schools are good. The high school is new within the past five years and is truly state of the art. They have a great young staff there who are onboard with new styles of education.

Winters are extremely mild. You'll get a dusting of snow a few times through the winter, but it rarely exceeds a couple of inches. As long as your winter tires are not bald, you'll be fine.

Generally speaking, it's a pretty welcoming place, but keep in mind that it is a small town, and all the stereotypes that come with that are true. Word gets around fast, people talk. But overall, very welcoming and kind.

As mentioned, there's a large population of Portuguese and Punjabi populations, in addition to the members of Osoyoos Indian Band. A few East-Asian families and a couple of Sudanese (I think) and Syrian refugee families have come in the past decade.

Summers are definitely busier, and Mainstreet/highway 97 can get painfully slow. Traffic between Oliver and Osoyoos usually slows to 50-60 km/h due to tourists going slow because they want to look at the orchards. But Osoyoos and Penticton are the true tourist destinations because of their boating lakes, Oliver is kind of the little brother of the two when it comes to tourists. The biggest draw is the wineries in Oliver, so there are lots of tourists that come for that. Black Sage Road gets pretty busy.

Clubs, Activities and Social Groups: If your kid is into soccer, that's a great way to do it. SOYSA is a pretty big community gatherer. Of course, like any other Canadian town, there's a hockey culture, so that's also a way to get involved. Getting involved with your kid's school (whichever you choose) is also a great way to meet people. In the summer, the local pool has a great community feel to it, and there are lots of families that become regulars there. I'd recommend checking out the Parks & Rec guide, there are lots of events and clubs they put on.

If you're any kind of Christian, there are lots of churches in Oliver, all with their own community, so that's another way that connections can be made. There's also the Sikh temple for the same reasons.

I still have lots of connections there, so feel free to reach out via DM if you want any further info or help.",t2_6g56c,epicarson,0,1593726269.0,0,t1_fwqqzrq,fwqqzrq,True,bibbidibobbidi-boop,t3_hk0x28,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/hk0x28/moving_to_oliver/,Moving to Oliver,/r/okanagan/comments/hk0x28/moving_to_oliver/fwqqzrq/,4,r/okanagan,0,4

"I don't live there now but I grew up in Oliver so I can give you pointers! I haven't been back for anything longer than a weekend in a long time so this may be out of date but its a small town and I doubt things have changed enough that I'll be all wrong.


>is school registration for fall still possible now (ex: via email?) how can I get in touch with the elementary school my son will go to during summer break?

Typically school offices are staffed starting in August getting ready for September. There's 3 elementary schools in town though, make sure you're visited the office of to there one you intend to enroll with!


• how do people find the schools in general?

Tuc-el-nuit is the elementary school for the eastern part of the town (there's a river going through it that serves as a border for which school you attend) and it's the nicer school because that's the side of the town with a lake (and thus where higher income families live).

OES is right next to the high school and I can't say much because I didn't attend there.

There's an elementary school (name eludes me) up on the rez as well that's absolutely gorgeous and worth looking into if your children have aboriginal heritage.

>what are winters like (ex: average snowfall, do highways stay clear, etc) I have a tiny Prius C and though my winter tires are still decent I wonder if it's time to get something a little meatier.

You'll be fine. Snowless Christmases were a north of my childhood. It's a legit desert. Be ready for 40 degree summers, winter is not to worry about.

> any tips on local hiking and trail etiquette? I don't want to wander into someone's property by accident or let my dog wander anywhere he shouldn't

You shouldn't be worried about private property as much, people have fences. The real thing to pay attention to is cacti and snakes. Again, this is a desert. Jumping cactus are all over the hills and rattlesnakes are common enough that you need to keep them in mind. 


> are families in Oliver generally pretty friendly and open to newcomers?

Can't speak about Oliver today, but in the 90s and 00s it was home to a TON of immigration from Portugal and India. Small town mentality still, though, and it was quite cliquey based on race. 

>what kind of diversity can we expect in the area, and what kinds of attitudes toward ethnic diversity? (my son is a visible minority and this has come up in negative ways at times even in the city)

Depends on the minority. There's lots of white, Indian, and aboriginal people. Decent amount of Asian population. Growing up there I could count the number of black people I've ever seen in Oliver on one hand.

> do summers tend to get quite crowded (ex: with people visiting from lower mainland/tourists etc)?

Crowded might be hyperbolic, its definitely busier in the summer but its never busy to the long point of inconvenient unless there's a big event going on and you're on-location.


>what types of clubs/activities/social groups would you recommend for newcomers to make new connections?

If you're into sports, there's plenty of that. Softball is very popular in Oliver. Not a ton more than that, it's a small town. That said, this is an area where my outdated knowledge may be totally off base. I'd still be confident about baseball being a safe bet. There is a ski hill nearby as well, Mt Baldy.

Sounds like it's a bit too slow for you. That's how I felt in my early 30's about the thought of leaving Toronto, but with things getting out of control here, I've started to reevalutate things. 

Not being by a major airport hub does suck though. I know there are direct flights to YVR, YYC and YYZ, albeit much more limited with the last one. 

The friends I have here I hardly ever see, and we're close to each other, so it's not a major thing.

"Thanks for all the feedback everyone.  I really appreciate it.

To be honest, I find the comments about Kelowna being ""too big"" and bad traffic sort of funny, then again, I'm in the biggest city in the country. However, seeing as there's no real public transportation, I'd unfortunately have to get a car. At least insurance would be a lot cheaper.

I've heard about the drug problem but seeing as they recently opened up a respite shelter about 300m from my condo, I'm sure it wouldn't be any worst. Did I mention that there was absolutely **NO** community consultation? 

I'm all about wine clubs. It's tough here because my friends in the wine industry are around my age, but work restaurant hours, yet the people who can do wine tastings  and ""claim"" to like wine, are more of the pinot grigio crowd, but enough about that...

Honestly, the weather is a major attraction and pull for me. I know people claim it's hot, but I'm so over 30+°C and 100% humidity that we get here in Toronto. The winters are ok here, but it's just so grey here and bland. I realize it's grey in the valley as well so more or less the same there. 

I wouldn't say I'm an outdoorsy person, but I want/hope to change that. I actually wanted to do a hike when I was there this past May, but was fighting a cold so decided not to. Plus it was pouring rain the only day I was well enough to go. No where to really do a hike here, unless if it's walking home because the TTC isn't running...

Some of the cons are serious, namely the lack of doctor. I have a great doctor here (reg MD and naturopath) and having to go who knows how long w/o one isn't very appealing. Is the situation the same in the entire Okanagan or just in and around Penticton? 

There does seem to be some naturopaths around though so that helps.   
I hope it's not the same and as tough trying to get a dentist or chiropractor!

I suppose lastly, meeting people is a concern. I know a lot of people out west (well more like through the rest of the country) dislike people from Toronto and/or think we're all about extreme lefties.  While I get that the Okanagan tends to be more conservative (I believe the area in general also tends to vote conservative in elections) I'm hoping most people aren't that stuck up or close minded. The people I've interacted with all seemed fine but of course there's the odd comment. With that being said, life is too short to worry about spilled milk. (Try saying that to my boss about our accounts. You'd think we just missed out on the cure for cancer...)

Thanks!

"I moved to the Okanagan for work from Calgary. In my mid 30s, single, been here almost 1 Year. Here are my impressions so far;

1. The opportunities for recreation are unsurpassed in all seasons and they are all close by. I can literally go hiking or to the lake by walking from my doorstep.
2. The climate is mild in winter, and winter is really short and grey compared to the sunny and fierce prairie winter. 
3. The Okanagan valley and surrounding areas are so scenic! I live in lake country overlooking two lakes and can’t get over the view even after one year. 
4. I work in consulting so my pace of life is still super fast. However for most other people, it seems more relaxed. 
5. I don’t really miss anything from the big city except; an airport with a bigger hub and opportunities for networking. 
6. On the personal side, the Okanagan is perfect for retirees and families. For single people I find it very difficult. Opportunities to make friends with retirees and families are everywhere but it is really difficult to make friends with other singles unless perhaps you work with a lot of single people? There definitely are pockets of single people but I have no idea how to connect with them. 
7. If you’re looking for a sense of community the Okanagan offers that, random people actually say hello and good morning on the street, at the ski hill or walking trails. 


To summarize, I think you would like it here if you enjoy the outdoors, slower pace of life and mild weather. If you’re more on the outgoing side you’d probably make friends your age too. It takes time. Hopefully that helps, if you have any more questions let me know. As for me I’m trying to move back to Calgary!

"Another Pentictonite here. Penticton is the nicest mix of city and town. Mild winters, hella hot summers, and enough to do in between. Yes, we get grey in winter, and our winds are cutting, but you can go up Apex ski hill and catch some rays -  when the sun comes out, everyone is in the best mood! Housing is tough, but if you are selling your condo, you'll be able to buy. Trying to rent here is practically impossible with a less than 1% vacancy rate. Finding a Dr is actually impossible. For a town full of the elderly, you'd think there's be openings all the time, but no. BC is trying to figure out how to change this, but governments move slow. Job market is dependant on your area of expertise. We've got all your drinking needs covered: more than 40 wineries within 15 mins, we're newly crowned 'brewry capital of Canada"", a few distilleries, a great green juice spot (The Angry Vegan). Food is great too. Because we cater to the wine crowds, we have some top tier restaurants. Like sports? Got it all. Skiing summer and winter types, snowmobile or jetski, hiking, biking, boating, rock climbing, swimming, floating, gyms, yoga, martial arts,... Our Junior A Hockey Team is pretty damn good too (we've produced 50+ NHL players). We're close enough to Kelowna for things we we don't have here, and Vancouver is only 5 hrs. The North Okanagan is beautiful too. Lush forests where our desert ends and forest begins. More snow though. There's nothing wrong with Kelowna, but there's lots that's wrong with Kelowna. Many Pentictonites loathe having to go, and Kelownians think Penticton is 'quaint'. Further south is nice, but much hotter and dryer, and waaaaaaaayyyyy slower life with little to nothing to do. All cities in the Okanagan have a drug and petty crime problem, with none being better than another. It's a broken government, not Okanagan, cause. Schools are good. We have Okanagan College too.

"I did this, though my story is perhaps a a little different. I visited Kelowna one summer and moved out here 14 years ago from the Brampton/Caledon suburbs. I truly love it here. You’ll probably here that making friends is tough which it can be but at the same time I do think there are plenty of opportunities to get that community feeling. An example of this is last year when our family started going to support the local Junior hockey team, the Kelowna Chiefs. We met some great people who are all really involved in various different aspects of the community.

If you enjoy the outdoors and being active there are so many different opportunities here both for activities themselves and to connect with other peoples who enjoy those same things. Whether it’s fitness training, snow sports, hiking, kayaking, mountain biking, team sports, etc.

You enjoy wine. Enough said. I didn’t enjoy wine until about 3.5 years ago and I’m so thankful my palette came around because it’s now such a fun part of life here; visiting wineries and trying new wines. One of our favourite wineries is Indigenous World Winery and after joining the wine club we’ve became somewhat like family with the people there. It’s actually easy to get that feeling around here.

"Penticton here. It's awesome! It has all the amenities (like 24 hr gas station) that I miss in a smaller town but still keeps a small town feel (people care about one another). The population is almost 30% seniors - so the night life is lame. Most people find their circles and enjoy wine potluck or games nights (obvs also in my 30's). Being sandwiched between 2 lakes is epic! Ski hill is 30 mins away. Cimbing hills/rocks 5 mins away. If you love outdoor stuff there is no shortage of stuff to do. Takes less than 10 mins to get anywhere by car, and bikes & walking is common. Lots of insurance & wine jobs. Our weather is a tad warmer than Kelowna.

"To address the microclimate, It's all about the sun and the wind. The impact of the lake and mountains. I have wild cactus and sage brush growing naturally on the sun exposed slope behind my house. While, the North side of the mountain, a 30 minute walk away, is cedar and moss, a true temperate forest. 

The natural vegetation is a great indicator of microclimate. 

The warmest spots (locally) will  be sun exposed, South facing slopes slightly elevated off the lake, which also get reflection off the water.  IE, Mission hill area in West Kelowna. (The solar gain from reflected light off water is said to be 30%.) 

The lake itself moderates temperature. As the water temperature is colder then the air in the summer, while warmer in winter.

Wind generally moves West to East, with less obstacles(mountains) the stronger. Downtown Kelowna and lower mission(rotary beach) see the most consistent wind. (Where the sailboats and Kiteboarders go). Also,  hot summer days result in afternoon thermals that  blow South down the lake (sometimes in reverse).

Generally, the South OK is slightly warmer and Drier than the North. The most noticeable change is the snow line in winter. Armstrong is 2c colder on average than Penticton and recieves 14% more rain and 114% more snow. Vernon and Kelowna receive the same,  60% more snow than Penticton. However, since neither of these places really receive a great deal of snow (approx. 3ft on the year), a single snow event can be the true difference maker.",t2_1oxyox,kootenaypow,0,1579194252.0,0,t1_fek7jyg,fek7jyg,False,Elsamathew,t3_dqpeuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/dqpeuu/what_are_the_seasons_like_back_in_the_okanagan/,What are the seasons like back in the Okanagan?,/r/okanagan/comments/dqpeuu/what_are_the_seasons_like_back_in_the_okanagan/fek7jyg/,1,r/okanagan,0,1

"To be honest I’m really not sure how to answer this one. If by “best climate” you are referring to the warmest and driest then I suppose Osoyoos would offer the best climate.

I should probably also clarify: The climate is more or less similar from Osoyoos up to about Armstrong in the North Okanagan. There will be days where it rains or snows in one area and not in another and as I mentioned it is typically warmer in the South end of the Valley cooler in the North; however, were not talking a difference difference that impacts the lifestyle or quality of life.

"March - spring starts, lots of sunny days, daytime temps usually max out around 10C but sometimes into the teens.
April-May - spring weather with temps ranging from about 10C to 30C. Often see hot streaks but typically temp in high teens to low 20s
June - a wildcard month but in my experiences this is end classic spring month with lots of rain and temps in the teens. The odd beautiful day to tease you of what’s to come next. Sometimes it’s more like summer though. June 2018 was hot and sunny the entire month.
July-August - summer. Hot. Not uncommon to see 3-6 weeks of straight sunny days and temps in the low to mid 30s. This past year was an exception, much cooler than usual. This time of year is also sometimes referred to as “Smoke Season” because there is usually a few days to a few weeks if Smokey skies due to forest fires.
September - known to start off like summer and end like autumn. Common to have morning temps down in the low single digits but afternoon temps reaching 30C. It’s a beautiful time of year.
October - autumn. Temps isually in the teens some really nice sunny days and some rainy days.
November - the snow will arrive any day but usually around the 2nd week of the month. It’s starting to feel cold. Overnight temps will dip below zero from time to time and daytime temps won’t get much higher than 10C, if that.
December-February - winter - temps anywhere from -25C to 10C but most often however right around 0. Many grey days. The sun will often make an appearance in the early morning hours and then disappear around 10am not to be seen until the next day. Snows usually a handful of times.

"When are you planning to visit? And for how long?

Many wineries are shutting down the public side of their operations at this time of year. Most will re-open for visitors around the Easter holiday.  

How many in the group? If it's a manageable number I'd suggest booking an excursion to Naramata one day and then another excursion to Oliver for another. If you had a third day, a jaunt to Summerland. There are a number of wine tour companies, zero ride shares and taxi service that is expensive and unreliable.

"Housing and rent is all relative - that bad compared to what? Small town SK, yes; Vancouver/Toronto - the whole Okanagan is a bargain. :) Look up prices online - that would be your best bet to get a feel for what you would want/need.

Homelessness is a bit of an issue in both places; tidiness is pretty good, though there are places that are unsightly in both places, just like any other city.

Crime rate is increasing slowly; petty theft and drug use are a problem; in Penticton, bikes especially get stolen a lot. And many transients especially in summer, who work in fruit picking, and because of good weather.

Summer weather is fantastic, yes. Easily gets above 30C - this week highs are in the mid-30s. Dry heat, yes. Lots of lakes around. Penticton is bordered by 2, Kelowna has one on its west/south edge.

Winter - depends a bit on altitude (lots of housing up in the hills of both cities). In town -10C is about as cold as it gets, thought it can get colder for very brief periods. Lots of winter is hovering around 0. Winters are short, and Penticton a little shorter than Kelowna (being a bit more south) - using golfing as an example, you could golf until mid-late November and usually start again mid-March. Sometimes even late Feb in Penticton.

Traffic is bad in Kelowna; part of that is so much growth and the city wasn’t built for it - the provincial highway (97) goes right through the middle of the city with tons of lights. Bridge over the lake heading to West Kelowna can get backed up easily, even though it was replaced a few years ago to handle more traffic.

Traffic’s not bad in Penticton at all. Much smaller city, though WAY busier in summer due to it being a huge tourist destination with fantastic beaches and wine tourism.

People are friendly in both places, though Kelowna’s much more of a big city feel now - lots of money, lots of tech companies, etc. Penticton is a big retirement community; there’s a lot of NIMBY issues, and it can be a bit harder to break into social circles (and other issues, like literally no family doctors in Penticton are taking new patients).

"Housing prices are high but not unlike other communities in B.C. pricing is far less than metro Vancouver and metro Toronto. Vacancy rates have been low for years and with the elevated property values rents are also high, although level out more as you move from a 1 or 2 bedroom condo to a detached house.

Summers are hot but dry except this year but that goes for the entire province of B.C. this year we had a considerable amount of rain throughout June and a July and haven’t had any days over 30C that I can recall. Usually we get 4-6 weeks straight sun and 30+ throughout this time of the year, maybes it’s just arriving late this year.

Winters are mild. Snow amounts vary from year to year and temperatures tend to hover around freezing. In the 13-years I’ve been here It usually gets down to about -20C once or twice a year but never for more than a couple week at once.

Locals love to complain about traffic, even the ones that come from bigger cities. The thing is, if you’ve experienced traffic congestion in any large city, you pretty much won’t city anything like that in Kelowna.

Homelessness is definitely a problem that the City is arguably trying to deal with but struggling. This is a real problem in a many cities across North America and nobody seems to really have the answer.

Many of homeless are drug users and with that comes petty crime. I don’t know the exact figures but I would say there has likely been an increase of these petty crimes.

"Why are you considering the Okanagan? What is it that you do for work? 

Penticton and Vernon are quieter, smaller cities and will offer less in terms of jobs and amenities. Kelowna is the largest city between Vancouver and Calgary so has more than the other two. Coming from Toronto, Kelowna will seem like a small town.

Long, dry summers and relatively mild winters. Skiing, golf, water sports, hiking, mountain biking, and endless adventures within a few hours in any direction. What I love about Kelowna is that I'm two hours to Revelstoke and the gateway to the Rockies, one and a half hours to Osoyoos and the Similkameen valley, four hours from Vancouver and coast etc...

"The money will go much further in Calgary and it is a relatively short drive to the mountains (you could day trip it and winter driving isn’t *that* bad usually). Taxes, gas, insurance, and rent are all cheaper there.

Lifestyle in Kelowna is the big perk for sure! Warm winters, lots of outdoors activities, I’m sure I don’t need to tell you. However cost of living is higher in taxes, insurance, gas, plus there is MSP and Kelowna is currently the 8th most expensive city in Canada IIRC. Two bedroom apartments in Kelowna are averaging at $1,600. 

You have to determine what option best suits your lifestyle. If you are outdoorsy and think you’ll really take advantage of the Kelowna life style go for it! But if you value quick material gains Calgary might be better for you.

"I am not a huge wine drinker either but some wineries that I went to that I really enjoyed were Vibrant Vine and Frequency. They are both pretty interesting places and host live music regularly. I know for cider there is a cidery called Scenic Road Cidery it is north Kelowna but they are open Thursday-Sunday and offer cider tastings. If you are going to be in the north part of Kelowna anyways you could make the trip to Lake Country for the Kangaroo farm and also go to the Jammery for breakfast. If you are looking to relax you could go down to city park and hang out on the beach. I will often go down, hang out at the beach, and then get ice cream from Parlour on the way home. Also if you are looking for a beautiful hike I suggest Christie Falls. The road out to it has some pretty nasty potholes but the falls are amazing.

"> We're hoping to stay within 30 to 40 minutes drive to Kelowna. 

> but finding a 3 br HOUSE with a yard under 400,000 is proving difficult. 

Really? What areas are you looking at? Kelowna/West Kelowna proper? Lake Country? Mission? 

I made this move from Vancouver recently and had never even been to the area before... I love it! It's freaking gorgeous here. Massive red pines,  rocky hills, wineries galore and a huge, super warm lake; it's like a Canadian California.

I bought a 3 bdr/2 bath house on 2/3 of an acre with a fenced yard and a large, detached workshop a year and a half ago for under 300k. It's about a 35 minutes to Kelowna, 25 to Vernon on the Westside of the lake (cheaper than Lake Country, better for travel to Kamloops and Osoyoos). I mean, it's not a new house (1970) and does need/has needed a bit of TLC and exterior updating, but it's a great little house, and I can see the lake from my master bedroom!

I guess prices may have gone up a bit, but over 100k in less than two years seems like a significant increase for such a rural area. I could be totally off though, which I guess is good for me?

All the following is suggestions for north of Kelowna (2 - 2.5 hours to Kamloops/Penticton, probably ~4 to Ossoyoos)... 

If you like the idea of retirement/gated communities, have you looked at Fintry? La Casa? Valley of the Sun? Westshore Estates? There are a few higher end neighbourhoods in that area that offer a strata type set up, take care of snow/garbage removal. You may pay a bit more at these places though...

Killiney Beach, Ewing, Wilsons Landing and Traders Cove are all little ""neighbourhoods"" along Westside Road that would suite your commuting needs and may have suitably priced homes. They offer a mix of permanent residents and summer homes. Got to hire a neighbour/deal with snow yourself, and take your crap to the dump in these places though, if that's a concern for you. 

Heads up, water is expensive AF over here. It was a shock, used to it now, but I even have to pay some water fees on the empty, adjecent lot with no hookup I purchased. Super cheap property taxes offset that cost though.

A realtor with a good knowledge of the area may be an asset for you, especially since you are out of province, although I found my house on my own just browsing different local realty sites. Just don't go with one of the cheap, discount percentage realty companies as you totally get what you pay for. Both sellers I bought from used one, and they slowed the process significantly, were impossible to get a hold of, and made many errors.

Good luck with your decision! Feel free to ask any questions/pm me. It was a scary move, and my first home purchase, but I am so happy everyday for having done it.

Edit: I forgot about Parker Cove. That is a really nice, gated community with no age restrictions (and I highly doubt there's any pet restrictions) that has its own private access beaches and docks. It's mostly new builds, smaller lots but some have good sized fenced yards, and it's a very nice little community.",t2_82rje,Enucks91,0,1517496435.0,0,t1_dtkmyae,dtkmyae,True,Silverfire4200,t3_7uaq3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/okanagan/comments/7uaq3n/maybe_relocating_areas_to_look_for_or_avoid_and/,Maybe relocating - Areas to look for or avoid and why.,/r/okanagan/comments/7uaq3n/maybe_relocating_areas_to_look_for_or_avoid_and/dtkmyae/,1,r/okanagan,0,1

"Be ready to get looked down upon by locals and be prepared for an uphill battle to be respected. I've never done the work myself, but grew up in towns in the south Okanagan where pickers flocked to every summer. 

I'm not saying that you're like this, or that even most are, but there's a lot of pickers who are little more than vagrants. They adopt pets and abandon them when the season is over because it's easier than travelling with them. They steal (not just from locals, but from other pickers too) because they're only in the area for a few months and have no permanent address to get tracked back to. So locals are often very suspicious of pickers. 

That said, there's always good ones too. Plenty of great folk just looking to enjoy a working vacation in a beautiful area. Be respectful and responsible in dealing with people and you'll usually get it returned to you. Just remember that this is our home.

"Thanks for taking the initiative to help this fine canine to find his way home. Have you taken him to a vet or rescue organization to be scanned for a microchip that could shorten the search? 

Some steps you can also take:  

*Post to /r/dogs, /r/rescuedogs and any related reddits listed in their sidebars as well as subreddits specific to your province and any local colleges, like /r/ubco. 

*Go looking for local rescue organizations, asking them to list the dog.
Do the same for local neighborhood egroups (you can sort either Yahoogroups or Googlegroups by city name) -- these groups are incredibly effective at reuniting pets with owners.

*post a flyer with (tear-off tags for contact phone #) in nearby veterinarians' offices, at the local municipal shelter & the humane society, on utility poles and under neighbors' doormats in a large radius, in supermarkets and libraries, etc.

At every step, ask the people you're talking to for more ideas, and also ask them to pass on the info. It's work, but this beautiful dog deserves your best effort. Good luck! 

EDIT: I just realized this is happening the same day your own dog had to be euthanized. I'm so sorry this all landed in your lap at once.
