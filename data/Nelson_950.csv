"I moved to Nelson in November and it's more expensive than where I was living before (Calgary). Depending on where you land there are some reasonably priced spots, but because you and I are part of the new remote-workforce, vacancy is pretty low these days.

I was recommended to find a place using FB groups--you essentially have to post a dating profile and then compete with everyone. My partner came to Nelson to visit last year and met a property manager and then spent a year forging a really meaningful relationship with him (because he was a cool guy, not because of alterior motives) and we got really lucky in that he sent us properties that he was managing when we decided to make the move. 

The bad: finding a place is hard but coming from somewhere like vic it'll be comparable/potentially a bit cheaper. A lot of people have ended up paying above market price because its so hard to nail something down

"To get natural immunity you have to get covid..... and that doesn't last forever either.  Unvaccinated people simply have higher rates of hospitalization. There's evidence from all over the world showing this. So you propose people catch covid instead of getting a vaccine?  No thanks. 

And in terms of taxation...... alcohol and cigarettes are taxed to hell.  Heck even gambling goes to our Healthcare system.  There's fat taxes all over the world.... and they work.  If you smoke... your insurance premiums are higher,  if you engage in risky behaviour your disability insurance may not cover you. If you drink and crash your car....is icbc gonna cover you?  No way. There's plenty of precedent.

I totally agree it is primarily a disease of the unhealthy..... but our society is overwhelmingly unhealthy.  Obesity, alcohol,  drugs, poor work life balance, shitty diets.... on top of illness..... you gonna magically change that? No.  When these people get covid and they don't get vaccines they end up in the hospital at much higher rates and are stressing out already vulnerable system.

You live in a society. Who cares if you're a healthy covid survivor......we are dealing with a world wide pandemic that goes beyond you.

"Actually a few months ago the unvaccinated accounted for over 90 percent of hospitalization. Now we know that the vaccines protection lasts for only 3 months and the unvaccinated now account for 45 percent of hospitalization. At this rate in another couple months that number will likely be 10 percent. Peer reviewed studies have proven that natural immunity is more robust and lasts much longer. Additionally, of the few government health agencies , mainly the UK and US, willing to break down the demographics of those dying you will find that the vast majority of deaths occur in people either over 80 and or already compromised by 1 or several other diseases. In the US for example over 70 percent of deaths have occurred in people morbidly obese and or severely diabetic. That literally makes this a pandemic of the old and unhealthy. So to those morons who think we should tax and or refuse healthcare to the unvaccinated are fat people next ? , smokers?, alcoholics?, The latest study out of the European Union which used the latest data from 14 countries suggests that if you are over 80 you have a 95 to 97 percent chance of survival. Under 20 is 99.998 percent. I‚Äôm 45 years old , have focused on physical health and made the difficult financial decision to eat almost exclusively organic food for the last 25 years. I contracted the Delta strain early last year and was sick for 3 days and would have gone back to work within a week if not for the quarantine. So yes if everyone got sick at the same time , vaccinated or not, the hospitals would be overwhelmed and collapse. That being said, we did a pretty damn good job before vaccines were available just by wearing masks social distancing and hand washing. So why are hospitalizations as high or higher this year with 90 percent vaccinated!? That‚Äôs a simple Occam‚Äôs Razor answer, people got vaccinated and listened to the talking heads that promised life would go back to normal after they ‚Äútook one for the team‚Äù then became a-symptomatic super spreaders. It is the ignorance and entitlement among the vaccinated spreading it and the ones who haven‚Äôt had access to crowded indoor public spaces for months have been hit hardest. Anyone who can still think critically sees by now that taking people‚Äôs personal freedom and even livelihood‚Äôs away to coerce them into taking an experimental treatment that doesn‚Äôt work as intended, providing immunity and stopping spread , is morally repugnant. Mandates don‚Äôt work and never will.

"> [A logical fallacy](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/logical-fallacies-examples) is an error in reasoning that can invalidate your argument.

Understanding common logical fallacies is an important part of judging other's arguments and crafting your own. When you use logic that is consistent and makes sense, your employer and colleagues are more likely to take your arguments seriously.

To be honest it is not very back country anymore and is full of people.  I remember going up there in the 90s and seeing maybe one other group over the course of 3 days.  And sadly the glacier itself is a mere glimpse of what is once was.

"Gentrification seems to mean that not only are locals and long time residents being pushed out but also the town and area around it are being turned into just another urban sprawl.

There's a community college in Nelson. [They offer a Liberal Arts course there.](https://www.tncc.edu/about/admin/academic-divisions) Despite its name, 'liberal arts' will teach you how to think critically and how to properly form an argument.

Do your democratic duty and enroll, because you badly need their services.

> just questionable that you feel the need to emphasize male rights

I'm a Humanist and left-wing male advocate. I'm in MensRights to balance perspective and encourage a healthy view to gender politics *outside of feminism*.

There's nothing questionable about that to anybody but a moral authoritarian who is so fragile in their own perspective that they can't stand any opposition.

>What I think is helpful is easily identifying members who you may otherwise trust were it not for their history of posting rather hyperbolic statements 

That's a rationalization because masstagger provides none of that. 

You posted a series of subs that you consider 'wrongthink' and thought it APPROPRIATE to 'warn us' that we're *suffering* because we don't align with the dominant social narrative.

It's full-on dystopian behaviour. Stop it.

**Lastly**, the only thing you should be judging is the merit of my argument. 

Masstagger is tantamount to ad hominem. 

If you disagree with me, then say so and why. Don't hide behind accusations of wrongthink.

Stop working against democratic ideals.

>I've just said that you are both tagged by most bots, and that your history is more strange (than the other poster's) with regard to hyperbole & potentially pushing an agenda across other subreddits.

I request proof of ""hyperbole"" and how what I've said differentiates itself from others who have spoken on behalf of universal human rights.

Until then, that claim is foundless and you'd do yourself a favour by not repeating it.

Next, how am I ""pushing an agenda"" any more than any feminist poster? I'm a passionate humanist who advocates for what he believes.

It's editorialization, again, to say I'm ""pushing an agenda"". An agenda of equality? Sure, why not?

>It's odd that you would think this is somehow a problematic system

This is an obviously loaded question, I never said it was wrong either, just questionable that you feel the need to emphasize male rights when (rather objectively) global female rights are not on the same level. It's similar to the counter-argument against BLM saying ""all lives matter"", nobody is disagreeing that everyone has their personal rights, what it is saying is that we need to re-evaluate the prejudices/stereotypes placed on black people that have an ongoing negative impact on their livelihood.

It's strange you find this to be a personal attack on your freedom of speech, when I've said nothing to indicate I want to limit that - I've just said that you are both tagged by most bots, and that your history is more strange (than the other poster's) with regard to hyperbole & potentially pushing an agenda across other subreddits.

"There's a couple factors that I've considered. 
One: nature is 100% a priority for me. Manitoba is essentially one big lake and forest. Less tourism, lower population, endless quiet green space. 
Two: The coast is going to be underwater due to sea level rise, or the Big One. I'd rather not wait for that. The coast is certainly not safe. I lived on the island for a long time and thought about earthquakes almost every day. Of course, I know I'm mostly alone in that, and don't blame others for not wanting to think about it. 
Three: the housing prices and just general cost of living is basically half in the prairie provinces compared to BC.

If you're asking if the wildfire seasons are going to get better or worse, the answer is, without a shadow of a doubt, worse. Nelson is right In the middle of it all, but in reality, the whole province of BC is in for a world of hurt over the coming decades. It's not something anyone, including the government wants to admit or think about, hence why it will only get worse. The time to act has long passed. 
I myself plan on moving next Spring after a long glorious decade in BC. This summer was the final kicker to finally open my eyes to the full reality. I've seen the best of BC, I certainly don't want to see the worst.

"Wow, thanks for taking the time to check in. Honestly, I don't think I was prepared for this change, and yeah it will take a lot of people off guard. You'll probably see an odd mix of welcome relief and wariness is my guess. No one is gonna throw eggs at you but you might get a bit of side-eye.

Thinking in terms of basic fairness it would be hard for me to object. We just returned from a month in US -- a real culture shock, covid wise! -- visiting my ailing mom, attending two different weddings, etc.. we are all double vaccinated and we followed return protocols, including my under 12 daughter having to isolate for \*two\* weeks. We felt confident we weren't putting our neighbours at risk or we wouldn't have done it. 

That said, when we returned home we found out that a bunch of my in-laws, almost all of whom were fully vaccinated then went to another family celebration and all ended up with COVID. Delta is no joke. After almost zero cases, we are seeing a bit of an upward tick even here. So the (hypocritical) scientist in me still wants everyone to stay the fuck home. But that can't continue indefinitely.

"I mean... what's floating around might make a difference but exposure to a high concentration of particulate matter is really bad for you, whether it's coming from the forest, or elsewhere.

>Exposure to Smoke from Fires  
The smoke released by any type of fire (forest, brush, crop, structure, tires, waste or wood burning) is a mixture of particles and chemicals produced by incomplete burning of carbon-containing materials. All smoke contains carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and particulate matter (PM or soot). Smoke can contain many different chemicals, including aldehydes, acid gases, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, toluene, styrene, metals and dioxins. The type and amount of particles and chemicals in smoke varies depending on what is burning, how much oxygen is available, and the burn temperature.  
Exposure to high levels of smoke should be avoided. Individuals are advised to limit their physical exertion if exposure to high levels of smoke cannot be avoided. Individuals with cardiovascular or respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma), fetuses, infants, young children, and the elderly may be more vulnerable to the health effects of smoke exposure.  
Inhaling smoke for a short time can cause immediate (acute) effects. Smoke is irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat, and its odor may be nauseating. Studies have shown that some people exposed to heavy smoke have temporary changes in lung function, which makes breathing more difficult. Two of the major agents in smoke that can cause health effects are carbon monoxide gas and very small particles (fine particles, or PM2.5 ). These particles are two and one half (2.5) microns or less in size (25,400 microns equal an inch) and individual particles are too small to be seen with the naked eye.  
Inhaling carbon monoxide decreases the body's oxygen supply. This can cause headaches, reduce alertness, and aggravate a heart condition known as angina. Fine particles are able to travel deeply into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs. Inhaling fine particles can cause a variety of health effects, including respiratory irritation and shortness of breath, and can worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease. During increased physical exertion, cardiovascular effects can be worsened by exposure to carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Once exposure stops, symptoms from inhaling carbon monoxide or fine particles generally diminish, but may last for a couple of days.  
Avoiding smoky situations is the best way to avoid exposure. If your age or health status places you at greater risk from smoke exposure you should speak with your doctor about alternative steps you can take when encountering smoky situations. Anyone with persisting or frequent symptoms that they think are associated with smoke exposure should see their health care provider. Additional information on carbon monoxide and fine particles can be found at the web addresses listed at the end of this fact sheet.  
There is also the potential for chronic health effects from exposure to the components of smoke. Long term exposure to ambient air containing fine particles has been associated with increases in cardiovascular disease and mortality in populations living in areas with higher fine particulate air pollution. Frequent exposure to smoke for brief periods may also cause long-term health effects. Firefighters, who are exposed frequently to smoke, have been examined for long-term health effects (for example, cancer, lung disease, and cardiovascular disease) of repeated smoke exposures. The findings from these studies are not consistent or conclusive. Some studies show an increased frequency of these diseases among firefighters compared to similar male reference populations (e.g., male policemen, white males in the general population), while others do not.

"It's no secret that most doctors dislike cannabis. Some would no doubt find the prospect of treating THC induced psychosis daunting. Considering the current saturation of pro-cannabis fluff journalism heralding marijuana as medicine (in North America, not so much in Europe where its effects are better understood) Nelson is unfortunately just too far removed from reality to be a place most GPs would choose to reside. It would be a great place to study the link between cannabis and psychotic disorders. If a study were to get underway it would absolutely catch the interest of serious professionals. That would be the tact I would take. Don't try to attract fairweather doctors with the rosy facade, turn your pedestal into a carving board and appeal to their intellect. Studying the link between cannabis and psychotic disorders will become increasingly important as the prevalence of diseases like schizophrenia rise alongside the rise in drug use and potency (anticipating an 8-14 year lag between first use and onset).

"Well, honestly I don‚Äôt. 

But I have talked to some others who have travelled to other places over the last month or so, and they said that they where relatively welcomed due to the fact they rented an air Bnb, got delivery from local restaurants and grocers and obviously purchased lift tickets, they said majority of the people they talked to where happy to have the business. 

So, the reason for the question was to see what people locally feel about it, if there is any place or small local economy I would want to support during this it would be Nelson. Because I lived there for several years I have an understanding of how the local economy works there and I enjoy support my favourite business. 

The intent for the question was in no way malicious, nor do I intend to ignore any provincial guide lines. I do not plan on travelling any where any time soon.
But if the situation improves later in the season and it can be done in a safe manor. I would really enjoy riding at my favourite Mtn, and getting some food from some of my favourite restaurants.

"I left this year, and recall there being quite a bit of contention around the rental issue there from both locals and people trying to move there. Nelson itself is a small but highly sought-after place to live and for good reason - I'm happy where I am now but definitely miss certain aspects of living there. The surrounding communities might offer some options if you're okay with commuting, just think carefully about whether living rural is something you're up for, definitely takes effort. It is after all in a mountain range.

Be sure to check out the Facebook group (I think ""rent in Nelson"" or something like that, I'm not in it now), I found it more fruitful than Kijiji.

"Winter tires are legally required. RCMP were stopping people to check the other day on the Paulson (pass between Castlegar and Christina Lake). 

Before COVID, I drove between Nelson and Castlegar daily for work. 

It‚Äôs pretty flat and straight, other than the bluffs at Beasley just south of Nelson. 

I‚Äôve never had any traction issues, but I also run top-quality snow tires with an AWD vehicle. 

It‚Äôs occasionally slow because there are limited passing opportunities. Accidents are almost always because someone without good snow tires slid into someone else, or someone tried to pass and got sideways when their wheels hit that centre strip of snow.

And - if you‚Äôre the slow driver holding up a long line of vehicles behind, just pull over and let them go.

"Good quality winter tires (not all weather/season, IMHO). Use the engine to slow you down, gear down, or just take you foot off the gas pedal, try not to use heavy breaking as this increases the slip and slide factor. Try to apex a bit later on the turns and keep your distance from the car in front of you. Be careful through Thrums as the road can quickly ice over when the sun starts to set or the temperature drops. If you are sliding gently turn into the slide it will help you recover control quicker.

"I mean, compared to a big city, it couldn't get easier given how little traffic there is, how small the highways are etc.

When I did the test, I went up to baker st, took a left and drove to the end where it becomes a one-way street. From there, I took another left onto Vernon (ensuring I was in the very left-hand side of the one-way to make this turn) and then headed uphill, where I did a couple parking procedures.. i.e. make sure you know which direction to turn your wheel on an uphill vs. downhill street and don't forget to use your parking break.  Finally, we headed to Observatory st where you'll probably get onto the 'highway' for a minute, taking the turn-off back into Nelson or going towards the carpool/railtown turn-off.  Here, make sure you're not speeding. The speed limit doesn't increase, I believe it's 50.   Finally, if you end up in railtown on baker st heading towards town, at the four-way intersection, this is a two-lane intersection.. so if you're heading straight through from rail-town to downtown you should be on the right side next to people turning left to go straight through.

Just remember to relax. This is a small town, and your instructor will probably be very nice.

"Those are good questions. On the one hand, Vancouver Island and Vancouver will definitely be dealing with flooding within the next 10 years due to the rising ocean. Not to mention the ever looming threat of earthquake and tsunami. 
Nelson could continue getting lucky over the next 10 years or it could burn down next year... its impossible to know. The government offered each community funding to protect itself from fires after the terrible 2003 fire year. In 2017, it turned out that only a couple communities had taken up the offer and about 7% of high risk land had been fire-protected. Its not much better now. If something doesn't happen every year, we seem to forget about it and not worry. Human nature I guess. Keep getting lucky until we don't.

"Lots to explore if you're somewhat outdoorsy.

* Pulpit Rock: the most popular classic hike that leads to a really great lookout to get a sense of Nelson's geography. It's just across the lake, and a quick 5-10 minute drive. A little steep, but doable. Takes less than an hour to hike up there.
* Kayak / SUP: You can rent one from Lakeside Park if you want to explore the shoreline / around Nelson.  If you're feeling a tad adventurous and have a way to drive the gear back to Nelson, you could even paddle down stream to Taghum beach
* [Kokanee Old Growth Cedars](https://westkootenayhiking.ca/kokanee-old-growth-cedars/):  Beautiful forested trail 45\~ minutes from town
* Slocan lake + Bannock Point: 1.5hrs drive.. Stunning lake and place to spend the day or camp with a steep drop-off into the lake for cliff-jumping (of various heights.. 3-20ft)

"You basically have three choices:

* Backroads
* Torchlight
* Nelson Brewing Company

In terms of taste, they all offer something a little different, and have a fairly frequent rotation of new flavors.  As for experience, Backroads has the best location, often buzzing with a good vibe. Torchlight is a little further from Baker St, can sometimes be less busy, and feels more industrial.  It's a much larger space compared to Backroads. NBC, if it's open, is more of a tasting room.

"The Facebook group ""Nelson BC Canada Homes and Rooms for Rent"" might be your best bet. Rentals can  be pricey and goes quickly. I'd recommend checking the group often and maybe even make a post of your own seeking rental space. You can also start with renting a single room so you have a place to be and then slowly look for something more suitable like a studio. It easier to find a studio or 1bdrm in the spring or fall when it's the ""off season"". 

Oh! There is also ilovenelson.com for rentals. That's how I found my space 3 years ago. I find it's usually older folks that use that website, but it's definitely another good source of listings.

As for transit, I've never really taken transit as I do own a car ... It's definitely possible if you live in town to be without a car, you can totally walk everywhere (and you will have killer calves). But I'd say it would be a bit harder to have to commute in from outside of town everyday without a vehicle (but definitely still possible I think)!

Good luck out there and feel free to ask if you have any questions.

"As of right now, BC is moving foreward with it's reopening plan. The Covid cases have been steadily dropping for weeks and are mostly confined to known outbreaks. People are out and about, many businesses will likely reopen shortly and life COULD be ok for the next while. The issue lies in the nature of the virus, as it seems to sneakily pop up and do it's damage before anyone has time to react. This is a particular concern for Fall since it's prime time for a resurgence. So I think the attitude of BC is that currently things are going pretty well, but best to act on the side of caution. As for Selkirk, it's hard to tell what could happen. You could be all set to move out here, only to be told all the classes are cancelled again. If the Covid cases drop to pretty much nil, I'm sure it would be fine.
