"I don't get what you mean ""or a lifeguard station""? There's one every single block whether there's boardwalk or not.

Over the years I've stayed down in the 30s, right on the beach, nice big houses and an amazing view; but you have to drive to the boardwalk. I've also stayed around 10th right in the thick of the boardwalk but a block or two off the beach, more walking to the water but no need to touch your car all week, and you can go up to the boardwalk every day rather than it needing to be a special trip.  

Both are great, both have drawbacks.  I'd go for a lower number street if you like walking to shops, breakfast, the boards.  I'd go for a higher number street if you want to be able to see the water from your place, if you want more peace and quiet, or if you need an especially big place.

If you have kids it would be best to be near a lifeguard station. It can get super crowded around them, but I feel safer.  If you are near a station but not within their boundaries they will whistle at you and try to herd you over anyway.

I have always used air bnb or VRBO. I have nothing to compare it to but it just seems easier to cut out a middleman.

Well for starters you really won’t get beach front property that’s also on the boardwalk unless you target those streets (5th Thru 1st and 13th above) if you can find something between 5th and 1st I’d lock that in Bc it’s a mixture of both!

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"Oh cool! Okay- so obviously there’s the beach, boardwalk, and the like.  If you’re into nature stuff, there’s Forsythe nature reserve- basically you drive a loop and bird watch.  And there’s kayaking out of Windingriver Campground, like 30-40 minute drive from OC.  Then there’s shopping on Asbury Avenue, or high end shopping and antiquing in Cape May, which is like an hour drive if I recall correctly.  Though I think Cape May might be a bit conservative and not sure how lgbt friendly they are.  As for nightlife, there’s Atlantic City: most of the casinos have nightclubs and bars, but I’m not really a nightlife kind of person, so I don’t know any that are lgbt friendly.

"If you like pinball, Jilly's arcade has a really great set of machines that are well maintained. Besides the pinball there are a number of old and new video games. It's not full of claw machines and other money-sucking ticket machines like you see in other tourist destinations. If you are at all remotely interested in old school arcades, it's a must see. (plus you are surely going to walk by it on 12th and the boardwalk at some point!)

Shopping on Asbury Ave downtown (12th to 7th streets) is nice if you like to walk and window shop. That area has a small town feel with lots of little independent shops and restaurants. Really quite nice in the afternoon if you aren't hard core beach sitters.  Things off the boardwalk do close early though, so take that into account.

My favorite ice cream is at Hobby Horse on Ocean and 8th.  Highly recommend the waffle sunday there. The prices are a little high (though really all the ice cream near the boardwalk is set for vacation pricing) but the portions are large and their hard ice cream is high quality. 

3 Brothers Pizza (10th and Boardwalk) if our family's go-to pizza out of the dozen plus choices on the boardwalk. This is one of those ""huge pizza slices"" places. If your kids are the right age and haven't seen a truly giant pizza before, it will be a memorable meal for them. If you order a whole pie rather than slices, they will sometimes cut it into 16 slices - which makes sense from a serving standpoint - but you can ask for them to cut it into 8 so you can get the full experience. 

Lots of good coffee and donut places. I like Drip n' Scoop on Asbury at 10th street. It's not worth a special trip, but if you are walking by stop in to see the donut selection.  Prices are good compared to getting coffee at Starbucks and a delux donut will be cheaper than deserts other places.  

Another commenter talked down the amusement rides. Not entirely wrong, but if your kids are under 16, I don't think they will know or care.  The two parks are geared more towards the younger folk. A few decent/large carnival type rides for teens/adults thrown in. I always preferred Castaway Cove because Playland had more rides for little kids but that may have changed. 

At either amusement park, the tickets get a lot cheaper if you buy in bulk. I would recommend taking a look around to see what you want to ride and adding up the tickets needed before buying any. I don't remember the exact numbers, but I think if you buy the biggest pack the price per ticket is half the cost of a single ticket. (all rides are 3-10 tickets depending on the size of the ride)  If you have little kids that aren't big enough to ride alone, don't offer to give ride tickets for the accompanying adult. I don't know if it is the official policy, or if it has changed over the years, but when my kids were little I never had to pay to ride along with them on the kiddie rides. 

No fine dining or beer/wine in Ocean City NJ. Not even BYOB. A number of choices for both in Somers Point right over the bridge. It really is a 'family resort' so I don't have a lot of suggestions for things you would want to do and the kids won't enjoy.  If you like Vietnamese/Asian food and are looking for other than Italian takeout in OC, try Fusion Plate on Asbury near 10th.  

Some people like to rent bikes and multi-person surreys to ride on the boardwalk in the morning. I think you have to return them by noon. Really not my thing, but people do it. 

In the evening there are historically street performers on the boardwalk every block or so. Not sure if they will allow it this year. Mostly local young folk but there are always a few really memorable acts. For example, one middle school aged kid I remember would take requests to recite historical speeches off a list of 10-12 choices. On the one hand, not really great entertainment in absolute terms, but on the other hand where have you seen something like that before?

Just read back and you mentioned safety tips. I really can't imagine anywhere being generally unsafe in OC. Obviously use good judgement - don't get into vans with strangers or anything crazy of course - but I've never felt uncomfortable or known anyone to get into real trouble.  You will see some groups of teens on the Boardwalk and Beach at night. They will be loud- but everything on the boardwalk is loud so you can't blame them too much. It sounds cliché, but they generally are good local kids just hanging around with their friends and not looking for trouble. Police are present on the boardwalk. Not overwhelming presence. The foot/bike officers really do try to be friendly city ambassadors rather than hard-asses. They are around where the crowds are so if you are worried about safety that may ease your mind.",t2_3rs9m2l1,Sharp_Revolution,0,1620095412.0,0,t1_gwv0ia6,gwv0ia6,True,lego_vader,t3_n48x04,https://www.reddit.com/r/OceanCityNewJersey/comments/n48x04/visiting_for_a_2_nights_before_july_4th_not/,"Visiting for a 2 nights before July 4th (not staying for it, too expensive)",/r/OceanCityNewJersey/comments/n48x04/visiting_for_a_2_nights_before_july_4th_not/gwv0ia6/,6,r/OceanCityNewJersey,0,6
"You can't get alcohol in the actual town – helps with the family vibe. There is a really big liquor/wine/beer store on Roosevelt Boulevard coming onto the island from the south side. That should do you fine.

I would say the classic shore stuff would be to get pizza from Manco & Manco (crowded and a touch overpriced but good pies), ice cream/frozen custard/water ice, and some candy from a place like Shriver's. There are some fun arcade/amusement type things on the boardwalk that you could do. Sometimes they have music or other events on the boardwalk on weekends but I'm not sure exactly what they're doing re covid. There are some fun shops in downtown OC, on Asbury from like 14th to 6th.

As far as where to stay, you should absolutely spring for a weekend condo/apartment rental with that many people. Most places have 2 or 3 bedrooms and could easily accommodate two couples and two kids. That might be a little more expensive but it makes for such an improved experience. I have family that has a property in OC now, but 20-ish years ago when I was a kid and my family either did motels or day trips it sucked. Granted I'm not a beach bum type so that influences it.

"Great bagels: hot bagels and more (sold at yiannis) and deadend

Great pizza: Piccinnis, Marios, carluccios (in northfield but totally worth, I recommend grandmas pie or bruschetta. My favorite pizza around by far) 
If you ask me mancos is overrated, it’s very thin and overpriced. 

Bonus: I would recommend going to Dots pastry and get a cream donut and nauti donuts has good custom donuts. 

Good cheap restaurants: yiannis, surf cafe, Sack O’ subs

Good semi-expensive restaurants: Jon and patty’s, dockside, sunrise, varasity inn, hooked on breakfast

As you can see, this post by /u/historylover714 is [identical to the posts by another scammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/menlopark/comments/ls8wfr/genealogist_i_will_discover_your_california/) named /u/pink_suitcase before they were added to the [Reddit Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php) and has been banned permanently from dozens and dozens of subreddits. 

This scammer also creates [fly-by-night websites](https://www.heritagehuntersgenealogy.com/) that they link to for you to give them personally identifiable information and payment details. Stay away from www.heritagehuntersgenealogy.com or whatever else it ends up getting changed to in the future.

So many [scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/lq3fec/ancestral_origins_map_anyone_interested_in_an/gohe8c3/), so little time!

"We only get down about once a year, so these answers may be incorrect, BUT:

I used to go to that same section of the Surf Mall looking for new and vintage Star Wars toys. Those don't seem to be the focus of the toy section anymore, but I do remember seeing sports cards there. 

But as far as my very hazy 2019 memories of the store go, the toy section is much more modern and has a wider range of contemporary toys in stock. I think I remember some sports cards, but I believe the card sections was mostly gaming (Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Pokémon) focused. 

I think the antique store you're thinking of is Only Yesterday. I'm pretty sure they were on the boardwalk up until 2018 or 2019. But while they closed their boardwalk location, they have a store on Asbury - https://onlyyesterdayoceancity.wordpress.com/

"As a cyclist in Ocean City this drives me nuts. Drivers are part of the problem when they wave people on their bikes across as though they're pedestrians so they get used to it. The logical inconsistency is clearest when I'm cruising down Central on my bike at 25 mph and the car going the opposite way stops and waves some bikes across - why would I be yielding to other bikes? They're traffic and they have to wait for me to pass.

It's a combination of people riding bikes in traffic who never do it anywhere other than the shore and drivers who are overly cautious about NJ pedestrian crossing laws. It's the blind leading the blind and it's going to get someone killed. Two people on bikes nearly rode right out in front of me crossing West the other day because they thought I would just slam on the brakes for them.

"Right before summer started it was clear that that anti-maskers in our neighborhood Facebook groups were viewing the shore as the last refuge of freedom. Little surprise that they are overrun with anti-maskers. But what amazes me is the cops not doing anything about it considering on multiple occasions I have had them stop and demand that girls in our group put on shoes they are carrying after we left the beach and were walking on the board walk -- happened to my girlfriend 30 years ago and my wife just a few years ago.

We usually go to OCNJ every summer but given that a normal week down there really is usually pretty crowded -- eating places are usually packed, walking the boards at night is a mob, shops are small and packed with stuff. Even with masking it didn't really seem like it was worth going down to sit in a house, get take out, and try to find an uncrowded beach.

Also I used to live in New York City in Manhattan in Greenwich Village (New York City had the Coronavirus situation very bad near the beginning) where I was born, and I lived in for almost the first whole 28 years of my life until I had to move with my Mom, and my Pops to Brighton, New York in the Rochester, New York area on December 30, 2015 as my Pops was sick, and dying, and he was born in Rochester, New York, and he had family members who were born in, who lived in, and who live in Rochester, New York, and the Rochester, New York area, and the actual city of Rochester, New York is less than a mile away from my house (from my apartment building) when going in 2 different directions from my house, and even though I really live in Brighton, New York the mailing address is Rochester, New York actually.

"Of course, it all depends on how much you finance and where you buy. As an example, beach front on Central Ave. on the south end of the island is approximately $1m more than the opposite side of the street. My first floor condo on Central (not beach front) would typically command about $3k / week during the season. One street over - towards the bay (Asbury) is considerably cheaper than Central. 

I suggest you look at costs for rentals (Fox, Berger, etc.) and sell prices on Zillow which would help you understand the market. 

Also should you look to buy, be sure you understand NJ’s “mansion tax” which is another 1% that you’ll need to pay at statelet for any home $1m or over.",t2_13wigt,jhj-pmp,0,1593893470.0,0,t1_fwxnlo4,fwxnlo4,False,Fletch71011,t3_hkssgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/OceanCityNewJersey/comments/hkssgo/property_as_an_investment_in_ocnj/,Property as an investment in OCNJ,/r/OceanCityNewJersey/comments/hkssgo/property_as_an_investment_in_ocnj/fwxnlo4/,1,r/OceanCityNewJersey,0,1

"There’s also a farmer’s market on the Tabernacle grounds (on Asbury bet5th and 6th) every Wednesday morning in the summer. Randall’s seafood from Pleasantville is there with scallops, clams and whatever catch of the day they have available. I get stuff from there almost every week and   It is always amazingly fresh. Get there early because the line gets long and they can sell out. Also, you mentioned cheap. Most really fresh local seafood isn’t what I would call “cheap” anymore. You definitely get what you pay for. Also keep an eye out for the Somers Point or Marmora Shoprite ads. They have a pretty decent seafood selection and occasionally run a $5.99/lb lobster special. They’ll even steam them for you at no charge.",t2_m0bvnlr,dogdaze57,0,1565124446.0,0,t1_ew51dl5,ew51dl5,True,whitestlung,t3_cme5ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/OceanCityNewJersey/comments/cme5ou/seafood/,Seafood?,/r/OceanCityNewJersey/comments/cme5ou/seafood/ew51dl5/,1,r/OceanCityNewJersey,0,1

"Clams, crabs or fish to cook yourself  try Woodburns in Somers Point. On Rt 9 south of Somers Point Mays Landing Rd ( on the left before the southbound Parkway entrance.
