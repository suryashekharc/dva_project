This is because those in the city want to get around to the city specifically. These routes are not necessarily on the state's radar, or the city would need to petition it. Cities running their own transit is extremely common because they don't need to lobby state interests for local needs.

"Nothing that Fulop has done is unique to him. None of the “growth” people here are lauding is even remotely tied to anything that you can say is uniquely his. Any politician elected by the machine would do basically the same. He operates within the confines of the box he chooses to stay within to reach his political ambitions of statewide office. Just because he’s not a craven social conservative like Sweeney doesn’t mean that he’s not fundamentally an economic conservative; given that he used to work for Goldman and is a multi-millionaire, that’s not a surprise.

70% of the vote in a 15% turnout election means that about 10% of eligible voters support the guy, wow such mandate, so democracy.

He has all the power in the city to do what he wants and has basically done nothing with it. He has engineered a veto-proof supermajority in the council, could pass any law his heart desires, but does bubkis. “Progress” for Fulop is performance, a smokescreen for his economic conservatism.

Fulop is the type of egocentric machine politician that throws you table scraps and demands that you thank him for it. Those that are praising him here attempt to paint the critiques as being hysterical, or out of touch, but that’s because they’re content with the status quo. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of people in JC are apathetic and turned off from local politics, and that’s by design.",t2_8z8a0xbi,6438eke,0,1648266541.0,0,t1_i25k80j,i25k80j,True,nj2tx,t3_tntsor,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/tntsor/opinions_on_fulop/,Opinions on Fulop,/r/jerseycity/comments/tntsor/opinions_on_fulop/i25k80j/,1,r/jerseycity,0,1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen,\_New\_Netherland

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsimus)

\>Once the area was ceded to the British after the surrender of Fort Amsterdam, New York claimed ownership to the high waterline along the west bank of the Hudson River and that any pier built there was under its jurisdiction, thus stifling development which would compete with the burgeoning New York City.

"Jésus, Maria y José! Read my previous posts on my Reddit profile. I’m a pro-public transit guy but you have to understand logistics, start up costs, operating costs, maintenance, salaries, and administrative fees. This is no small feat. 

You yourself just said that there were once private buses that couldn’t make money hence they stopped operation. NJTransit still provides low-cost bus service across the county and beyond. And, believe it or not, they do still subcontract with private companies that operate certain routes on behalf of the agency. You want more service? Show them the demand. They conduct ridership feasibility and impact studies. 

Jersey City should NOT be building its own bus network. This would be a logistical and financial nightmare for the city. As much as we all like to bitch and moan about NJTransit it has certain efficiencies in coordinating transit across broad areas that NJ’s myriad of municipalities simply do not posses.

"I totally don't get that place.  It's not even an automat.  The whole point of an automat is you don't have to order or plan in advance, it's just a wall acting as a vending machine for hot/cold fast food. Drop in some coins, take your food and go.

If you had to place an order to use a vending machine and food was made to order, you wouldn't call it a vending machine.

I think automats are actually kinda cool and could totally do well here.

I see my coworkers pretty regularly wanting to see who wants to go in on food because nobody wants a whole order, but they want something.

If I were McDonalds, Chic-fil-A, etc. I'd be playing with traditional automats in part of the place for urban locations that don't have drive throughs. Just insert your credit card and pull what you want from the tiny door on the wall.  No line, no wait.  Super quick and you're out the door with your item(s).

It's pretty nice for impulse cravings/snacks.  Sometimes you don't want a sit down meal.  just want something to snack on for a minute or two and move on with your shopping, work or whatever you were doing.

That place is a prime location too between the mall and transit.

"Long term resident perspective (been here since early 90's) My main issue is that he essentially ignores the people who were living here and only caters to the new people coming here for that quick commute luxury life.   I have seen zero evidence of him trying to help any of the long term residents struggling with rent increases or being bought out due to big loft buildings needing to be constructed.   He shows up downtown to do public events, or tries to act like he cares about ""everyone"" but I'm pretty sure he doesn't give two shits about anyone who isn't making 100K+.  I only ever see posters about him making appearances at community events if they are downtown in the fancy 'hood, or have some other luxury-lean like a new loft building in one of the actively gentrifying areas. 

SO yeah, ✨LUXURY✨ isn't doing much for me personally.  I don't begrudge anyone their choice to waste huge sums of money to live in a building that has a gym they'll never use... but I'd like to spend a more appropriate amount, personally, and that's getting hard when every single opportunity to tear down half a block worth of older construction and put up yet another ""luxury"" building results in skyrocketing rents.

"He’s popular IRL with people who vote. Many people on here like him but don’t want to argue with the several people who are very anti fulop. 

IMO he does a good job. I wish the schools would be funded by some city money instead of increasing the police budget when they could just make bank doing actual parking enforcement. But I tend to like the big projects that I think advance the city forward. 

People who grew up here don’t want the city to change and become more expensive, and feel the big projects and developments accelerate gentrification which might be true.

The city is buying military equipment for the police right now, as most of the cities schools do not have clean drinking water.

"Fulop is ok, used to be better, but now we can definitely do better. I don't want some pie in the sky progressive but I think we need a council that can stand up to Fulop, and a well-funded candidate to challenge him going forward.

Compared to previous mayors, he is good, but that is a really low bar. So people using that argument is pretty terrible.

Also, about winning with 70% of the vote. Terrible argument. There are shitty presidents and politicians that have been re-elected with a high percentage of the vote many times. Means nothing. Incumbents with a big name and the money and the machine, and nobody with money to oppose them, that's what happens. it's super common.

When I first moved here I really did like him. He is socially progressive, and still is, which I like. On such things as weed, bike infrastructure, social issues, he is great.

As far as the big economic expansion, people giving credit to Fulop for that are also being misleading. JC rose as NYC rose up and became a wonderful center of the world again - the city that you had to be in again. Jersey City came up when the city came up and people started to become more priced out - having 24/7 train access and probably the most convenient mass transit options into Manhattan - I mean straight to FiDI plus to midtown - from NJ made it the logical next place to explode in population. Lets put things into context.

No he did not get in the way, and did some good things to help it along, so give him credit for that - but at some point he became too intertwined with big developers and caring mostly about the most well off areas and just giving the developers too much leeway. Also a lot of the stuff being built is creating these soulless neighborhoods. Is Journal Square going to be another bedroom community like Newport that provides nothing for the locals? Just people to get on trains? Where is the assistance to help bring character and mom and pops to these areas?

Does he do stuff for other wards. Sure. But a lot of the time it is half-assed, like Via. Some are good too. I just don't think it's enough anymore. Stuff like the Central Ave redevelopment was the baby of Councilman Yun, who passed. At some point I think Fulop lost his way a bit.

I mean the fact a developer that is massive in JC is doing his renovations in Rhode Island just stinks to high hell.

That all being said it's not like Fulop is anywhere close to the machine politics scumbag levels of say Menendez or Sweeney where they've been around for such a longwhile to have such different views and philosophies from his various tenures that there's just been general acceptance of him being a useful veteran because gotta tow party line and all that. 

Part of me personally wanted to see Holt Jr take Lautenberg's seat and see if Booker would challenge Menendez's seat when it was up just to see Booker actively debate Menendez.

"General opinion is he has typical problems but otherwise he has no glaring, throw him out of office, issues. Some will say he does nothing outside of downtown but thats abjectly not true (e.g. Via, Sci Tech City). He definitely cuts deals with some developers, so it'd be daft to say he's corruption free. But he is far from even the standard problematic politician a lot of cities get. He isn't a saint either. But regardless of your position JC has changed a lot and grown under his terms. Facts wise the city is just better than it was 15 years ago (crime, scenery, life), though it still has lots of improvements needed, and despite what I just said I do think he could vocally do more for not downtown/jsq. He has done stuff just more could be done. We have a bigger city budget than people think. For example its odd a city the size of JC doesn't have a dedicated bus system. Anyway.

I'm sure the people on this sub who despise him have honest reasons to do so, but they're a pretty clear minority. Dude just got re-elected with something like 70% of the vote.

"....”Paycheck Protection Program relief
In April 2020, Shake Shack applied for funding through the Paycheck Protection Program due to lost business during the COVID-19 pandemic. It received $10 million.[46] Shake Shack was criticised for utilizing a loophole in the program which allowed it to qualify for monetary aid meant to help small businesses. The company operates 189 locations in the U.S., but only employs around 45 persons at each restaurant.[47] Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti then said it would return the $10 million so that ""restaurants who need it most can get it now.""[48] In July, it was revealed that Shack Shake founder Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group took a total of between $11 and $27 million in PPP funding. Meyer was unapologetic about receiving the relief funds, despite the fact that the firm employs a total of 2,300 employees. When the Shake Shack relief funding was revealed, he had earlier appeared on at least one podcast stating that its acceptance of PPP funding was irresponsible.[49]”.....",t2_32peh,jerseycityfrankie,0,1648215394.0,0,t1_i22ae6v,i22ae6v,True,L0v3_1s_War,t3_tnbssa,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/tnbssa/shake_shack_opening_in_newport_centre_soon/,Shake Shack opening in Newport Centre soon,/r/jerseycity/comments/tnbssa/shake_shack_opening_in_newport_centre_soon/i22ae6v/,2,r/jerseycity,0,2

"I've gotta come clean; this post was written purely to provoke my husband during a marital dispute. We had an argument.

Once the responses came in (which frankly, I was a little surprised by) maaaaaybe a small part of my brain thought ""well shit, maybe I really *can* have a goat in the backyard, wouldn't that be cool.""

Downtown is the first place most people see when they come to the city, every municipality focuses on specific neighborhoods strategically but it benefits the city as a whole. Whether it be a waterfront, a downtown area, and area around a large green space. This trickles into the surrounding community, there has been investment in all other areas of the city since I moved here. When I moved here I only knew about the downtown area but due to the investment into the city as a whole and the impact it has in all neighborhoods I'm looking to check out other areas when my lease is up.

The RI thing is just stupid fodder for people who dislike him to complain about. His complaint isn't even about the public beach, it's people walking and parking on his property to access the beach. People who don't know anything about home ownership don't understand the legal issues you open yourself up to when people access your property. If the town wants him to allow access to the beach through his property they need to pay him and provide a legal easement that absolves him of any liability issues, otherwise he absolutely has the right to block access.",t2_anstk,jwuer,1,1648210359.0,0,t1_i220gla,i220gla,False,DuDUHAST1,t3_tmz0g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/tmz0g9/come_meet_your_master/,Come meet your master.,/r/jerseycity/comments/tmz0g9/come_meet_your_master/i220gla/,1,r/jerseycity,0,1

"My point is that it's unusual for any business to receive so much negative attention consistently for years on end. The OP's post is doing exactly what you're suggesting, which is to not give them business if you don't agree with his business methods.  
That one video aside, what do you make of his many yelp responses to criticism over all these years?  It appears as if he's the one trying to ""win"" any arguments to be had, even if they're not necessarily arguments to begin w, and his responses are far from professional or mature for a grown man.  There are many either only 5 star or 1 star reviews over the years, with some rude, some straight up trolling responses to negative reviews, which is telling.   Every customer deserves to be heard, about both bad/good/neutral experiences, as do business owners but there are better ways for a productive conversation or solution to be had.

"The only time I ate CFA was when they opened and were giving food away to promote themselves. The sandwich was not great and the fries were really bad.

If their politics weren't trash, I'd consider eating there again, but with that as a factor, and the fact that I can walk across the food court and get something slightly different, but better at Popeyes, they'll literally never get a cent from me again.

If you actually read all the articles you will figure it out. 24 mil refers ONLY on construction that is estimated at over double that. 
In addition he believes he ONLY will have to pay 6mill to Pompidou(for five years which means 30mil and then they will have to relicense and have a new agreement  or Pompidou can pull off and we will be stuck with the museum and no art!) the 6mil is  for the rights(ONLY THE LICENSING COST) and all the rest of the cost ie employees maintenance lights, more operating expenses  etc etc he believes will be covered by the visitors paying tickets. 

But wait for the kicker in addition to all the above he said in the press conference announcement that JC residents won’t pay for a ticket 🤣 so he thinks he will operate or at least he wants us to believe that people will come all the way from Manhattan with the best museums in the world to see the Pompidou and we will have enough visitors to cover the expenses.

Q:Why is there zero traffic enforcement in your city?

F:The police force is understaffed.

Q: No really, I've heard this for decades every time there's any complaint about policing. Our force is not understaffed compared to similar sized urban cities. Every other city in the country tickets people and makes it pay for not just the PD but other stuff. Same for parking. We all watch parking agents drive right by illegally parked cars.

F: The Parking Dept is understaffed.

Q: Why don't you hire more agents to produce more revenue?

F: we don't have the budget for that.

And, the county and municipal levies will definitely see increases in the years to come.

Tossed at the end of the article, it is plainly stated: our current levy per student after this increase is still 25% short of the calculated local fair share amount.

Tungsten rings don't come in half sizes, and they're not adjustable. Both of us are half sizes.

"Tourists and visitors are understandably confused by PATH, don't sweat it.  Mostly they are confused that there is ANOTHER subway system totally different from the famous NYC one.  (I once dropped off a friend at 23rd St and 6th Ave, told him to take the train back to NJ, he ended up in Brooklyn on the F because he entered the first subway station he saw, not the second secret one underneath it.)

Once you figure that out, there are TWO ways to pay for PATH and each method has TWO forms.  But both are easy to use once you figure it out:

\- Bay a yellow Metrocard from a machine either in NJ or NY (including machines in the NYC subway).  Put cash on it, use it to ride PATH and NYC subway.  Note that you can also buy unlimited Metrocards, but those will only work on the NYC subway and NOT ON THE PATH.  Not on AirTrains either for that matter.  Only cash-loaded Metrocards work on PATH and AirTrains.  This can be very confusing.

\- Buy a SmartLink card from a different machine, found only at PATH stations.  This sells two kinds of SmartLink  - cards that are trip based and loaded with 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, and 40-trips OR cards that are unlimited for 1, 7, or 30-days.  Unlimited is probably not necessary unless you really think you will be going back and forth a LOT -- you need to ride PATH four times in one day to make the one-day unlimited pass worthwhile.

&#x200B;

It used to be that the easiest thing to do was buy a Metrocard, load it with cash, then use as needed on PATH and NYC subway.  But since NYC subway now takes your credit card (just tap) it makes it more viable to get a Smartlink and not have to do all that math to figure out how much cash you really need.",t2_9g10fjac,Public_Minute_805,0,1648144685.0,0,t1_i1yjn51,i1yjn51,True,Localzen,t3_tmidgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/tmidgs/going_to_staying_in_nj_and_intimidatedconfused_by/,Going to staying in NJ and intimidated/confused by how to get a path train pass,/r/jerseycity/comments/tmidgs/going_to_staying_in_nj_and_intimidatedconfused_by/i1yjn51/,9,r/jerseycity,0,9
