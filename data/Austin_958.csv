"Right? My first thought went to the Hare Krishna temple and the very distinctive Sri Venkateswara. They're not there for nothing; there is a strong population of Indian and Indian-American families. Level of traditionalism varies, as it does for the Russian (""White"" to some, which glosses over a lot of distinction just over skin color), Jewish (see my previous comment), and Pakistani families around the general area as well. Latino families- mostly Mexican from experience, so very little Cuban or Puerto Rican presence- are concentrated in the Southwest side of Cedar Park but found throughout the area. What the area isnt is, by and large, African/Caribbean-American, but I think for that we can blame the history of the West/East Austin divide (forced) than we can any modern reasons against.

I'm too new to the Austin area in general to know *exactly* where the divide between Cedar Park's ""true"" border and North Austin's end, or how much a difference there is between Cedar Park and Leander for instance (beyond the obvious city lines), but this is my general feel going through the area and working there off and on. I have a lot of appreciation for the diversity, though I don't know how much a recent change this is for ""OG"" locals or where the ""real"" Cedar Park is to them as opposed to new folks.

"**[5-over-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-over-1)** 
 
 >5-over-1, also known as a one-plus-five, or a podium building, is a type of multi-family residential building commonly found in urban areas of North America. The mid-rise buildings are normally constructed with four or five wood-frame stories above a concrete podium (usually for retail or resident amenity space). The name derives from the maximum permissible five floors of combustible construction (Type III or Type V) over a fire resistive Type I podium of one floor for ""5-over-1"" or two floors for ""5-over-2"", as defined in the United States-based International Building Code (IBC) Section 510. 2.

"I think you're reading the map wrong.

The dark green bubble is highlighting existing SFH that trigger height restrictions of nearby VMU's. No zoning changes are happening in the dark green.

Seems very reasonable to me, I don't think 90' building should go directly against SFH. Compatibility rules make the transition more gradual, but still allowing tall VMU when appropriate.

"There's currently a few VMU/zoning issues in Zilker that I can think of. Generally developers are trying to expand on the existing neighborhood created VMU plan, which the neighborhood opposes.

IMO the neighborhood plan is decent, basically all of Lamar is VMU or MU5A with 60' limits along most of it. I think 60' is good for transition into low rise apartments or R4, but there could be a lot more R4 (missing middle) off of Lamar. Brodie Oaks will probably be good for the area too.

The current issues are:

* Raising the height limit from the existing 60' to 80' on the Gourdough's lot
* The old apartments on Sterzing and Toomey height increase to 90' (not VMU)
* The massive Brodie Oaks development (not technically Zilker but close)

"You're failing to understand the most important part here. Housing in Austin has gone up ~45% in just over a year. Yes, every city has seen major increases in housing costs, but not like Austin.

Of course there are other places where it's more expensive, literally nobody has claimed otherwise. But have those cities seen the relative increase that Austin has? No. 

I own an extremely nice home in one of the most desirable suburbs in the city limits, but I'm not blind to the struggles of others or how these recent changes have negatively impacted people. You're childless and live with a roommate, not everyone is as fortunate as you. Some people have children, some people live with and take care of an elderly relative, and some people have issues that don't give them the option of living with a roommate. 

I went from making 40k/year in 2013 in Austin to now being in the top 2% of earners in the US, and I worked hard for it, but I'm not going to pretend that I'm in my current position only because I worked hard. Anyone at my pay level that is honest with themselves can admit that there is a ton of luck involved in making it to this level of pay and being able to afford what used to be a lifestyle that was affordable while working any run of the mill office job in this city. The answer isn't as simple as ""grind"" for an extremely large number of people.

"Aubrey Marcus is heir to the Fleshlight fortune and began his well funded path of entrepreneuralism selling 'day after ecstasy' supplements at cheap raves in the early 2000s under the shamelessly and intrinsically ecstasy-referencing brand name 'Onnit.'

Onnit, among a couple other brands owned by Marcus, became one the earliest mainstream nootropic stacks - peddled to the top by up and coming podcaster Joe Rogan.


now Marcus owns multiple national brands for supplements, high end gyms, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu studios, yoga studios (Black Swan Yoga), and hosted Rogan's move to Austin.

"I had a friend who worked on Wallstreet after a top business school. He hated it. Not the work, it was fine. Not the people, they were some of the best friends he had made  in his whole life. He hated waking up early. Anyways, he left and started doing freelance finance based on his connections. He never owned a car, and stopped by a hertz every Monday to swap out what he was driving. He stayed in mid-tier hotels 100% of the time.

As a freelance guy, he met a man that had sold his business a few years earlier and walked away with 1.5 billion dollars. This guy wanted to buy a hotel in Uruguay, and needed strategies on how to do that. What assets to sell, when, etc. My buddy helped him with it, and built a friendship with him. He later helped him with personal finance. Here is how that worked: most of the assets this guy owned were in Muni bonds. Tax free fixed income to fund things like cities building tunnels or bike lanes. The return was about 4% annually, but tax free. That's a return of roughly $60 million per year. They budgeted a burn rate of $20MM per year; that means $20 million could be spent every year.

I said to my friend, ""well that's a lot, but I could see how you could easily spend that much buying a mansion and  art etc."" He said ""No, that's not burn, he will resell all those for much more.

"When did OP say people “should” get displaced from their homes? Y’all get so upset when someone so much as acknowledges a harsh reality as if they are cheering it on. People on this sub have adopted this silly notion that all we have to do is add more condos and MFH and suddenly housing costs would drop back down to 300k median. Even if we fixed every zoning issue, vacancy law, and corrected sluggish housing production, we would continue to see accelerating costs of living. 

Fixing those problems would help, but the new development in Austin is going to lead to more and more people competing for finite space. People *are* going to get displaced because we live in a country (not just a city) where costs continually outpace wage growth.

"For some of last year and again lately I've been having to commute from north Austin to just outside San Marcos. A friend once told me that on the freeways around here, the right lane is the fast lane, the center lane is for passing, and the left lane is for violence, and I couldn't have said it better. That stretch of 35 thrums with bloodlust. Every time I commute I lose two hours out of my day and two days off my lifespan. Pollyannaish optimists and profoundly disingenuous capitalists will say that a commute is actually a good thing because it gives you time to reflect and compose yourself before and after your day, but the only thing reflecting during my drive is the actinic high beam glare of the psychopathic cannibal in the dented Altima three and a half inches off my bumper in my rearview mirror.",t2_2jatqmr8,hiimneato,0,1648267527.0,0,t1_i25lyac,i25lyac,False,theenukeface,t3_tnzhxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/tnzhxk/texas_realtors_say_everyone_wants_to_be_in/,Texas realtors say 'everyone wants to be in Pflugerville and Round Rock',/r/Austin/comments/tnzhxk/texas_realtors_say_everyone_wants_to_be_in/i25lyac/,2,r/Austin,0,2

"I'm from the NY side about an hour from Ottawa. Now I'm an hour north of Austin.

Honestly....I miss the northern border and I'd trade TX for Canada in a heartbeat.  I have a lengthy list, and, no, before someone says ""just move then!"",  we can't afford to move. 😔  

Austin is my saving grace for being here. It's far more culturally diverse than many of the places I've been, but cost of living is insane.

Thank the gods for air conditioning! 😜 Seriously, don't move here between May and October. 🤣 I came to TX at the end of July, and I thought I was gonna die! 

Things I don't like:  Politics. A huge swathe of TX is everything wrong with TX. They claim to want small government, but I've never seen a more restrictive government. ""I got mine and the hell with the rest of you"" is common in my area. I also see a lot of xenophobia.  A week after the 2020 election I was blessed with Patriot Front propaganda in the front of my shop. 😒

Plus side:  Tacos....and there is so much incredible food here. Add in....the most stunning wildflowers I've ever seen, 7 days of ""real"" winter, and HEB is the most incredible place on the planet. Also...more air conditioning. 🤭

This link is to a map of proposed major transit corridors and the Vertical Use Overlay surrounding areas that would be subject to the increased development.

It shows some major streets in Central Austin, but I would also like to point out some absurdities that are placed solely to benefit certain developers who don't even live in Austin.

For example: The intersection of 45th Street and Duval is declared to be a major transit corridor. Not Duval Street, nor 45th Street, but only the 20 feet or so of roadway where they intersect. It's clearly absurd to consider this in isolation to be some kind of major transit area. That declaration will however trigger a circle of VMU overlay district subject to height requirements 30 feet higher than any existing structures, less parking than units, and no setbacks. The development is not restricted to 45th or Duval, but would happen on little residential streets like Barrow Avenue and Avenue H. If you follow the chain of property ownership around that intersection you will find layers of LLC corporations, shell companies, and finally the actual owners which is primarily a family who lives in Bee Cave outside of Austin. Another property is owned by the ghost of a Westlake resident who according to her obituary died in 2018.",t2_jsfdhjc,TigerPoppy,0,1648259531.0,0,t1_i2570bg,i2570bg,False,TigerPoppy,t3_toc47k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/toc47k/vmu_vertical_mixed_use_ordinance_returns_to_city/,VMU - Vertical Mixed Use ordinance returns to city council docket,/r/Austin/comments/toc47k/vmu_vertical_mixed_use_ordinance_returns_to_city/i2570bg/,11,r/Austin,0,11

"Your comment lacks perspective. Austin has for several years had the fastest growing cost of living price increases in the nation. I would suggest you try to consider how this might affect people other than yourself. For example:

Elderly and retired people, and other people on fixed incomes who need to be near medical services but struggle with cost of living increases.

Teachers, nurses, social workers who are expected to move further and further out into the exurbs and face longer and longer commutes. Their salaries generally don't go up if an area gets trendier. 

Families who shouldn't be forced to uproot their children's lives during a critical stage just because a city wants to maintain an outdated housing policy from the 1980s. 

You're framing this as if you're the only one who's not lazy, which is kind of ironic since it seems like you're arguing that people should be lazy and apathetic about updating our housing policy to allow more sensibly priced housing options to get built. 

The truth is, people in Austin are working hard af. The unemployment rate is under 3%. The problem is, people aren't seeing much if any material gains in their quality of life because the rent is going up so much faster than income. Your share of the rent would have been $500 a few years ago. It sounds like you don't have kids, but when you do you'll understand how important it is to have a functional housing policy.",t2_b53c9dsn,llildoodooo,0,1648254030.0,0,t1_i24vmgl,i24vmgl,False,theenukeface,t3_tnzhxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/tnzhxk/texas_realtors_say_everyone_wants_to_be_in/,Texas realtors say 'everyone wants to be in Pflugerville and Round Rock',/r/Austin/comments/tnzhxk/texas_realtors_say_everyone_wants_to_be_in/i24vmgl/,16,r/Austin,0,16

"That is not what that “usually means.” Good grief.

The majority of dogs are not great with cats unless they were raised with them during puppyhood. Some can be introduced to them carefully as adults. A lot can’t. It’s not an indication that anything is wrong with a dog. 

And the combination of dogs + young kids is a lot trickier than most people realize and often rests a lot more on the behavior of the kids & parents than on the dog. A lot of behavior that is typical of children is scary and/or unpleasant for dogs (fast movements, loud voices, tantrums, being physically invasive).  It is also not uncommon for a dog to have no aggression history but be fearful of children bc parents allowed children to mistreat them in a previous home.

">Nah, genuinely curious. Thanks for the links.

Were you now?

>However, the studies don’t show what you claimed. You claim that tech workers are right wing, white men. In fact, there is a big issue in Austin and other tech hubs that are importing foreign people heavily from Asia and India, displacing local tech talent (which is likely not enough to meet demand).

>I have no problem with that but the reality is not what you posted. People of color with exceptional tech skills are out pacing everyone in Austin.

I'm confused, can you quote me where I mentioned race at all? This seems more like something you assumed, because I certainly didn't say it.

>But let’s get something straight.

You seem kinda bad on getting facts straight, but okay, let's see where this is going.

>You jumped in this thread with straight up bigotry. It doesn’t matter what your politics are. Bigotry is simple to define and your comment fits it to a tee.

Because I'm aware right leaning tech bros are sexist man children? I'm not certain you can be bigoted against a personality type.

>I didn’t post anything like that because it is irrelevant to the thread.

Are you sure? After all, you are the one who brought it up, not me.

>There was absolutely zero reason to post your broad brush disdain. You clearly despise the type of people you describe.  The truth is, you were looking to virtue signal because you think this sub generally agrees with your views.

I was looking to rag on losers, there isn't any virtue signaling required for this good time my dude, I'm not here to be nice.

>If you don’t fit the profile of the opposite of what you clearly disdain, doesn’t that make you one of “them”?

I dislike right leaning tech man children, the man part isn't the problem, it's the right leaning adult who acts like a child part.

>The only difference is you think people who don’t share your political beliefs are not just folks with different ideas (diversity) but bad people who have no decency.

I think people who don't share my same opinions are great, but that doesn't mean stupid people with stupid opinions are going to be treated nicely.

>Dude, you are the problem. Obsessed with race and spouting disdain for anyone who doesn’t agree with you. My understanding is that hate is in the eye of the beholder.

You are the only one of us who mentioned race, but you mentioned it multiple times. Careful Pot, you keep calling the kettle black.

>By the popular definition of the day, your speech is hate speech and it doesn’t belong in this thread. I’m sure you can find threads bashing white folks.

"The actual Nazis in Germany were highly interested in vegetarianism, and wanted to convert Germany into a vegetarian state.   Nazi Germany was decades and decades more progressive than English-speaking ally countries including USA, Great Britain, and Canada when it comes to animal rights. Nazi Germany outlawed vivisection.  This was many decades before vivisection ever was discussed as political issue in the English-speaking world. Vivisection did not become issue in English-speaking world until well into the 1980's

Adolph Hitler himself was interested in vegetarianism and professed to be vegetarian in last years of his life. 

I scratch my head how anybody could associate veganism with anything besides ultra far right. 

In vegan community, there is massive far-right component. Vast majority of vegans are antivaxx, into natural healing, and anti-medical establishment and generally completely  anti-establishment (which, 30 years ago would have been considered left, but in 2022 is considered right---go figure)

Huge percentage of vegan community is affiliated with alt.right, neo-nazis, Q-Anon etc..very highly anti-establishment which is currently (in 2022) considered right-wing although it used to be considered left-wing.   

Many prominent members of vegan community are openly Nazi sympathizers. One example is John Rose out of Houston but there are tons of others.

When I visualize a polly tishin stuffing their face with dead animal carcasses I mainly think of Obama when he stood at line at Franklins, he cut to front of the line if I remember correctly.

"Nah, genuinely curious. Thanks for the links. 

However, the studies don’t show what you claimed. You claim that **tech** workers are right wing, white men. In fact, there is a big issue in Austin and other tech hubs that are importing foreign people heavily from Asia and India, displacing local tech talent (which is likely not enough to meet demand). 

Here’s a link https://www.austinasianchamber.org/asian-data

I have no problem with that but the reality is not what you posted. People of color with exceptional tech skills are out pacing everyone in Austin. 

But let’s get something straight. 

You jumped in this thread with straight up bigotry. It doesn’t matter what your politics are. Bigotry is simple to define and your comment fits it to a tee. 

I didn’t post anything like that because it is irrelevant to the thread. 

There was absolutely zero reason to post your broad brush disdain. You clearly despise the type of people you describe.  The truth is, you were looking to virtue signal because you think this sub generally agrees with your views. 

If you don’t fit the profile of the opposite of what you clearly disdain, doesn’t that make you one of “them”? 

The only difference is you think people who don’t share your political beliefs are not just folks with different ideas (diversity) but bad people who have no decency.

"Controversial opinion buttt, I’m kinda tired of the “Austin is too expensive posts”. I moved here over a year ago and my first job here payed $13 an hour. I struggled badly, but after grinding it out and working on my professional skills, I have since doubled my pay. I’m doing just fine now. With one roommate we each pay 1k a month in rent. I live in a nice neighborhood, I don’t hear gunshots every night anymore. It’s clean, im close to the city, and lots trees nearby. In comparison to many other popular cities, Austin is still relatively cheap. Y’all just wanna pay 1k/m and have a 3 bedroom house, live close to the city with a yard and garage. It’s an unrealistic expectation in almost any growing city in America. 

I moved here from Houston, this city is much nicer. If you want a cheaper standard of living, sure places like Pflugger ville are cheaper, but theres a tradeoff with any budget option in the world. This city is a huge upgrade over Houston and the amt I pay in rent feels fair for the better standard of living. There’s lots of high paying jobs in this city, and lots of opportunities to grow. You pay a price for all of these things. Just type in the name of literally ANY city in this country in to reddit, and their subs are all going to be complaining about the “lack of affordability of housing”.

"I usually wouldn't dignify this kind of comment with a response, but I am bored so here it is.  A horrible human abused the shit out of this dog, and he is not perfect, but neither is my dog, and from what I can tell, neither are you, but I bet someone loves you, Or rather, I hope someone does, because you shouldn't have to be perfect to be accepted and loved. 

I am not thrusting this dog at anyone. I posted a story about a dog in need. A dog who could use someone with patience to take a chance on them. Because some human hurt him for years. I did not show up at your doorstep with him. I have answered every question honestly. If you don't want him that's fine. But why come here and be negative. Why not go do something kind? I truly wish you the best and would encourage you to go do some volunteering at an animal shelter. Dogs are resilient but often imperfect, even when people are shit to them.
