""We’ve done about 140 demolitions since April of last year, which I think is a staggering number. Those houses, the ones that can’t be saved. Those are the ones that has asbestos in ’em, that have fire damage in them that just completely blotted with no help, no way to rehab them. So, we have to look for ways to get those out of the community because they pose a safety hazard for many things and also create a haven for crime. So we’re going to continue to do those. There’s about 600 of those total that we’re aware of now. At the same time, we’re trying to stop the bleeding on blight.  Our code enforcement has done a wonderful job.

"Are you coming from living in a city or a suburb? I ask this because I feel like as someone who has lived in other cities, Macon is totally fine and the way that people in middle Georgia (in more suburban areas) make it seem is overblown. But if you’re used to suburban life, the urban nature of it may be jarring.

The fact that people commenting in this thread hating on it are recommending seriously suburban or rural places reinforces my point.

But I love Macon, seriously. There’s so much to do downtown and so many people with a ton of heart and passion for civic life here. Get involved and you won’t regret it a day. I love having access to tons of original restaurants and small businesses. I love how much art and music is around. It’s really nice, and I’ve never had any personal issues with crime.

"UPDATE: This dog (now named Luna) did very well at her vet today. She was not microchipped and her PawBoost post has over 100 shares at this time. The vet hypothesized that perhaps she was dumped, but given her being in otherwise good health (no heart worms, no parasites) she seemed unsure and said she was probably around 3yo. Her nails were so long when I picked her up she was waddling rather than walking, and is a little flinchy but otherwise she is doing very well. She seems to have been out for a while, given some resource guarding she’s been displaying and the smell that was coming off of her when I initially got her. 

She has been fully vaccinated, and if her owners don’t come forward by the end of this upcoming weekend, I have a home arranged for her with a good friend of mine :).

"I don't know what number you are calling for Cox but they do answer when I've called 478-974-6318. I've had issues with it dropping for awhile and they came out and replaced the modem. They also split my network into 5G and 2.4G because our two bedrooms were a long way away from the modem/router. We use Panoramic and have 5 Rokus, 2 laptops, and 2 phones just for us, that's not including family/friends who come over with their devices. Obviously they aren't all running at the same time, but so far it's been working fine. I will say that if you pay the extra $10 to have Customer Care, it's worth it. It cost me nothing for the guy to come out and test the coverage in the house and then replace and reprogram the new modem.

That said, I hate Cox simply because they have a monopoly in some areas and they charge a ridiculous amount just for internet. We cut cable a few years ago and only stream now, but the internet costs are just stupid. So we ordered Starlink, which is now available in my area. It came on Monday and we've been running it on all our devices. So far I've only had an issue once, at midnight last night, where it dropped my signal, but their app shows you everything that is going on with the router, and it came back up a few minutes later.

"Call Cox and tell them you need the lines replaced between your modem and the outside connection. This includes (if in a house) the line to the ""tap"" aka the connection point near the street or up the telephone pole. Apartments are trickier because some do not allow for outside contracting to run new lines or the cable company isn't allowed to run lines inside the walls which causes issues with getting lines replaced.  Generally random disconnects are caused by 1 or more issues with either the hardware or the lines themselves. The typical problem use the line was kinked when being run through the house and may look fine but it's causing ingress into the actual cable system. Companies may refer to this as interference, noise, leakage, or signal ingress. This is usually only repairable with a total replacement of the line. Other culprit may be water in a line causing spikes or increased resistance in the out going signal which causes the entire modem to restart trying to establish a better connection. Once lines have been replaced and hardware replaced the only other option is ingress ( as mentioned before) from a neighboring house or apartment. This does not have to be your immediate neighbor either it can be up to a couple blocks away depending on how Cox has set up their nodes the divide up the town. 

Schedule a service call and ask them to show you the ingress levels on their cable meter and show you the ranges for your signal. The ranges should be something like -7 to +7 and you want to be in the middle which is 0.   The levels should be more than 3 points from either end of that scale for at least 2 signals. I don't know if these are referred to differently between companies but I know them as Rx and Tx which is the downstream and upstream.

I've been using Cox for over 20 years now. My bill isn't cheap- I have the 500 mb package. But I have to have good internet for work, and I have a family of 4 who are often all streaming and/or gaming at the same time. 

So, assuming that you are paying for ""enough"" internet, time for some troubleshooting. First, go to speedtest.net and run a test. If too slow, check all your physical connections, reboot/restart modem and router (as applicable) and once everything is back up, test again. If you've done everything you can and speeds are too slow or connection is unstable, time to call Cox. This might be frustrating, dealing with any support sometimes is, but persevere, and don't back down until you are satisfied. Over the years, I've replaced modems and routers.

I’ve lived here my whole life and the only thing I’ve experienced was some minor property crime. Which is a risk no matter where you live. Violent crime? Random acts of violence are pretty rare, most if not all of our murders are perpetrated by people who know each other and have bad blood for whatever reason.

Personally I wouldn’t live anywhere else, Macon and the region, has a lot to offer. Museums, parks, kayaking, fishing and all kinds of night life.

"I lived in Shirley Hills for about 2 years back in college.  There are definitely pros and cons to the area (as there are in every neighborhood). Shirely Hills was the “North Macon” back in the late 1800s and early 1900s. There are some beautiful homes/mansions throughout the neighborhood. Unfortunately, some of these historical homes are abandoned and falling apart. I would disagree with this being an expensive area.  Similar sized homes are cheaper in Shirley Hills compared to North Macon or Idle-hour. I think you can get a lot of bang for buck for some of these properties. Granted they are likely much older homes. There are a lot of blighted areas that are directly bordering the Shirely Hills community.  I would say the further you are from Gray highway = the less you will see/notice/experience any of the negatives of this area.  Overall, Shirley Hills has a lot of charm and some beautiful old trees/landscaping.  Jackson Springs park is a awesome little historical park (rumored that Andrew Jackson spent time here during the war).  If having to drive on Gray highway doesn’t bother you, I would say definitely consider looking in Shirely Hills.

"I live in shirley hills. Its wonderful and the neighborhood is really a mixed bag of people. Some great home deals can be found here. The homes are all pretty large as it was the high class part of town in the 20s-70s. I have a few really great neighbors that invite us over for dinner and we help them with little projects. Some of the neighbors are old money and stuck up. Some are just grumpy old people. There are not a lot of young families. Mostly childfree couples, older folks and gay couples. 

The biggest problem is the school district. If you have children you should plan on sending them to private school or a charter school. The schools we are zoned for are horrible. The cost of private school could mean a much higher home budget elsewhere 

Also the roads are a little janky, and narrow in places. Lots of people walk and walk their pets but there are no sidewalks so you have to keep an eye out for pedestrians. The main thouroughfare we have to get on to get out of the neighborhood is one of the busiest in town and the construction on the interstate exacerbates that. the trees are huge and old so when big storms come through we lose power. Probably once or twice a year for a day or so. Theres also the surrounding area being pretty low income. The local grocery store can be a little sketchy at times but is mostly fine. The closest gas stations can be dangerous late at night.  The neighborhood itself is mostly crime free though. A few car break ins here and there where people left their doors unlocked. A couple of package and mail thefts. Ive been lucky enough to have never had any problems personally but a few of the neighbors have.

 We are really close to downtown so good restaurants, festivals, night life, and events are all easy access. Once interstate construction is finished we are close to the river walk. We have a cute little park in the neighborhood. Overall i like it here. I love our house and it was very affordable compared to the north macon neighborhoods. I also love that no two houses are the same. The whole neighborhood has character. We have talked about moving out west to Colorado but only because im over the humid summers here, and the school situation for my daughter. 

Overall i would recommend it if its a good fit for your life.",t2_6vpjw,Superslinky1226,0,1645197357.0,0,t1_hxgd4px,hxgd4px,True,Lufthom,t3_sv4ken,https://www.reddit.com/r/macon/comments/sv4ken/shirley_hill/,Shirley Hill,/r/macon/comments/sv4ken/shirley_hill/hxgd4px/,4,r/macon,0,4

"The other comment is pretty accurate I’d say. In my apartments downtown, electric was about $100 or so, and gas was $60. In my house (which isn’t super big), it’s now $145 for electric and $90 for the gas. Internet is about $115 but that’s the specific plan I chose, I could have gotten a more or less expensive internet plan. So I’m sure you’ll end up somewhere closer to my first figures.

"Here’s what I bet you did to come up with that number. You googled Macon and crime, or is Macon safe, or some variation. One of these “neighborhood data” sites came up and created this statistic by cobbling together various data of dubious origin and relevance.

I already don’t trust their data because I immediately noticed they gave the population as 163k, which is incorrect. If such an easy top-line stat like that is wrong, what else is?

One is free near Tattnall Square and the other is $10 called Barks n Brews. Then ofc there’s commercial stuff like the trampoline park.

"Hello fellow nerds!

My wife and I are also gamers (video, tabletop, board) but we’ve been mostly video gaming during the pandemic as it’s been hard to justify doing almost anything in person.  We live on the north side of Macon (near Bass/Rivoli) with our 2 cats and 2 dogs. We love food/drink/travel (though a lot less during the past 2 years) and fortunately also love cooking, baking, and cocktails which we’ve gotten to focus on a lot during the pandemic. We are not particularly outdoorsy unless that is referring to drinks on a patio, in which case we are exceptionally outdoorsy.  We moved here in fall 2017 and have been really grateful for the extra space. 

Do you only play official D&D or do you play other tabletop systems (FATE, Savage Worlds, etc)? Do you GM/DM or are you principally players? Do you prefer playing with minifigs/battlemat or do you prefer theater of the mind?

When you say you don’t play typical board games — are you referring to family/casual/party games, or do you also not play modern eurogames (things that you’d find on BoardGameGeek)? [note: we have an extensive collection of these type of games]

We haven’t checked out Prime Time Gaming yet as it just opened during pandemic — so can’t provide insights there on good/bad but there is a game shop called DiceDropGames we went to just before everything got bad which was pretty nice.

With all that said — we’d love to meet some time!

"Fall line brewing and macon bacon games are my personal favorite. There are a handful of places to grab a eat/drink in Macon (fall line, piedmont, macon brew co, just tapd) and WR (black barley, tap and pour) or perry (hazards). Fair amount of places to eat if you look past the chains. If you like country music there have been several free concerts around with fairly big names. Atl/savannah/hilton head are day-tripable. Saw you like biking, if its roads its kinda meh with local traffic but gets quieter west of 75. There are a few places for mtb/trails like oaky woods (need a lands/fishing/hunt pass to be there) or pig trail. Macon has more going on but southern WR like hwy96 area southward is nice, more suburbia but less iffy areas than downtown.

"JBA is by far the cool alt spot. Good vibes, open doors, live music, cheap classoc cocktails. 

Tuesday is Trivia Night at Just Tap’d from like 7-8 but its not overcrowded and they have a warm basement and Pizza/apps and 64 Taps but they don’t serve Liquor.

Piedmont also hella cool and they have full kitchen&bar and also brew their own awesome beers and have a warm basement. 

Society Garden opens Wednesday and I do recommend you go and bring a jacket as its mostly an outside venue but they have indoor spaces and outdoor heaters.

Not specifically for alt crowd but—Obligatory Plug for Kudzu Seafood Co. Rooftop bar (The Wheelhouse) might not be open for service until like Thursday but you CAN get drinks at the main Bar and take them up there to enjoy the view.

"I mean, it makes me smile seeing people in this thread who think they know more than Marriott executives who do this all the time and already had property in the Macon market, so they had local knowledge to fall back on (the Marriott right next to the Coliseum). They wouldn’t have poured millions into this without due diligence on getting returns. They are a brand with a number of different chains and price points. Why would they brand this at their high end, as a Tribute Portfolio project, if it would be better at a low end?

A lot of people see high priced lofts downtown and  say, “Wow, those will fail.” I’ve seen those exact comments on Facebook. Guess what the occupancy rates are? 95% and up. Just because the market isn’t you, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. 

There is a lot of people with money traveling to Macon to do business - most travel is not leisure travel. One example near the hotel is the hospitals. Healthcare execs and even traveling medical staff have enough money to afford these prices.

There are plenty of budget hotels right off the interstate catering to that kind of traveler. This fills a niche for a premium traveler with a premium location, being the only hotel downtown, and I don’t believe other hotels in middle Georgia come close to providing the same experience. You can look at 1842 Inn maybe, but that is a tiny place like a bed/breakfast. A lot of business/luxury travelers prefer the security/quality from being associated with a bigger chain.

My hope here was someone has rented in Macon with a balance and could point me in a direction, or at least someone know something more than me lol.

"What make ME think I can pay it is that the rent there was 920 and I’ve been paying 1650 at Camden Bay (well known rental company) for the past 8 months and was approved with an eviction. We moved from Florida to Georgia because my fiancé was offered a job, his second day of training office wound up closing for Covid. We told the office that we didn’t have a job and provided proof of his office closing and told them we would have to go back to Fl. they made us pay an extra month as a fee for breaking the lease then 3 months later I’m served an eviction because the new property owners took over that month yet they insist the balance isn’t owed to them it’s to the old company - that I can’t get a hold of. My logic is that if everyone who was evicted was unable to find housing we’d have A LOT more homeless people. My logic is that some “slum lord” that wants their money will take 3 months paid upfront or a double deposit or something. I think I can pay rent because I KNOW I can pay rent. It was circumstantial and shouldn’t have even happened and I refuse to pay 5,000 when I paid the fee I was told to. I’m unable to track down where I “owe” this money and I will obviously need a place to live in the meantime.

"If you're working in Warner Robins, you're going to begin to hate the commute from Macon. However, if you work in Warner Robins, and live in Warner Robins, you will have a much nicer quality of life in terms of finances and safety, with the trade-off being that there isn't much to do. If you want the downtown hipster barcade experience, you can live in Macon, but you're surrounded on all sides by a shithole with higher taxes and corrupt local government. A few weekends ago a friend of mine saw a lady dead on a streetbench downtown, presumably from an overdose. People are trying to ""fix"" Macon but it's important to know that it's a fixer-upper. Another thing nobody's mentioned is the endless road construction along I-75, 247, among others. The roads are shitty and you will have a bad time.

Macon does have its charm, don't get me wrong, but if you don't plan on visiting ""craft breweries"" every weekend, you're probably not going to be taking advantage of the city.
