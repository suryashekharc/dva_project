I hadn't even loaded a full mag, let alone taken a shot at anything. The range manager had to tell the guy I just got there and hadn't even started shooting.

"Been there a couple times to sight in my rifle for hunting. Both times left me with negative impressions.

I'm a 2A liberal so I'm not a fan of the right wing politics that gets espoused all over the gun shops in town, but I get it comes with the territory and just try to ignore it. However, the range staff are city employees and have no business openly discussing politics while in their professional roles, but on my second visit, the range staff we're vocally bashing liberals and liberal concepts. That's highly inappropriate when acting as a public servant. 
I was also not a fan of the attitude demonstrated by the staff. I understand that gun ranges are serious places that deserve to be taken seriously. But the attitude I felt they were giving was less of an instructional/safety officer tone, and more of a superior/subordinate tone.

"Others feel the opposite. Ebikes are bikes plain and simple. A multiuse path is indeed for multiple uses, whether we all like them or not.

For example, I would prefer horseback riders not use them. They are far more destructive to the trail, more dangerous, and disruptive to other trail users. Same goes for many dog walkers, especially those whose dogs are off leash.

Your perspective on ebikes using the roads is a bit ridiculous in my opinion. ABQ drivers do not understand sharing the road. We have more pedestrian deaths than any city in the country if I recall. Quite a few motorcycle fatalities as well. Do you bike on ABQ roadways? Confident you know the rules as a driver?

Growing ebike usage is a significant net win for society. Healthier, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly than travel by car. They allow many people who would otherwise not exercise at all get meaningful, low-intensity cardio (zone 2 and 3). Please don't gatekeep.

NM's treatment of ebikes is already a national embarrassment.

"Well, I bought my first bike in 2017 hoping to commute at least once a week. One month in to commuting, I sold my car and I have been using my bike as my main mode of transportation.  I do about 5k miles a year and snow rain or wind does not stop me from doing what I do. Hills are hard but your legs get used to it. I hate the wind during the spring. I learnt really quickly that tubeless is the way to go and since 2019 I have been running tubeless tires with orange seal and  a dynamo hub for my front and rear lights and it’s been wonderful. The bike shops here are very helpful Fat tire bikes a local bike shop I prefer  would go above and beyond to make your life comfortable if you are using your bike as main mode of transportation. I most of the time reach my work place much faster than my colleagues who get stuck on paseo crossing the river . Bike has been extremely dependable mode of transportation at least for me . The few gripes I have is seeing used needles on the bike paths and some occasional person in the car not seeing me because they were busy with their cell phones. I do have a camera to record any of these incidents. The shops and the business all let me park my bike inside the buildings so I don’t have to worry about someone stealing my bike. Even my doctors office has been very accommodating with my needs when I let them know I have to park my bike inside the building.",t2_1x5ydiea,kmm-2018,0,1648174799.0,0,t1_i20jw5k,i20jw5k,False,RepulsiveEagle42,t3_tmagpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albuquerque/comments/tmagpv/i_cant_stop_looking_at_it/,I can't stop looking at it,/r/Albuquerque/comments/tmagpv/i_cant_stop_looking_at_it/i20jw5k/,1,r/Albuquerque,0,1

The suggestion to buy an HT and listen in is good as long as you don’t transmit! (Without a license). If you are licensed there are a number of talk type nets on a daily schedule. One uses the Caravan clubs repeater at about 7AM MON-SAT.

I'll also add that some of those groups are more dog friendly than others if that matters to you. Women who #OptOutside & Making Strides rarely do hikes that dogs can't go on.

"I'm very active on MeetUp, so I can give some perspective on the groups in the blog:

Albuquerque Hiking and Outdoor is alright. They probably have the best combo of difficulty & # of hikes out of all the hiking groups that I'm in, but some are timed. I've only gone out a couple of times with this group but everyone was alright. They do some solid after work events.

Albuquerque Co-ed largely only seems to do beer runs & biking events now. I've never gone out with this group b/c I don't like running or biking.

WOW WE is a solid group. They focus more on longer weekend trips (like having to drive outside of Albuquerque). The group seems to skew heavily towards the retired age. Everyone was very nice the few times I've been out with them.

Awesome Hikes is a lot like the WOW WE group (and may share some organizers, I can't remember off the top of my head). They mostly focus on things that are 4-6ish miles and moderate, with a good mix of events in and out of Albuquerque. They steer more towards weekend events as well.

Can't speak to the Mountain Club personally, though I've heard great things about them. Don't know much about the Gay or Minorities groups.

NM Women Adventure is a dying group. They got a new organizer a few months back who is kind of brusque. A lot of the events are not well attended. Women Who #OptOutside was started by a lot of former members and organizers of the NM Women Adventures & is a great group with a lot of activity type & time variety. 

The Sierra Club posts some things on MeetUp, but I think they prefer sign ups through their website. I've never gone out with them either but I've heard great things about their group. 

Making Strides is a co-ed hiking group that skews towards easy to moderate events. They probably do the most after work events, and they also do some weekend hikes outside of Albuquerque. They're a great group to meet people in and do things in a group, but if you want to be challenged they're not the group for you.

A lot of people on MeetUp attend events with multiple groups, so it's sort of a ""MeetUp circuit"" as I've heard people call it, which is nice b/c it's easier to find familiar faces. I've made great friends through the app that I hang out with on my own.

Even if the police said that to reporters, that's no defense. That is why more careful journalists use the word ""allegedly"" so often. 

I agree with you, that reporting should be based on ""what is known at the time"". At the time, they *knew* nothing whatsoever about any involvement by the other two.

"That's me without proper ADHD meds. Got sober over 2 years ago here in Albuquerque, but I quit using HAMS as I am very familiar with alcohol withdrawal treatment. Alcohol isn't cunning or baffling. Ethanol or drinking alcohol is created when the process of fermentation a grain, fruit or vegetable.  Any form of alcohol is toxic and poisonous to the body including ethanol.  The normal human liver can process alcohol, but during this process, it is filtered and a small amount of damage happens, however that is what the liver does, it takes damage. Minor damage is no issue for a healthy liver.  Extensive damage causes scarring or Cirrohsis of the liver.  Current medicine has 4 stages of severity medically.  Today's medicine isn't going to be tomorrow's medicine.

The staff at UNM should remember me well.  I spent my 2020 Christmas at UNM chained to a bed in that corner room with all the useless cops watching me for months.

"Hmmm, KOB may have a problem here. Their earlier article reported that ""State police capture inmates who escaped in transport van."" So it appears that they falsely accused the other two inmates, who did nothing illegal, of being in on the escape. They remained handcuffed in back the whole time, and had no choice but to go along for the crazy ride.

I can't find this earlier article--the link to the earlier article sends you to the one supplied with this post. Even if KOB got that info from the cops, they should have checked it.

Here is what google coughs up if you enter ""[kob.com](https://kob.com) joshua hall"":  
""State police capture inmates who escaped in transport vanhttps://www.kob.com › albuquerque-news › state-police...  
2 days ago — The three inmates were identified as 35-year-old Josh Hall, 36-year-old Rickie Billie, and 45-year-old LaCosta Reeves.""

KOB wasn't alone in this. The AP, USnews, and KRQE also wrongly lumped all 3 inmates together, and showed all of their pictures as ""escapees"" who ""stole a van."" 

I don't know the legalities here, are there any lawyers who can weigh in? Can the other two inmates take legal action against the media?

I point fingers to poke people in the eye and say, good morning sunshine, have a cup of coffee, break glass and make noise and art with the glass broken helping clean up neighborhoods with it as Art itself.  Leave the Street art, professional and licensed stuff all of it where it is supposed to be and do things.  I've been talking about some things I've made, I love it, don't want to sell my art.  So, first person who sees me walking ask.  You take it. It's a gift.  a mystery gift!  I'll wrap it up properly.  It's called, ,In case of Emergency.  All I ask is it stays free, and it's never exchanged for money, crypto currency, all that shit.  If shit gets real bad, there's all sorts of awesome mediums, but it is real broken glass, on the art, so be very careful.  I tried to make it fairly safe, but not too safe, and it does glow, turn, I don't, know, be careful but play with it in lights and stuff.  I'll wrap it, and whoever messages me at midnight will get a location of an Little Library.  It will be there, but I'm not sure where I will put it.",t2_gqbf2,ObsoleteContraption,0,1648087581.0,0,t1_i1vooun,i1vooun,False,ObsoleteContraption,t3_tlj8to,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albuquerque/comments/tlj8to/update_on_resources_for_albuquerque/,Update on Resources for Albuquerque.,/r/Albuquerque/comments/tlj8to/update_on_resources_for_albuquerque/i1vooun/,-2,r/Albuquerque,0,-2

"There are other ways to find employment depending on your ability and degree of education within the smaller labor Companies who also provide clerical, nursing, and all sorts of other careers and depending on your interest, you can often laterally move into something more interesting for more money sometimes.

In New Mexico I was finally able to get on Medicaid!  This literally saved my life. If you are not working because of health issues or on Medicaid get all the Dental work you can get done at participating locations!  I go to Comfort Dental on 4th Street who are awesome!  I unfortunately hadn't the chance to keep up on dental work, and that cascaded into it quickly becoming a very serious issue.  I personally decided, just do it, pull everything bad, I'm going to just go for it and get dentures.  For me, I was exhausted of dental pain, tooth decay, plaque, everything that would have been prevented if I will be honest I neglected, because they looked great, until they didnt.  

Medicaid will provide outstanding dental care including a dentures and other procedures, fillings, extractions, cleanings, and everything else by the actually highly trained staff at Comfort Dental on 4th!  I'm just going to keep going with this until I can't remember all the things I do have done etc!  I'm seriously unmedicated for ADHD, and need Adderall to control it, however,  I'm scheduling an appointment with Presbyterian to move PCPs and my psychiatric care to them, and also so I can finally get properly medicated by a psychiatrist who can provide that level of care (controlled substances / amphetamine), after getting a proper re-evaluation of my original Diagnosis of ADHD, which was already impossible, to prove, or is it?  

I need to head over to Healthcare for the Homeless tomorrow in hopes of getting a walk in appointment for my PCP, Dr. Tree, a very talented Dr and compassionate guy for a routine check-up.  And to get new referrals to Presbyterian.  On the other side, I'll go over to see if my psych nurse is there.  They do have a fantastic paych clinic available to all.  The appointments are very limited, and the walk-ins are usually around 7:30 first co mm e first serve.  First 10 guaranteed I think.  There is also a free dental clinic for the low income on premisis.  I'm not familiar with all the hours, but they perform extractions, fillings, cleanings, and other services for free.  Get the emergency stuff done ASAP, it could save your life, seriously.  Gingivitis, toith decay, enamel erosion, plaque buildup, sores, your tongue, gums, should be healthy, guess what, all centennial rewards eligible!  Good Rx cards are there, however use the Fetch application as the GoodRX has a unique number in the app   this is why Walgreens is told to tell you no, or say, eh, you'll only save a penny, not I'll run it AND save you that penny, or have it in their system regardless.  There is a complaint form on the app about this.  They cannot refuse you, and if it saves you nothing it doesn't hurt you you get like $1.50 everytime you run the Fetch app.  The Fetch App can be used by anybody.

"I don’t disagree with most of your comment, but I went to school here decades ago and the schools were bad then too. My high school was nearly unaccredited. The state motto is pretty much “Low Standards”. Not just for a schools; for everything.  

The hospitals suck too.  Half the reason the hospitals suck is because half of the nurses went to local schools and therefore can’t write a basic sentence. The other reason the hospitals suck is because the administrative staff is comprised of people who went to New Mexico schools. 

Personally, we’re leaving the state because of the low standards in everything.  It’s a shame, but I’m not willing to risk my life here. The medical system here killed my ex husband, my mother, and my father, all because of stupid mistakes.  I know other people with similar stories.  And we want to start a business, but there’s no one here I would be willing to hire - I wouldn’t trust them not to destroy it. They literally don’t understand how 4-way stop signs work; they don’t understand that Facebook isn’t the whole internet, and they raffle off hundreds of guns to raise money for a domestic violence agency.

"Tiny homes have been great in other cities because in those cities people are actually allowed to \*live\* in the tiny homes.

There are four homes currently occupied in the village.  No on else has been approved to move in. Every time I've looked over the past year, they have not been accepting new applications. Even in the article it says that if you give them all the money they want, they will won't allow someone they've approved move in for another two months.

The tiny home village was supposed to offer all of those things, and the community was behind it, but THEY WILL NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO THE VILLAGE TO USE THOSE SERVICES.

One of the reasons that they give for not accepting applicants is that they are refusing people who just need housing. They will only accept people who will participate in whatever bullshit community activities they've made up to try to weed out people who just need a home while they get back on their feet.",t2_i0p9e96o,nynotes4567,0,1648069028.0,0,t1_i1ugz2a,i1ugz2a,False,boxermansr,t3_tktlk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albuquerque/comments/tktlk2/tiny_home_village_seeks_additional_funding_to/,Tiny Home Village seeks additional funding to fill vacancies,/r/Albuquerque/comments/tktlk2/tiny_home_village_seeks_additional_funding_to/i1ugz2a/,6,r/Albuquerque,0,6
"I applied there... Sort of... I think... (Ilsa Biel?) I think is the name of the person who runs it.  I emailed them, got a huge application to fill out, and basically after receiving a gigantic application PDF with all these stipulations, no real thoughts into how you're going to first brag about how everyone is trying to help so much, but basically every major shelter in this city is nothing but a money grab from the government, while they're allowed like Steelbridge and Legacy church to do whatever they want because they don't have any compassion for anyone.

I'm tired of being told my problem in life was that I haven't found religion, or your organizations keep jamming AA down your throat, being told that because of a lack of your completely unscientific approach to anything, and I apologize, I kinda stopped going to church when you guys ruined the whole Santa thing for me, then realizing you believe in something that is actually less possible than a fat white guy using slave labor to deliver presents via flying dear, that somehow manages to do all this while magically visiting every shopping mall so even more impulsive shopping and feeling crappy for yourself because Christmas shopping means Capitalism.  

I know about a lot of charity, and organizations like this, and basically since there concern really has nothing to do with people freezing out in the cold, helping them medically, and clearly just stealing as much money from the government as they can with their friends so they can act better than us, and they care.  Good Shepherd is downright disgusting in it's treatment of people.  These circles of grift need to stop, and I am sorry, if your religion, AA programs, jail, prison, deciding that you are the ones going to fix this on paper.  I gave up even trying to get into your place, as you guys never update anything, don't do anything but cry about how you wanted to help.

I was kicked out of the Good Shepherd after being sober forever for missing an AA meeting on my day off with a signed pass, because I stayed in bed that day not feeling tired, which wasn't uncommon considering I had 2 roommates die because of addiction and mental illness, and another one who I have no idea, just disappeared.  Rather than put my picture on their wall as a success story because I did sobriety my way.  I got to the making amends stage in AA, and it was always really short.  To make things abundantly clear, these places open and I see blocks and blocks of Megachurches who don't care about any medical guidelines because f you, that's why?

I have a great idea, let's compare notes.  On zero dollars for months, I have helped millions of people by just walking around, using my own EBT to feed people, not shaming them, or acting like they have the answer. 

So, want to compare some notes?  Or do you all have documentation on all the illegal labor practices you have?  Hmm?  Let's see your salaries.  Look at my post.  Do you really want me (WA) to expose you for who you are? 

See my post.  Why do I know more than anyone?  Because no one ever believes your homeless story, and no one likes it when a single person can throw all your outdated terrible ideas out the window and see what's sensible here.  With $10K I could make my own community, start tiny and build up, not think big and work down.

Personally, I'm exhausted of seeing this in every city.  Having so many homeless is a class and greed problem.  How about one of you come live with me on the streets for a month?  I'll do it.

"“Balderas just signed the State of New Mexico on to an Amicus brief in support of the City of Berkeley, California in its case against the California Restaurant Association which is suing in opposition to the ban on natural gas which also applies to businesses.

Berkeley was the first city in the U.S. to approve such a law, when its City Council unanimously agreed in July 2019 to prohibit natural gas infrastructure (such as gas hookups) in any new buildings that applied for permits after Jan. 1, 2020.

Despite “representing” one of the most important natural gas producing states in the nation here in New Mexico, Balderas saw fit to sign on in support of Berkeley. Whether you are just a New Mexican who benefits from the money natural gas benefits for the State of New Mexico or whether you heat your home or cook with natural gas, Balderas represents radical environmental groups, not you.“ this is an excerpt from a post about hector b signing a brief in support of banning natural gas hook up in California.

"I'm old, so I've watched the deterioration. I've also lived in other countries, and have seen how they handle it.

When people are poor, they feel no connection tot he society that lets them live that way, while at the same time needing to survive, and crime is often the most convenient way to get by. Everyone should read up on how Switzerland solved their opioid problem, they really break down these different components very clearly.

In Albuquerque, we have generations of people who grew up in poverty, who were born to teenage mothers, and are now teenage mothers. When you talk about crime and 'street life', they know it well. When you talk about college and education to get ahead, that is an abstract concept they know nothing about. They have no family members who went from where they are, to UNM, to having a successful career. They've never seen it happen.
