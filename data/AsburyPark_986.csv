"I‚Äôve lived in Asbury Park on west side of town for 7 years at intersection of Monroe and Comstock. I‚Äôm not a huge man and neither is my wife and we have two little dogs. 

I‚Äôm half white and half Mexican and my wife is wife.  We are middle class people too (I work in tech and my wife is care giver). 

The neighborhood is a mixture of black and immigrant families, most middle to lower middle class. 

When I first came and decided to buy the house, I parked and checked out out the Asbury scene and then walked home with my wife at 2 in morning. Saw no one on the streets. 

I routinely walk my neighborhood at all hours of the day and have zero problems. You will find people very warm and inviting and numerous characters who will outright converse with you, something I wouldn‚Äôt get much of in other neighborhoods. 

It‚Äôs a mixed bag for sure but it‚Äôs a good neighborhood with good people. Any trouble comes between people and not random civilians. You will likely find same sort of disorderly behavior (drug use-dealing, drinking, etc), you would find across the tracks. 

I‚Äôve made it a mission to be a part of the community. I‚Äôm friendly, helpful, respectful. I fix kids bikes and mentor young men and high school kids I meet up with. 

The neighborhood is safe but really busy. Lots of traffic. Used to be more ‚Äúlively‚Äù but neighborhood has changed as more young families like us and less renters move in. 

If you want to live in Asbury, this is the last affordable place to move. And it‚Äôs fine but you will be surrounded by minorities and if you have a problem with that, perhaps you should not move here. And if you think just having black and immigrant families around will put you in danger, you shouldn‚Äôt move here either. 

There‚Äôs no huge random crimes at all. We keep a Ring on our house but don‚Äôt have to worry too much about much. Immigrants don‚Äôt cause too much havoc and many of the black families are just that, families. 

There may be sketchy houses and abandoned but it‚Äôs at same clip as any other mixed economic area in America and as I said, higher income neighborhoods have same mixture of crimes, drugs and behavioral problems. 

Difference is they are mostly white. That‚Äôs it. If you can‚Äôt handle not being on mostly white neighborhood, you won‚Äôt be comfortable and should not live here. People understand the judgments here and you will not likely get the same warmth and community I get everyday in my neighborhood.",t2_jmqy1,ConnextStrategies,0,1647865876.0,0,t1_i1its9r,i1its9r,True,Ricjd,t3_tisjga,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsburyPark/comments/tisjga/think_of_moving_to_comstock_stsummerfield_ave_area/,Think of moving to Comstock st/summerfield Ave area,/r/AsburyPark/comments/tisjga/think_of_moving_to_comstock_stsummerfield_ave_area/i1its9r/,8,r/AsburyPark,0,8

"My early bird tickets will be $195 plus fees. That‚Äôs pretty normal. 

I‚Äôve attended Governors Ball, Sasquatch, Boonaroo, Panorama, ACL. All are about $325-350 plus fees for three days. 

None of these are on the beach which does indeed add an ambiance that can‚Äôt be matched. 

And on top of solid top tier acts, their mid tier is fantastic. 

My Morning Jacket, Billy Strings, Cage The Elephant. Gary Clark Jr. These are acts that for sure you will find tickets be $100+.

Plus local and even the lower tier are very very good. 

I go to concerts once a month at least. Nothing wrong with Sea Hear Now prices nor its lineup. Definitely in line with good concerts and in some ways, it‚Äôs quite a steal.

BTW I just looked up the Hella Mega Tour with Green Day, Weezer, and Fall Out Boy (no other acts). It‚Äôs about $300-450.

So you see three bands for more than seeing over 20+ bands over two days. 

So, unfortunately, the math works out for Sea Hear Now based on your own parameters",t2_jmqy1,ConnextStrategies,1,1646784051.0,0,t1_hzwnvb4,hzwnvb4,False,Informal_Lizard,t3_t9mo6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsburyPark/comments/t9mo6t/seahearnow_2022_lineup_has_been_posted_cant_wait/,Sea.Hear.Now 2022 lineup has been posted.

"To those of you complain about the costs, clearly you don‚Äôt go to concerts. 

Seeing a top notch act like Stevie Nicks or Green Day will most likely cost you $100-200 minimal when you count all the fees. Maybe more. 

You will most likely also see them in an arena or stadium and not in the sand. 

The others bands will also end up costing you about $100 minimum as well. 

So for two days, you are getting at a minimum, $1000 worth of bands for $200-300.

If you don‚Äôt like the line up, I get it but calling this a rip off is just wrong.

"I grew up around here and have been going to the bar scene for 5+ years, and also lived on 1st ave next to the library for a year. 

At 29 years old I find the bar scene largely caters to the young to mid-20s crowd nowaways, which is exactly why i'm moving up north to the JC / Hoboken area. You will see see plenty of late 20s to mid-30s folks out but they're the minority. Maybe in larger numbers at more expensive places like Watermark, AP Distillary, or even Biergarten but still, it's not great for nightlife for people near 30s, in my opinion. Though there could be less frequented bars im not aware of where the 30s crowd tends to congregate. 

Outside of the nightlife scene, its still a great place to live as theres nature, live music, great restaurants, lots of coffee shops, shopping etc. Plenty of other things to occupy ones time but as others have said dating/nightlife around here in the 30s, while better than the suburbs, probably isnt easy for 30s folks.",t2_ajhha,bluestudent,0,1646190384.0,0,t1_hz01lcc,hz01lcc,True,GoodVibes444,t3_t4llc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsburyPark/comments/t4llc1/should_i_move_to_asbury_park/,Should I move to Asbury Park?,/r/AsburyPark/comments/t4llc1/should_i_move_to_asbury_park/hz01lcc/,2,r/AsburyPark,0,2

"The answer is yes. Asbury is a great town to live in, especially in your 30s. There really is no shortage of women to meet out and about considering that it's got one of the best bar scenes around.

Crime won't really be much of a problem as long as you're careful of your surroundings. It really all depends on where in town you end up. I don't think that it's any worse than most of NYC.

Munroe Towers will be the most ""fun"" building to live in since the crowd skews younger. But if you want more of a luxury type place there are options around. You'll probably end up renting a condo from someone, like I did. Getting off-street parking should be a priority if you own a car. Living on or near Cookman is great if you want to stumble home from the bars, less great if you want to go to bed at night and not hear a lot of noise.

"$60 for 2 people is very expensive for pizza. That can get you 3 large plain pies and more in most places outside Asbury, including the towns immediately surrounding Asbury. So for anyone visiting or living in Asbury Park, why not go for either cheaper pizza or more convenient or better dining experience? Yes, Galley is more expensive and the only pizza place I'd rank lower than Medusa in and around AP for my own pizza needs.

Talula's is close in price, but they have deals some nights, serve awesome cocktails, are in the best location downtown, and IMO provide a better food and better dining experience.

"Affordable? By what standards? The cost per slice/pie, especially taking into account size is not great. Sure, you pay for higher quality ingredients, but with Crust and Crumble and Talula's downtown, the town's already more than fulfilling the needs of high quality ingredients and those with dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, etc.). Beyond that, most people who want good pizza for takeout go for good AND cheap.

Without a location in downtown for easy walkability for out-of-towners AND having such a small space, they needed to get a ton of takeout and delivery business. I'd rather order from TJ's or Nick's in Wanamassa. I'm not trying to pay an arm and a leg for pizza, especially if ordering for a family or a group.

I'm also generally against new condo's, so I have my fingers crossed that the Medusa property will go to another business. The property is zoned for business and outfitted for a restaurant.

"deep dish? blasphemy!!

had a friend from Chicago tell me once ""jersey pizza is like a cracker with some sauce and cheese, its called pizza PIE cuz should be thick like a PIE""

i was in chicago and he insisted i go to Lou Minotti's famous deep dish and it would change my life, so i open mindely went, ordered 2 slices with sausage and peperoni, my go to, the 2 loaves of bread came out with the toppings, i took a knife and cut the tops off with about 1/2"" of the bread, mmmmm yum. he was appalled and swears there is something wrong with me.

took him to Pete and Elda's for ""a slice so thin it has one side"", he was appalled again at this cracker pizza as he calls it lmao.

its a regional thing, i like a sicilian once in awhile but not a breadfan, gotta be thin with fresh made sauce and the mozzy that is made in the kitchen, a slice should have to be ""drained"" of some oil before proper eating and the slice must be folded, or 2 slices on top of each other with the toppings facing each other, that is proper etiquette.

ever tried a ""philly taco""? or a Sawmill slice on the seaside boardwalk? mmmm yummmm

"garbage, and i am saying that nationally. 

i grew up going to the original mikes in Pt Pleasant, get some breakfast before heading out on the boats, a hoagie when we got back in, they were the shit, would drive from island heights just to get one, that is some 30-40 years ago, nothing better then a mikes club sub!!

fast forward to now, i work all over the country and everyone is always ""hey jersey (on the road we all call each other by where we are from or something like that), lets go to jersey mikes""!

ima ""nah, they suck, i'll get a real hoagie when i get home next week"", (for reference i also don't attempt pizza once im outa town, cuz, well, it sucks elsewhere).

case in point, i work in south cali a LOT, on occassion i buy my crew lunch, if its pizza i'll get pappa johns, cuz, no matter where you are its consistant, im not a fan but i'll eat it cuz it doesnt suck on a grand scale.

last november i order in jersey mikes, $900 worth of subs, and i will tell you they were utterly horrible, one slice of meat and one slice of cheese thickness, bread sucked balls (pretty much bread sucks everywhere else but the east coast, except maybe chicago, their bread is different but good.

jersey mikes used to use good meats like thumans or that kind of quality, now they are no better than subway, chain store crap.

there is one near home in ocean county, wife gets them on rare occassion from mikes, and they are meh, bread is better but if i am going to pay premium price, and they are premium price we'll go out to Hot Shot Subs or for that matter just go to the deli counter at shop rite, wanna a great hoagie, go to shop rite!!!

"Langosta Lounge, which is same owner as AP Yacht Club and Pop's Garage, has a smallish room with ocean views they might be able to allocate for a party.  The back half of Pop's could also work, depending on the vibe you want. Marilyn Schlossbach, who owns all three, is a wonderful human.  

The Berkeley-Carteret or Asbury Hotel may also have smaller function spaces but IDK about prices. The Asbury is owned by the same people as the Lanes so if they had an option they might have suggested it.

"Young 20's Porta is probably your best bet. They have good food and a nice atmosphere for dining with huge tables for large groups. Afterwards it turns into a night club so its a one stop shop for you guys.

Beirgarten is good too! Food is too heavy for me to party with though lol

I would't go to R bar. You can only get food in the dining room downstairs and it has the volume level of buffalo wild wings.

Watermark and Langosta are good, but I don't think Watermark really has food. More of a cocktails lounge. Definitely places I bring my friends to when they're in town.

"The city obviously has more happening in the summer but it's also busier. It can be more fun in some ways in the off-season but it depends in large part on the weather. If it's too cold and rainy, you won't have much fun walking along the boardwalk or through town. 
The boardwalk and beach are still open but all of the vendors on the boardwalk are already closed. The restaurants on the boardwalk will for the most part still be open. The restaurants and bars in the downtown area are still top-notch and worth a visit. 

Where to eat depends in large part on what you enjoy - there's great pizza (Porta, Tallulah's, Crust & Crumble), Mediterannean (Reyla), French (Pascal & Sabine), and the bar and alcohol scene is solid. There are countless rankings and lists of the restaurants here so you can just browse those.

I got the Box Office tent and they said ""oh I'm sorry, your tickets were sold. But you can buy new ones on the resale site! :-)!""  

I had no email (still don't on Monday), no message, no warning that they had sold overnight from Friday into Saturday. We discovered lots of people outside the event, either in my position or who had been given them buy friends who couldn't go, had been screwed by exactly this situation.  

The ticket people *knew* about and still shrugged their shoulders and said ""there's nothing we can do about it, please complain to ticketmaster and don't blame us."" They could have sent a communication out to let people know this was happening. They could have told people you won't get an email when your tickets sell.  

The show (from what I'm told) was produced well, but the ticket end of the production company had their collective head up their own ass.",t2_393fgcqx,CockercombeTuff,0,1632157701.0,0,t1_hdm1xx8,hdm1xx8,True,RickyPan,t3_pre0bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsburyPark/comments/pre0bg/for_sale_1_sea_hear_now_wristband_best_offer/,For Sale: 1 Sea Hear Now Wristband Best Offer,/r/AsburyPark/comments/pre0bg/for_sale_1_sea_hear_now_wristband_best_offer/hdm1xx8/,1,r/AsburyPark,0,1

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"I‚Äôve never gone myself but maybe try kickball? There‚Äôs a group that plays in the park across from The Asbury Hotel. They have an Instagram @asburyparkkickball. 

If you like dogs (even if you don‚Äôt have your own) going to Wonderbar for Yappy Hour is a fun way. There‚Äôs an outdoor section where dogs can roam free and you can sit and have a drink. It‚Äôs alway easy striking up convos with dogs running around. 

It‚Äôs a huge music/arts town so if you have any interest in those things you‚Äôll be able to get involved there. Check out Ghost Harbor Creative for more local stuff. Lots of the bars have local acts and other more grassroots type stuff that are probably best for meeting people. I follow all of their Instagram accounts to stay up to date on events.

"You'd have to call the Asbury school district. The phone number is in this thread. Going to a local high school to run the track certainly helps with motivation and tracking your progress since each lap is a quarter mile.  I actually do that now in Ocean County since corona. 

Track??  Since you mentioned Neptune high school I have to mention this.

I ran track in high school a long time ago.  At that time it was a hundred yard dash, not meter.

We ran against Neptune and I ran against Neptune's John Chambers who regularly ran anywhere from 9.5 to 9.8 hundred yard dashe; in high school.

All I could say is if you could picture a mechanical rabbit moving around the racetrack at the dog races, that's how he looked.  

He  just glided down the track and made it look effortless.  It's like his legs didn't even move. He just glided down the track way ahead of us 10.4 to 10.8 guys.

You also mentioned Long Branch. They also had a world-class high school track star, Larry bunting, who ran  hurdles.

I don't think anyone has surpassed those guys since the late 1970s.

Aynway, enjoy the track.  Some of the middle schools and intermediate schools especially if they're new have nice tracks and basketball courts outside.

Also, about two or three blocks west of Bar Anticipation, there are several outdoor full basketball  courts, and you often see people and leagues playing there.

I‚Äôm just trying to see if you think about the issue from a different angle If you might understand. 

I lived within 15 miles of ap for 30 years and worked in the restaurant and hospitality industry along the beach for 15 years with the last 4 years in asbury.  I donate money, participate in local movements, and councils. I cooked food for hundreds and made boxes of groceries to give away to people who lost their jobs and lost their income, all while taking huge pay cuts for a year. People were practically spiting in my face during the last summer in the middle of a pandemic that is still happening, because I was asking people to mask up to protect my staff and myself and others. 
Your may be a smart person but you are not behaving like a person I would want as a neighbor or ‚Äúlocal‚Äù. 
I think if a restaurant, bar or business chooses to not be open it is likely for a reason.

"I think a lot of the perception of Asbury as ""unsafe"" is misplaced or outdated.  I just moved here from DC - in DC, there were regular shootings in our expensive, downtown neighborhood and constant porch pirates.  Last summer someone set a police car on fire in front of my house.  

Living in Asbury, biking past these beautiful gardens and grand old Victorians and tourists going to the beach I have been so confused by my family members who have made comments about Asbury being ""unsafe.""  It depends on what you are used to - I would personally never leave anything valuable in my car, or leave my door unlocked because in my mind that just wouldn't be smart, whether I was in Asbury or anywhere else.  Some people in Monmouth County confuse a few blocks of buildings being a little rundown with general safety, and I think long-term Asbury residents are not eager to correct the perception since gentrification in AP has also been pretty aggressive.",t2_2i0jycyz,dckate1308,0,1627066275.0,0,t1_h6a3plx,h6a3plx,True,Charchar33,t3_oq40w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsburyPark/comments/oq40w4/should_i_be_concerned_with_safety/,Should I be concerned with safety?,/r/AsburyPark/comments/oq40w4/should_i_be_concerned_with_safety/h6a3plx/,6,r/AsburyPark,0,6
