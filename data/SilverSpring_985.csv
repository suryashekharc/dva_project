Dtss is possibly the best place around in terms of public transit outside of downtown DC. Lots of great and frequent bus connections. Neighborhood shuttle. New Bus Rapid Transit up and down 29.

"It depends on where in Chicago you’re moving from and what your expectations are about DTSS. 

This is the east coast and it is a very different feel from Chicago, IMO. I lived in the West Loop for 10 years and then moved to Silver Spring. We were on the journey to have kids and build a suburban life but still wanted to be somewhat walkable to grocery, farmers market, transit, parks, etc. 

Silver Spring, like many areas surrounding DC is somewhat expensive for what it is, unless you find a rental/purchase gem. From reading some of your comments, I think you might like the area near Fenton and Wayne, or a little south from there. There are some rental buildings that will put you closer to the quiet neighborhoods to give you the best of both worlds.

"Not really worth the rental rates. Citron is $1818 - $2544 a month and it's competitive with DC area rates as well as Bethesda, MD rates but you get no space,  max is 1192 sq ft . The Blair's is further down Colesville Rd. & Blair Mills Rd. and nothing but good reviews but those prices are high as well.

The point I'm trying to make is that Downtown Silver Spring is a cool place to visit. Breweries, coffee shops, two movie theaters, a playhouse, new restaurants, a giant state-of-the-art library, DSW, H&M and a newly renovated Ellsworth Place. However if you cast your net a little wider you'll get more bang for your buck living wise by looking into neighboring areas like Colesville, Burtonsville, Beltsville, White Oak. If you want the city feel but a little further out I'd highly recommend Crown Gaithersburg off of I-200. Also there's new apartments in Wheaton off of Georgia Ave. by the mall and the Safeway which are worth checking out as well.

Another question is, where are you planning to work/commute to everyday? If within the Beltway, you're pretty much okay with going deeper into DC like the Columbia Heights area. If driving around I-495 to Northern, VA whatever you do, don't look here.

"I lived close to the metro for a few years.
Pros:
-Tons of great restaurants 
-The Filmore and AFI
- Three(!) amazing breweries 
-Close to tons of bus lines and the metro
-Metro ride into DC 
-Juniper Trailhead / Rock Creek Park in walking distance
-Grocery stores nearby
-Weekly farmer's market 

Cons
-Mostly families/ kind of boring if you're younger
- Metro area has a lot of pigeons, dead pigeons, bird shit, and a homeless white dude that would sometimes get aggressive
-Bridge with murals that is pretty but smells insanely strong of urine
-Loud dude with megaphone screaming about Jesus? for long periods of time right in the center of Downtown 
-if you have a car someone WILL smash the windows in for no reason. This happen multiple times, and I did not leave anything appealing on the seats.

"Ok. I think by now folks have given decent answers for DTSS specifically.

More generally, DTSS is good for Metro access if you're going into  DC. If you're commuting to outlying areas, be aware that the part of the DC beltway adjacent to Silver Spring is one of the more congested sections, especially during the evening rush hour. 

Also, while the same Metro (Red) line runs up the I-270 corridor to the North & West, it takes long time to get there since you're going all the way into the heart of DC and back out again. Eventually there's supposed to be another transit train (MD ""Purple line"") that will connect DTSS to  Bethesda, possibly shortening that particular rail commute.

"As the other posters have observed, you need to careful with the “Silver Spring” name.  As a native of the area (Takoma Park and then Silver Spring, and later downtown Silver Spring), I used to explain to folks that “Silver Spring” was a postal fiction covering everywhere in southern Montgomery County that wasn’t something else - and “southern” MoCo goes pretty far north.  

That said, I’m biased, but Assuming you are speaking about “Downtown” Silver Spring (or most of the immediate suburbs, it is a pretty great area.  Good public transportation, and because it is centrally located with easy beltway access (and if you have a car), it’s really convenient to getting to other great areas in the region.

"DTSS or the surrounding burbs? Silver Spring is a little bit amorphous and feel differs by neighborhood.

I live in one of the neighborhoods a bit north of DTSS and love it. Access to all the amazing food, cultural events and major transit hubs is easy AND I can quickly get to local trails (NW Branch, Sligo Creek). The cafe scene in DTSS is low key among the best in the US. 

Carjackings are up as a regional issue and you can get some loud street races at night... But crime doesn't feel that worrisome considering it is a highly dense, transit accessible area near the core of a major metro area. I find people to be generally very friendly and helpful in all parts of Silver Spring (except in parking lots).

Downtown Silver Spring has a fairly city-like atmosphere despite not even being an incorporated city.

"If you're into weight training and want something within walking distance of downtown, you're out of luck. The only real option now that Washington Sports Club is gone is LA Fitness, which is possibly the worst gym I've ever been to. 

On top of being crowded, the general gym etiquette is abysmal (to put it lightly). Few people bother reracking weights, and when they do often put them in the wrong racks or leave them strewn across the facility.

"Hey sorry for the late reply. You probably already finished your decision process, but here's what I can say:

It's my first time living in an apartment building, so I don't have a good frame of reference. I think it's been nice though I don't want to continue spending a ton of money to live here, so I might consider other options at the end of my lease. It's probably still one of the cheapest in comparison to other luxury Silver Spring apartments I'd imagine, so I can't call it expensive.

Staff are really friendly, people in the elevator are usually friendly. For your internet, you're forced to use Comcast Xfinity. Construction hasn't stopped so one of the nearby roads I would use has been closed for a while. Also the water pressure has gotten worse since the end of December and I'm not sure if they've done much about it in spite of the several maintenance requests they got. 

I've never had problems with roaches or loud noises from other people in the apartment (except one night when someone washed their laundry too late). I usually keep the windows closed when sleeping so the street noise doesn't wake me up.

**FIRECRACKER EDICT ISSUED BY POLICE**

**Montgomery Arrests Will Follow Noises After 10 at Night.**

**COMPLAINTS ARE MANY**

Annoyed by repeated complaints that boys and men are exploding firecrackers and other fireworks in the residential sections or Bethesda and contiguous towns, Montgomery County police or the Bethesda Substation have issued an ultimatum. 

Any person caught exploding fireworks after 10 o'clock at night will be arrested and taken to police court, according to Sergt. Leroy Rodgers, in charge of the substation. They will be prosecuted under the provisions or section 118, article 27, Maryland code, which prohibits the making of unseemly noises to the disturbance of the public peace.


Numerous complaints rained upon the personnel of the substation and Sergt. Rodgers finally decided to take the matter before States' Attorney Robert B. Peter, Jr., at Rockville. State's Attorney Peter dug up the law and told the sergeant that arrests could be made. Sergt. Rodgers last night instructed the men of his command to be especially vigilant and to warn persons caught discharging firecrackers that they would be arrested if they persisted after 10 o'clock at night.


It is understood that the other precincts or the county police will follow suit if there is any need for it.

"Well, one suggestion is to sign up with Volunteer Match. You tell the system what you can do, what your interests are, and how much time you want to spend, and they send you lists of volunteer opportunities. There are many ways to help via a computer that don't require mobility.

Another idea is to take a look at the Meet Ups in the area. It's a bit like fishing: sometimes you get an old shoe, and every once in a while you pull up a rainbow trout. Same thing here: I've met some odd fish in Meetups, but I've also met some people with similar interests who have gone from stranger to acquaintance. Who knows what the future might bring? 

As for finding Meetup groups with people with similar interests and needs, that's something you can play with. I just did a tiny dig and found a DIY remote controlled and autonomous mobile robot group, all online, [here](https://www.meetup.com/GTA-Robotics/events/284060578).

"Metro is supposed to be fully accessible, although I know you know how varied ""accessible"" can be. Still, it's better than so many other transit agencies around the country.

If you can get to the downtown Metro office (which is between Gallery Place/Chinatown & Judiciary Square stops (like 1 block from either)), you can get a disability SmarTrip card that will only charge you half fare for any trips taken. If it applies, you can also sign up for MetroAccess, which is door-to-door transportation on-demand (although you have to request it days in advance).

These things together can help you get out more often, even if it's just to go to the doctor's or for a meal.

The library is usually accessible and is a place you can go w/o having to spend any money once you get there.

If you do have mental health challenges, there's the peer-run (that is: ""us helping us"") Silver Spring Wellness and Recovery Center (SSWRC) as part of the Santé group. It's just on the outskirts of downtown Silver Spring & it's a place to go where you can meet people & do things. (I used to go to the Santé group for my therapist & psychiatrist as well.

"Many people on disability can't do that because if they do, they lose their disability support (yes, even with volunteering too much because it ""proves"" you can work), and the job doesn't make up for what they lose. There are programs to help people w/ disabilities get jobs, but the federal ones require you to be able to hold down a full-time job (and many PwD can hold down a small job or be self-employed but not full-time) Even schooling can sometimes ""prove"" that you're ""well enough"" to have a job. People don't just lose their money, they can easily lose their housing too, as well as their insurance. (The system is NOT set up to provide a high quality of life for disabled people.)

Plus, everyone and their MOM is trying to find remote work right now. While it's common now, it's also in incredibly high demand.

Also if they don't have interest to work or volunteer, they may also have mental disabilities as well, like severe depression, which can keep them from being able to hold down a job.

THAT being said, there's a MD state program called EID, Employed Individuals with Disabilities, that, if you get a paying job (and it CAN be self-employment.  I'm not sure you even have to make enough to file a tax return, but then you have to submit different paperwork, because I just submitted my tax forms), then the state will give you Medicaid even when making up to like $50k or $75k, for a premium of $0-50 a month. (I made $350-400/month and had to pay $25 for my premium). So even if you do some kind of small task (like get someone's groceries, or babysit) or even make crafts or something & sell it on Etsy (even if you just sell like $1 worth a month), you can get Medicaid on top of whatever other insurance you have. (I had Original Medicare (Parts A, B & D) & used EID like a Medigap plan. It worked VERY well. I had to go into the hospital for a week once and I never even saw a bill. It covered EVERYTHING.)

"We take our dog to the silver spring animal hospital and don’t have any complaints.

Ellsworth is a pretty good dog park. It’s a bit small and weirdly shaped so it may not be the best depending on your dog. Like, when there are dogs my dog actually wants to play with there she will get lots of exercise, but it’s a bit harder to throw the ball if that’s how you want to tire out your pup. 

There is a dog park in Wheaton that’s only like a 15 minute drive and it is much bigger. That’s where I take our dog on the weekends when I really want to tire her out.

There is a great doggy day care on Georgia ave near silver spring ave back by the Guatemalan consulate that is very reasonably priced and doesn’t require booking ahead for daycare. A half day is 20 bucks, a full day is 32 IIRC. That’s much cheaper than the places I’ve seen elsewhere, and it’s family owned and operated which is pretty cool. 

If you are near downtown and like alcohol, fen wick beer and wine is a great dog friendly store and they always have treats and water for the dogs there.

"Yeah that does sound annoying. I’ve been thinking about this a lot since I commented, so sorry this is a little long winded. I heard that learning to play the recorder is part of the elementary school curriculum in Montgomery County Public Schools, so the rule affects those students even though Blairs prides itself on being a “family” building. Also the rule seems extreme even to the point that someone can’t play acoustic guitar out on the grass since it’s not allowed anywhere on the property. I wish there could be some middle ground but that would get messy I guess with noise complaints and such. Honestly, I’m grateful I don’t have to hear someone learning to play recorder (or clarinet), but I do feel a little sad about it killing people’s creative side (even though apparently people don’t follow the rule lol).",t2_5f4byt8u,gemmasp,0,1646313339.0,0,t1_hz6g4ka,hz6g4ka,False,piccplayer,t3_si3lqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/si3lqc/looking_for_apartment/,Looking For Apartment,/r/SilverSpring/comments/si3lqc/looking_for_apartment/hz6g4ka/,1,r/SilverSpring,0,1

"This isn't a big deal in all honesty; it was redundant to have two Truist branches within about three blocks of each other in downtown Silver Spring.

Interesting fact: All of the ""Big Four"" banks (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citibank) and four of the five ""Second Five\*"" banks (PNC, Truist, Capital One, and TD Bank) have branches in or within a mile of downtown Silver Spring.  If you include HSBC and M&T Bank, DTSS has branches (or is located close to branches) for 10 of the banks in the U.S. that have over $100 billion in assets.  There are few banks in the U.S. that meet that threshold (and some of those banks are investment-focused banks or credit-focused banks).

\*""Second Five"" banks is a name I personally use to identify U.S. Bank, PNC Bank, Truist, Capital One, and TD Bank as the five consumer-focused banks that are much smaller than the Big Four banks but much larger than all other consumer-focused banks in the U.S.",t2_4okecjul,FormerCollegeDJ,0,1646076707.0,0,t1_hytedxs,hytedxs,True,SourceOfTheSpring,t3_t3jk9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/t3jk9r/suntrust_bank_permanently_closed/,SunTrust Bank Permanently Closed,/r/SilverSpring/comments/t3jk9r/suntrust_bank_permanently_closed/hytedxs/,4,r/SilverSpring,0,4

"For the love of all that is holy, do not go with the Meyerson Group. We rented a townhouse under their management for less than a year and they are awful. I can’t imagine the homeowner was happy either - the house was vacant for a month or two between the previous tenants and us, and those lazy MFers didn’t actually, you know, manage the property during that time. When we moved in, the washing machine had been left closed so long that it was visibly (and irreparably) full of mold and it took them two months to replace it. We reported a leak in the main bathroom’s shower on move-in that they didn’t feel the need to fix until it was literally raining through the floor into the room below. And then we spent weeks with an enormous hole in the living room ceiling (through which we could see mold growing on the ceiling joists) while they shopped around for the cheapest repair company, and THEN their property “manager” couldn’t be bothered to babysit the contractors while they fixed the problem that his negligence caused. We had to take time off work to chaperone the strangers in our house (who then proceeded to close the hole on top of the mold without remediating).

Whew. Sorry for the rant. Clearly I’m still processing some shit over a year later.

"I'm very happy at the Bennington. I'm in a one bedroom with balcony overlooking the NOAA courtyard and wave pool. 

One thing is that this building doesn't have all the bells and whistles you will find in others, like a swimming pool. But I looked at some of the buildings with pools and running tracks etc and noticed that the actual apartments were smaller. I've got I think 650 sf here and that's about 100 sf larger than ones that I looked at in other buildings.

If you do take a an apartment in one of the buildings along the Metro tracks just be aware there's quite a bit of noise with the Marc, freight trains, metro, and Amtrak trains going by. I'm in the front of the building so farthest away from the tracks and it doesn't bother me but I've overheard neighbors who live in the back of the building next to the tracks complain about the noise.

"I rent a 1 bedroom at ""Arrive"" (formerly ""The Point""), and I will have lived here for two years once I move out in March.  My rent actually went DOWN from $1550/mo when I first signed in 2020 to $1350/mo.

Overall, I would say the building is ""fine"".  I rented a unit that was not upgraded (in other words, not painted over to look luxury), but had a washer and dryer in unit.  The luxury units are more expensive.  The units without W/Ds are less expensive, and there are laundry rooms on every floor. 

While I do have some complaints, this did fit my plan perfectly.  I moved into this apartment knowing that I would move out as soon as I could buy my own place.  I wasn't trying to put down long term roots here so I was willing to forgive a lot of annoyances. 

Overall, I was happy renting here because I saved a ton of money with this place.  It is walking distance to literally everything (doctor, barber, dentist, bank, gym), but most importantly my office, where I park in the office underground parking for free.  So I saved money not having to rent a parking space in my apartment.  Because of those great benefits, I overlooked the fact that my apartment is hot.  Seriously, it's just hot, year round.  I am on the 11th floor facing south.  It gets direct sunlight from sunrise to sunset and, in the winter months, the building's internal heat radiates upwards and adds to the heat.  It was only intolerable for maybe one or two weeks in the early spring and late fall when the outside temperatures are still warm but the building is on heat (units do not control whether the AC or heat is on--the building decides that, you can only turn it on or off). 

My unit was definitely not luxury.  But it wasn't a dump--it was ""fine"". It had carpeted everything, but the carpet was in good condition when I moved in.  The cabinets all look straight out of the 90s and so does the bathroom.  But again, I'm fine with all of that. 

Importantly, I had absolutely NO issues with bugs or vermin.  No cockroaches, mice, or anything.  I remember when I was apartment hunting I saw a lot of reviews online complaining about infestations.  Maybe that's a problem on the lower floors but I had no issue up on the 11th where I am. 

I did leave for work one morning and found a homeless dude passed out in the hallway on my floor.  I told the concierge immediately and it never happened again.  The building does require a key fob to get in but he probably just followed someone else. 

So that's it.  My experience renting a not-luxury apartment. Take it for what it's worth.  It was perfectly fine for my particular purposes and I really have no complaints.  I am glad to move out of downtown Silver Spring just because I do not like the noise and hustle of ""city"" living all day long.  I can't wait to be able to leave the office and go home to a peaceful neighborhood.  I will miss being able to walk to everything, but my office is still here so I can get that stuff done during breaks in the workday.",t2_16sjfj5u,supertranqui,0,1645472153.0,0,t1_hxvbaik,hxvbaik,True,lothh17,t3_swo49c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/swo49c/help_2022_best_downtown_silver_spring_apartments/,HELP 2022 Best Downtown Silver Spring Apartments,/r/SilverSpring/comments/swo49c/help_2022_best_downtown_silver_spring_apartments/hxvbaik/,2,r/SilverSpring,0,2

"I lived at 1200 East West and it wasn't great but maybe not enough to turn you off. All the ""high-end"" apartments in Maryland have their problems since the places cut corners, but the garbage disposal there literally backed up into my bathroom sink and flooded the bathroom with food. I had to convince them to be the one's the clean it. They originally said I should hire cleaners for the leftover gunk of what they couldn't get. They also increased rent about 100 bucks a year, and when I first moved there parking was only 100 and when I left it was 150, so they are not afraid to increase pricing so you need to make sure you can afford that. If you don't want it then lock into a longer lease. Overall everyone has a bad story about buildings in this area no matter where you go, and on the whole I never had issues with noises, the place was pretty quiet, parking is good and easy, area is very nice and safe, and the gym was super nice.

Because she  is a well-liked politician who represented this area in Annapolis and the House for 24 years.

This one paragraph from her extensive Wikipedia entry more than makes the case for why we might want to bestow some basic honors on “this person.”

In 1998, she was one of only three Republicans to vote against renaming the Washington National Airport the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Morella was the only Republican in the entire Congress to have voted against approving the use of military force in Iraq in 1991 and again in 2002. She was active in human rights, women's health, and domestic violence issues in Congress, and served on the Science and Government Reform Committees.

"I lived there back when they were called Montgomery Gardens, from 2005-2013. The management at the time was the best I've ever had in my entire adult life, and I've rented from big and small companies for 20 years. I mean, they were GREAT. There were no roaches and like 1 rat once in 8 years? We occasionally got some ants, but I mean, everyone gets ants every now and then. Put out Terro, they went away.

Your noise WILL bleed through to your neighbors, no doubt about it. Not having carpet, you'll hear them upstairs all the time. They will hear you working. If you live in the apt closest to the tracks, the trains will shake your desk in your room.

If you don't own a car, it's a long 6 block walk to the Metro, uphill in the evening. Or a quarter mile walk from the buses.

You may also want to consider Summit Hills. Closer to the Metro, similar prices (I think), esp if you split a 3 bedroom. I lived there for 2 years (2016-2018) and each building has their own manager right inside the lobby (I loved ours), their maintenance was quick & thorough, no rats or roaches. We had noisy neighbors like once or 2x but they dealt with it quickly. (Had a lot of noise when they were renovating apartments near us.) The only major problem is if you don't own a car but you occasionally borrow or rent one, the parking situation is atrocious (they won't give you a pass but you'll have to fight for the few visitor spots near your building, and people too cheap to buy a 2nd parking spot will try to take them. If you don't mind a quarter mile walk to your car, there's a TON of parking at the bottom of the hill (or maybe you'll end up in the buildings there). (Oh, and the gates at the bottom of the hill and the 16th street side get locked at night, so it may be a long walk if you live in the wrong place.) I mean, personally, I hated living there, but that was in part because I had a TERRIBLE roommate & I had just come from living somewhere really swanky. But they're really all that's available in DTSS at that price range unless you want to rent a room in a house, and they have DO have amenities out the wazoo.

Honestly, there's not really such a thing as affordable housing without noise issues in the DC area, unless you like rent a room in someone's house or something. At least, not that I ever found in the 20 some years I lived in the area.",t2_3rew1,C4bl3Fl4m3,0,1643763592.0,0,t1_hv7nhf3,hv7nhf3,True,piccplayer,t3_si3lqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/si3lqc/looking_for_apartment/,Looking For Apartment,/r/SilverSpring/comments/si3lqc/looking_for_apartment/hv7nhf3/,4,r/SilverSpring,0,4

"I think they're more going for the 'drink and paint' vibe (e.g. muse bar) which has its market but painting is just WAY more accessible to the general population than photography. And the dynamic is an odd one: paint bars work because youre gathered in a well lit room with a wine glass in one hand and a brush in the other, everyone tangibly creating something (and ribbing each other/themselves) vs. In the dark, wearing gloves, dipping paper in chemicals, everyone doing the 'after art' part of the creation process.

"What makes a person a public figure? There isn't specific guidance from reddit. However, in this instance it is clear to me that they are not a public figure. As appearing on fox news (from what I can tell, one time) does not make you a public figure. 

When I approached this I checked a few things in a moment:
1) Are they a politician, executive or spokesperson for a business, an important member of some clergy, or other public facing role  (no)
2) Do they have a large social media following (no, medium) 
3) Have they identified themselves as the person in the video (no)

"I’m in White Oak on the other side of 29, welcome to the neighborhood!  White Oak is never in the news for the right reasons, but my husband and I have found it to be a pretty great neighborhood since we wanted to settle down.  If you’re into mountain biking or hiking, there’s a great trail up in Fairland, so basically right in our backyard.  We bought here for similar reasons to you - more space, the buy-now rush, etc. and have been here for almost 4 years and really like it.  We were in four corners before and I do miss the walkability there compared to here.  I love backing up to woods (sooo much wildlife!) and how quiet it is up here compared to DTSS, while still being very close to everything.  Having Trader Joe’s and Target super close is also appealing (we have a one year old).  It’s definitely more ‘burb life, but it sounds like you’re ready for that again.

"First, congratulations! I'm a few years out from the possibility of home ownership myself, and the competition is terrifying, so nice work finding a place you like that's within your budget!

I don't have much advice on what's good in White Oak, but I do have some thoughts about your general situation. 

It sounds like you're doing some mourning for the urban and walkabke life you've lived as a young adult in the DMV. Ultimately this is a very natural response to change and aging. You're on the precipice of a whole new stage of your life, with a clear marker that there was your life before this, and there will be your life after this moment. It's okay to be feeling some trepidation and going through a little grieving for your old self and lifestyle.

Trust yourself, though, that you had good reasons to make this change. What was it you were most looking forward to when you decided to shop for a home? What are the opportunities home ownership provides that aren't possible as a renter?

Focus on those positives to give yourself something to look forward to, rather than only thinking about what you're giving up. Are there any projects you can finally do now that you don't need to worry about getting your security deposit back? Are there any hobbies you've always wanted to try but never had the space? Do you want to be able to get as many pets as you want without having to get approved from your landlord? Will this home finally let you pursue any dreams of starting a family? Do you want to build a hedge maze and garden in your yard, or convert your basement into a dance studio/laster tag arena?

So yes, it sucks to not be able to walk to stores and the metro, BUT you're also gaining some amazing opportunities and taking your first steps on a new, exciting journey!",t2_5e6t28aq,elmic91,0,1643292680.0,0,t1_hufuqdk,hufuqdk,True,supertranqui,t3_sdju2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/sdju2a/just_bought_in_white_oak_looking_for_life/,Just bought in White Oak - looking for life suggestions.,/r/SilverSpring/comments/sdju2a/just_bought_in_white_oak_looking_for_life/hufuqdk/,6,r/SilverSpring,0,6

"Hi neighbor - I'm only a few miles away from you.

Yeah, the suburban lifestyle is a bit different than the urban one if that's what you're used to. I spend my evenings.... on reddit apparently. There's some night life in downtown SS and in Wheaton (or so I've been told - I'm middle aged, married, and boring so I don't go anywhere). 

I happen to love the northwest branch trail - you can take it all the way north to the ICC and all the way south to the mouth of the Anacostia. It's beautiful. The most scenic part is probably the area just south of 29 (it crosses under 29 right near the trader joe's). Speaking of the Anacostia, the Bladensburg waterfront park is cool, you can rent kayaks and canoes, and if you have your own there's a free boat launch.

There's Ice skating in wheaton and downtown SS, horse stables in Wheaton regional park, MLK regional park, YMCA, GSFC visitor's center, Kenilworth aquatic garden, Rocky Gorge Reservoir, AFI Silver Spring, and paint your own pottery in downtown SS.

"> Is posting someone's private or personal information okay?

>No. Reddit is quite open and pro-free speech, but it is not okay to post someone's personal information or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible.

>Posting someone's personal information will get you banned. When posting screenshots, be sure to edit out any personally identifiable information to avoid running afoul of this rule.

>Public figures can be an exception to this rule, such as posting professional links to contact a congressman or the CEO of a company. But don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or upvote obvious vigilantism.

Don't live in Summit Hills. It's really gone downhill since the giant management turnover. Everyone I know who lives here is just waiting out their lease and then leaving. 

Management has done super shitty things like lie about how long the construction on 8484 is going to take, send 2 year long leases when you asked for 1 year hoping you wouldn't open it and read it, and now they are implementing a utility fee that's not even based on how much utilities you actually used, but the average based on your apartment size and they wrapped that communication up in some environmentally conscious bullshit instead of the cashgrab it is.

"Adding on to other people's comments: (Note: I had to move away in 2018, so forgive me if my advice is a little dated.)

1. Definitely get into Ethiopian food while you're here. There's a million restaurants in the DC area, and a thousand in downtown Silver Spring. I'm sure everyone has their own idea of who has the best (I'd love to hear everyone's opinion) but the DC area has a huge Ethiopian population and downtown SS is basically Little Addis Ababa, so you're right in the heart of it.

If you've never had Ethiopian food before, start with a messob platter. And definitely try out raw kitfo if you eat meat. Ethiopian steak tartare, basically. It's one of my favorite foods of all time. And if you're veg/vegan, Ethiopian is perfect for you; their cuisine has a ton of veggie dishes (including ones with protein), they're all vegan (AFAIK), & totes delicious. You can even get a veggie messob platter.

2) Also, check out the various pollo joints (pollo-a-la-brassa). Rotisserie chicken, Peruvian style. I was partial to Crisp & Juicy, but I don't think I ever had bad pollo from any of the other ones. (I recommend with fried yucca root, maduros/sweet plantains, and a salad. Oh, and you're going to want extra dipping sauces, trust me.)

3) re: driving. As well as what everyone already said, don't forget about black ice. This happens when it's above freezing in the daytime & everything melts and then dips back below freezing at night and the previously wet roads can turn into sheets of hard-to-see ice if not properly treated. (The temp changes like that are common.)

4) The surface parking lot behind the Whole Foods in DTSS (Downtown Silver Spring) is a special circle of hell. Esp. if St. Michael the Archangel (next-door) is having services or an event. Avoid it if you can.

4.5) The same can be said about the parking lot at Trader Joe's/Shoppes at Burnt Mills up 29.

"And if you want to really torture yourself, check out the disc golf course in Germantown at Seneca Creek State Park.  It's world class.

If you like to hike or have a mountain bike, check out the Northwest Branch Trail.  There's a good trailhead at [Burnt Mills Park](https://montgomeryparks.org/parks-and-trails/burnt-mills-east-special-park/) by Trader Joes.  From there you can head southeast into PG County - stay up on the ridge for rolling up-and-down terrain, or there are sections where the old trail stays down by the creek.  Out-and-back from the parking lot to the PG line (where the trail becomes a paved bike path) is about 6-7 miles I believe.  If you want to keep going, once you get back to the parking lot, cross Colesville at the Trader Joes light and turn left to cross the creek again on the bridge - the trailhead to continue northwest is just past the bridge on the right.  You can go from there all the way to Wheaton Park, in classic stream valley trail.  Ups and downs, some fun rock gardens.  Another 6-7 miles out-and-back.  And there's even more to the north if you're feeling ambitious, but it takes a little bit of sidewalk to get to the northernmost section.

"Welcome (even if briefly) to the area! Main roads are generally maintained pretty well - if you aren't used to driving in the snow/ice just remember to drive slowly, don't hit brakes hard (this causes you to slide), and give yourself and others lots of room to stop! 

What part of SS are you going to be in?

For food I would check out:

* Charm Thai / Ruan Thai / Kin Da (if you want Thai and sushi)
* Santucci's (for am amazing Italian sub) / Filippo's Italian Specialties / Mamma Lucia / Olazzo
* Tbaar for boba tea and onigiri 
* Bob's Shanghai 66 (amazing dumplings)
* A&J restaurant for dim sum
* Sushi Jin / Ikura Sushi
* Parkway Deli (fantastic Jewish deli)
* Woodmore Pastry Shop (best jelly donut I've ever had) / Donut Run
* La Casita for pupusas (or any of the hundreds of pupusarias)
* Samantha's for Mexican 
* Mid-Atlantic Seafood for some great soul food
* Quarry House Tavern for bar food (get the Korean BBQ wings!)
* CSNY Pizza (close as you get to NY style here) / Roscoes (Neapolitan)
* Supreme BBQ and Auntea Boba
* Restaurant (?) in the Wheaton H-Mart for Korean (not sure what it's actually called lol)
* Bonchon for Korean Fried Chicken
* El Pollo Rico 
* Tastee Diner for breakfast
* Woodmore Market Beer and Wine
* Bottlegonia (wine/beer)
* Takoma Bev Co
* Brew Belly (if you want to make a trip to Olney - great food and beer selection)

For other fun/shopping, you can check out Pike and Rose, go to a concert at the Fillmore, Saturday farmers market downtown, Sligo Creek trail, Rock creek park, Billy Goat trail... and this isn't even including going into DC (which you should do because you are so close).


There are hundreds of other amazing places to eat/shop/have fun. I'm sure others will chime in.

">Candidly, I have PTSD and the circumstances are beginning to take a toll on my mental health. 

That really sucks, sound pollution was one of the main contributing factors in our decision to move out. I would highly recommend getting an app that shows live decibel levels, so that you can call non-emergency to shut them down for the day. That helped us a lot.  


>Kettler's release was that they mismanaged rent collection. But quite honestly, after a year at the helm, WPC has likely done more to devalue the property than whatever rent they lost out on.

We signed under Kettler, and WPC had no idea what our monthly rent was set to. We found out at the very end, their data had our rent listed at like half of what we had been paying all along. Of course they never reached out to inquire about abnormally large monthly payments! :)  


> Comical really. I've copied WPC leadership on multiple emails to no avail.

"You know, I've lived in more apartments, across more states than I imagine most have (military). Candidly, I have PTSD and the circumstances are beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I find myself wearing earplugs for most of the day. My zoom calls are often punctuated with noise from the fitness studio below or construction activity. The evenings are no reprieve with the myriad of entertainment venues across the street. I have no agenda in saying that this is the most incompetent management I have ever seen.

The previous property manager was a paragon of professionalism. In my conversations with her, it became clear that WPC is a company perpetually hoisted by its own petard. Why lease space to a fitness studio in an almost entirely residential building and make no effort to mitigate the sound? That's actively hostile toward residents in my view.

Even as a layperson I know that commercial real estate is an entirely different ballgame. It is far more laissez-faire. I have on good authority that the reason for Kettler's release was that they mismanaged rent collection. But quite honestly, after a year at the helm, WPC has likely done more to devalue the property than whatever rent they lost out on. Comical really. I've copied WPC leadership on multiple emails to no avail. I decided yesterday to cut my losses and seriously begin the search for a new home. A tenant association is not fixing this. Moreover, I am no fan of working for free...

Between the noise from F45 Training (occurring as I write this), the looming fear of yet another HVAC failure, and the blithe indifference I've observed—paying 2k a month to live here is viscerally upsetting.

"I was a semi-regular customer at the Pete’s near Friendship Hights back when they first opened and then the one in Columbia Hights back when I used to work near the station 

It was good for what it was but sometimes you just want “regular”  pizza and not pay $6 a slice 😐

I don’t think Pete’s had a lot of foot traffic in that location in DTSS and it seemed a little too casual for the “finer dining” crowd and too upscale for kids and the less fancy diners 

It just seemed like it wouldn’t last long and it didn’t ☹️

But I will agree we lack good pizza areound here 

Flippin Pizza was “ok” but it’s long gone and Jerry’s is ok but other than on a Monday after 3pm I doubt I’d ever eat a pizza there since it’s about $6 pizza and I’m not paying more than that for it 

I’m a fan of MOD Pizza but I wouldn’t call it “high quality” even if it is super yummy 

Mama Lucia makes good pizza but it’s pricy so I rarely get any there 

And Papa Johns/Dominos is...well Papa Johns and Dominos, everyone knows what they are getting there 😐

"1150 resident here.  The quality of building management has plummeted in the last year.

We felt valuable and cared for.

Washington Property is abysmal.  As noted elsewhere, twice now we have received ""notice"" of something as it was happening - notification of a fire alarm test after the alarm was already sounding last Friday, and a holiday party where they sent notice 15 minutes after it started.  When I complained they told me it had been posted around the building and sent in the app earlier, both demonstrably false and written to make me feel in the wrong - not good customer service.  My floor constantly smells strongly of pot, and in response to complaints the send out a weak and feeble ""reminder"" that it's a non-smoking community.
