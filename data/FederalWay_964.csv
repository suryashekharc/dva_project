The first thing is the Burke Gilman trail is your friend. You can get on that trail and get to a lot of places in FW without having to use roads and only a few stop lights. 

I never biked on Pac Highway, and always found parallel streets or routes. 

I agree with the other comments that FW is not the most bike friendly but it isn’t a huge hurdle to overcome either. Use the Burke Gilman Trail to get close to where you need to be and look for residential streets from there that keep you off Pac Highway, 320th, etc.

"You don't have to do it through the city appointment though, in fact, even in the best of times, that's the wrong way to go about it. 

If you are a king county resident, you can do it downtown in the county office, usually same day.

Normally you can just show up at the King County Courthouse downtown and they can do the fingerprinting, FBI NCIS background check, and submit the application in one step. 

Recently apparently, you still need to have an appointment, even for the downtown county courthouse route, but the application process will 100% be faster if you do it downtown. They will also process the application faster with the county directly.

Even better if they have a garage, but I kind of like being in the open and hiding in plain site.
Also, if there are apartments near you that have overflow parking onto the street, this is a great place as well.
Wherever you choose however, do not park in the same spot more than one night in a row .
Same property is probably ok, bit try to have a few places to keep in rotation.
You probably already know this, but any prepping you have to do for the night(like getting ready for bed or food prep) try to do it at another location.

"Been in Federal Way since 1993 and I'm not sure if you have ever walked around outside of your living room by your comment. FW has gotten considerably more run down and the ""little trace"" of felony way comment really has me baffled because the exact opposite of what you said is happening. Federal Way is a mess right now and the light rail is going to bring change but now how you think. Angle Lake will no longer be the southern terminus for the Light Rail............ 

now what does that mean..... all the traffic on the Light Rail will be now pass through Angle Lake and have the opportunity to continue to Federal Way. 
Being the end of the line there will be a lot of people milling about around the FW station especially homeless people. (Don't believe me go hang out at Angle Lake Station when link service stops).
Homeless encampments are popping up like crazy and with the new light rail this area will become more attractive to the homeless with already ample wooded areas. 

I'm not sure about all the schools being rebuilt I'll take your word for that but there's somewhere along the lines of 35-40 schools within FWSD.

"Dude!! I had a really bad flu around the onset of lockdown, when people really only associated it with coughing and mask mandates weren’t in place yet and she expected me to come into work!! She insinuated that I would be doing a disservice to everyone by not coming in and basically guilted me into coming into work (i kick myself every time i think about it because i wish i had just up and quit right there). I was under the impression that either Melody was too busy to work (with a good reason to not work) or was already working at the store that day, but it turns out that she was just out with her boyfriend the whole time. It really sucked knowing that I worked a full shift while feeling feverish, having a horrible cough/sore throat, and extremely fatigued, preparing and being around food/drinks that people would consume- while she was out eating with her boyfriend. Though I didn’t have covid, it was a blatant disregard of common health/safety policies as well as her taking advantage of the power dynamic between us as an employer and employee.",t2_el2xd4fo,lil_spacecadet,0,1631845913.0,0,t1_hd5rxi7,hd5rxi7,False,E3ha,t3_pmn0xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/federalway/comments/pmn0xt/melody_boba_house/,Melody Boba House,/r/federalway/comments/pmn0xt/melody_boba_house/hd5rxi7/,3,r/federalway,0,3
"I also worked for Melody in the past and I would unfortunately have to agree that the manner in which she treats her employees and sometimes customers can be incredibly unprofessional and straight up disrespectful. 

When I was working there, she had created and enabled an incredibly toxic work environment. She would constantly talk shit about her employees to other employees, berate us to our faces (calling us stupid or other names, swearing at us when she was upset at us), and I’m not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but she’s physically pushed me before. Keep in mind that most of her workers at that time were either still in high school or had recently graduated high school. …but yeah. She pushed me around my SECOND week of working there because i was washing dishes too slow during a rush, and literally shoved me out of the way and said “I’ll just fucking do it myself”. I understand she was upset that I wasn’t going the pace she needed me to be going, but physically pushing me was completely unnecessary.

Melody would also expect us to uphold policies in the workplace that were either very unreasonable or just straight up a cheapskate move (limiting employees to one plastic water cup that we could use and expect us to wash and reuse it if we didn’t have our own water bottles, limiting napkin access to customers, refusing to remake someone’s order even if we entered it in wrong but they approved it when we read the order back to them, etc). I get that sometimes customers take advantage of our amenities like taking hundreds of napkins, but that makes up a small minority of her customers and it really hurts everyone else because customers associate the policies with the workers and not really her. I as well as other workers there have been yelled at/humiliated by customers for trying to uphold her policies. Even if she isn’t physically there, she would watch the store cameras and individually interrogate the people involved to find out what happened. There was almost no way we couldn’t uphold her policies without any threat of being fired for failing to do so.

Long story short, don’t bother going or working for Melody for the sake of your physical and mental health.",t2_el2xd4fo,lil_spacecadet,0,1631845389.0,0,t1_hd5quvu,hd5quvu,True,E3ha,t3_pmn0xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/federalway/comments/pmn0xt/melody_boba_house/,Melody Boba House,/r/federalway/comments/pmn0xt/melody_boba_house/hd5quvu/,5,r/federalway,0,5

"I have also worked there in the past and besides treating her employees horribly she violated multiple health codes. During covid the boss moved the rice cooker that used to be kept on the floor in the bathroom to the floor in the kitchen right by the mop station ( we used the rice cooker to cook the boba toppings). When it got moved to the kitchen it was placed on the ground right next to the mop station where we cleaned the mops every night. The pine sol that we used to clean the floor was also kept right next to the open bag of sugar. Also the store was always filthy but the boss never scheduled anyone to come in an hour early or stay an hour late, as soon the store was closed she would want all of the employees out within 15 minutes, if we left 30 minutes past closing because we were trying to make sure everything was clean she would reprimand us in text about why it took so long. This happened throughout the time I worked there and even during covid when you would want to make sure everything was clean. She expected everything to get cleaned while the customers were still in shop so we can leave as soon as the store was closed to avoid paying any of the employees extra. This meant nothing was ever actually cleaned because we had no time as there were always customers coming and going and we were understaffed during covid she would only have 2 people at a time scheduled meaning one person to take orders and one preparing the orders so we never had time to clean. This lead to the tumblrs that we made the drinks in to have mold growing in it.

"Thanks for the assessment on my mental capacity. Random internet psychologists on reddit are the first place I turn to for all my mental health needs.

The articles I posted are more proof than you've provided in this conversation. All you've offered are your personal experiences and world view. So here's mine, I guess.

Most car thefts are performed by people looking for the path of least resistance. Smashing a window signifies a risk. Not everyone's home is as well insulated as yours seems to be, and people hear windows breaking. Most thefts from cars happen because theives are handle checking. Keep your car locked, and avoid the most common low level attack against them.

If someone is willing to break your window, they're looking for a bigger payoff to offset the additional risk. This often means your actual car is going to get jacked.

"Bein real, Federal Way was not so nice up into the early/mid 2000s, but by the late 2000s, a lot had started to change and quickly. I was born in 2001 and grew up with stories of what was bad around here and have honestly not experienced it farther than my car window as a child. Even then, I had started to notice new houses/apartments being built, roads being fixed, sidewalks being built, etc. By the time I started to leave the house on my own, there was very little trace of what could be considered ""felony way"". There are still a few areas that resemble the classic felony way vibe but those are few and far between and really just look bad. There are very few package thefts, car break-ins, etc, the closer you get to Redondo and I assume that's the most common crimes in other places. This isn't just me speculating either, the county is investing heavily in Federal Way because they share my same opinion, with a light rail and a uw branch coming here. Not only that, I'm pretty sure 4 schools have been rebuilt in just the last 5-6 years and we only have like 7 tops.

"I grew up in Federal Way during the 80s and went to both of these places. The Chuck E. Cheese opened first. I want to say late 1981-82. It closed in the mid-80s when the company experienced a bankruptcy after the video game crash. 

The Showbiz opened a couple of years later but was lost in a fire. The roads in that area have also changed over the years so the exact location is hard to pinpoint. The building was demolished after the blaze, so even if there's a building there now it's not the same one. There was a story about the fire in one of the local papers, it would be either the Federal Way News or the Tacoma News Tribune since those were the papers my parents got. I haven't been able to find it online but searching library archives might be possible.

There was also a Bullwinkle's. It was located near the Black Angus, the same building where Pier 1 Imports was until recently.

"There were definitely a few DnD groups going in Tacoma, some pretty big! Took over several tables at restaurants (with permission), formed several subgroups.

I know some comic shops have started DnD and Magic the Gathering again too, Fantasium Comics in Federal Way, and Hills of Comics in Auburn (temporarily closed due to a nearby fire a couple days ago) are ones I've gone to and enjoyed, though I haven't attended any since late 2019.

"I can't find it right this instant, but I read somewhere that it's being stored to go up at the new Light Rail Station. 

The light rail line will cross directly over the existing roundabout where the Art was for all those years, and down at the Transit Center itself they're replacing the light-controlled intersection into and out of the east end of the station with a new roundabout. I'm like 95% I read the hands would be installed at that location.

As for why it's in Rainier Beach? It's at a Sound Transit owned facility that doesn't see a ton of traffic in and out. That means it's less likely to get damaged while there. They wouldn't want to store it at the FW construction site because it would have to be moved constantly.

"I have a couple theories:

1) they're storing it to relocate it near the FW light rail hub after it's complete. However I don't know why they'd store it all the way in Rainier Beach if this was the case.

2) Near the Rainier Beach transit stop there is a handful (pun intended) of statues and other artwork. It might be relocated there. But, if they are, I don't know why the statue is just sitting in an empty lot instead of putting it up or clearing a space, unless they're going through red tape and process right now. 

3) It's being trashed. This seems like the least likely option because the statue was nicely taken apart. If they were going to trash it why would they go through the effort of taking it apart and moving it? Also it IS a piece of art, I don't know the red tape around destroying art.

"Hey, late to this post but wanted to tell you about a couple dog spots.

The dog park at French Lake is very hit or miss, at least as of a year or two ago. Lots of dog poop left around. People who come there and just sit at the table while their dogs run wild (or their dogs ""protect"" the table from other dogs). Dogs that shouldn't be at dog parks. Dogs that harass any dog entering the park. So do what's best for your dog on whether you go or not.

If, like me, you prefer outings that are low stress for you and the pooch, here are three great walk spots. 

The old Weyerhaeuser property north of S 336th between I-5 and Weyerhaeuser Way. It is now owned by IRG but you are still allowed to walk there with your dog. The field is closed in the summer due to fire risk, but the woods are open and there are casual trails running north and south there. When the field is open, you can park on the shoulder along 336th and head into the field on one of the trodden down tracks. Or you can drive to the far back left of the DaVita parking lot (32275 32nd Ave S and you'll see a trail entrance on the left. Feel free to wander since the highway sound will keep you oriented in the woods. Google maps shows the location of the major trails.

You can also go just north of the traffic circle at 336 and WW and turn right at the next street (should say ""Weyerhauser Rd"" on the opposite side of the street, not to be confused with ""Weyerhauser Way""!). There's a trail entrance right after you turn in, and it will take you along North Lake. Watch out for fishing lines at the water entry spots.

Please be courteous and leash up your dog if anyone approaches, with or without their own dog. And please, for God's sake, don't leave poop on the trails or next to them.

Further afield - 

Sumner Link Trail - [I park here](https://goo.gl/maps/5kVc93rimFS7XWRE9).  (Any time you are on the paved trail, your dog must be on leash. There are a few spots with very long sightlines though, so as long as you are careful to watch for fast approaching cyclists, there's no one else around and your dog has excellent recall, you could have him off the leash now and then.) Cross the wooden bridge. If you want to access the river, you can go to the right at the far end of the bridge and get to a small sandy area. Be careful - the river is often very fast and there are few places to access the banks if your dog gets swept downstream.

Just before the trail curves to the right, you'll see a cleared area that runs along the river (parallel to the trail). It's basically just an access ""road"" that the City of Sumner keeps mowed down so they have river access as needed. You can let your dog off-leash to walk here, as long as you leash up if someone else is coming your way. Walk all the way to the end of that grassy access road, then turn left on the paved trail to go back to your car or right to continue your walk. Just after you get onto the paved trail going to the right, you will see a little field area on your right. There is river access for your dog at the far end. If continuing on, walk around a big U shape.Then you'll see another cleared ""road"". I follow that and then turn around and come back on the paved trail. You can also go south on the paved trail from the parking spot, but you'll have to be much more careful about keeping your dog on leash because you can't see very far ahead.

Even further afield, but great to get out into the countryside, and great view of Mt Rainier on a nice day -

Flume Trail out in Sumner - [here's an old trail report someone wrote up.](http://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=601393)  This is a gravel access road owned by the local water utility. I usually park [here](https://goo.gl/maps/Trca645cjwh3b1cKA) off 258th and go east, but you can also go west from there. On a weekday, you may have the entire trail to yourself or see one or two people. On a weekend, it will be busier. My dog likes to guardedly investigate the cows from the dairy if they come to the fenceline (and yes, sometimes it really smells like cows in certain areas...) There's not much shade along most of the trail so I wouldn't go on a hot day, There are a few informal places for dogs to access the water, but they are mostly only suitable for medium to large dogs due to steep banks. If you continue east all the way across Sumner-Buckley Highway, there is no-bank access to the water, suitable for any dog. At that point, the trail enters the woods, so shade and cooler temps (but also mosquitos and flies in the summer). You can also park just off the road at that gate if you only want to do the woods part. Note that there are No Trespassing signs at every gate, but the trail is used regularly by people and dogs. Again, please leash up if anyone is approaching.

Why did I write up this long post? Because I'm grateful that other dog owners passed these spots to me, and I want to pass the favor. There are so few places left where a dog can be off-leash without being in a gross dog park full of unsocialized dogs. I'm moving to another town and I hope someone will do me the kindness of telling me about the lesser known great dog spots there too!",t2_ct68d,Zootrainer,0,1625247676.0,0,t1_h3tvzvt,h3tvzvt,True,Angelycan,t3_ncjavv,https://www.reddit.com/r/federalway/comments/ncjavv/moving_to_federal_way_what_do_i_need_to_know/,Moving to Federal Way.

Also in the main Korean plaza off Pac there is a billiards place that is open late that is cheap and cool. 

Pac highway at night isn't somewhere I'd walk around unarmed.

Don't live in West Way, the pavilion apartments, any apartments directly off of pac highway, 288th & Pac aka Muder Bloc, or Miro apartments.

Other than that just common sense as with anywhere. Don't leave a bag or valuable shit visible in your car, lock everything, etc.

Umm.. What else.. The police in fed way are dirty af, worse than Tacoma somehow, so just be on point with them. They're criminals with badges so don't let them pull anything on you. 

There's only like 5 traffic light cameras in the city, learn they are. Also, usually a state patrol posts up on the on ramp/overpass on the main 320th exit. 

Burger Express used to be the best burger joint around but it's trash now after these wack ass people bought it a couple years ago. Complete dogshit. Don't give money to those people. It's really sad because that spot was fire so many years. 

There's no weed stores in the fed because of some lame ass backwards city council that thinks it's 1952. Closest store is Greenside in Des Moines (which taxes and isn't that good) and CBC in fife (which is actually good). Also stash box in auburn is good tho and not too far. 

Be sure to check out Hyeblos Park trails and Dash Point of course. Also NE Tacoma is adjacent to fed way so check out Browns Point too. I'm sure you already know about Redondo too but if not be sure to check it out. 

Also on nearby stuff, be sure to explore around in Des Moines because it's hella chill.

"- H mart > paldo.

- For korean I’d recommend so moon nan jib (traditional) and vons chicken (Korean fried chicken). There is an overwhelming number of options though. 

- One of the comments said to avoid the 320th Safeway. I shop there and I haven’t had any issues. 

- Pizza. Meh, there are a few subpar options. Can-Am is worth checking out esp for their Indian pizzas, but it’s a franchise by name only and the f way one is good, but the other ones in the area are much better.  There’s a mod pizza, New York vinny’s and pizza pizzaz are decent 

- general food recs. Katsu burger, senior taco’s, pho Bach/Lin sonh, I’ll add to when I think of more 

- There’s essentially one brewery in town, north 47. I dig it 

Overall, you’ve got a Trader Joe’s, all the Asian food you’d want to try, Costco, h-mart, etc.  it might not have as great of a nightlife nor a hip “food scene” as Tacoma, but it’s a solid, quiet place with everything you need.  Plus Tacoma isn’t too far.

"Dash Point Park, West Hylebos Wetlands Park and the Redondo Boardwalk and beach (technically Des Moines) are all great places to explore the outdoors. Five Mile Lake is another fun place nearby (Auburn?) to swim/kayak on a hot day.

Our family's favorite restaurants are Senor Taco ($), Vince's Italian ($$), Ezell's Chicken ($ - try the spicy and avoid the sides), Thai Bistro ($$) and the Tokyo Steakhouse ($$$). Burger Express is popular if you like char broiled burgers. If you like sunsets, check out happy hour at ether Salty's at Redondo or the deck at Verrazano's on Pac Hwy.

Farmer's Market is a fun place for berries, fresh veggies, sweets, etc.. It's every Saturday in the parking lot along 324th & Pacific Hwy. 

Fred Meyer is the place to buy groceries,  but we supplement with Trader Joe's,  Costco and Total Wine. Marlene's is the place to go for more healthy choices (also has a nice Deli). Legendary Doughnuts is also popular.

We also have the Centerstage Theatre at Dumas Bay if you're into live theater, as well as the Federal Way Performing Arts Center. 

Oh, and the South King Tool Libray is here as well if you need a power tool for a day.

Finally,  try Eleno's Yogurt.

"Apparently these mobile ""needle exchanges"" are not really even an exchange but just a free giveaway of needles in bulk. It seems like this is just lowering the cost and barriers to addiction and enabling drug abuse. It's also contributing to the littering of our neighborhoods and parks, as trash pickups/cleanup initiatives regularly turn up [tens of thousands of needles](https://www.westsideseattle.com/robinson-papers/2021/02/16/more-1000000-pounds-trash-collected-last-month-parks-and-other-areas).

Here are some interesting quotes from this article:

> SCORE told Lubrano the van would be setting up in a parking lot at 276th and Pacific Highway South.

> Lubrano parked in the lot and watched several cars and people approach the van. ""I saw what looked like a 16 year old go to the van, then to the edge of the parking lot to shoot up. That's something I'll never forget seeing in person.""

> She then waited for the 'rush' to be over and then walked over to the van and asked if she could get a needle without having one to exchange. Lubrano was told, 'no problem' and was given a box of 100 syringes.

> Lubrano continued her stakeouts and on March 26 observed the same activity at a Park N Ride on 348th and 9th Ave. She added that the needle van came to several other locations in Federal Way several more times that week.

It's also incredible that KC Public Health was either lying or just unaware of how the mobile needle exchanges work, based on this quote from Federal Way Mayor Jim Ferrell:

>  ""We reached out to King County public Health repeatedly and even now they were saying they did not go to those locations but that they do go to the Park N Rides.""",t2_4jt8y5s,SharpBeat,0,1617229456.0,0,t1_gsyrx72,gsyrx72,True,SharpBeat,t3_mhh9r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/federalway/comments/mhh9r6/seattle_area_neighbors_expose_county_needle/,Seattle area neighbors expose county needle exchanges operating in vans in parking lots,/r/federalway/comments/mhh9r6/seattle_area_neighbors_expose_county_needle/gsyrx72/,1,r/federalway,0,1

"(Trying to think of Covid-safe activities...) A lot of Puget Sound beaches are narrow and rocky, but Dash Point State Park at low tide will give you a nice stretch of sand. Local skimboarders like it. There's also a network of hiking trails in the wooded hills above the beach. Just know our state parks require a Discover parking pass ($10/day or $30/year). The West Hylebos wetlands boardwalk is a nice place to take a walk if you're more in the mood for just stretching your legs. Another good place for exercise is the BPA trail. It's a wide, paved path winding across the hills under the power lines. And if you just want some peace, the Pacific Bonsai Museum, located on the former Weyerhaeuser campus, is free and outdoors. 

Food wise, my personal favorites include Taqueria la Tentacion for Mexican, Vince's for pizza, Pac Island Grill for Hawaiian, Ban SomTum for Thai,  DaeBak Wang Mandoo for Korean dumplings, Mi Rak for Korean BBQ, and hamburgers are a toss-up between Herfy's, where you can get just about any combo, including a Bulgogi burger (we have a large Korean population, and lots of delicious food to show for it) or Flame Burger Plus. Oh--coffee!--there's a cheap, cash-only drive-through with tasty coffee called Easy Espresso. Poverty Bay Cafe was my favorite, but they are closed for now.

"Federal Way has in general earned that reputation, but like any city, it really depends where you live. Along Pac Hwy (hwy 99), I’d say you can expect more crime. It’s an area that you can quickly hit and scoot to other cities. In Twin Lakes around 21st and Campus Dr. can be rough too. Head toward the water (Redondo) and it gets nicer, and I think most areas in Twin Lakes is ok. 

Where we lived, we moved to Montana about 4 months ago, we didn’t see too much crime. I thought this was weird, honestly as it was between 320th, 312th, and Pac Hwy. Sort of a little oasis. We did see the SWAT Team twice during our 11 years there, but one was a SWATTING and another was because a neighbors brother did something while out of parole and the police assumed he was hiding at her house, which he wasn’t. Scary, but ultimately ok. What we DID get there a lot was police blocking the streets looking for someone who ran into the neighborhood, police helicopters overhead- usually trying to get someone over at Safeway or along Pac Hwy. One guy shot his son one time, not sure what that was about. Nobody died, thank god. 

But these things weren’t every day. My family and I often took walks and thought nothing of it. Still, we should have bought a house anywhere but there lol. That’s what it was like living closer to Pac Hwy tho. It’s not like that everywhere. Just be picky about where you live and you’ll be fine. Also, like someone else said, don’t go to Safeway after dark. You never know what you’ll end up with. 

As is good anyplace you live, lock your stuff up. Theft is a thing, maybe more in some places than others but I take no chances. And if you’re buying a house, put a camera system in. If you can’t prevent it, at least it’s on film, right? Or even if you’re renting, maybe the landlord will let you put in cameras. 

And just FYI... some level of paranoia is good, no matter where you live. I’m in Montana now and I still make sure everything is locked up tight and I intend to install cameras because meth heads will steal anything anywhere.",t2_z73pex5,PhunkyMunky76,0,1599892680.0,0,t1_g4wp6t0,g4wp6t0,True,[deleted],t3_ii1wcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/federalway/comments/ii1wcb/is_it_safe/,Is it safe?,/r/federalway/comments/ii1wcb/is_it_safe/g4wp6t0/,1,r/federalway,0,1

"There are a whole bunch of reasons to support a business.

For example, I don't shop at Walmart because they treat their employees like crap, are owned by arguably the most powerful family in the country, displace small local businesses, and buy products made through child labor in foreign countries. I don't really care what products they offer, given that socioeconomic cost.

In this post I'm looking for black-owned businesses in my area that I can support. 

I haven't stopped looking for any other businesses, but the fact is that very few businesses in the greater Seattle area are owned by black people. They're hard to find.

Capitalism has a lot of problems, but one its strengths is that I can invest my dollars into changing the shape of my community. Individually that doesn't do much, but en masse it makes a difference.
