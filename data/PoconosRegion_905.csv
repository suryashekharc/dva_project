"I disagree respectfully. Maybe I am a homer but - let me make the sell and the realistic back to earth. The “Pocono’s” is a wide range and has a lot to offer but I will not attempt to sell it as a high end experience. I’ve been up here for a long time. You won’t find the best bagel or the best steak you ever had in your life. For OP - if Martha’s Vineyard is a comparison - this is not your place.

BUT - there are local wineries and distilleries all within a radius. Rowan Asher, Blue Hill, Cherry Hill, Renegade, Holy Ghost Distillery….those are the ones I’ve been to and the majority of them are excellent. But in between Stroudsburg and Blakeslee is a 30 mile radius.

The foliage in that time frame is beautiful and there are many places that you can find an intimate spot to enjoy it - HOWEVER

Are you looking for a semi-gentrified AirBnB or an authentic experience in the mountains? It sounds like you are not looking for either (with all respect). It’s a working class location with great people but we (unfortunately) are a quick confusing getaway for anyone outside the area. It’s just enough city to be disappointing - and just enough country to be inconvenient.

As a summary: 
Don’t expect for your mind to be blown but you can find a nice getaway for a quick weekend. When you drop into a town - it’s full chains and a “central”. You want to be alone or enjoy a nice cabin or drive around and find  a view…you can find it.",t2_v9imy,PawelW007,0,1647580003.0,0,t1_i14992k,i14992k,False,mc928,t3_tcycr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poconos/comments/tcycr7/visiting_929103is_that_a_good_time_to_visit/,Visiting 9/29-10/3…is that a good time to visit?,/r/Poconos/comments/tcycr7/visiting_929103is_that_a_good_time_to_visit/i14992k/,2,r/Poconos,0,2

"Be aware there is a HUGE community backlash against STRs in the Poconos at the moment.  Community associations and local municipalities are starting to clamp down and charge fees.  Here's an example.

https://pennforesttownship.org/short-term-rentals/

This township hired a 3rd party company whose job is to hunt down unregistered STRs, enforce STR code compliance, collect STR payments, and fine STR owners after complaints from neighbors and police.

In the area where I live you have to deal with / pay the county, deal with / pay the township, deal with / pay the community association, deal with / pay the management company,  and deal with your neighbors that hate what you are doing.

"Real Property Managers in the state of PA need to be licensed as real estate agents. I am a former agent. I also did this at one point for family. That is a limited scope of what a real property management company would do. Not saying you can’t find someone who will go above and beyond. I charged 25% and cleaned the property myself for a fee. Again, that was an internal situation. 

Unless there’s a company or guy I don’t know who does this the right way, I wouldn’t trust anyone with your real estate. There’s no short cuts on that side of the business.

You need to find a cleaning company that cleans on your calendar, while a manager who can manage the schedule, deals with issues, arranges repairs, checks on the property after all of these things occur (they will). 

You want an airbnb?

Over spend, think long term, and own it. Maybe not for cleaning purposes - but everything else. I made a couple mistakes along the way - I also kept my new family breathing while dealing with some real life stuff. This mountain is a beast - it’s not for the weak willed. Don’t believe the glory stories from the couch flipper 

Honestly - one day I’d love to do an AMA about my experience but I feel like it would be cathartic me but probably par* (not part) for the course for anyone that has dealt with rentals.

A little further away there's some great waterfalls in Dingmans Ferry.

"Your deed should have meets and bounds that gives the lot dimensions and markers. You only need to find one to measure and use compass, or if you know someone with a transit. I find many markers with a metal detector when the pin is beneath the surface before using any other means.

What makes it difficult is knowing the difference between taxable land and actual boundaries. Example is road frontage. Private roads will be owned to road center. Then if road is 30 feet, another marker is 15 feet from road center. This is the taxable area, so you’re not taxed on road. Others are listed on deed to a point along road. Then the marker along road is your line. So the deed is needed. All lines have a set back, or easement. So building anything you will need to know easements as well. They are specified on deed.

Property lines can also be found in the plat room or public room at tax assessment office.",t2_5h4rx419,LuvMyG,0,1644616736.0,0,t1_hwkaa3l,hwkaa3l,True,[deleted],t3_s9t1l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poconos/comments/s9t1l6/who_owns_all_of_this_vacant_land_and_why/,Who owns all of this vacant land and why?,/r/Poconos/comments/s9t1l6/who_owns_all_of_this_vacant_land_and_why/hwkaa3l/,1,r/Poconos,0,1

"I had a property there.  Big Boulder / Lake Harmony Area.   The place rented pretty well, but def. had busy times and dead times.  The summer was booked almost solid, but everything other than that, the Monday - Thur. timeframes were mostly dead.  Peak Ski season had some bookings, but was hit or miss.   Almost every single weekend was booked up tho.  I used Evolve rentals, they were.....so so.   Definitely got the place booked up, but their customer service was very poor.    
  There were some very frustrating parts.   Some people were great, but there were also lots of renters who were a pain.   Smoking in the house, leaving a mess, stealing petty things.  Some of this I was kinda expecting, but it seemed excessive at times.  A bit of handholding with some renters.  They would text/call with questions about the surrounding area (restuarants, things to do, etc.)  ....uhhh could you google this?!  Overall, it was worth it.  It made good money, and we couldn't be there all the time, so it was better than having it sit idle.  Wasn't without it's own set of issues tho.    
   Pros:  Some decent money if you do it right.  I live in nyc, so great to have a place in the poconos to escape to.  Beautiful part of the country.    
  Cons:  Some locals seem to hate everyone not from the poconos.  Depending on where you are, the weekdays are empty and if you're there you might feel isolated.

The HOA will tell you that you need to hire your own surveyor to accurately find your property line, they won’t do that themselves.

When the bubble popped, lots of people were left holding the bag. Some people let the properties go for tax sale or sold for a fraction of the price. Or just weathered the storm. A lot of people own the properties adjoining their homes, so it is worth holding onto them. 

If the market gets to where it was in 2003-2007, if you picked up an inexpensive property  in an HOA when prices were rock-bottom and stayed current on dues and taxes,  it's possible to end up in the black. 

If you want, send me the property details and I can set up an email alert if that particular property comes on the market. I don't know how to do it as a consumer, but I can set it up for you as a real estate agent (as long as its in Pike, Wayne or Monroe Counties). 

You might want to think about reaching out to the owner and offering something, though. The price will be higher if you wait for the owner to put it on the market.",t2_68u2h,mamacarly,0,1642876202.0,0,t1_htrubql,htrubql,True,[deleted],t3_s9t1l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poconos/comments/s9t1l6/who_owns_all_of_this_vacant_land_and_why/,Who owns all of this vacant land and why?,/r/Poconos/comments/s9t1l6/who_owns_all_of_this_vacant_land_and_why/htrubql/,3,r/Poconos,0,3

Since the pAnDeMiC hit I've gotten crazy offers for a couple of them and sold one for a nice profit.

"Here we go again is right.   AjayMVP is a frequent visitor here who does nothing but create a divide with the NYC/NJ and Poconos communities.  This post is the perfect example of what I've discussed on this forums for months now.  His behavior has been brought to the mods numerous times.  Apparently he has a free ride to act as he wishes.  Which I find disappointing, mostly for the Poconos community.    
   It's clear that there is a % of people from the Poconos that just hate anyone from anywhere other than the Poconos.  A very disappointing mindset.   They blame everyone from outside the region for all their problems.  They ignore completely all the horrible behavior from those in their communities, or simply act like it doesn't exist.  Imagine if everywhere in the world had this mindset.  No one would ever travel.  Imagine the business opportunities the Poconos are taking away with this mindset.    
   Where to start.  ""the Time to be kind has passed"".  Are you kidding me?!  have you seen your behavior here over the years?!  You've literally NEVER been kind to anyone from outside the Poconos.    
  Anyway, on to the mindset of blame NYC.  It's truly a shame that this kind of thinking exists in the Poconos.  It's really what holds the Poconos back from doing better.  I've been here for a while. I know the mindset.  ""So what, so that we can have a 15th waterpark that benefits investors""?   No.   These are the people holding the Poconos back.  The Poconos unemployment is (usually, but not always) DOUBLE that of the US unemployment rate.  It's not going to large water parks, or Casinos.  It's going to small businesses.  restaurants (not chains).   Small independent stores.  Local businesses that could employ local people.   Those are the ones suffering by this mindset of ""keep everyone else away"".    
   The same is once again true for Covid.  Blame everyone from NYC.  I speak from (possibly) greater experience than anyone on these forums for covid related issues.  I work in Pulmonary medicine and live in NYC, but spent about 1/2 my time during peak COVID in the poconos.   The % of people who were masked in the poconos during covid was way way way less than NYC.  It wasn't close.  Living in NYC, if you walked into any business, or even building without a mask, you WOULD be told to put one on or leave.   Every single building had signs everywhere saying masks required.  Most places would have security stop you from even walking in.  NYC now has a law for all stores/indoor places.  If you don't require ppl to show vax. proof, you MUST require them to mask. The Poconos?  Very little masking, except at major stores.    
   Vax. rate?  Well NYC is at 70.33% who are fully vaxxed.  The poconos.  Let's pick Monroe County.  53.22%.  Carbon County.  55.58%.  Pike County.  48%.      
   As always, the mindset in the poconos (by some) seems to be a victim mentality.  When I see something wrong with my area/family/surrounding I think about what I can do.  The Poconos seems to see things wrong in their community and looks to blame everyone other than themselves.   The behavior I've seen during my time in the Poconos from the LOCALS has been absolutely horrific, and the finger always seems to get pointed at everyone else.   The sad truth is, the Poconos is a victim.  A victim of it's residents who hold it back from it's true potential.    
  It's an amazing area.  Beautiful nature.  There are certainly some wonderful people in the community with kind hearts.   There are, unfortunately,  plenty more people like AjayMVP in the Poconos.",t2_c9g83,ordin22,0,1639883695.0,0,t1_hp4iz85,hp4iz85,True,AjayiMVP,t3_rjako0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poconos/comments/rjako0/here_we_go_again_i_really_do_hate_nyc_pocono/,Here we go again.

"I live in NYC and have a home in the Poconos. I spent almost all of Covid in the poconos.  You're 100% dead wrong.  If you walk almost anywhere in NYC without a mask on, or following guidelines you'll either get outright asked to leave or at the very least told to wear a mask and/or show vax. proof.    
   Go almost anywhere in the poconos and most places don't wear masks.   Go into small town in the poconos.  Masks are few and far between.  NYC now has a MANDATE.  Anywhere that doesn't require you to show proof of vax. status, MUST mandate masks.  Is that happening in the poconos?  Nope.

"Born and raised in Monroe County (Saylorsburg) so I've been able to witness first hand why the hate... because it is VERY warranted. 

&#x200B;

first: The Local's are far from perfect, the level of idiot is off the charts for both. 

\- The big difference that I've always seen is the local normally stay local. The transplants moved here when it was convenient in the 90's, fuck up the school systems with insane overcrowding, destroyed the housing markets, destroyed the local economies, then as soon as their property values in their McMansions started falling, they immediately left in the early 00, leaving an even more destroyed housing market behind, massive debt that the locals needed to shoulder, higher school taxes, etc etc.

&#x200B;

In addition, NY/NJ absolutely doesn't pay their weight. They avoid gas taxes and other sin tax buy buying and bringing it in, NY still doesn't give PA employment taxes so we lose all that revenue, they make driving anywhere near 80 an absolute shit show anytime in the summer, and the economic benefits they do bring are almost exclusively to service industries, which are low payed for the most part, and due to the increased costs of living (due to larger income being brought in from out of state)

&#x200B;

Basically, NY/NJ use our area as their playground, then when they are bored they leave and we are forced to clean it up. 

&#x200B;

and none of this even touches on the areas which have been decimated with crime and gangs (PCP / East Burg / etc) which has a massive impact on the area as a whole or the absolute shitshow they turn any and all events, parks, venues, etc into when they decide they want to go there. Go check out Beltsville any weekend in the summer and you will see very clearly what I mean

"I agree with your idea and sometimes get stumped but what it takes to make this a reality - I appreciate the two platers because they use our area and pay sales tax as well as using services and goods.

On the other hand I hate the traffic that comes race weekend and Labor Day weekend at the crossings (I choose not to leave my property those weekends) and I’m okay with this because I live in an area that has a day tripper population.

And I see the absolute mess that occasionally gets (was before the gates ) left at the recycling centers because people don’t understand( willfully or not) how garbage pickup in the Poconos works

But I have to ask when does someone  become a local - I didn’t go to a local high school but I’ve been here 25 years am I a local or just another two plater

Maybe part of the solution is to stop considering people who just move here, pay local taxes ( including property) and who use local services regardless of where they work as tourists or transplants and welcome them as part of the community. Then we can all dislike the tourists 

I have no answers for you but understand the dilemma- I assume it’s an issue all touristy areas have to deal with - have lived in Vermont near Ski resorts and there are similar viewpoints maybe it’s forever the divide between townie and tourist

I will service your hive throughout the first warm season, checking for any signs of disease and performing standard maintenance on the hive monthly, I can also show you how to do it yourself if you're interested in learning. I have over 5 years of experience at my family apiary which sells some amazing local honey in Honesdale. I can also provide info on getting your hive registered for selling your sweet gold! Believe me, it's easier than you think, and is very much something that once you're all set up, you can afford one day every now and then to maintain. Think of it as a garden that is already established and ready to provide!  
  
Again, I will build the hive, complete with an electric fence around it to prevent any curious animals if your location is near the woods, materials, bees, and queen are all provided as well as my monthly maintenance and quality checks for this upcoming april-first frost. I will close off the hive for the winter season and provide you with info on opening it back up in the spring. At that point, you'll already have some knowledge and hopefully experience working with your new investment.  
  
If you're looking to have enough honey to sell at the end of the season, I strongly recommend 3-5 hives and for a fee can extract and bottle the honey for you. Otherwise, I can provide info on how to do it yourself with the materials and links that I personally use on the farm.  
  
What are you waiting for? This would make a wonderful Christmas gift to a significant other or to your own family that they can cherish for generations! With a season of experience, you can also become a beehive inspector with the state of PA and embark on a new career!  
  
Contact me asap and we can work out all the details, I can survey your space, and make a date this spring where I can build you a new adventure!  
  
If you decide down the line, that it isn't something you can keep. I will take down your hive and the bees for free if it's still the 1st season.  
  
I service a 30 Mile radius from Greentown PA 18426

"As an outsider who moved here several years ago before the recent 'influx', I am glad there are more families like us moving in here.

Yes, we are more well off compared to the families who have stayed and weathered the area's economic devastation after the fall of coal mining.

But we have a better understanding of what it takes to succeed in business. So many business owners here don't seem interested in succeeding. As a customer, it often feels like I'm bothering them because I need their service. I'm not rude, I just expect them to...want my business? Care about customer satisfaction? The customer service attitude needs readjusting and thankfully out of town folks are providing some much needed competition and training.

The whole 'you aren't anything if you aren't from here'... it's rooted in racism. There, I said it. It's disgusting. Any reference to 'ghetto' or 'urban' or 'big city' is flat out racism or antisemitism, even if they don't realize it. I'm not a person of color but I sure as hell don't look like a local - I have zero genes of German descent. When I moved here, people were extremely rude. I have lived in multiple other places (rural, suburban, urban) and never encountered the type of coldness and cliquey-ness that I have from the people here. Since when is it okay to respond to a smile and a hello with a blank stare? It's completely rude. People will intentionally withhold information unless you're affiliated with a group that they know. Neighbors treat you with hostility simply because you're not 'from' here. Thankfully there are good people, but there are so many local a**holes thinking the exact same way that you are OP.

"NY resident here who absolutely has loved his time in the poconos.  I certainly understand the intention of the post, I've seen the same thing myself, but this is painting with a very wide brush.   I love the area, I go out of my way to try to keep the area in good shape.  I pick up garbage that isn't even mine, repair broken property and donate to local charities in hopes of helping the local community.  I know others who do the same.  There seems to be a local mindset that will never be accepting of NJ/NY residents no matter how much they try to help, and at the same time, will be completely accepting of life long Poconos residents even if they treat the place like a total garbage dump.  Or seem to think, lifelong Poconos residents would never do that, they can do no harm (wow).   Truly unfortunate.I've seen PLENTY of locals in the community that are not helping the community at all.  While I can certainly see the desire to keep people out of the community, it 100% has it's drawbacks too.   There are certainly areas of the poconos that are badly in need of an economic turn around.   Places that need funding and improving.  There's plenty of people who seem to be of the mindset, we don't care....stay away.  Until they need funding for roads, community projects, improvements, etc. etc.  Until local businesses start shutting down, jobs start disappearing.  I know the community well enough to know that all I just said doesn't make a difference.  That's very unfortunate and short sided.   There's plenty that both sides can gain from each other.  The NY/NJ crew should DEFINITELY be more respectful of the local community, but there's plenty the locals could work on as well.  Sadly, I've seen the mindset of ""if you don't like it don't come here"".  Over and over and over.   Let me give you the other side of the coin.  Local businesses need money.  These people coming in have money and do spend it.  Housing prices have gone up.  I guess you could view this as  both good and bad though.

"I want to preface my comment by saying that I don’t intend it to be hostile. My parents moved us to the “Switzerland of the Poconos” in the early 90s and there was a lot of hostility from locals about being transplants. I have no problem answering questions from those who have relocated here or are coming here for work. 

However, the constant deluge of “where should I vacation” and “where’s the best place for me to buy a property and then it into an air b n b” type posts is super annoying. You want to buy real estate in the Poconos? How about you call a local realtor (or 5) and ask them your questions and give them the opportunity to earn your business. At least make an effort to contribute to the local economies in ways that support family-sustaining employment. 

If a FAQ will help stem the flow of these requests, I’m all for it. I do think it’s important, however, to offer a reality check — people do live here full time, and the Poconos do not simply exist as a fun getaway for moneyed vacationers.",t2_6aasgbka,relaxed-bread,0,1632653477.0,0,t1_hebz20c,hebz20c,True,PawelW007,t3_pvk1lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poconos/comments/pvk1lb/would_a_real_estatetourist_guide_for_this/,Would a Real Estate/Tourist Guide for this Subreddit Be a Good Idea?,/r/Poconos/comments/pvk1lb/would_a_real_estatetourist_guide_for_this/hebz20c/,1,r/Poconos,0,1

"I’m for assisting if I can. I admire what you are suggesting here. My take is there is going to be growth whether we like it or not. It’s not worth being a butt and making it harder I think. I’d rather help those trying to establish themselves instead of add to the negativity and toxicity.

For one compiling info on the different school districts and such.

A micro-project I’d like to see eventually would be like an adaptation type program. Help youth transition to the pace of the Poconos, and set up programs for children of commuter parents.

A lot of transplant parents don’t take that into account. They want a better life and environment but forget that there is A LOT less to do and leave children/teens unsupervised…the school system then has to handle that burden.

I'm a real estate agent in Pike County. I agree with another poster that you should think about Lake Wallenpaupack again - it is very busy on weekends in the height of summer, but it's so big, there is lots of space to kayak. 

Right now I see one cabin available for sale in Promised Land, which is above your budget ($199,900). I see another home that has rights to Twin Lakes that might be something you want to consider.

Yes - Francis E. Walter is very nice and kayak friendly. We take the kids there all the time. You could look close to White Haven and it’s neighboring little towns.

"I'm not an expert on the little lakes around the Poconos but I would HIGHLY suggest you give Wallenpaupack another chance

Yes, there are a lot of HOAs around Wallenpaupack but you're going to get your best bang for your buck there. Plus, home values will continue to go up on Lake Wally.

I kayak in Wally, so you have to realize that the lake is only busy Saturday and Sunday. Monday through Thursday it's dead especially in the off-season. You're perfectly safe when you follow the coast line around Wally even in the summer.

Full disclosure, the Poconos doesn't have a vibe. Honesdale is slowly getting there but you're not getting cool vibes in the Poconos.

"Hi.  
  
The good news is there are lots of options in and around Philadelphia. I also like your idea to try some airBnBs first. I did that in Seattle and it gave me time to figure out what I liked and didn't like without having to make a significant dollar investment first. You can get to know some residents and ask the ones with similar interests and values what appeals to them too.   
  
Even in terms of finding an AirBnB, I'm going to suggest starting with a quick look around different Philadelphia neighborhoods. This post ([22 Philadelphia Neighorhoods](https://www.phillyaptrentals.com/blog/ultimate-philadelphia-neighborhood-guide/)) is a good place to start. It has a nice chart comparing neighborhoods wrt rent ad parking affordability, greenery, restaurant and shopping scene, and proximity to parks. 

Lastly, it's important to note that there's a lot of variety across different neighborhoods. Take your time. There are lots of beautiful green and spacious parks and the Atlantic Ocean and the Pocono Mountains are only an hour and a half away!

"If your home is on the smaller side, a mini-split heat pump may be all you need to heat and cool your home. Its ability to heat one room or space individually may prove a better option than incorporating a larger system into your home. It’s also a great option for older homes that don’t already have ductwork in them. You’ll save money by not having the ductwork installed but still accomplish the goal of having your home well heated.

"""Bad News"" is that if you wanted to walk to the Glen, it would be a two mile stretch, which is longer than you're looking for. Good news is that you'd be able to turn around at any time.  

If you want the coolest area for the kids, i'd go early and walk around at the Glen(parking at the closest lot) check out the hole in the wall, walk down to the river, and walk the D&L trail/trains if you want. Trying to be out of there by 9-10ish.   The area does get crowded with tourists like every other location and you're really best getting there early. Mid day gets to be an absolute zoo. Enjoy your meals, shops, tours in the middle of the day, get your hikes in early, you'll be able to enjoy the location so much more. 

The walk that you suggested is nice, flat, gravel, and will see the same type of people as on the other side of the river on the D&L(near the Glen).   I'd make sure to bend right at the bridge/tressel and head that way towards Glen Onoko instead of straight towards Nesquehoning.

"Along the river you will see plenty of bikers, but also people with pets and other young kids.  You'll also get to see the train running up and down the line.  Personally, as a local, i'd have no problem taking my young kids on a walk on the D&L Trail.  

Regarding Parking,  You can either park near at Glenn Onoko and hike north. (this is the path that you'll see the train) but will have more tourists. 

You can also park at the Jim Thorpe Marked and head south towards Lehighton on the D&L.  This path is used, but less than the one running north and you won't be seeing the trains. 

If you don't want the Lehigh, there is the Switchback Trail that runs along the Mauch Chunk Creek(Drive up Broadway all the way to the top, keep going and right before the water plan, turn left to Flag Staff Road to park). The Mauch Chunk Creek drains out of Mauch Chunk Lake Park flows down the mountain, directly under many of the houses and shops on Broadway and eventually dumps into the Lehigh. The Swtichback Trail is a much smaller path than the D&L but there is still parking, a good trout stream, and easy for kids to talk. 

The Switchback trail system is very nice, but again, isn't right on the Lehigh and you definitely won't be seeing the train here.",t2_cbfva,cw236085,0,1626442111.0,0,t1_h5e89ot,h5e89ot,False,PiBary,t3_ol1mn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poconos/comments/ol1mn7/kidfriendly_walkshikes_in_the_jim_thorpe_area/,Kid-friendly walks/hikes in the Jim Thorpe area,/r/Poconos/comments/ol1mn7/kidfriendly_walkshikes_in_the_jim_thorpe_area/h5e89ot/,1,r/Poconos,0,1

I second this.  It's a bit of a drive from Jim Thorpe area tho, but worth it in my opinions.  So many good trails up there.   Shades of Death is my #1 choice (ignore the silly name).

"well from what am seeing front platers come, buy land cheap , build big homes that fill the lot.
tear the trees down. and have big noisy partys , now this isnt all of them but most i see do this. 
i bought the 1/2 acre lot next to me 4 years ago for a great price. been offered 50k for it lol i wont sell mainly because i like the trees and privacy. 

as far as builders , sorry i am not impressed with any contractors up here.  i do it all myself.
i would definitely get lots of references from anyone you get.

"Oof, I hope someone corrects me, but I don’t think all of these requirements are possible. 

Maybe Lake Harmony area for the water and bars? Pocono Lakes have a ton of water views, and lakes vary immensely in size.

It’s impossible to find a Pocono spot that is over 5 hours from Philly, and I’m pretty sure nearly everything falls within 1.5-3 hours. 

Mid driving range for grocery stores is very standard, and I find Pocono Lakes to be pretty family friendly in general. I think the hardest requirement is definitely the walking distance to a bar.

"I recommend coming a little further south toward Jim Thorpe. Still in the heart of the Pocono mountains but less of a city vibe and more of a welcoming, smaller town vibe. So many things to do, classy tourism keeps the area afloat, and a great diverse + updated school district. There’s many of developments in between Stroudsburg/Jim Thorpe that are still JT school district. Rt. 903 has places such as Lake Harmony, Towamensing Trails, Bear Creek Lakes, Penn Forest Township, etc. Turnpike is right here so easy access still to NJ/NY/Lehigh Valley/Wilkesbarre/Stroudsburg/Philly.",t2_ba3164nv,somewhereinthemntns,0,1624465295.0,0,t1_h2s6v9l,h2s6v9l,True,burntCheezits2,t3_o63qg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poconos/comments/o63qg8/is_stroudsburg_a_good_place_for_families_to_live/,Is Stroudsburg a good place for families to live?

"My wife and I are also considering Stroudsburg as a potential vacation/early retirement location due to its proximity to a major international airport (Newark), small college town, hospital, Shawnee ski resort in the winter, Delaware river in the summer, lots of waterfalls and hiking within a short drive, close to shipping centers, variety of dining options that are difficult to find in other Pocono towns. We don't know much about the crime or people in general but it does seem to offer a bit more than other locations in the area.",t2_f51wh,dswails2729,0,1624445943.0,0,t1_h2r6x80,h2r6x80,True,burntCheezits2,t3_o63qg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poconos/comments/o63qg8/is_stroudsburg_a_good_place_for_families_to_live/,Is Stroudsburg a good place for families to live?
