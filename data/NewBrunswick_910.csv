Confirmed but really the only places it looks ""depressed"" is main St or down on water St by the river. There's new housing going up and some new/-er business interests on main St, but the cost of living reflects it. Considering the proximity to larger business centers anyway, it works out.

Oh is that what all that is? Really couldn't quite work out what the plan was.

Some people complain about homeowners not occupying properties and renting out to Rutgers students. My gut tells me most of the HP student renters are grad students anyway.

If you're looking to get on the ownership train, I assume you've already seen River Ridge Terrace. It's low in comparison; be prepared to fork over more like $350, if not more, for most homes. The North Side has a slight reputation of being fancier.

Be cautious about homes near the Mill Brook (north side of HP) because of localized flooding. Unless you live right next to Johnson or Donaldson Parks, the Raritan won't seep into your basement.

"Pros (to me): Highland park is fairly liberal. It's a quirky town- lots of grad students, phd's, professors, therapists, and a large jewish community. The local reformed church is super liberal - pro lgbtq, prison abolition, etc. I'm not involved, but it seems like good vibes if that's your thing. There's also mckenna's, a local weight lifting gym that is also very lgbtq friendly.

I think it's a great place with a nice community. It's super walkable, very cute, and the parks are nice. Everyone I've met here so far has been down to earth & friendly with a ""we're in it together"" kind of vibe. There's also a weekly farmer's market, killer coffee shop & great local bar (singular) called Pino's with open mics & music. 

Cons (to me): It has the highest taxes in middlesex county due to a lack of businesses and small population. Properties tend to be small for the price. It also has a weird ""north side"" / ""south side"" thing going on, where the north side is more ritzy (it generally has bigger and better kept properties).. although I don't think anyone **truly** treats anyone differently because of it.",t2_dwfad,manual_combat,0,1637618116.0,0,t1_hlox2pq,hlox2pq,True,[deleted],t3_qzuhad,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewBrunswickNJ/comments/qzuhad/anyone_live_in_highland_park_thinking_of_buying_a/,Anyone live in Highland Park?

"Thanks for caring. Unfortunately most people don’t know to call 211 when there is a need for social services, such as housing, child care and job training. The point of entry for getting help through the Homeless Hotline is to call 211. Through there, everyone is assessed and sent to the agency best able to help. Most people can/will get help through the Board of Social Services or any of the other homeless help agencies in the County. 
There is also street outreach teams that regularly speaks to unsheltered people living on the street, and help them find either temporary shelter- either at the men’s or family shelters, or hotel placements, until permanent housing becomes available. 

Elijah’s Promise serves free hot meals everyday, and also has new good quality free coats and other items such as hygiene kits. The street outreach teams also provide items such as sleeping bags, tents and blankets to people who refuse case management services.

"in/around NB:

for restaurants, i have the following recommendations:

1. Frog and the Peach (price: \*\*\*\*, food: \*\*\*\*, atmosphere: \*\*\*\*\*)
2. Salt Seafood and Oyster Bar (price: \*\*\*\*, food: \*\*\*\*, atmosphere: \*\*\*)
3. Destination Dogs (price: \*\*\*, food: \*\*\*\*, atmosphere: \*\*\*\*)
4. Pizza, generally from any given pizza place on Easton Ave (price: \*, food: \*\*\*\*, atmosphere: \*\*)

for history, i recommend equally:

1. east jersey old town
   1. this is at the end of johnson park, a park right between highland park and new brunswick. take a look at a town from new jersey from before it was a state!
2. rutgers college ave campus and library
   1. walk around! read a plaque! pick a book from the 1600s right off the shelf in the alexander library!
3. the zimmerli art museum
   1. I haven't been since Covid, but it was wonderful pre-Covid. I still remember the soviet art showing fondly from a few years ago.

for nature, i recommend:

1. the tow path (""Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park Trail"") at the corner of landing lane and george street in new brunswick.
   1. As regards appreciating the northeastern fall, there is no better hike to see the beauty of the leaves falling.
   2. parking might be tricky. the parking nearby is bad, so you might have to walk a couple of blocks from your car.

for orchards, i recommend:

1. battleview orchards in freehold.
   1. very historic, it's the site of molly pitcher's well. it also has wonderful, immense orchard grounds, great apple selection and tasty cider/cider donuts.",t2_17zfyt,mr_sneep,0,1633312327.0,0,t1_hfave9p,hfave9p,True,jesuisjusteungarcon,t3_q0m3ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewBrunswickNJ/comments/q0m3ps/things_to_do_in_the_area_restaurant/,Things to do in the area + restaurant recommendations,/r/NewBrunswickNJ/comments/q0m3ps/things_to_do_in_the_area_restaurant/hfave9p/,6,r/NewBrunswickNJ,0,6

"The goal is to formally deprioritize and defund arrests and convictions related to possessing and growing naturally occurring entheogens within the city. Psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline/peyote, and ayahuasca are all in this category. Decriminalize Nature groups have succeeded in passing this initiative in 7 other cities in the US including Washington, DC; Ann Arbor, MI; and Oakland, CA. Like marijuana, these substances would still be federally illegal but local police would stop enforcing laws that punish people for possession.

These substances all have scientific studies supporting their value as medicine to combat PTSD, depression, anxiety, alcoholism, and addiction. It is important to decriminalize instead of waiting for medical legalization because therapy with these substances costs thousands of dollars per session and will remain inaccessible until we allow people to use them within their own homes. This doesn’t change laws making it illegal to drive or be in public while intoxicated, so it really is just about granting people bodily autonomy and permission to heal at home.

The science is already there and indigenous people have been using these substances for thousands of years.",t2_mrkmxla,prolongedexistence,0,1631194230.0,0,t1_hc6gltc,hc6gltc,False,[deleted],t3_pkwoov,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewBrunswickNJ/comments/pkwoov/decriminalize_nature_new_brunswick_is_trying_to/,Decriminalize Nature New Brunswick is trying to get entheogens (naturally occurring psychedelics) decriminalized in the city.

It's an older part of Edison, so the infrastructure can no longer handle the number of people who drive around (not to mention you should avoid Rt 27 at all costs). The New Brunswick station can also be a mess during rush hour. If you don't mind parking in a parking deck, that will be your only option. 

I don't know where you are thinking about buying a home, but I would prioritize the school district for your child, which would arguably be Edison particularly North Edison which would mean you not using either train station.

Also, I'm sorry if this is more information than you were asking for haha.

"Transportation engineer here. I don’t think there would need to be environmental studies. That being said, it would probably take a month or two to get a left turn signal and lane added. Assuming the signal controller and conduit can handle an additional signal head, they would just need to perform a traffic impact study, which don’t take too long.

Typically something small like adding a left turn lane is not a budget issue, but an issue of not having enough engineering staff or field crew available

"1. Is there a reason your SO needs to drive, or is train doable? Train commute to Newark is always going to be faster than driving for reasons that other folks already mentioned. I commuted to Newark for a year and the train was always better and faster. Plus, I could catch a couple extra ZZZs on the train as well.
2. My fiancée and I are in our mid-20s and we love it. A lot of our friends are in town. She's a professional and I'm blue collar, and most of our friends in town are a good mix of the two. There's always somewhere to go for a fancy date night, or a casual night at the dive bar if that's your scene. There's a lot of stuff that NB doesn't have that other cities might, but that means it's ripe with opportunity to create the kind of community you want around you. A lot of folks just come here for college and don't really leave the college part of town, and their impressions on NB are artifacts of that experience. But it's a real place with real shit going on. I love this city more than anywhere else I've lived(I'm originally from NYC, have lived in Philly and Chicago as well). 
3. If you can avoid the 6th Ward where most of the college kids and frat bros live, then do so. We live in the 1st Ward and we absolutely love it. We're kind of on the outskirts, but we have quick access to great food all around us, it's quiet and peaceful, but we're still only like a 20 minute walk to the other side of town/train station.

"1. The commute up the Turnpike is totally dependent on when you are travelling - if they leave early on the way there (7am or earlier) and head home not in the dead center of rush hour, traffic on the TURNPIKE shouldn't be a dealbreaker.  Local traffic within either one of those places is what likely contributes to most of the variance on the commute time.  I don't know as much about Newark, but I can definitely confirm traffic on Rt 1-9 in and around JC can be totally miserable during rush hour.
2. I'm in your boat age-wise and have been living in NB for almost a year with my wife (most of which was during lockdowns).  I think it's really dependent on what kind of activities you are in to.  There are some great restaurants and parks, but it has been a bit harder to organically meet new people out and about than it was in other NJ cities I've lived in (Hoboken, JC, Asbury Park).  In my opinion, nightlife seems to cater either 100% to college kids or 100% to adults going on nice dates alone or with friends.  If you already have some friends close by who dont mind coming to you, its can be a great place to host a get together.
3.

"Ditto with using two types of locks, usually a U-lock through the frame, rear wheel, and post, and then a wire to the front wheel. I would also recommend [Bicycle Bolts](https://www.bicyclebolts.com) to secure your components (like your seat) and [Kryptonite Wheelnutz](https://www.kryptonitelock.com/en/products/product-information/current-key/001768.html) to secure your wheels.

"I sympathize with you OP.  I have always been extremely cautious about bringing my bike to most places, preferring to never leave it unattended. I wish this extreme level of precaution wasn't necessary, but here we are. I locked it up for maybe 10 minutes while I ran into Walmart in Edison to use the bathroom, and when I come out there is a noticeable slice in the metal lock cord. Someone had unsuccessfully tried to cut while I was indisposed. I consider myself very lucky in that regard, but yeah most urban areas are no place to lock up a bike. The NB train station is especially sketchy IMO. Maybe you can lock it up at a Rutgers building such as the Yard, and walk the few blocks. I think you'd have better luck there.

Listen, the point is that if this construction were FOR New Brunswick, they would take steps to make the city look and feel good, like burying the garage underground. Instead its IN the city, but designed so people who live outside it can drive in as cheaply as possible. Underground costs more. They dont want to spend the money because they dont care about the residents and the Mayor doesnt care either.

When you go to signup for membership they make you confirm your address, if its a NB address, they automatically give you the subsidized price. If you give them an address outside of NB, they give you the higher price. I'm not sure on specifics because I haven't been a member there in years but your prices seem accurate.

"Everyone on this sub always says ""it depends on your budget"". The newer apartments downtown are close to the train station, but also very overpriced, and there isn't a bigger park, other than Boyd Park, close by for your dog. Buccleuch Park and Johnson Park (which is across the river) are much bigger and more easily accessed away from downtown

That being said, I like New Brunswick a lot, it's a fun place and has some of the best restaurants in Middlesex County. And for people who live close to them, the park space is great. It's also very easy to get to the Turnpike for your girlfriend's commute (also depends on what part of the city you live in).

If you really value the ""quietness"" of a town,  you won't get that in New Brunswick haha. If that is something you care about, and also that ""safe"", walkable downtown area, Metuchen would be a great town.

Metuchen has a train station, a few stops north of NB and probably slightly cheaper tickets, has a great downtown, Roosevelt Park is very big and close, and there is also a dog park not too far as well. It's also quieter minus during rush hour. The downside is that the new apartments are also overpriced, but less than ten minutes away from the train station. The town has everything I imagine you two would want, so if you can afford or are willing to overlook apartment prices, I think it's a great place to live.",t2_28omioc,jollyjam1,0,1620142724.0,0,t1_gwx2l50,gwx2l50,True,padrewarbucks,t3_n4qc76,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewBrunswickNJ/comments/n4qc76/commuting_to_moorestown_nj_and_nyc/,"Commuting to Moorestown, NJ and NYC",/r/NewBrunswickNJ/comments/n4qc76/commuting_to_moorestown_nj_and_nyc/gwx2l50/,8,r/NewBrunswickNJ,0,8

"I went to Rutgers. Call it ""pre-med"" if you want. It's really health sciences. It got me to PT school and a doctorate. I had a blast at Rutgers but it's not easy. People think it's just a place to fool around but I got a good education and was well prepared for grad school. Sciences classes are known as ""weeding out classes"" because everyone who thinks they want to go into health care will find out quick if it's really for them or not. These classes are huge (hundreds) and the teacher won't have a clue who you are unless you make a point to go to office hours. Don't expect anyone to hold your hand here. Not for anything. You need to be organized and get your work done but you can still have a lot of fun too. You'll need to be proactive to get to know a few of the teachers so you can get recommendations and potential research opportunities. I applied for research and had a tough time because most opportunities are given to people the teachers know. Also fyi lots of science teachers do not always speak English so well and it can make learning a bit difficult. The chem department is awful too.
