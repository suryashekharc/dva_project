As with all real estate transactions--location location location. You can change a lot of things about a property...except where it is.

"We just went through this last summer, most decent custom builders were quoting a minimum 12-14 months, some were even 18+ months. 

There are great advantages in this market to building, mainly not having to deal with the inevitable bidding wars when a home hits the market.

One downside, for us at least, was that we were renting. Those additional 12-18 months of paying rent was an extra expense that really stung (rent was way higher than any mortgage I've ever had, or will have).

I grew up in area much poorer than “Burrito Springs” (the nickname for the Hispanic side of Bonita) so I appreciate the hard work & efforts of those no-frill restaurants.

Another good spot in Naples is Mister 01, which is a pizza chain but the taste is def more mom & pop.

If you’re into bbq and have the time (this will put you past RSW) McCarters BBQ in Fort Myers is an absolute must (as no-frills as it gets, it’s just an outdoor barrel cooker & an old run down home? where they set up shop). It’s off Martin Luther King BLVD and Cranford Ave and no other BBQ spot here comes close. You also have Spice on MLK which is a Jamaican restaurant as well as Hooks which is a fast food fried southern seafood spot that we also have back in Miami.

"You should understand that most of SW Florida is considered a ""resort"" area for older pot-pellied retirees and tourists, which drives up the cost of living considerably, the cost for rental properties and housing; and most doctors and specialists are booked up months in advance. The one main traffic artery, Route 41 can take 2 hours or longer to travel from Fort Myers to Naples. For younger people there are plenty of dive bars and ""Asian therapy"" massage parlors, dive restaurants and not much else other than Fort Myers Beach which can easily take 1 1/2 to 2 hours to drive to on a low-traffic, off-season day with there still being people every ten feet or so and minimal parking. 

If I absolutely HAD to move to the area in my 20s to 30s I would target downtown Sarasota or get as close to that area as possible or Lakewood Ranch. The demographics are very different there with many more younger people, more to do, more and cleaner beaches, more nightclubs and things to do, gourmet restaurants, more museums (I don't think SW FL even has one that has actual artwork from known artists), some ethnic diversity, lots to do for dating life, all kinds of houses of worship and all kinds of modern stores (and the only Apple and Microsoft stores in the entire region), state and national parks and forests. If you visited downtown Sarasota (you can park at the Whole Foods for free) and just walk around there and compared that to downtown Cape Coral (or downtown Fort Myers) you'll see it like night and day.

To tell you which I like best is difficult because they’re very very different as far as offerings, size, etc.  
I’m partial to a small town vibe with a lil’ culture thrown in so Sarasota is my fave, but St Pete has a similar vibe while being much larger (geographically) and having access to the “big city” things like top musicians coming in concert, sports teams, an International airport, and it’s only a 2hr drive across I-4 to Orlando, or a couple hours north & you’re at all the crystal clear springs. They also have beaches galore and awesome restaurants.

"Well, the area is known to be far cheaper than larger cities, so that's a huge part of it's appeal. If you drive from North Fort Myers to Naples on the single main street, which is called Route 41 / Tamiami Trail, you'll quickly discover that much if not most of the area is abandoned strip malls, dive bars, fast food restaurants, and medical offices, and then abandoned gas stations and it's all bumper-to-bumper. Once you begin to enter Naples, you'll see very nice, clean, modern gigantic outdoor malls with pretty little bridges, cafes, gated housing communities as part of them with large private hospitals for each one, lakes and canals criss-crossing the rich gated communities with their own private clubs and golfing communities and private beaches with security and yacht clubs. One of my two dentists is in this area and the drive is very relaxing and scenic. You won't see beat-down apartment buildings behind gas stations as you would in Fort Myers or s\*\*\*\* kicker dive bars with knocked over trash cans as you would in the northern part of the area, either.

The redneck biker areas are far cheaper than Naples, Sarasota, and other, nicer areas, hence the appeal. Also, the nicer areas don't want biker parades and confederate flags waving around every ten feet, strip clubs, ""Asian Therapy"" massage parlors at strip malls, and beer cans littering the streets and parks. 

The pot-bellied tourists are tourists from all over, usually very wealthy, and of course many locals who love to eat at the diver bars. 

I live here, too, but unlike others, don't see it as Paradise On Earth. It's just a lower-middle class town with warm weather. It's a decent place to invest in property to flip and profit from. It's decent to live in if you don't care about the issues I've pointed out or aren't' working for a living, don't mind the angry biker guys, racist views, lack of diversity, or high cost of housing, or lack of cultural activities. 

Just my humble view of the area.

"Traffic is very bad all over the area. Considering that Fort Myers has about a quarter of the population density of Sarasota but with comparable (or worse) traffic, I'd take Sarasota still just because it has so much more to offer in terms of quality of life. In Fort Myers, traffic is maybe cut in half when tourists are gone. Since COVID hit, more and more people it seems don't leave and are here year-round (don't know why since they're actually better off in Canada with their National Healthcare Service and higher quality of overall healthcare and no gun violence issues as we have in the US). 

I'd agree with the other poster that traffic is congested during the pot-bellied tourist season, but still better than trying to drive from Baltimore to DC or driving through Atlanta. Of Fort Myers / Naples / versus Sarasota, as I said, I'd still pick Sarasota for a higher quality of life. In Fort Myers there are no delis just dive bars and ""Asian therapy"" massage parlors and cheap dinner theater and beer-can riddled beaches crowded with angry biker rednecks and more tourists. In Sarasota you get bigger cleaner beaches, fewer rednecks and biker BBQ joints with trash cans kicked over, art museums, national concert acts regularly, private beaches nearby, walkable clean downtown, cafes, jazz, a Chamber of Commerce that does things, lots of clean parks, national parks and forests, large open space areas to go for hikes, it's just cleaner, more modern, but larger and better across the board.",t2_3jdj2dt6,47952,0,1646247875.0,0,t1_hz32enk,hz32enk,False,Lkyzch,t3_t4lyjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWFL/comments/t4lyjn/leaving_chicago_for_south_florida_where_to_live/,Leaving Chicago for South Florida - Where to live and where to avoid?,/r/SWFL/comments/t4lyjn/leaving_chicago_for_south_florida_where_to_live/hz32enk/,1,r/SWFL,0,1

"Yeah, Sarasota is where we would live if we could sell this house in Fort Myers and HAD to live in Florida. UTC is one of the malls we used to go to to shop. Fort Myers, Naples, Punta Gorda, no other areas short of Tampa or Miami have anything like that, or Lakewood Ranch. Downtown Sarasota is a area in which you could walk from Whole Foods, walk to cafes and coffee shops and a giant library and museums, walk to the little beach / port area with docks and boat leaving it. You can get a house in nearby areas with some decent land, and be minutes away from delis, tailors, doctors, modern hospitals. My Primary Care Physician is in Sarasota and she is one of the few who uses a patient portal, has teledoc, requires patients wear masks or bars them from entering, and is competent and has some personality. My dentist is also in Sarasota and one of the very few in the area where all staff are fully vaccinated and actually said they believe COVID is real and take all precautions possible to keep patients safe there. 

I grew up in the South, in Virginia, and like some country music, enjoy Southern writers, have friends who are considered rednecks, but I don't care for the love of guns, violence over logical problem solving, common racism, anti-technology anti-science and anti-education views, and alot that goes with the whole pot-bellied angry redneck type of character that is common in the more poor, run-down areas.

We went to Sarasota weekly before COVID came to get groceries (their Whole Foods are bigger and have more variety, as does their Coscto), to visit larger and cleaner parks, to visit actual art museums and go to regular concerts, or take a boat trip or just walk around downtown. The area is also surrounded by large parks and very close to a national forest and national parks. The traffic is less off-season when fewer tourists are there, with peak traffic always in the morning and between 4-6 PM. 

Miami is fun, but it's more of a party kind of vibe, much more expensive, more congested and crowded, smaller and fewer parks, and gets hit more by hurricanes.",t2_3jdj2dt6,47952,0,1646243899.0,0,t1_hz2rxvt,hz2rxvt,False,Lkyzch,t3_t4lyjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWFL/comments/t4lyjn/leaving_chicago_for_south_florida_where_to_live/,Leaving Chicago for South Florida - Where to live and where to avoid?,/r/SWFL/comments/t4lyjn/leaving_chicago_for_south_florida_where_to_live/hz2rxvt/,1,r/SWFL,0,1

Sarasota seems to be the popular choice - I was looking at Bradenton as well but everyone refers to it as bradentucky. I saw Sarasota has a nice mall as well (UTC) along with a bunch of “upscale” stores that are at least considered upscale here like whole foods. The mullet rednecks are people I’d rather avoid if at all possible hahaha I picture “Florida man” when you wrote that. Is the traffic in Sarasota bad all year or just during the tourist season?

"I'd go to Sarasota. We live in Fort Myers and don't care for it. Fort Myers Beach takes an hour and a half to get to with traffic, tourists every ten feet, water filled with red tide and beer cans in the sand, and dive bars everywhere. Downtown Sarasota or anywhere in Sarasota is ten times better: there are young people there with real businesses, museums with real art (as opposed to cheap dinner theater here for retirees and no real art museums), doctors in Sarasota are better and there are more of them, there are more and bigger and nicer more modern malls there with more technology and more to do, bigger and better parks and cleaner and bigger beaches and you're closer to larger cities. 

If we HAD to live in Florida, we would go to Sarasota. Miami is very expensive, very crowded, flooding often, gets hit by hurricanes annually, Naples is rich retirees but no culture or diversity or real nightlife. Sarasota is the best of everything. I used to go to networking events there and loved the restaurants, we'd go to the art museums and quaint book shops, and loved downtown Sarasota. 

Fort Myers is all rich, white, pot-bellied retirees, pot-bellied tourists, or pot-bellied mullet-wearing rednecks wanting to fight and argue and throw beer cans into the parks and beaches. Naples is much more upscale, but similar. Sanibel and Captiva are islands and have really nothing to do except their private beaches but get slammed with hurricanes every year. Punta Gorda is much more small town and more isolated and more redneck but might be okay if you only want warm weather and can dig that vibe. Port Charlotte and North Port are closer to Sarasota but more isolated rural type areas.",t2_3jdj2dt6,47952,0,1646238574.0,0,t1_hz2dxjr,hz2dxjr,True,Lkyzch,t3_t4lyjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWFL/comments/t4lyjn/leaving_chicago_for_south_florida_where_to_live/,Leaving Chicago for South Florida - Where to live and where to avoid?,/r/SWFL/comments/t4lyjn/leaving_chicago_for_south_florida_where_to_live/hz2dxjr/,2,r/SWFL,0,2

"Venice, FM, Naples, etc. are all going to have very little for you to do if you're in your 20s and still looking for typical 20-something things to do.

Tampa, St. Pete, etc. are much better options with a much higher number of early career types so you'll have better dating and friend opportunities.

The original town of Bonita Springs (just north of Naples) is kind of like an old Mexican village. I like it.

It might be worth your time to check it out.  
I was looking at some strange, but cute, townhomes in this area for my sister.  They were only 600sqft with a car port,  and still selling for just over $100k, because they are so small.  I like them.

"For more of a city vibe, I would maybe recommend checking out Tampa or St Petersburg. 

Sarasota is super nice, Naples is too, and you will pay a lot for it. 

Fort Myers is ok, I live here and love it, but a lot of people seem to hate it.  It has a ton of nature and beach options and is close enough to Sanibel, Naples, Sarasota, stuff like that. Orlando and Tampa are less than 3 hrs away, so there are options if you don't mind driving. 

I'm not a fan of Cape Coral, but a ton of people live there and love it. I feel it does have better restaurants and bars compared to Fort Myers, but it's not a long drive from Fort Myers, so there's that. 

Estero and Bonita are little towns in-between Fort Myers and Naples and I like them a lot, but they're pricey towns too.  

Compared to Chicago, the traffic down here is probably a lot better than what you're used to. I moved to Fort Myers from Boston and we heard a lot of complaints about the traffic down here and it turned out to be nothing compared to up north. 

Long story short, it's personal preference, so if you can, come down and explore to get the different vibes of these cities and towns. 

I think one thing just about everyone would agree on is avoid Lehigh Acres and some parts of Fort Myers.

"First off, very sorry for the circumstances forcing you to move here. Divorce with young children is tough on everyone. Based on your post, Grandma in Naples will become an important part of your and the children’s daily life, so you will need to account for that proximity for the first few years of your time here. Based on that, my suggestions are this - think short term (1-5 years) from a housing and work perspective. Housing has gotten ridiculously expensive in the entire state of Florida but basically everywhere else too. Despite that, you should be able to find apartments to rent in Bonita Springs or Estero that can work for you AND keep you within 15- 30 minutes of Naples. Next, look for a teaching job in Naples or those areas, which should cut down on your daily travel time for both work and the kids. People tend to undervalue their personal time, especially when young. You can recalibrate when circumstances change - child care, relationships, housing affordability, etc. - and trust me they will change.

"If you do things smart you can do well here.  Buy a duplex live in one side and rent the other side out.  Being its your primary residence you don't have to pay additional rental tax on it.  You will still likely need to pay something against the mortgage but far less then what you would pay in rent.  Doing this you will build equity in the property, and later if you want to sell it you can have a nice chunk of cash for a down payment on a house.  Or you may just decide to keep it and cashflow it, never hurts to have a $1,000 extra in the pocket each month.

When I found her she was laying in the street and looked like she had been starving to death. Her paw pads were torn and burned. It looked like she lived outside her whole life. 

She was deemed food aggressive/not adoptable from being starved. Otherwise the dog is loving and friendly. I can’t adopt her because I live in a motel and have a dog already that is not aggressive at all and can’t risk any fighting. Is there anyone out there that can help me save this dog? Besides her being food aggressive she was the sweetest dog. It took me a little time to gain her trust but when I did she licked my face and hands and showed me her belly. Looked like she had puppies before.

She may be best with someone without other pets.

I just called to check on her but they said I wild have to physically go there and they can’t give me updates over the phone they close at 3:30pm pleas someone help me save this dog!!

"Keeping extra change and extra cash deposits is a risk for being robbed.  Our insurance demands we minimize cash on hand as much as possible. Just in the past year, a Publix Pharmacy was robbed as was a Dollar General nearby.  The Dollar General at gunpoint, after hours where the bad-guys forced employees to re-enter the store (after they closed for the night) then had them open the safe up.  

Its also very inefficient from a cash management and discipline perspective.  Saturday *and* Sundays cash sales deposits tend to stay in the safe till Monday, which means two busiest days of retail sales worth of deposits are sitting in safe longer than they have to.

"Luckily we are in the information era and have all the information we seek at our finger tips. Based on your criteria it appears lifestyle is priority. Being that SWFL is dominated by more a mature demographic it limits locations with higher counts of younger age groups. Recent influx in real estate prices creates challenges for values, but if you plan on owning the property longer than 10-years short-term value concerns are reduced. As other respondents stated, there are many risks with building due to supply and labor issues that can increase costs throughout construction and delay completions. Another factor for construction is the lack of supply for land in good locations. 

I would start with the priority of lifestyle and filter down locations based on the age demographic and proximity to the retail/entertainment districts you seek. The website at the link below provides some great map tools using data from the 2020 census that allows you to pinpoint locations based on age which significantly reduces potential locations for you. If avoiding areas with high crime is a concern, which it should be if you seek great resale value then check out neighborhood scout maps which allows you to see areas with high crime. 

Based on what your saying you may want to check out the Mcgregor area where Mcgregor blvd, Winkler Ave, and College Pkwy meet as both maps we suggested show a higher percentage of 21-24 year olds in the area and reasonable crime rates. Plus you have easy access to Downtown FM via Mcgregor Blvd. or a growing retail/entertainment scene just over the cape coral bridge via College Pkwy.

"The state nor FPL do anything anymore as far as I know but I did get a federal tax credit of 26%. So I got a bit over $11000. On a side note I did have a little issue with the county. I have 4 plots of land. One that my house sits on, the piece beside me and the 2 pieces behind me. I had them all cleared but left the tall pine trees on the land behind me. The back of my home sits directly south and the tress were throwing a lot of shade. I called Steve Hazeltine to remove them. He came over and gave an estimate and said I would need to go to the county and obtain the permit myself. They make you draw a diagram of the tree locations and you have to measure the width of each tree. They charge you by the inch. Once the application was submitted a lady comes out to look everything over. So about a week later I received an email saying the permit was ready to be picked up. When I went to pick it up the young girl at the desk said yeah I have it but you're not going to be happy. The application was for 7 trees but I was only permitted to remove 2. I asked if I could speak with the girl that made the decision. When the lady came out the first thing she said was I figured you were going to be mad. I said I'm not mad, I'm confused. She said only 2 of the trees qualified. Well, you should charge me for all 7 because I'm taking them down. Oh, you can't do that. Umm, yes, yes I can and I'm going to. If you do I might have to fine you. That is your job and you certainly can do that. But understand that I looked up the penalties. The most you can fine me is $1000 per tree. I'm not trying to be a wise guy but that isn't going to change my lifestyle one bit so you really should just charge me for all 7. She didn't and I had all the trees taken down but I never heard another word about it.",t2_ipaaf,sudsaroo,0,1643843486.0,0,t1_hvcdxf1,hvcdxf1,False,wwholm88,t3_siw680,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWFL/comments/siw680/solar_panels/,Solar Panels?,/r/SWFL/comments/siw680/solar_panels/hvcdxf1/,2,r/SWFL,0,2

I live in Port Charlotte too. My electric bill averaged about $300 per month. I put solar on my roof a year ago. 39 panels at a cost of $43000. I used Harriman's from Sarasota. I tried to get different quotes but everyone except Harriman's wanted to just do emails. I knew it was going to be expensive and I wanted to talk to someone in person. On good months my bill is $9.78. That is a fee that FPL charges just to be connected to them whether you have solar or not. There is a bunch of paperwork that needs done but Dawn at Harriman's handled all of it. Because I have so many panels it changed the tier level rating so FPL required me to get a million dollar umbrella policy. Not a big deal. It's about $100 a year. I use The Time Agency in Punta Gorda and thankfully my agent knew all about it and provided one with just a phone call.  Some things you need to consider is location. In reference to the sun how does your house face? Are there any large trees that shade the roof? Are you concerned with the payback period? I don't think I can live long enough to have it pay for itself but I don't care. Also know that FPL is in no hurry to move things along. They have to approve everything before you start. Of course the county has to get involved too because you need a permit. FPL will change your meter once the job is complete. The new meter has the ability to run backwards so you can sell electricity back to FPL. Of course they charged a $400 interconnect fee. I'm sure you have more questions.

>People in Southwest Florida are frustrated, as workers’ wages are not going up as quickly as housing prices.
>  
>One real estate expert put it like this: The cost of housing is going up because the supply is low and demand is high. People are moving to Southwest Florida at an even faster rate. All these people need roofs over their heads, but it’s becoming more and more difficult to afford the perfect family home, much less sign any type of lease.
>  
>A report by FilterBuy shows that residents of the Cape Coral/Fort Myers metro area experienced an increase of 16.4% in the cost of living between 2010 and 2020, the eighteenth fastest such increase in the U.S.

>“You’ve got to do a lot of research and figuring out exactly what you can afford, because prices have increased dramatically,” said Shelton Weeks, professor and director of the Lucas Institute for Real Estate Development & Finance at Florida Gulf Coast University. “And, unfortunately, wages have not kept up with the home prices. So, you’re going to need to be prepared, make sure that you have your financing in order. And when you identify the home that you want to buy, you’re ready to act at that point in time.”
>  
>One Realtor told WINK News there have been more buyers than ever seen in the past. The biggest concern is that they don’t have the properties to show potential buyers, and the ones already available go quickly. If you find one you like, you had better be ready to move fast.
>  
>Realtor Devin Sweazy says a lot of her clients coming into Marco Island are relocating from the Midwest. Between the square footage and lifestyle they’d like and the low inventory, they can’t be as picky as they’d like.
>  
>“A lot of people, when they’re moving to Florida, are particular to their rear exposure,” Sweazy said. “They want the sunset view, or their goal would be to be on a canal and be in the water. But, unfortunately, because of inventory or pricing, there’s compromises to be inland. So the bigger concern, really, is just finding a home that will accommodate their family. And then, when you do, more than likely you’re in a bidding war.”
>  
>Sweazy also says the market has to reach a cap at some point. The population will probably continue to grow and the work force is going to have to grow with it to accommodate them.
>  
>So does anyone benefit? Weeks says if you’re selling an existing home or downsizing, you’ve certainly benefitted from housing prices, but not so much people who are working or trying to save up for a home. The increase in wages has not only not kept up with housing prices, it has been significantly below housing price increases. 
>  
>“Sellers’ biggest concerns are where will they go once their house sells?” Sweazy said. “Sure, they can sell for an incredible profit, but then they are in the same position as all the others buyers… sell high, buy high. What if they cant find something, what if nothing comes available, what if they are outbid—where will they go? What will they do? It is, unfortunately, what is contributing to inventory remaining low.""",t2_k11a2,Obversa,0,1643502340.0,0,t1_husdhwg,husdhwg,True,Obversa,t3_sfv1aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWFL/comments/sfv1aq/stagnant_wages_vs_rising_housing_costs_in_swfl/,Stagnant wages vs. rising housing costs in SWFL,/r/SWFL/comments/sfv1aq/stagnant_wages_vs_rising_housing_costs_in_swfl/husdhwg/,6,r/SWFL,0,6

In my area there is a service that helps people with going through and selecting options for insurance. It is free (a non-profit). 211 might help to see if there is one where you live.

"Just as you cross the bridge south leaving fmb and heading into lovers key there's a great spot with free-for-all parking. Head down that beach half a mile past all the people and you end up at the spot with the petrified pines right on the gulf. Helps you avoid the longer trek from busy parking lot and pricier parking at the actual lovers key SP. 

Barefoot Beach in Bonita has lots of parking, cost $6 - same as sanibel toll but is just as beautiful and easier to access.
Clam pass in North Naples is $6 too and is gorgeous with a highrise informative boardwalk through the mangroves. Caspersen Beach is the spot for sharks teeth. 

Sanibel in season can be a real mission with the traffic. It's pristine out there as well and has the best beaches for shells plus Ding Darling. If you have a full day and want a real wild island beach, take the ferry or rent a boat and head out to Cayo Costa. There's sandy trails, wild hogs, camping, and petrified trees lining the gulf. 

Bunche Beach is worth checking out in lieu of fmb or on the way to sanibel too. Good spot to explore mangrove creeks and see the tides. Cheap available parking but it's within the caloosahatchee river basin so not fully salt water. It used to be the black beach, then the gay beach. Kinda neat. 

If you're renting a beach house look into palm island. It's very chill, no cars on island, just golf carts - Beach is out your front door. I would avoid Fort Myers Beach and it's traffic like the plague.

"This is probably a dumb business decision. Definitely alienating a lot of his customer base..

But the irony in all these liberal on here getting upset about this is when I consult with any of my customers/clients.. The liberals will make their political stance known pretty much immediately and unapologetically without knowing my political beliefs. The arrogance is unreal. 

Which in turn, will either make me have to politely try to change conversation until they drop it or pretend I’m a liberal so they shut up and I can do my job. 

Every now and then I’ll have a conservative bring it up, but that time is few and far in between. Most never do, and that’s why I assume they are conservatives. 

The ones who ALWAYS harp on political identity are the liberals. Whether they are telling you their opinion or complaining about Conservatives . 

The whole political identity obsession is weird, and happens on both sides but liberals obsess WAY more than conservatives do. Whether they are outraged or just arrogantly word vomiting their beliefs on you as if it’s the spoken law..

"Yall do realize that 1.) As much as it may hurt your feelings SWFL, well the Majority of FL is a Republican state. 2.) And this one is very important, you as of this minute are a free citizen of this country and as that is, you are not required to live in FL period. You are free to travel to another state one that may or may not be a Dem strong hold. 3.) Contrary to popular belief we native Floridians could honestly care if anyone else moves to this state as a matter of fact we don't need your money we were doing fine before ""Let me sell you Florida."" started and would prefer if you would kindly return to you place of breeding.. And 4.) And this is a good one, noone really gives a fat rats ass how you feel about a sign you didn't pay for, for a service you most likely will never need.... Now I understand the allure of the temperature and the beach, but if you want to live here you should really try to assimilate and become a Floridain and not a whiny little bitch.

"I honestly don’t remember the name of the place. And yeah it was determined that it was not connected but at the time the speculation was  there. The funeral home thing and the skeletons being found happened close together. 

When I first moved to Cape Coral in the mid 1990s, there were 5 or 6 women found dead in the Caloosahatchee over several months. Then a man in the east coast was arrested with a woman tied up in his house. The man would spend one week a month in Ft Myers on business. After he was arrested, dead women stopped being found in the river. To my knowledge he was never charged with anything but the implication was he was a serial killer.  So ya know, there most likely have been a few around. These women were street walkers and in the groups who drop through the cracks. They are not always missed.
