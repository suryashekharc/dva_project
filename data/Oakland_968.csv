Ill admit to running reds when theres no oncominh traffic and coming to a complete stop to making sure no one is coming. And why shouldnt i?

The things you should look out for are people running red lights, people using the left turn lane to get ahead at the start of a green light, people using the bike lane in the same fashion, and folks generally being unaware.

You're in Adam's Point - see that building on Grand and Perkins? That's because a fire truck speeding down the road had to dodge from some asshole who pulled out without looking.

I'll also let you know that you shouldn't trust those pedestrian crossings they installed without looking the entire time - I use these to cross on Grand sometimes, and I have someone run one on me rather often. Wait until you're crossing through one of these and you see some fuckwad blast down the opposite lane through this before merging back to the right side.

Have you met the dudes who drive their sports cars, ATVs, and dirtbikes up and down the wrong way on Grand yet? They appear on the weekends and in the evenings on nice weekdays.

"Because the East Bay is where there’s more likely to be people from Yemen, Myanmar, and Sudan, and other such countries where shit has been raging for years and decades.

The real question is why are 99% of us so quiet about those atrocities that have been going on for decades and have death tallies around or over a million???

The media has duped us into only paying attention to conflicts involving white people who wear hoodies and jeans like us, or where the US military is sending soldiers. (They play on our emotions, and generally the viewers who tend to have money to donate to campaigns or buy shares/stocks in media companies, or already have said shares and stocks, are white people or others who have assimilated and sold out into white culture).

Why are we so quiet about Iraq, simply because US military is no longer there, even though it’s in far worse shape than it’s ever been?

Ukrainian citizens are also wealthier than those other parts of the world, and they have smartphones with cameras, and Twitter and Instagram to share what’s going on around them. Most citizens in the aforementioned parts of the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia have never even touched a smartphone before, and certainly not the ones who are struggling for daily food, water, shelter, and safety.

Also the East Bay is where you’re more likely to find someone from Latin America who’s brother/father/uncle was murdered in Mexico or Venezuela or who’s sister/mother was kidnapped and raped.

The East Bay is where you’re more likely to find a young black man who has been shot because they were misidentified as a target from a rival gang.

There’s actually real shit going on in the real world both locally and in other countries, and there has been for a long time. Ukraine is less than 5%-10% of it.

If you must stay within the narrow sliver of 1% of the world that mass media and social media is informing you about, you’d do yourself a huge favor by reading recent news about Angelina Jolie. She gets it.

EDIT: to quote OP “After all, if we say we’re against bias, we should be against all bias”

I 100% agree 💯

We should be against all bias, in this case we should be against bias that implies only the suffering of white people in other countries deserves our attention and sympathy.

And this also means we should be against the bias that the suffering of Asians, Arabs, and Africans around the world is less deserving of our money, attention, and sympathy than the suffering of white Europeans. As they’ve been dealing with atrocities equivalent to 2022 Ukraine on an ongoing basis for the past 5, 10, 20, 30 years.

2ND EDIT: And don’t forget Haiti either, which is literally in the backyard of the US. Even if you completely wipe out the 2010 earthquake from their history (since a big earthquake is a calamity that could plausibly hit wealthy Americans as Bay Areans saw in 1989), the corruption, poverty, and violence in Haiti is astounding. The 2010 earthquake and the smaller 2021 earthquake were just more fuel to the fire. Also, the president was assassinated last year, and with an unstable government like that, there’s not a clear enforced universally-agreed line of succession. So what little stability there previously was, crumbled. Gangs have taken over the country.

What the American mass media and American social media outlets won’t tell you is how countries like Haiti, Iraq, and Philippines were occupied by the US (either officially or unofficially) and the US left them worse than they found them.

We all know about the 3,000-5,000 US soldiers killed in Iraq. And the 3,000 New Yorkers killed by 9/11 terrorists. And we love to remember them and memorialize them, which shouldn’t be taken away.

But how many of us know about the 100,000-200,000 Iraqi civilians who were killed at the hands of the US military? Where’s their memorial?

"The subsitution test doesnt hold ground here for the same reason why there arent large protests. Theres already a massive response and show of support for ukraine. The entire world has cut off russia for the most part, and providdd billions of dollars in weaponry and aide to ukraine. Thats a massive difference feom the lukewarm responses to other civil rights matters where companies try to straddle the fence and most people turn a blind eye. And Ukrainians are rightfully being shown tons of compassion as war refugees as they flee to european countries, which is a stark contrast to the treatement nonwhite refugees are seeing as they flee their own wars to developed nations. So really, it comes down to whether people feel opressed people need more visibility, which in the Ukrainians cases its not. The whole wprld knows whats going on and supports them, even on a surprisingly bipartisan level (thats probably another element of it).

If you want a substitution test, maybe you should look to yourself and ask how vigilant you are being on similar matters with african wars and protesting the treatment of those refugees (and refugees from syria  and other middle eastern countries).",t2_5lupyaed,TheTownTeaJunky,0,1648232299.0,0,t1_i23gt0e,i23gt0e,True,OakTownPudge,t3_tnq2bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/tnq2bg/why_is_the_east_bay_so_quiet_about_ukraine/,Why is the East Bay so quiet about Ukraine?,/r/oakland/comments/tnq2bg/why_is_the_east_bay_so_quiet_about_ukraine/i23gt0e/,11,r/oakland,0,11

Libs fawning over him not leaving, after he made it illegal for others to do so, makes me nauseous.

Also we're meant to forget about the litteral Nazis we send money to in their army, becuase Putin used it as an excuse for war, they didn't stop being Nazis just because Putin called them Nazis, the hate crimes they committed against minorities aren't ok and the US still shouldn't be sending litteral neo-nazis money, but there's no point in even pretending we live in a democracy any more, as legislative attempts to keep US money out of their hands (supported by Lee ofc) were just straight up blocked by the Pentagon.

"Yeah, as much as white people (of which I am one) love to complain that black people always see race in everything, I can't imagine how many times black people assume something is an innocent mistake or just someone being shitty for other reasons only to later find out that it was in fact an intentional act of racism.

Like it's just one of those things where x% of Americans will be consistently irrationally insane and go out of there way to screw a certain type of person over, and those people can seem otherwise very normal if they're not the type that likes to loudly and proudly declare it - it just feels like sometimes you can never know whether or not there's a private motive, you just know that sometimes there is or the statistics wouldn't bear it up.

So yeah, I can't really blame people for recognizing the potential red flags of ""Hmm, something weird and bad happened to the only black woman on an authoritative body, better take a second look to make sure it was an honest mistake because every x times we check it isn't, no matter how insane it sounds at first.""

"First, thank you for the correction on fee vs tax.


What I'm worried about is equitable access to the lake. The most ""BART accessible"" area is the amphitheater, which is .4 miles from Lake Merritt BART. Quite a hike for many people who are bringing things for a gathering. The Bellvue area is significantly further away and anyone taking BART would have additional cost+time for the bus, creating a bigger disincentive for going there.

The stated goal for the parking meters is revenue generation to help offset the cost of maintenance. Given that goal a general access fee is a more equitable approach. Those accessing by walking should pay the most as they are not generating other significant revenue that goes to Oakland's general fund, which the parks are in-part funded from, to help offset the cost of their use. Where as every time a driver purchases a car or gets gas in Oakland a very small portion of that goes to lake maintenance.

"I don't think there's a shortage of construction workers, just a shortage of construction sites.

Edit to clarify:

I don't think your question ""what are some pragmatic solutions"" is a bad one. But I was answering your questions ""what if we ... construction sites / would that be something that solves some of the bigger issues"", and my answer there is: No, this is not a good approach.

One reason is what I said -- we don't have a shortage of construction workers, but a shortage of ability to build new housing. It's very difficult to build new housing in the Bay Area, due to restrictive zoning etc -- for example, most land is zoned only for single-family homes, when having plenty of mid-rise apartment buildings could make things a lot better -- more supply means lower rents (for everyone!) means less homelessness.

But more valuable than a ""your idea won't work"" is ""here's an idea that will work,"" so here's a video on the **housing-first** approach (which is exactly what it sounds like -- housing first as opposed to job first or sober first) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L41peAlrkGw",t2_4vz2nmz0,rio-bevol,0,1648145931.0,0,t1_i1ymsta,i1ymsta,False,undercherryblossoms2,t3_tmehpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/tmehpz/oakland_council_member_proposes_rv_parking_ban/,Oakland Council Member Proposes RV Parking Ban,/r/oakland/comments/tmehpz/oakland_council_member_proposes_rv_parking_ban/i1ymsta/,5,r/oakland,0,5

"/u/chroniclesofazu this component of the story is lazily reported by Jose Fermoso of Oaklandside. It provides no comparison of other Oakland city parks and their relative budget to usage rate. We can draw no conclusion as to the overall value of the weekly maintenance cost as a result. What is clear is that other Oakland parks do offer free parking and haven't yet gone this path to help offset their budget. Not offering free parking around the areas that have commonly been used for group gatherings is a regressive tax to access a ""free"" community resource at a time when those with less are seeing increased costs across the board every day. If anything this will shift the parking burden into the neighborhoods, all of which have unmetered areas a couple blocks from the lake and neighbors who complain about not having enough parking, especially on weekends.

The maps aren’t accessible for visually impaired folks (which she is) so she couldn’t validate herself, she asked for help and got a bad answer. It seems like an honest mistake.

"I'm sorry I'm confused, who is they? I thought it was your property?

I agree it sucks to have cashflow constraints that could result in your rental property being foreclosed upon by your lender. It sucks that you're in a position where your tenants are unable to pay the rent they agreed to upon moving in. It also sucks to have people treating the property in a way you would rather they did not, especially when it adds to your labor and maintenance costs when they move out.  


But at the end of the day, housing is a resource that's necessary for people's survival. Profiting off someone's basic human needs  is an inherently risky business; because desperate people will do desperate things to have those needs met.  


This is why I'm suggesting looking for a CLT or community owned real estate trust to steward the asset. It distributes the risk of non-payment more broadly while providing investors with a return and property managers a decent wage for the job of managing the property.

"Close to home I like Anthony Chabot Regional Park -- start at the Bort Meadow Staging area. There's a nice five-miler that takes you up the hill and around by the stables.

Reinhardt Regional Park has lots of great trails -- my favorite combo is French, Brinde and Stream, about 7+ miles, starts flat and goes into some satisfying climbs if you start from Stream. It's mostly shaded so good for when it gets hot. 

Through the tunnel I like Briones, but it gets hot in the summer. You can do Briones Crest, Old Briones Road, Table Top, Crescent Ridge and Seaborg.  About 8 miles?

Black Diamond Mines in Antioch is also good to go earlier in the year -- Nortonville and Black Diamond Loop is 5-6 miles.

When it gets hot, go to Marin. My favorite is Tomales Point, which is about 9.5 miles total, an out and back.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"Really two big things: 
- since the district website is inaccessible to visually impaired folks, she asked some BART staffers to validate her new address would be in the district lines. They said yes, turned out she was across the street from the line. This sounds like human error. Again she was out of compliance by a few feet, not miles or even blocks. 
- the day after they said she lived outside of the district lines (she has been living there for almost a year), they voted on redistricting. With the new district lines she was back in District 7, the line moved a block over or something. 

Also, since the positions are elected, there is likely a higher bar to remove people that just doing it with 1-2 days of notice, so they needed to consult their appropriate legal people. 

So if this was a real problem, and she was very vocal about her decision to move and searching for a new place, did it take a year to find and issue with it. Mere days before the redistricting would have put her in compliance.  They could have feasibly waited until after the redistricting was completed.

"Idk how much you can say they're ""regular"" people when about 7% of all the people in the US are landlords, and they make about 45% more than the average median income. Typically only 30% of a landlord's income comes from the property- less than the 45% more they make. Individual landlords are a minority that is very likely to be financially privileged in a way that the average renter is not.

Regardless, most rentals, unit-wise, are owned by corporations, and the number of rentals owned by real estate investors purchased 11% more properties in the last year, a huge spike. The property mentioned in this story is owned by a property investment company that focuses on 20+ unit properties in both California and Nevada. 

Why are you more eager to cast these corporate entities as ""regular people"" more deserving of sympathy than renters, who somehow are not ""regular people""? Intentionally or not, you're providing a great rhetorical smokescreen for the majority of landlords, who benefit from playing up the mom-and-pop angle anytime someone puts their asses in check.",t2_12wys3,metamorphotits,0,1648067504.0,0,t1_i1uczdy,i1uczdy,False,undercherryblossoms2,t3_tl8hfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/tl8hfx/oakland_tenants_unionized_went_on_rent_strike_for/,"Oakland tenants unionized, went on rent strike for 13 months, and got big concessions from the landlords…",/r/oakland/comments/tl8hfx/oakland_tenants_unionized_went_on_rent_strike_for/i1uczdy/,28,r/oakland,0,28

">Will there be fires and rolling black outs?

IDK, maybe.  ""Public Safety Power Shutoffs"" are likely, but you get notice, and it'll probably only be once or twice in the late summer or fall.  

Fires? You mean like in the hills specifically? Possible but not highly likely. Last time the Oakland hills burned was [1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_firestorm_of_1991), and that was *bad* but its not like they're burning down every year.  There'll almost certainly be fires elsewhere in the state that'll make air quality garbage, but that'll impact the whole Bay Area.  

>Will I need A/C?

Depends on how you define ""need,"" how old the place is, and how good (or bad) the insulation is.  There'll probably be a week or two where it gets up to high 90's/*maybe* low 100's, and you'll either wish you had AC or be glad that you do have it. But it's also generally manageable with just fans and being smart about the windows/shades you have open or closed.  Or get a portable unit for your bedroom if you're really worried about it. 

>I just saw a thread about the Oakland hills that said it is on a faultline?

This is true, but an earthquake bad enough to fuck up that area specifically would also be fucking up the rest of the Bay pretty badly too.  Small jolts every 1-3 months are to be expected, but that's just life in the Bay Area.",t2_3wskn,scoobyduped,0,1648012197.0,0,t1_i1rd6ri,i1rd6ri,True,SoftandSpicy,t3_tkluws,https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/tkluws/chabot_park_should_i_rent/,"Chabot Park, should I rent?",/r/oakland/comments/tkluws/chabot_park_should_i_rent/i1rd6ri/,2,r/oakland,0,2

"I bike through there regularly--its a pleasant, very suburban, hill neighborhood. Somewhat isolated and away from things.

> Will there be fires 

Certainly could be, but a major hill fire hasn't happened since '91. 

> Will I need A/C? 

It will be nice to have during heatwaves, but definitely not a necessity. Climate will be similar to the rest of the town. 

> rolling black outs

Wouldn't be any different than the rest of the east bay. We haven't had rolling blackouts in over a decade; shutoffs to mitigate fire risk seem more likely.

> >  I just saw a thread about the Oakland hills that said it is on a faultline

There's a faultline nearby, but that's true of all of the Oakland hills, and soil type probably matters more than fault proximity for earthquake damage risk.
