"I strongly disagree. 

Consider the previous Fort Whyte elections. Since 1999, it's been a stronghold for the Conservatives, who regularly destroy the competition. That's why the leaders of the party have historically ran there. 

This election saw them receive more than 2,500 fewer votes whil the NDP only lost about 700 and the Liberals **gained** over 1,000. Khan won the riding by a mere 197 votes, and given that it's a 'Conservative' riding, it's fair to say that more people voted *against* him than *for* him. 

If my opinion isn't good enough for you, how about [Dan Lett's](https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/fort-whyte-warning-shot-for-tory-government-576323522.html), [Bartley Kives'](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/khan-pcs-margin-victory-fort-whyte-byelection-1.6394125), or [Sam Thompson's](https://globalnews.ca/news/8703241/tight-byelection-fort-whyte-manitoba-pcs/)? Or, hell, Obby Khan himself admitted as much: 

>It’s a message that the people of Fort Whyte sent not only me, but the party as well, that we need to get better

"My wife and I really like going out to Clear Lake and if you have a puppy there are some pet friendly cabins. Lots of great walking around, paved paths should be free of snow (but I imagine wild paths won't be great) and the restaurants, coffee shop are all great and open now. 

In the city, Assiniboine park is a really nice walk and you can either walk across the bridge to North side and see cool older wolsely, or stay on the South side and see some big ol mansions and the new pathway is pretty nice. If you like board games then across the board is a really good hang, and then either eat there or there are tons of restaurants in exchange from ""fast food"" poutine to sit down places too. Kings head is a good destination as well.

The new place 116 on Sherbrooke is pretty cool but a little pricey, also on that street is tallest poppy (their chicken and waffles with berry syrup is amazing) and magic bird (excellent fried chicken). If you like bagels , or bagel sandwiches, Hudson's is right there. 

If you are looking for somewhere to shop, and maybe pick up some good meals for the week, black Market is a great stop in South Osborne. Small shop but lots of great sides like mustards, hot sauces, pickled things and others but also breads, soups salads etc. Really big on alternative foods (not pushy just aware of different needs) so they have lots of options like gluten free, vegetarian, vegan etc. They do have great options to go there so I usually pick up a ruffles chip rice krispie square and then go walking with my wife and pup in South Osborne Neighbourhoods, specifically Kingston Crescent is really nice and you can park by BDI and walk across the bridge. 

I guess it's pretty clear I walk neighbourhoods a lot and wildwood is another one I'd recommend. 

For staying, if you do that, Inn at the forks is nice. Smith is good food, and there are so many walking opportunities from there. True North Square isn't far from there and if your partner likes beer the lake of the woods tap room is there and they have good stuff. Also upstairs is a bunch of good restaurants (I enjoyed the BBQ joint there).

"I would say though that if you're thinking about a small claim, but don't want to sue the company while you work there (understandable), it would be a good idea for you to do a quick 1 hour consult with a lawyer, since I can't really give you legal advice over Reddit.

While you can sit on your right to sue, it would be worthwhile having in writing from a lawyer the last day you can file without being out of time.  Manitoba will be replacing  The Limitations of Actions Act this fall, which could reduce the 6 year limit to 2. 

You also don't need a lawyer for a small claim, although it can be helpful to get some initial advice on how to frame your claim, and how the proceedings work.

"Take a gander into the history of the person I was *actually* speaking to.  I did make an assumption at first but my assumptions were correct.

There were always rules for collecting cerb. You had to have been working prior to the pandemic, have met an income threshold, not been collecting other income, etc.

There are some folks that got pushed into different programs to ensure they had income during the pandemic. It was up to each Canadian to ensure they met these regulations before claiming any funds. Otherwise they'd have to pay it back. You don't just get money for free. However I do 100% support Trudeau for ensuring the money went to people quickly so they didn't get evicted or starve (even though evictions weren't possible for some time).

The government is also allowing people to pay back these funds *tax free* within a certain time frame. The eligibility requirements were pretty clear. If you weren't eligible you were quite frankly stealing funds from taxpayers.

Also, heads up, coming in hot like a douchebag and demanding people explain themselves doesn't usually work. You may want to change your plan of attack in the future to something less abrasive. Lucky for you I'm in a good mood and felt like being helpful.

Edit: oh,  you're a conspiracy theorist as well. Makes sense.

What's the value of the missing commission payment? This will inform whether a small claim is appropriate.  It's been awhile, but my recollection is that small claims max out at $15k in Manitoba, so if your commission is significantly higher, a small claim may not be appropriate.

Does your contract indicate that unpaid commissions stop being payable in any circumstances?  Your contract almost certainly won't say this, but it would be a good idea for you to review the terms of payment to ensure that you are owed the commission.

"My great-grandfather emigrated from England to Canada through Dr. Barnardo's Charity at a very young age.  Himself, as well as his biological brother were orphans.  Unfortunately, he passed away well before I was born.  Details about his life, such as biological family, life in an English orphanage, his travel to Canada, the way he was treated by Dr. Barnardo's Charity, and his beginnings in Manitoba - are vague and sketchy at best.  The details seemed to have faded into obscurity.  It's something that has never sat right with me.  It's family history.  Dr. Barnardo's organization has always been presented to the public as a generous act of charity.  Motives never questioned.  The more you think about it, the more things don't add up.  I've wondered about a number of these things for many years. Mainly, was my great-grandfather and his brother horrifically mistreated and abused as children in the name of Charity?  Was he and his brother child slaves?

There’s lots of programs for sedentary jobs like another commenter said such as an office admin program. Of course, being middle aged like yourself, a sedentary career makes sense.

Whatever it is you decide to do, make a plan on how to support yourself. The rest will follow. Lots of people find love and experience great years full of adventure and excitement in the second half of life. There is hope.

"Congratulations on your acceptance! 

Regarding the cold...roughly 1.4 million people live in Manitoba, and we survive every winter. You can too! Our winters usually stay in the -20s. It only dips down into the -40s or lower when there's an arctic front moving through. Maybe we get 4 weeks of those in an entire winter? And there's usually breaks of relative warmth in between.

As others mentioned, the most important gear to keep yourself safe is a toque, gloves, boots, a light jacket for fall, and a heavy jacket rated into the -50s or below for the deep of winter. For gloves I'd personally recommend something made with Thinsulate - they can be rated well into the -30s but won't look like astronaut mitts. Ankle-height boots will do just fine in the city, no need to get boots that tie up at your knees or anything. 

And you might not actually want to go too heavy duty with the boots. When I lived in Saskatchewan (where it gets A LOT colder than Winnipeg) I used a pair of breathable hiking boots to get around the city in winter, because they were also comfortable to wear inside for long periods of time. If you buy some waterproof extreme cold rated pair of boots then your feet are just going to be drenched in sweat by the time classes are over. 

Regarding racism, Winnipeg does have the dubious distinction of being one of Canada's most racist cities. But in my experience, almost all of that racism is directed at the Indigenous population. Winnipeg (like other major Canadian cities) is pretty diverse with many different immigrant communities. Especially at university, you will find lots of international students. I think the risk you will experience racism is extremely low.

And just a life tip for Winnipeg, I would highly recommend that you buy a car if you can afford it. I don't know how it is in Dubai, but our public transport can be pretty questionable here. Unless you live on a major corridor with lots of overlapping bus routes, the bus will only come every 30 minutes. And the buses are often overcrowded during rush hour, to the point that drivers will skip stops.

"My neighbour for ~10yrs was from Pakistan, and he actually loved the winters here.  More than I, a native Winnepegger, ever have, in fact!  He may have been insane, I don't know???

Prepare for -40C to +40C and you'll be fine for the -35 to +35 that usually happens, and still alive if -40/+40 happens.

I would budget closer to $1k in ""unknown"" cold-weather expenses, as you'll likely be starting from nothing and will need at least two, possibly three coats as no single coat is suitable for both +/-0C and -40C!  (Warning: you have to buy them a few months in advance.  By the time you need the heavier coat, no one has any stock left at decent prices.)

There's plenty of racism around, but I haven't heard that it's intolerable in Winnipeg.  I *have* heard that it gets really bad in rural towns.  If you could possibly be mistaken for an indigenous North American, you'll be in for a very rough time anywhere in mid-Canada: racism against indigenous people is both virulent and endemic.

There is a very large immigrant community here, with lots of support for international students (AFAIK).

If you're looking at the University of Manitoba, in particular the main (""Fort Garry"") campus, make sure you live ON campus, or VERY close to a major transit route, or plan to own & drive a car.  (I guess spending a not-very-small fortune on taxis/Ubers/etc. is technically an option, too?)

"I don't speak from experience so take this with a pinch of salt, but I think it is a good place, we have a very large immigrant population here and I don't think I've heard of many or any hate crimes here (exception being swastikas on schools a few years back and probably some anti-asian hate during the pandemic). Winnipeg is a more Left-leaning city then most others in Canada, with the exception of Vancouver so there's less of a chance of racism here then other cities I believe. Overall you should be alright here, only warning being that the Manitoban south is like a little Texas without the oil, so be a bit on your guard then, but even there I don't think anyone's really racist. And this might just be a north america thing but our universities are as left wing as possible, so on campus will be good

&#x200B;

Edit: I did a quick google, and it seems most hate crimes in Winnipeg are people spraying swastikas on stuff. There was one incident were an anti-semitic song was played at a pro-palestinian rally, but I think we know there's a bit more at play there

&#x200B;

"My cousin is still living in Gillam and quite likes it, gets out a lot, does a lot of fishing, etc, but I think growing up in the north it still also feels like home to him or if you grew up in the interlakes/near the shield too as opposed to like, winnipeg or brandon, haha. I think I would like Gillam, I just don't really wanna work for Hydro. 

I've met a few people from Lynn Lake (work with 2) and it kind of sounds like the mines aren't what they used to be and the town is a bit smaller than it was. I'll be heading up to South Indian Lake for a few weeks come monday for work, and I believe that's on the way to Lynn once you're passed Thompson, I'd think South Indian is also effected by the mines and stuff. I think temporary closures are maybe more to do with weather and stuff like if winter roads can't get into those communities, right? I know south indian was closed for a bit this winter, for example.

"Correct, always dangerous, sometimes less.  Gang members arn’t vampires only out at night. The fact you know it has a large gang presence, by virtue means its always unsafe.   People that live outside the rule of law and societal norms, dont rationally decide crime can only happen after 7

"Are things like stabbings and other violence not typically directed at other gang members/criminals though?

I always heard the same thing said of parts of Winnipeg as well as Saskatoon where I was living, literally in Alphabet City, the 'dangerous' part of the city (Pleasant Hill/Riversdale area and the downtown core) and always got told how dangerous it was, don't go to / near the circle K on 25th after dark, etc. Maybe it's because I look bigger in general because I'm tall but even with my camera with me travelling around at dark I never really felt unsafe and only once actually had a local screaming at me...because I'd woke them up (saw them face down on the ground, assumed the worse that it was an OD and went to check on them, nope, just a super pissed off guy haha). 

I know random thefts and muggings happen everywhere, but in terms of the actual violence, i.e stabbings, beatings, coming from a smaller town myself with a cousin who still looks over his shoulder because of a fight he was in like 3+ years ago, the violent crime in places like that are usually all interrelated, especially in a place with only 13,000 people?

It just strikes me that everyone speaks of Thomspon exactly like they speak of the north end without ever even having walked there alone. I have no doubt violent exchanges happen, but I kind of think the 'reputation' of those places becomes bigger than the actual risk of violence. If anything I'd think theft is your biggest concern because communities that for north still deal with drug addictions like everywhere else, and meth and fent are both very big.

It's perfectly safe to be out almost anywhere in town until after 11. There are other areas that are known to be dangerous and to avoid, very much so like Winnipeg.

Let's stick with something more recent - the truck convoy.

Whenever the conservative members would ask Trudeau or Freeland a question - the question would never get answered.

"She didn’t have an answer and filled her response time with an anecdote about how her family is doing well despite this being a question about how another family is grieving due to the “pass the buck” game played in the province. 

It could really feel like a slap in the face to not only those who are directly involved but also to anyone who desires a quality group of people making the long-term decisions here. 

This may seem like a win to Manitobans who either don’t like or don’t care about certain groups in our province but this is how people with real power treat those they can’t or won’t help. 

Its not really based on culture or race for those in power, its based on who they need to support to maintain their position coming first and all others on a sliding scale of influence, wealth, position, and public image. 

Imagine if you were playing a video game like Sim City, you may not give any concern to supporting areas that give little to nothing back as it just costs resources that are hard to get. You may progress in the game at their expense because they aren’t real and they don’t actually suffer. 
In reality this happens but there is real human suffering. 
The real issue is less and less people are seeing how everything is interconnected on every scale, suffering transfers to anyone involved directly with it. It doesn’t stop at the end of your shift whether your a nurse, police officer, line cook, or really any job where you interact with people. 
It becomes time off, mental illness, physical illness, drug addiction, violence, and a low quality of life. 
This transfers into MASSIVE resources being poured into policing, healthcare, the justice system, prisons and the system isn’t changing enough to put a dent into that deficit.

"This exact same thing happened to me. We lived too far away from the base station to get a stable signal over long periods of time as the signal would 'drift'.  What happens is that your DSL modem 'trains' itself to recognize the line noise when you first connect (so it can filter it), then the modem assumes it'll remain that way, but surprise surprise it doesn't.  This is a VERY simple firmware fix they could implement or get their modem vendors to implement, but they don't care (I reached out to them a few times offering this solution).  If you have one of the (older) Siemens or ActionTec smaller modems, I wrote a program that monitors your connection and will soft reboot your modem automatically (much faster than unplug routine) and causes it to 'train' fresh. If you know c# and would like the source DM me (or I can post it here, I just don't have it handy on this device right now), probably needs a bit of work to get it running (it's on an old .net framework, I haven't had that internet in ages). It's a pretty simple app, it just checks if it can reach google every 5 minutes, and if it can't, just connects to the modems telnet port and issues the reboot command.  Another enhancement I never got around to adding, was making it reboot every couple of hours regardless of connection, because even if it is still connected, sometimes it just drops to a lower speed as the signal drifts, so you may be connected still, but have horrible speed.

This of course is a bandaid for a real fix - ditch Bell MTS, go with almost anything else (only Xplorenet is worse).  If you've got VISP in your area, I hear that's pretty good, and it's locally owned.",t2_6aub5lqx,ObjectiveAide9552,0,1647392137.0,0,t1_i0tqelk,i0tqelk,True,50leadsled,t3_tectt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manitoba/comments/tectt7/bell_mts_stay_away_from/,Bell MTS stay away from,/r/Manitoba/comments/tectt7/bell_mts_stay_away_from/i0tqelk/,1,r/Manitoba,0,1

When MTS was publicly owned it created the first emergency call system in North America (999) so I wouldn’t say it was a failure, actually it seems like it was creating and providing real services for Manitobans.

I have run speedtest once in a while (wired not wireless) on laptop and mornings can be as high as 5-6 mbps but also at primetime(evening) is where we get the 2 and 3's.

The price keeps getting higher to the point where Starlink is getting more attractive (relatives rave about it). So... maybe. The final monthly bill after taxes is 144 for Starlink they tell me.

"In November 2020, the PC government announced a $1.5M grant for local businesses to help get through Covid. It was recently uncovered via a Freedom of Information Act request that $500k of that money was given to Obby Kahn's fledgling business, Goodlocal. Another $490k was distributed to various chambers of commerce around the province. The remainder wasn't spent at all.

Goodlocal is described by Obby as Amazon meets Etsy, but local. Goodlocal recently opened a brick and mortar store though, so his description doesn't work as well anymore.

In the first 2 months after receiving the funds, Obby's business went from having 38 vendors to 388 and generating $850k in sales. That works out to a little more than $2k per vendor. No one really knows how sales were distributed. How much of that $850k was new business vs business that would have happened anyway? Goodlocal takes 15-20% on each sale and charges $1300/month to have your products in their brick and mortar store. 

The chair of the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce, himself a member of the PC party, a former party secretary, and failed candidate for the PC's, is saying that the decision to give one third of the funding to Obby was non political and was based on his own recommendation. He said it wouldn't be worthwhile to give a bunch of small businesses $1000.

In December 2020, after receiving the money, Goodlocal started posting to their Instagram account about what a great job Pallister was doing supporting local businesses during the pandemic.

Obby is now running as a PC in the by-election in Pallister's old riding.

Now that it is known how much money Obby got, a number of other businesses that sell locally made products (and, lots of others in the community) are questioning the fairness of how the grant was awarded.",t2_hyb2gnnt,NaiveInitial5283,0,1647297597.0,0,t1_i0odgmo,i0odgmo,False,LocalnewsguruMB,t3_t6xe8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manitoba/comments/t6xe8v/no_business_got_more_money_from_a_2020_government/,No business got more money from a 2020 government program than Good Local.

> the liquor stores are like Fort Knox

That's kind of hyperbolic, but there is *much* higher security at many Liquor Marts than typical retail locations.  In 2019 there was a serious problem with theft and violence at the stores.

Employees were getting assaulted. Crowds of people were walking into stores, filling up bags/backpacks and walking out. It was a real mess.

>At its peak in Aug. 2019, Liquor Marts reported 462 thefts in a single week.

>In the last nine months of 2019, $2,315,000 worth of liquor store inventory was forfeited through shrinkage, which describes what is lost due to factors such as shoplifting, vendor fraud, employee theft and administrative error.

Vendor/offsale - Licensed through hotels to sell beer. Sometimes appear as standalone buildings, but on the property of a hotel. Sometimes directly inside the hotel bar/restaurant. Prices can be higher than government store prices, but opening hours can be longer. Some have very basic selection because at 1am you really don't care about brand or price. There's a few that specialize in craft beers that aren't available in the government store.

"Whatever our school says they are doing is what my kid will do.  Thus far they have been consistent with mask wearing.  I'm interested to see what local businesses do.

"First, yes, a crown could be that stupid. They can deny the relationship. It’s happened before with the Thompson crown office. ‘Open in the community’ does not mean open to their employers or to defence counsel (given the defence counsel in Thompson I’ve contacted are all in the dark on this)

Secondly, as I’ve said it’s contrary to the code of professional conduct- the rules the lawyers have to follow. 

And if defence only finds out after, it’s not automatically dismissed. An accused could have waited 5 months in jail and then still be in jail for the appeal and have spent 8 months in jail- getting it thrown out later is hardly sufficient when they’ve loat 8 months in jail. And proving crown misconduct is much harder than proving criminal responsibility.",t2_7innsnup,Belle_Requin,0,1647205520.0,0,t1_i0jclgj,i0jclgj,False,[deleted],t3_td9ah6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manitoba/comments/td9ah6/a_question_about_ethics/,A question about ethics,/r/Manitoba/comments/td9ah6/a_question_about_ethics/i0jclgj/,4,r/Manitoba,0,4
"I work in an elementary school and aside from Covid, masks have prevented me from getting sneezed on at close range numerous times...so I'm okay with kids still wearing them lol.

Most people don’t and get themselves in more trouble or self incriminate themselves.
