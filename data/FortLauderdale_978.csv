"Amtrak is your best bet as others have mentioned.

I used to have the exact same scenario as you.  I would cancel trips or if I went, I would be miserable the entire time I was there worrying about the return trip.  I was able to get some Xanax prescribed by my doctor to use when flying.  I usually take them the entire day I'll be flying with my last does when I get on the plane.  The first few flights on it, I was still pretty nervous but not terrified like before.  After several ""good"" flights on Xanax, I can fly without it now (although I still fly with it when the weather is sketchy or any time I feel I need it).  If that will work for you, you'll get to where you can just pop your Xanax, put on some headphones, and sleep most of the flight.  Good luck.

I did so from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale in early 1998, and I never left. It was an experience I'll never forget. I have put nearly all of my airplane trips out of mind though.

"Amtrak goes from Fort Lauderdale to Penn Station. The train is better than the bus, but of course Greyhound goes everywhere too. The train is a 31 hour ride, looks like it goes direct. 

If you are not going to fly anymore, better buy a car. 

I drive back and forth to South Florida from NYC, for various reasons, usually due to the amount of camping and hiking stuff we travel with, but I don't care for flying either. During the week, when traffic is better, it's a two day drive, about 18-20 hours total. Of course if you are travelling with another experienced driver, you can do it all in one 24 hour period

"Ah I meet so many people at the gym I would definitely recommend getting a membership again. I used to workout at titan gym which is a small bodybuilder gym in north federal, great atmosphere but not your typical gym at all.

Then again, the gym at your apartment is a great place to meet neighbors. I’ve been meaning to check out the gym at the Aviah, I have a few friends that live there. 

There are some trails and a disc golf course at Snyder park but they rarely get used. 

Honestly I wouldn’t suggest the bars downtown to anyone, most of the people down there aren’t even 21 and let’s just say it’s not the right place to meet boyfriend material lol. You are probably really close to rhythm and vine, great little bar. There are bars in FAT village where I’m sure you will love the vibes, it’s the art district so you will meet likeminded people there. Also the wharf IMO is the best bar to meet people in Fort Lauderdale. American social on las olas is also great.

I tried a dating app...I had several dates that amounted to nothing more than one and done..my first date was 20 years older than her pictures.. the second was 100lbs heavier than her pictures.. it never got better... so I decided what really was missing from my life was a best friend.. so I changed my strategy.. find a good person who I can be friends with... and that has worked out ok..because some are 30 years younger who like I have no romantic ambitions.. they are comfortable and safe with me..some are my own age and I might not be attracted to physically but as a person.. we have great friendships.. now that I have made some great new friends I realized that the romance part I'm probably still not ready for.. but who knows... lightning can still strike... good luck with your search op... all is not hopeless..",t2_1jj1u4xs,mtready,0,1647732257.0,0,t1_i1ca10z,i1ca10z,True,ApplesandBananazzz,t3_thy210,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortlauderdale/comments/thy210/dating_in_ftl/,dating in FTL,/r/fortlauderdale/comments/thy210/dating_in_ftl/i1ca10z/,6,r/fortlauderdale,0,6

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Delta 8 is legal and you can get it at plenty o smoke shops - Google it and I'm sure you'll find a few

""What is Delta-8 THC?

Delta-8 THC is one of more than 100 cannabinoid compounds found in the cannabis plant, which include CBD and Delta-9 THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana

A cannabis plant that has more than .3 percent Delta-9 THC is marijuana; the same plant with less than .3 percent of Delta-9 THC is called hemp. Both CBD, the natural remedy found everywhere from health-food stores to smoke shops, and Delta-8 THC come from hemp

The federal Farm Bill enacted in 2018 legalized the commercial use of hemp and derivative products as long as they met the established definition of hemp: no more than .3 percent of Delta-9 THC.""

"OP don't do this lol. Jack's is nasty. The place is old and dirty and you can get way better burgers at other spots. Also, who wants their lettuce and tomato coming in a plastic baggie lmao. 

Anyway try, 

Tacocraft - fun vibe, good tacos and guac 

Coyo Taco - Right off of las olas - the best steak quesadilla I've ever had. Bar is cool cause it sits outside so if it's a nice day, it's fun to sit out there. 

B Square - Awesome burgers on Las Olas. It's pricey but the burgers are crazy good. Cool vibe as well.

Henry's Sandwich Station - Really good, craft sandwiches. Not a bar vibe but good for a sandwich.

Colada - Not the most authentic Cuban food, but it's more of a trendy modern Cuban fusion place. Good stuff though. Again - not a bar vibe but a chill lunch spot. 

Tap 42 - Good vibe, fun drinks. Really diverse menu - sandwiches, burgers, salads, fish, etc. 

Batch New Southern Kitchen - Modern, trendy, southern fusion. Think mac and cheese, chicken & waffles, etc. Pricey, but food is solid. 

Heritage - The best Pizza in Fort Lauderdale. 

Louie Bossie's - On las Olas. Awesome vibe. Great Neapolitan pizza.

Foxy Brown - Good vibe. Good food. Kinda like comfort food, but it can be expensive there. 

Southport Raw Bar - Looks like a dive bar/restaurant but it's a classic in Fort Lauderdale. Good seafood, reasonable prices. Sit on the dock out back for a better vibe. 

Top Round - No bar vibe. Awesome roast beef sandwiches and fries. 

Laspadas - If you're looking for a quick sub to take to the beach - this is the spot.

Lunchroom - No bar vibe. Great sandwiches.",t2_e43pugls,chipotleplz,0,1647355445.0,0,t1_i0r6c6t,i0r6c6t,False,[deleted],t3_teq2sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortlauderdale/comments/teq2sn/best_lunch_spot/,Best lunch spot,/r/fortlauderdale/comments/teq2sn/best_lunch_spot/i0r6c6t/,0,r/fortlauderdale,0,0

"Again, not sure how old your children are because that would make a big difference on what you’d be able to do and I’m not sure what you’re looking for, I don’t have much info other then you’re looking to kill time.

"Even if so, at 6 months their is now an independent living person that can be seen laughing, crying, listening, and interacting with the outside world. While I agree, it is a god awful situation.

I'm actually pro-abortion. Their is a point and/or situations that abortion is absolutely appropriate ethically. Their is also a point where it is becomes unethical.

"Vote number 3 for Scarborough

A few years back my SO and I got my first cat/kittens (they were actually stray kittens we'd found in our old backyard and fostered/adopted, he had cats growing up but I was always a dog girl and was sad I couldn't get one with our living situation/work schedules). Flash forward a year and our male cat had bladder issues, this was at the exact moment that I was changing careers and a week away from my first paycheck.  We went to Scarborough and I was fully preparing myself mentally for the thought of having to say goodbye to my cat due to not having enough funds to cover surgery etc (I was absolutely devastated, our cat was part of the family and helped me thru some pretty serious depression). The vets Scarborough worked with us, they helped us find payment plan and walked us they the cost/what was critical - truly the best care and support we could ask for and were an absolute lifesaver. When I came back the following day to pick up my cat, everyone there know his name, said goodbye, etc - really a great team and you can just tell they care about animals and providing top quality care.",t2_cke1rmun,LastOKAlternative,0,1646551401.0,0,t1_hzjvcjw,hzjvcjw,False,Scottishpsychopath,t3_t79ql6,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortlauderdale/comments/t79ql6/looking_for_a_good_vet/,Looking for a good vet,/r/fortlauderdale/comments/t79ql6/looking_for_a_good_vet/hzjvcjw/,1,r/fortlauderdale,0,1

—sweet liberty (south beach large cocktail bar with djs, drag brunch and incredible food - same owners as mama tried and blackbird downtown)


I realize these are all bars and clubs (I work in the industry so that’s my only area of expertise), and I’m not sure what kinda stuff you’re into or what your crowd is (upscale spots Vs dive bars vs college bars), but I’m happy to answer any questions. There’s also lots of activities in Fort Lauderdale like bar crawls throughout the year, trivia nights (try township, the den, the pub in Wilton manors), kickball teams (Thursdays) and stuff like that. good luck!",t2_td1kc,fuckloadofalligators,0,1646532393.0,0,t1_hziy2e8,hziy2e8,True,Puzzleheaded-Aide-82,t3_t7ekeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortlauderdale/comments/t7ekeh/things_for_recent_college_grads/,Things for recent college grads?,/r/fortlauderdale/comments/t7ekeh/things_for_recent_college_grads/hziy2e8/,22,r/fortlauderdale,8,22
