"Hi, also the library has a lot of activities -- book club for adults and of course children's activities that you can sign up for and meet other Moms. Every suburb has a branch of the Onondaga County Library---they are a treasure! The Y is also a good suggestion. There are different area YMCAs and you can go to any of them. Even the downtown one has a writer's and an arts center. 

There are a few Barre studios in the area as well as other gyms with classes. This area has wine tours (taking you to various vineyards) and often there are groups that plan to go on one together. We have a lot of beautiful parks locally and some of them have wifi.

Once you decide on a particular location, the Nextdoor app is great -- you can post there and get hooked up with mom groups, walking groups, neighborhood event and other groups. This area is not very dependent on church affiliations for social interaction.

"I get it, and I think everyone is feeling strange to socialize again.  You’re not alone!  So some activities you can see that there are mom-friends already and not to sound too high school-y but those already-made friend groups can be difficult to force yourself into it.  That happened to me at a gym class - we joined late so I’m just the lonely mom out.  But I don’t mind, I’m chasing a toddler and too busy anyway!! 

I usually just notice if my kid is playing with another kid and if I can figure out who the parent is - it just becomes “hey look our kids like each other, isn’t that cute?”  Or other ice breakers “how old is your little one” “wow they are so good at x, have you been doing this long?” The parents looking to chat will reply with their own info.  But the parents too engrossed with their phones or friends or whatever - you can usually just back away.  

It’s always easier on a playground (I have honestly made random friends with two moms at playgrounds - I just straight up say “do you wanna trade numbers and meet up again so the kiddos can play?”)  I think most parents jump at this because 1) having a playmate means you all get down time instead of constantly entertaining them 2) a lot of parents probably feel the same as us - exhausted from parenting and working and looking for some adults to talk to.

"Former SU staffer here. Nothing you said in either of those paragraphs is accurate. 

- SU is not the “number 1 party school in America.” That’s a completely subjective label that rags like Princeton Review release. Note that Princeton Review is not association with Princeton University. 

- Its not cold and snowy in Syracuse for “90%” of the academic year. Would it be possible to get snow in any given month during an academic year? Yes. Is this the reality of life in Syracuse? Absolutely not.

- Syracuse university very ardently defends the United States Constitution and has one of the nation’s top law schools supporting their stance on this topic. They rejected YAF as an *official campus organization* because it’s exclusionary to international students’ national values and uses extremely inflammatory and divisive rhetoric to promote what would otherwise be a reasonable set of organizational ethos. 

Contrary to popular misconception, SU has a relatively conservative administration, staff, faculty, and student body. The only aspects of their “politics” that make the news are things like their firing of Adrianna San Marco by the Daily Orange editor, allowing an ongoing BLM protest to displace their administration because it led to an actual rat infestation, and some incidences of racist graffiti which were widely believe to have been carried out by BLM activists trying to ignite a larger protest, and of course the infamous “racist” fraternity skit incident (which was carried out by racial/ethnic minorities).

"Upstate Community is the low-key, less busy sibling of the downtown hospital.  It tends to be less chaotic and the care should be better as a result.  

In-patient psych evaluations are highly regulated by the state and should be the same in most hospitals.  It is likely that they are getting diagnostic therapy and stabilization medication.  Discharge planning should begin at admission, so if they're going to be released into a friend's care you guys should start coordinating that.  Typically the hospital only holds people for 72 hours, so you'll likely be getting more information soon.  Its not prison, they should be able to take phone calls depending on their mental state.

Best of luck to your friend and its good to hear they have supportive friends that care about their wellbeing!",t2_bccgh,always_creative,0,1648226170.0,0,t1_i231335,i231335,True,ovenonfire,t3_tnmhwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tnmhwg/any_inpatient_experiences_at_upstate_community/,Any inpatient experiences at Upstate Community Hospital?,/r/Syracuse/comments/tnmhwg/any_inpatient_experiences_at_upstate_community/i231335/,16,r/Syracuse,0,16

"If you want to deliver at Crouse, there is CNY Women's Healthcare, Cathy Berry's office, CNY OB/GYN, and possibly 1 more than I cannot think of. 

St Joe's is understaffed and has their reputation but again, I have heard pleasant experiences there. Associates for Women's Medicine has some really great MDs/NPs/PAs. They use Maternal Fetal Medicine for high risk pregnancies.

Upstate Community Birth Center was newly remodeled. They have MDs and Midwives for prenatal care and there are midwife hospitalists as well. They have a Perinatal center for high risk and genetic counseling. 

If your pregnancy is low risk, and want to see the same provider, consider a midwife. MDs are mostly for High risk and they might have you see other MDs or PA/NP.

Check out the website for these places, they have videos of their L&Ds.

Number one:  Raising the Minimum Wage Would Boost an Economic Recovery—and Reduce Taxpayer Subsidization of Low-Wage Work

https://www.americanprogress.org/article/raising-minimum-wage-boost-economic-recovery-reduce-taxpayer-subsidization-low-wage-work/

""increase in the minimum wage would significantly decrease the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), as millions of workers are currently paid so little that they must rely on the public social safety net. Indeed, an increase to the federal minimum wage (and the elimination of the subminimum wage for people who work for tips and people with disabilities) would have broad benefits for the economy beyond the wages of affected workers. Wage increases—particularly for those at the bottom of the income spectrum—increase community-level economic activity and support local businesses; reduce the amount by which taxpayers subsidize corporations for the low wages they pay; and reduce the pay inequalities for women and people of color that depress overall economic growth.""

See how education works? Even better with a dose of humility as you've literally brought *zero facts* but lots of opinion/propaganda to this discussion.

""This is not some back-of-the-napkin approximation. According to a groundbreaking [new working paper by Carter C. Price and Kathryn Edwards of the RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WRA516-1.html), had the more equitable income distributions of the three decades following World War II (1945 through 1974) merely held steady, the aggregate annual income of Americans earning below the 90th percentile would have been $2.5 trillion higher in the year 2018 alone. That is an amount equal to nearly 12 percent of GDP—enough to more than double median income—enough to pay every single working American in the bottom nine deciles an additional $1,144 a month. Every month. Every single year.""

"Again you really didn't. If you want to change your argument then that's fine, but you just moved the goal posts. Your original statement was that people making minimum wage would afford average housing. Now you're saying if we give people more money then landlords will invest more in poor areas, which is a totally different argument.

It's also fundamentally incorrect. Giving people more money for no incremental economic output only increases the price of goods and services and make things more expensive. If what you were saying is true then housing would have become more affordable over the past two years where we literally sent people cash for doing nothing. Instead it is exponentially more expensive than it was before. There are already programs such as section 8 that give poor people money for housing. The slums are still the slums. Didn't solve anything and neither will raising the minimum wage. It'll just push everyone's else's wages up and the slums will be more expensive slums than they were before.",t2_idk9nlah,salty739,0,1648166105.0,0,t1_i200jtq,i200jtq,False,MessageSeparate,t3_tlab9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tlab9a/employers_of_syracuse_get_it_together/,Employers of Syracuse: Get it together!,/r/Syracuse/comments/tlab9a/employers_of_syracuse_get_it_together/i200jtq/,1,r/Syracuse,0,1

"I don't want to sound rude but if you are having accidents once a week you do not have potty training down. Accidents would be like once a month or every couple months. 

The thing about potty training is you need to be consistent. I started with an 1 every hour even at night (my bf and I rotated at night with the newest pup) but when I was raising my first pup on my own I took him out every hour. If I couldn't I had friends or neighbors do it. Then after a month if being successful on 1 hour we went up to 1.5 hours. Then another month we went up to 2. If you are not on the dot consistent then they will have an accident. If they don't go everytime that's fine bring them out again. 

So say you bring them out at 12 and they duck around outside for 10 minutes bring them back in and try and one. You need to have a balance of making sure outside just isn't fuck around time it's go to the bathroom time. So I would give my dogs 15 minutes max outside. All dogs have signs. Obviously they can't talk to you but they let you know when they need to go out. My oldest nitro he gets super hyper and crazy when he needs to go out. My smallest Tinsley she sits down in front of us and stares into our souls. It's on you to notice the signs. And you can't say your dog doesn't have them they do they just aren't being recognized. Right down their behaviors right before they go to the bathroom etc .. praise then give them treats. Go fucking nuts. 


If you aren't looking like a good damn lunatic with excitement everytime your dog goes to the bathroom you are doing it wrong. Dogs thrive off attention so give it to them. When they are being had you ignore them. Even if you yell at your dog is being bad yelling at them is attention and any kind of attention is good attention in our eyes.

When there is less demand for the lower end housing because people make enough money not to live in slums, in order to make use of that equity companies and individual landlords will have to invest in them to make them more desirable or change their purpose. 

You give the lowest paid individuals enough to afford decent housing and what you get is improved residential areas, which draws better infrastructure with it. You can understand the difference in things like roads, power lines, water and sewage to better maintained neighborhoods compared to ghettos,slums,barrios,trailerparks,  etc. They tend to collect more in taxes as well.

Others have mentioned potty training is on you. A dog trainer can tell you what to do but you need to be consistent. I've had both mine has pups and was religious about taking them out. I took them out every hour for the first month then slowly increased it to 1.5 hours (this includes even at night) it sucks but it's the fastest and most effective way to potty train. The way to get them to learn is prevent accidents.

Potty training is mostly a matter of schedule.  Get your pup out every 2 hours (including at night) and used to doing the business outside, is hard but works.

Minimum cost being something you can afford working a full time minimum wage job with. So $800 rents if the minimum wage is $15 an hour (which it will be in 2025).

"So you're going to compare the \[minimum worker\] wage to the \[average worker\] productivity? This is a statistical anomaly and it frankly doesn't make any sense. You can't compare a bottom quartile with the average. If you were to compare average worker wages with average worker productivity, then perhaps you'd have an argument. 

Minimum wage workers become less and less productive as more and more responsibilities get automated by technology. Bank tellers were replaced with ATMs, self-checkout lines replaced cashiers, vending machines have replaced convenience store clerks, automated factories have replaced factory line workers....... it doesn't make financial sense for a business to pay a worker an hourly wage that is higher than the output that the worker produces.

"The income for most CEOs comes mostly from stock options which is a completely different concept than employee compensation.

And most people who work for these types of companies have RSU plans which allows them to share in the growth of the stock as part of their compensation package as well.

If you want to use an actual CEO with an actual salary, use Walmart as a case study. The CEO of Walmart made $24M last year. Walmart employs over 2M people.

"I've never ""ridden ridden"" the canal, but have ridden the stretches west and east of syracuse.   Things get pretty congested near the major parks (camillus, cedar bay, etc), but thin out as you get out further, even just by a couple of miles.    
  If you need a bathroom near DeWitt, skip cedar bay Park and instead shoot a real short ways down butternut to DeWitt town park (this is next to where the DeWitt to Rome stretch of tow path starts).   A few miles up, you can take some side trails into Fayetteville and end up in a park right next to a coffee shop (freedom of espresso)  and a decent bike shop (resource cycling) should you need either of those.  Also nearby is a big ass plaza with a grocery store, target, etc and a killer middle eastern restaurant (king davids).  A little further down the towpath (~10 miles) you can easily duck into the town of chittenango if you need food or supplies.   
  On the west side of town, there is less going on right near the canal, but near camillus canal there is some stuff if you need supplies.   Going west from camillus there are a few patches where the path gets real narrow, much narrower than on the east side of town and it can get really torn up/muddy.

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera.""

"i have mixed feelings.  i think people should be paid enough money to survive on their own but there should always be an incentive to achieve more.  i'd argue that you can live in syracuse on around $20/hr (because our cost of living is skewed lower), but you'll just be treading water and never really getting ahead.  is that really fair though? debatable.

the ~$13/hr (sub $30k/yr) jobs that i see most companies paying today in cny usually never offer full-time hours never-mind vacation time, health ins/benfeits, or the ability to contribute a meaningful amount towards your own retirement (e.g., 401k, roth ira, etc.), so you're basically stuck working until you die at that wage.

it's nice to see wages go up (albeit slowly), but to actually get ahead even in this area (and have the above) you probably need to be bringing in around $40-50k single, and quite a lot more to raise a family, etc.. i'm fortunate to have a job based in another state and i work remotely full time, but many don't have that option or luxury. so not only do i draw a competitive salary based in a larger city, i don't have the commuting expenses, extra laundry to do for ""work clothing"", physical stress/pain of having to stand on my feet, deal with rude customers, etc.. many locally have it much worse and i'm extremely sympathetic to those that have to deal with more bullshit than i do for much less compensation.  it's not fair at all.   additionally a higher income allows me to own property instead of being trapped paying rent indefinitely, max out retirement accounts so i can leave this rat-race one day, etc..

i'm very grateful to have an in demand skillset given the bleak employment options we have locally.  what we probably need is an influx of money from the federal & state govt to create good paying jobs to improve things locally in addition to fighting for higher base wages for everyone, and hoping politicians do what they can to attract new businesses to bring higher paying jobs here, plus offer more vocational training for blue collar jobs and stop pushing all kids towards white collar jobs (e.g., ""go to college!"").  ffs i earn more per hour doing handyman work on the side than i do from my wfh white collar job (i charge $50/hr and that's pretty cheap these days).  we don't have nearly enough people in the trades any longer and those are great paying jobs, mostly union based with benefits..  just an idea.",t2_4i9q4,nefrina,0,1648081982.0,0,t1_i1vc6o3,i1vc6o3,True,MessageSeparate,t3_tlab9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tlab9a/employers_of_syracuse_get_it_together/,Employers of Syracuse: Get it together!,/r/Syracuse/comments/tlab9a/employers_of_syracuse_get_it_together/i1vc6o3/,7,r/Syracuse,0,7

"Inflation =/= Productivity. 

Objectively speaking, the minimum wage has more than kept up with inflation from the $0.25 set in 1936 by Roosevelt to the $7.25 set by Obama in 2009. Inflation has averaged around 2-3% per year and even less than that over the past decade (due to the recession and low interest rates). A minor adjustment is needed since it hasn’t been raised in 13 years but anyone who thinks there’s going to be a 4-5x jump is crazy. 

Productivity is defined as the amount of revenue that an employee generates for a business in an hour. Do you realistically think that businesses can stay afloat while paying people with a minimum skill set (fast food workers, grocery store clerks, factory workers, other jobs with no skill requirements) a wage of $30 when they don’t actually generate that much in value for the business? Philosophically speaking, it would be great if that were the case. Realistically, most businesses couldn’t afford to stay open leading to an increase in prices of goods/services sold or the automation of jobs that require low level of skills (ATMs, self-order kiosks, vending machines, self-checkout stations, etc.). Small businesses wouldn’t exist with a minimum wage that high. Instead of employing multiple baristas at your favorite local coffee shop, it’s just one person running the entire shop and everything is automated and a cup of regular plain coffee costs $15-20 and all of the other baristas are unemployed because other businesses in the area had to close. 

The whole reason why productivity has skyrocketed over the past 3 decades is because of computers. When “high skill” jobs like computer programming, accounting, finance, education, engineering, etc. are slowly becoming automated themselves, what do you think is going to happen to low skill, minimum wage jobs?",t2_1xn9a5xs,CharismaticSwan,1,1648081728.0,0,t1_i1vblxa,i1vblxa,True,MessageSeparate,t3_tlab9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tlab9a/employers_of_syracuse_get_it_together/,Employers of Syracuse: Get it together!,/r/Syracuse/comments/tlab9a/employers_of_syracuse_get_it_together/i1vblxa/,0,r/Syracuse,0,0

"$50k yearly minimum wage if salaries kept pace with productivity over the last three decades instead of just funneling the profits up to the billionaires

What's embarrassing is having to explain sharing to another adult

""The federal minimum wage in the U.S. has remained glued at $7.25 an hour for the last 12 years, the longest stretch without a boost since it was first adopted in 1938. Yet there's another revealing figure that underscores how the minimum wage — created by Congress after the Great Depression as a way to ensure that Americans were fairly paid for their labor — has failed to keep up with the times.

Even as workers have been more industrious — helping drive corporate profits, the stock market and CEO compensation to record heights — their pay has flatlined, or even declined when factoring in inflation. If the minimum wage had kept pace with gains in the economy's productivity over the last 50 years, it would be nearly $26 an hour today, or more than $50,000 a year in annual income, one economist notes.”

I see your point re: more expensive homes being on the market longer. But it's not like your logic is perfect either. You can't use one, specific example to extrapolate to the rest of the market.


1) Again, that is factually untrue. There are plenty of bonafide rich people in Syracuse. Obviously not at Bezos level, but certainly into the millions. And they should be paying more in taxes. They currently have a lower tax rate then someone making the CURRENT minimum wage.

"3) no, just my opinion.

2) post covid numbers are certainly relevant because rates have dropped such that homes are still equally affordable. I can dumb it down for you like this. My house was 339,000 pre covid. I forget what our rate was but around 4.. now, our house is worth about 415,000 but rates are in the 2-3 range.. so the monthly payments are almost identical. So yeah, my point still stands but right, I’m sure you Zillow survey is super reliable. Also the number homes for sale doesn’t have anything to do with average home value. More expensive homes stay in the market longer so of course there will be more of them, very flawed logic.

"So the people that don't know a ""trade"" deserve to make less than a living wage? It is their fault for not bettering themselves in your opinion. 

We know a job, like a worker at McDonald's for example, will always exist. There has been constant demand for fast food workers since the 50s.

Your opinion is that these people don't know a trade, and therfore do not deserve a living wage. They should ""better"" themselves. 

That does not jive with life liberty and pursuit of happiness in my book. I'm not a socialist, I believe capitalism can work.  But it needs to be very regulated and not allow businesses to pay wages less than someone can comfortably live on. 

If everyone of those people adhered to your view point there would still be demand for fast food workers, and a much lower demand for ""skilled"" labor. So you would have people with a trade, not able to get work in that trade, and having to work at a fast food place that pays less than a living wage because there aren't really any other options. 

Instead of putting the burden on people to better themselves to conform to a system clearly driven by greed, why isn't that burden put on the businesses through better wages, or the state with more regulations.

"It depends on your permit. If it’s a “sportsman’s” (for hunting, fishing, camping, etc.) you have to keep it locked up at home when not in use, or in a lockbox in your vehicle until you get to where you’re going.  

If it’s for “work”- same thing, only allowed to carry it on premises or if “on the clock”. 

If it’s for “home”- it can never leave the house (technically, but this is a dumb one because with the rules of “home”, that means you can’t go to a range and practice because it is illegal to carry outside of the home). 

And of course “unrestricted” means just that - go anywhere except federal and certain state property.  

And the laws can differ depending on the county. For instance, Onondaga says if you have a sportsmans, you can’t carry until you reach your destination, but I believe it’s Madison county that allows you to carry as soon as you leave the house because you’re “en route”.

"You can get it from average rent in area. 
Since in order to work in a place you must live near it. 
In order to live near it you must be able to afford rent near it. 

For Syracuse this is ~$1289, average. (I think this is apartments.com info)

Landlords want you rent to be 30% of monthly income. 
$1289/0.3 = $4296/month, before taxes. 

$4296 / 4wks = $1074/wk. Income per week. 
$1074 / 40hr = $26.85/hr. Hourly income. 

Now my calculations are not perfect and can definitely be improved upon by a real case study, and if you look you may find one. But this is the basic premise. You should also look at cost of food, water, electricity, internet, etc. The basic amenities needed to live and work; their contribute to society. 

When these need are not met you have the effect of human suffering and tax dollars allocated to support low income household.  

People generally move away from these areas which contributes to a brain drain, which leads to good jobs leaving the area (white collar jobs like business leaders, scientists, engineers), which leads to the jobs that supported those jobs disappearing (manufacturing jobs, fast food, stores, anything you think of as ""unskilled"" labor).

"A girl at work refused to take 'No' for an answer when it came to friendship. Brought me to hang out with her fuck buddy and his friends.

After hanging out for a few months we ended up together. We've been together over 3 years now. 


So, I suggest letting people force friendship upon you and drag you places you otherwise might not go.

"> Esquina Habanera

Can confirm, as I finally got to try this place a week or so ago. I moved here from FL back in December and one of the only things I thought I'd miss from that hellscape of a state was good Cuban food.

I've only tried their Cubano (nobody really calls it a ""Cuban sandwich"" in FL) so far but it's among the best I've ever had. It was absolutely _massive_ and in particular was loaded with tons of roast pork. I got the whole size, which was $13, and it was easily the biggest I've ever seen. I was only able to finish a quarter of it for lunch, and polished off the other 3 quarters over the next few days.

"Hi Op, I was kind of in your shoes when I was single when I was 30-32 (Male, 4yr degree, house, car, but from the area). I tried bumble, hinge, and tinder. Made it clear I was on them for a relationship, got a good amount of matches (to the point where I would stop swiping because I had too many conversations going). It took awhile but I eventually found the one on tinder(in the middle of lockdown at that) and plan on proposing soon. I had your attitude at times and if things didn't work out with my girl I was going to just take a break from all the apps. 

I obviously don't know really anything about you and my experience as a guy is different then yours as a woman, but I think you need to make it clear what you want in your profile and swipe with people who want similar things. I know it's seen as a hookup app but tinder had more people than bumble and hinge combined. Yes, there will be lots of fuckboys and shitty people but I think it will help you the most. You should also make sure your range is pretty big, Cuse isn't very dense

If you're really against apps then you'll need to find some kind of hobby to find guys, maybe a sports league through wherever you work?

"1) Italian - I’m not truly an expert on this style of bread but I do like Columbus and pastabilities.  

2) half moons - I’m partial to green hills (moister and Cakier) and Mario’s.  I found Harrisons bleh because their frosting is the hard kind. (And in general I went to Harrison’s a month ago and everything tasted a little stale and dry…but maybe I went on a bad day?)

3) jelly and Boston crème goes to Lyncourt.  I find their donuts the best overall with a great price.  Honorable mention to Serres for cake donuts/sour cream donuts and green hill donuts in general.  Sweet priaxis does an nice yeasted donut but their glazes are so “wet” that I still prefer lyncourt (plus SP is expensive) 

4) apple fritters the donut or the apple rings fresh fried with batter?  The donut version I like Honeycomb and Lyncourt.  Fresh fried - I like navarino orchards but I don’t think they are year round.  Beak and Skiff has their inside shop that maybe does fritters all year? 

5) special bread - tous de jours has Korean style bread and pastries.  I really like their milk breads (very soft and sweet) as well as their pastries with crème (strawberries and their cream horns - so yummy)

"I recently moved back to Syracuse after being away for a little over a decade and had a similar experience. It definitely can be frustrating.

My $.02 is to try and focus on finding activities you enjoy and try to meet people that way. Dating apps can take a toll. Also, you may already have tried this, but, taking the lead and being the one to approach a man you're interested in could be fruitful. Being a guy on dating apps can be a grind and having a woman be the pursuer definitely stands out in a positive way IMO.

Possibly ironically, I know a few single guys who I'd consider decent, lovely people. Women don't tend to pay much attention to them 🤷‍♂️.",t2_7ro24,lkdfjlksdneue,0,1647886799.0,0,t1_i1k6zv7,i1k6zv7,True,islands777,t3_tix8s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tix8s0/how_to_meet_a_partner_in_your_30s_in_syracuse/,"How to Meet a Partner, in your 30s, in Syracuse?",/r/Syracuse/comments/tix8s0/how_to_meet_a_partner_in_your_30s_in_syracuse/i1k6zv7/,5,r/Syracuse,0,5

"I'm not sure they'll do that. Had a friend ask one time and they refused to give the contact for an artist because they didn't want people going outside the shop to order.

One of the people involved in the shop is [Kara Daviau](https://www.karadaviaustudios.com/) and she might take the commission if she has the time or if it aligns with her style. She's an owner so she's typically the only one taking side work from shop customer inquiries.

If it's landscape you can check in with [Wendy Harris](https://wendyharrisfineart.com/). Landscape or portrait try [Dan Hayduke](https://www.instagram.com/danielhayduke/). If you want something that looks like an aged photo you can check out [Phil Parsons](https://www.philparsonsart.com/) but I'm not sure if he takes commissions.
