"When they see it they will just tell you off the bat you are gonna fail with those tints. Since basically any tint is illegal in NY, once its seen there's no need to waste time. 70% is the limit which will look clear. 
You'd have to find a spot that will look the other way, I know of one but not in Westchester. Or get cheap tints and replace yearly.

I don't have tints now (wasn't worth the hassle to me anymore) but when I did I'd go months never getting pulled over and then times where I would get stopped multiple times a month. It makes a difference where and when you drive. Some areas, especially at night have police kinda just hunting for drugs, guns, warrants etc so tints will give them a easy reason to make a stop.  I've never actually gotten a ticket though. They'll say something like, if I run your license and its clean etc I'll let it go, but take those tints off soon. Between inspection and cops tailing you for blocks at night I couldn't be bothered with the tints anymore.",t2_8xmayhlw,Chea63,0,1648174752.0,0,t1_i20jsi0,i20jsi0,False,Curioustowner,t3_tlw3o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tlw3o5/does_anyone_struggle_with_car_window_tint_here/,Does anyone struggle with car window tint here?,/r/Westchester/comments/tlw3o5/does_anyone_struggle_with_car_window_tint_here/i20jsi0/,1,r/Westchester,0,1

"First, I'm with you on Central AC, my house has it and I love it. But this is one of those questions that is basically impossible to answer as it is highly situational. Biggest factors are if there is a basement, how many stories there are, if there's an attic, etc.

Adding a true central AC system is going to require ductwork. How that ductwork is done, again, is highly situational. If you're on a one story ranch and there's unfinished basement, this shouldn't be too hard! But obviously different on colonial built on a slab. Another thing to consider here: if it was easy to add central AC to the house you're considering, it probably would have already been done. In most cases, you either run the system from the basement and ductwork up (most common in this area) or from the attic and ductwork down (more common in the South and places where there are no basements), but again, situational.

Anyhow, the difficulty of how and where to run the ductwork and returns etc. factors into it quite a bit. If there's no obviously way to do it you will lose some space. It's usually a fairly extensive project which I can't imagine could be done for sub-$20k especially in this environment. You're going to spend at least $10k just for the condenser and furnace, easily. I'm guessing a lot of quotes for a typical situation would be around $25k-30k, although again, I'm guessing here.

Mini splits are a bit different and you might be able to get an easier estimate on those as you may be able to find someone who will quote you an average per unit install rate (ex. $3k for each unit installed and you need 5, BTW I'm making these numbers up because I have no idea how much mini splits are, just that you don't have to deal with whole ductwork hassles).

I kind of made central AC a requirement when buying and ended up getting an house that already had it (although I did end up doing additional HVAC work which is why I'm a little knowledgeable now). I did consider adding it to another house we nearly made an offer on but not surprisingly I couldn't even get anyone to make a ballpark quote considering I didn't own the house (and this was pre-pandemic when things were easier).

"Gilligan's Pier in Newburgh MD - Randomly came across this place once driving back, it could be a day 1 lunch/dinner stop depending on itinerary; ~6-7hrs away. Nice little local seafood joint on the Potomac. South of DC, you'd be detouring off 95 (no idea if this was done for traffic reasons or just for variety but was close enough to the chosen route that it came up in a quick lunch search).

Food was nice enough, not a conventional tourist destination by any stretch but the memorable thing about it was that out back there was a bizarrely out of place little beach with a themed tiki bar complete with palm trees. It felt like a minor Twilight Zone experience; ""Wait... palm trees don't grow this far north, right? We've been driving in the right direction, right?"". Not like, little ones in pots either. Legit looked like a Florida beach.

Apparently they've got a guy who trucks them in every year and replants. Which sounded nuts, but alright. I have no idea if this is a completely unique phenomenon or not (and I suppose no guarantee that it's always done up to the same degree depending on year/season) but it made for a fun little memory.

"I used to go to school in FL and made the trip too many times to count.  The biggest hassle is getting through the DC beltway area.  If you leave very early, like 5am, you can usually get through somewhat easily hitting it late-morning.  Outside of that, just go zen mode and accept the traffic.  Once you're south of Richmond, it's pretty smooth sailing.

For rest stops: 

Clara Barton Rest Stop, last spot on the NJ turnpike to get NJ gas.

The Maryland House, which has a decent-sized food court.

Florida Welcome Center give you free cups of OJ (don't know if COVID affected this).

IIRC NJ and SC tend to have the best gas prices.

South of the Border is worth about a 1/2 hour of exploring a classic ""tourist trap""

For overnights,

Fredericksburg, VA is a popular first stop.

"Have lived here for six years and love it, although we are soon moving (very bittersweet). It’s definitely a small town where it’s easy to get to know your neighbors and see the same friendly faces around. There’s a lot of pride in the town and community with regular parades, fairs, events. 

It’s got some great restaurants and shops, but it’s not extensive, however town sorta bleeds right into Dobbs Ferry so there are always additional options a mile away. Antoinette’s roasts the best coffee in Westchester and bake all their own pastries in-house.  

There is a lot of musical people, but if you’re looking for a band to be playing at the bar there aren’t many options for it anymore (RIP Roadhouse and The Mill). That said, you may bump into a jazz quartet on the lawn outside the library.

There are two versions of HoH: Those who have lived here there whole lives and go back a few generations. And then those who recently moved here from Brooklyn to start a family.

If you don't have to move immediately there is 1 Clinton Park. It's just about done, but they are starting to lease now. This is 1 of a 2 building development with a pedestrian plaza in between.

I did so, and they said they would only accept liability if the pothole was reported at least 2 weeks prior, so they knew about it and it was recorded in their system, and they failed to fill it.

"Some thoughts:
* Rosie’s Bistro takes down its outdoor seating during colder months. It’s not an option now.
* Underhill Crossing is in an enclosed shelter with an open wall. It’s fine as long as it’s not too crowded. Tre’dici Social is similar in setup. Scalini Osteria has an outdoor alley and a true outdoor setup, but no one ever sits in the latter. La Casa Bronxville has an outdoor shelter with individual booths, too.
* If you’re coming on a Tuesday night, you’ll generally be fine anywhere. None of the outdoor restaurants get that busy. Busiest time will be 6-8.
* As things start to warm up, you’ll have more options. Coals just put out their tables, but have no heat lamps. If they’re open outside, their tables are well spaced out. Il Bacio (Italian) or Haiku (Asian bistro) would work when they’re outdoors, too. 
* That said, you can’t go wrong with a picnic on the Bronx River Pathway. Just check the weather first, as it is a flood plain and can get muddy after a legit storm.

"**An excerpt from True Allegiance, by Ben Shapiro:**


Then he heard the voice.

   “Hey, pig,” it said. The voice wasn’t deep. It was the voice of a child. And the
kid stood outside the door of the quick mart, legs spread, arms hanging down by
his sides. A cute black kid, wearing a Simpsons T-shirt and somebody’s old
Converse sneakers and baggy jeans.

   On his hip, stuck in those baggy jeans, was a pistol.

   It looked like a pistol, anyway. But O’Sullivan couldn’t see clearly. The light
wasn’t right. He could see the bulge, but not the object.

   O’Sullivan put his flashlight back in his belt and put his hand back on his
pistol, the greasy handle still warm to the touch.

   “Stop right there, pig,” the kid said. His hand began to creep down toward his
waistband.

   O’Sullivan pulled the gun out of its holster, leveling it at the kid. “Put your
hands above your head. Do it now!”

   “Fuck you, honky,” the kid shot back. “Get the fuck out of my neighborhood.”
Then he laughed, a cute kid’s laugh. O’Sullivan looked for sympathy behind
those eyes, found none.

   Oh, shit, O’Sullivan thought. Then he said, “Hands up. Right now.”

   The kid laughed again, a musical tinkling noise. “You ain’t gonna shoot me,
pig. What, you afraid of a kid?”

   O’Sullivan could feel every breath as it entered his lungs. “No, kid, I don’t
want to shoot you,” he said. “But I need you to cooperate. Put your hands above
your head. Right now.”

   The kid’s hand shifted to his waistband again. O’Sullivan’s hands began to
shake.

   “Get the fuck out of my neighborhood,” the kid repeated.

   O’Sullivan looked around stealthily. Still nobody on the street. Totally empty.
The sweat on his forehead felt cold in the night air. In the retraining sessions at
the station, they’d told officers to remember the nasty racial legacy of the
department, be aware of the community’s justified suspicion of police. Right
now, all O’Sullivan was thinking about was getting this kid with the empty eyes
to back the fuck off.

   “Go on home,” he said.

   “You go home, white boy,” said the kid. His hand moved lower.

   Suddenly, O’Sullivan’s head filled with a sudden clarity, his brain with a
preternatural energy. He recognized the feel of the adrenaline hitting. He wasn’t
going to get shot on the corner of Iowa and Van Dyke outside a shitty
convenience store in a shitty town by some eight-year-old, bleed out in the gutter
of some city the world left behind. He had a life, too.

   The gun felt alive in his hand. The gun was life.

   The muzzle was aimed dead at the kid’s chest. No way to miss, with the kid
this close, just ten feet away maybe. Still cloaked in the shadow of the gas
station overhang.

   “Kid, I’m not going to ask you again. I need you to put your hands on top of
your head and get on your knees.”

   “Fuck you, motherfucker.”

   “I’m serious.”

   The kid’s hand was nearly inside his waistband now.

   “Don’t do that,” O’Sullivan said.

   The kid smiled, almost gently.

   “Don’t.”

   The kid’s smile broadened, the hand moved down into the pants. “Get the
fuck out of my hood,” the kid cheerfully repeated. “I’ll cap your ass.”

   “Kid, I’m warning you,” O’Sullivan yelled. “Put your hands above your head!
Do it now…”

   The roar shattered the night air, a sonic boom in the blackness. The shot blew
the kid off his feet completely, knocked him onto his back.

   O’Sullivan reached for his radio, mechanically reported it: “Shots fired,
officer needs help at the gas station on Iowa and Van Dyke.”

   “Ohgodohgodohgodohgod,” O’Sullivan repeated as he moved toward the
body, the smoke rising from his Glock. He pointed it down at the kid again, but
the boy wasn’t moving. The blood seeped through Homer Simpson’s face,
pooled around the kid’s lifeless body. The grin had been replaced with a look of
instantaneous shock. His hand had fallen out of his waistband with the force of
the shooting.

   In it was a toy gun, the tip orange plastic.

   For a brief moment, O’Sullivan couldn’t breathe. When he looked up, he saw
them coming. Dozens of them. The citizens of Detroit, coming out of the
darkness, congregating. He could feel their eyes.

   Officer Ricky O’Sullivan sat down on the curb and began to cry.

"A few things. You may be overrating the westchester dining scene based on this and your previous post. Yes there are a few gems here and there but overall it’s extremely lackluster. The Hudson valley and Connecticut and western MA have better restaurants/food culture than westchester. 

Many towns in westchester don’t have any big box stores. You simply commute to the areas that have thr big box stores when you need them. For instance the entire northeast of westchester(somers, north Salem, Katonah, Bedford, pound ridge, etc) has zero big box stores and you just drive to white plains, Stamford, yorktown etc. 

Starbucks is terrible so that’s a good thing. Small 3rd wave coffee shops are good. 

Dobbs Ferry is more diverse and the people would be less “Brooklyn liberal” but still dobbs ferry has river town personality as compared to the sound towns which is not Brooklynly. 

In terms of test scores I would say by the time your kid is ready for college test scores may already be completely de-emphasized for college admissions. Many schools are already making the SAT optional (I don’t agree with this trend but it’s related to ultra liberal test scores are white supremacy rubbish).

"Hi, I’m in Hastings on Hudson. I’ll try to answer as many of your questions as I can remember. 

I guess it’s a hip town in a suburban kind of way. We moved here the year before the pandemic (2019? I can’t remember) so I’m not too aware of the music scene but I have been seeing some social media posts about local musicians performing at the local coffee shop and I know quite a few residents play one kind of musical instrument or another, myself included. I guess that counts as a music scene. I would love to see more bands playing around town. 

I’ve never been to Edgemont I can’t comment on how much more or less diverse Hastings is but on the grand scheme of things its not super diverse. That said, for what it’s worth it’s getting more diverse. It was a white working class town (read into that what you will) until, I think, about 20 or 30 years ago when the factory that made mustard gas or something shut down. 

There is no Starbucks or big box stores, there are a good selection of mom and pop shops and restaurants in the downtown area. When we need to visit a big box store we go to Central Ave in Yonkers, they have have most of them. 

It is comparable to Dobbs Ferry, I think Dobbs might be a little bigger and the downtown area is definitely bigger. 

The school district here is great and they have really great services for neuro-diverse kids which we love because our older guy needs some…actually all of those services. 

I’m guessing from your questions you haven’t visited yet. You really should come look around. It’s pretty walkable so if you’re moving up from NYC you don’t need to get a car right away if you don’t walk.

"I lived in Tuckahoe (very near Sagamore, as it happens) back in high school and it's a fantastic little town. I almost moved back a couple of years ago, in fact. It's actually come a LONG way in the last couple of decades, with a ton of revitalization of downtown and Main Street, as well as the old Revlon factory across the tracks, bringing in a good amount of tax revenue to the town that was missing during most of the late Eighties and Nineties. Despite having a train station the town still lacks a cool ""town square"", but it has great parks and sports fields, the Bronx River walking/biking path, solid schools (a ton better than when I went there!) and easy access to highways, country clubs like Lake Isle, NYC, White Plains and Central Ave. There aren't and never have been safety or crime issues anywhere in the town, unless you count the [Scripps Heiress murder back in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Scripps), right down the road from where you're looking to move.

"This road in particular is managed by the NY State Thruway Authority, so Westchester tax dollars don’t really directly affect it. 

NYSTA maintains, operates and staffs the NY portion of 90, 87 and 287. I looked it up and the budget for repairs and resurfacing is only 900m- it would take conservatively 50 to 75m to resurface the Westchester portion of 287.  Knowing that 287 is only 11 miles of the ~550 mile thruway, hard to commit that money. Especially with the rising costs of materials, fuel and hard to staff paving crews.

"My dad has worked on a paving crew my entire life so I know a lot about paving, most of it against my own will 😂

A lot of it is weather related, the freeze and thaw every year of the ground underneath, plowing pulls up pavement, normal wear and tear from being a heavily traveled road. 

Generally, what I’ve seen is they rely to heavily on patches to extend the life of the road instead of re-paving. But that’s also a logistical problem for  a major thruway, needing night road work.

"I/mc1298

I am the original Highlands responder from earlier today. 10605 does cover a few neighborhoods, one being the Highlands. We have many beautiful neighborhoods here in WP and it’s a great family oriented area to raise kids. We do have 5 elementary schools (I never said they were all in the Highlands). My child went to Church Street which is across town but was a wonderful experience. I know families at all schools and all have had wonderful experiences.The Rocky Dell area is closest to the Ridgeway Elementary School. 

I never said Rooster Market was a coffee shop although they have excellent coffee. It’s a small local deli where everyone knows each other. A wonderful little local spot. But plenty of coffee shops like Hastings, Araras, WFM, Starbucks and Dunkin’ are all close by. 

I recommend the local WP Moms page on Fb. You can search and find lots of info on the neighborhood you are looking at and the schools nearby.

"Sport time and WSA have been there because they have the better locations in the area.   


Most of it is industrial zoning and they fit that well. Elmsford raceway was actually deeper in the industrial section of that area but ended up moving to their final location in the mid 2000's if I remember correctly.   


the fact that the area is mostly industrial zoning makes it hard for non-industrial businesses to survive there. not saying its a problem, just a consequence. i.e.: cactus jack's, fairview golf center, the shopping center with the multiplex....",t2_10qily,FoxMcLOUD420,0,1647526433.0,0,t1_i10r1g8,i10r1g8,False,julianfri,t3_tfjk2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tfjk2z/elmsford_raceway_mid_90s/,Elmsford Raceway mid 90s,/r/Westchester/comments/tfjk2z/elmsford_raceway_mid_90s/i10r1g8/,2,r/Westchester,0,2

"Hi, I have lived for the past 30 years in zip code 10605 in White Plains. The neighborhood is called the Highlands and it is a fabulous neighborhood filled with families and young children. It is a super sort after neighborhood and the current market is very hot so finding a home can take some time. Here in the Highlands you will find families walking and playing outside, beautifully maintained homes and gardens and local coffee shops filled with smiling faces. Stop into Roosters Market on Gedney Way and you will get the perfect feel of the locals. We have 5 elementary schools all of which are wonderful. Think about joining the Highlands Neighborhood Page on Facebook for a better idea. Everyone is friendly and will have loads of advice for you. Best of Luck!

"Your employer cannot take any action against you for missing work due to Jury Duty, but you should let them know ASAP of course.

Don't worry about dressing up, just wear something clean, not vulgar/offensive, and comfortable. There is no coat-check, so if you bring one, or a bag, you'll be carrying it with you through the day.

You're going to White Plains, yeah? If you're driving, park in the all-day parking at the Galleria Mall a block away. Bring a physical book/newspaper/magazine. They will confiscate your phone when you enter the courthouse. Wear comfortable shoes, because you could be standing for quite a while before you get inside. Even if you show up, like, an hour before you're supposed to arrive there will be people in line already. Don't sweat not getting into the building by the time on the card, just be on line.

From there, just follow instructions. You'll fill out some forms, you'll watch some videos made in, like, 1990 about the importance of Jury Duty. Then you'll sit until your name is called. You will probably be either picked or dismissed by the end of the day, but you *may* be told you'll need to stay late if jury selection is still ongoing, and you *may* even be asked to come back on another date (they only do jury selection on certain days of the week). If you're picked, you'll be led to a different room where you'll be questioned to see if the prosecutors and defense attorneys are okay with you being on that jury. You'll also have an opportunity to give a reason you should be excused from Jury Duty, but be aware they are *really* strict about what they allow - basically, you need to own a business you cannot be away from or be *absolutely essential* at home or work to be excused.

 If you're picked for a jury, they'll give you the start date of the trial and possibly some idea of how long it's expected to last. Again, your boss cannot take action against you because of this. They don't have to pay you, though, but you will be paid by the Court ($50/day if memory serves, check mailed to you after you complete your duty). If you are dismissed (not chosen and not told to come back another day), you're clear for the next five years.",t2_7gso6,TheCheshireCody,0,1647464961.0,0,t1_i0xnvsb,i0xnvsb,True,ImmediateAttitude218,t3_tfk3b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tfk3b9/just_got_a_jury_duty_summons_what_should_i_expect/,Just got a jury duty summons.. what should I expect?,/r/Westchester/comments/tfk3b9/just_got_a_jury_duty_summons_what_should_i_expect/i0xnvsb/,5,r/Westchester,0,5

"Saw this on my ring alert and couldn’t believe the length of the video, I thought it was looped at first. Truly disgusting.  

Whats also disturbing is that if she had some how fought back and injured this trash person then she might get charged herself.

I worked as a superintendent in lower Yonkers NY about 5 years ago. It’s a pretty rough area and the buildings I was working were low income, and had a lot of homeless and drug users who would hang around. One guy who had been arrested for assaulting other people on the same street multiple times (ill link a related video below, yea that’s how often it happen) , for assaulting people while on PCP (sometimes naked) , decided he didn’t like me for whatever reason I won’t speculate at the moment.  He would threaten me on a near daily basis and I even reported him to the police. 
One morning while I’m walking out of the corner store with a coffee he follows me around the corner when I leave and sucker punches me in the head. I turned around and told him to fuck off, he proceeded to hit me in the face 3 more time and tries to kick me in the stomach.  For reference I’m 175lbs 5,9” and he’s pushing 300lbs  6,4” ish.   I swat his 4th punch away and told him again to leave. He made another foray foward and I pulled my karambit and slashed his fore arm wide open . He recoiled  and screamed running down the block at which point i closed my knife and put in back in my pocket. Within 2 mins the police where there and arrested me , then took the “victim” to the hospital. I was charged with felony 2nd degree assault , because I , to quote the interviewing detective “should have let him beat me up more” .  

TLDR: defending myself in lower Yonkers from a known maniac and got charged with felony assault.

 Data from the New York City Police Department (NYPD) indicate that Asian Americans are the only racial group that experienced increased victimization across all offense types between 2008 and 2019.2 In 2008, for example, Asian American victims accounted for 4.0% of murder victims, 4.7% of rape victims, 11.6% of robbery victims, 5.2% of aggravated assault victims, and 10.3% of all grand larceny victims in the New York City. These numbers increased to 6.9%, 8.0%, 15.6%, 7.7%, and 15.7% respectively in 2019. Hate crimes against Asian Americans have also increased over the years.

"It was stressful because I was unable to do it well myself within the confines of my apartment. Someone with experience who has the space and tools will do a better job than me by myself in a tiny bathroom with a plastic water pitcher.

However, I would like a periodic bath for her to get the dirt, dander, and oils that she can't get herself that accumulate over time. So I am looking for someone who does a good job that others can recommend so it can be a fairly pleasant experience she can be acclimated to.

"I can only speak to how it works with LG, but when you purchase direct through the manufacturer they go out and pick a competitive installer for you. Then you get a call/email from the contractor who will come out, fly drones, and confirm dimensions. I actually gained capacity! So don't be discouraged if your initial estimate and roof layout isn't what you hoped for. It can change because satellite views aren't perfect for panel placement. You don't pay anything until this work is done and you pay the installer directly because they know local incentives and file paperwork for you.

A lot of people chose to reach the contractor first. And many manufactures websites will direct you to these contractors for purchase. Going to contactor first could be beneficial because they can carry a few competing products and depending on your roof setup it could be good to have someone offering various designs to get the most out of your roof space.

In my case I already had a contractor offer the most efficient panels and learned I would pay more and get less overall capacity because the panel dimensions prevented me from packing panels in the quantity I'd like. LGs panel dimensions allowed me to pack more panels into the sunniest places and at a lower price. Not the most efficient, but the most area covered cheaply was great for me.

"Peekskill. We just moved here in October and love it. We were also in a similar position and initially figured we’d rent first to experience NY before buying, but after seeing the costs of rents everywhere it just seemed smarter to buy now with the cheap rates and a mortgage lower than rent. We bought an old house in a nice neighborhood for under $500k that needs some cosmetic TLC, but our mortgage/taxes are under $3500/mo. I commute to the Bronx via car everyday (~1 hour-ish), but my neighbor walks down to the train every morning to get into Manhattan (10min walk & hour train ride). The city has a ton to offer with restaurants/bars, a nice waterfront along the Hudson, Depew Park/Blue Mountain State Park hiking trails and ease of access to the outdoors. When we looked in neighboring areas (Ossining, Cortlandt/Mohegan etc.) they didn’t seem to offer all the things we were looking for in our first home with starting a family in mind, but also being able to walk into town for fun and easily get out of the house.

"What if the shoreline, as an appealing place to visit, only exists because someone invested money into making it exist? If a resource exists only because it's been invested in, do the people who invested and continue to invest in that resource have a right to ask people using that resource to contribute in order to offset their investment?

Or for ostensibly pubic beaches with difficult/expensive access, do the residents who live in that community have the right to minimize intrusion by masses of outsiders coming in and taking over? I'm usually fairly anti-NIMBY, but I've lived across the street from a pubic beach with easy access (Miami Beach.) It was awful. The beach was disgusting within a day of being cleaned. There was noise constantly. On nicer beach days, it was virtually impossible to find a spot on the beach or to drive down the street because of the traffic. And the thing is, while visitors only had to pay a nominal parking fee (something like $8 for a day at the time,) the residents who lived in the area had to pay a significant privilege year round because of living there - costs that were exacerbated because we also had to pay to deal with the problems caused by large numbers of visitors like beach cleanup and policing.

So I guess my question is: if you open up the shoreline to everyone, with minimal costs, aren't you just creating negative externalities for visitors who don't have to shoulder the economic costs of their activities, and moving that entire burden onto residents?",t2_gezoi,the_lamou,1,1646966597.0,0,t1_i06xizc,i06xizc,False,Saucysquid6969,t3_tb7fd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tb7fd1/which_beach_club_is_more_expensive_beach_point/,"Which beach club is more expensive, Beach Point Club (Mamaroneck) or shenorock (Rye)?",/r/Westchester/comments/tb7fd1/which_beach_club_is_more_expensive_beach_point/i06xizc/,1,r/Westchester,0,1

"> I don't know much about the Glen Island Park situation . . . are there any articles about it? I'm curious. 

I'm not aware of any discussion of the matter at hand but here's something from when the development was originally announced:

>https://www.newrochelleny.com/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1332&ARC=1784

As one might expect, the entire discussion is about the economic interests of the city and a lot of fluff that boils down to ""how great is it that we have created a bit of high-end housing"". 

To my memory, the area was an undeveloped rocky terminus of that stretch of land, and it was dramatically expanded in the first place. Beach clubs and private homes line the other water-facing side of the formation, with one public park (Davenport) in the middle of them (which also imo is a nice park but feels like access is slightly hostile insofar as the sidewalks don't even go all the way there - can't encroach on that lovely manicured lawn in front of the wall of the first beach club).

I'd say it spoiled the park at glen island a tiny bit(as well as the much smaller Neptune park), I mean it's a nice property but it's just so in your face to be out looking over the water at the northern end.",t2_lhsib,getrill,0,1646952893.0,0,t1_i06366z,i06366z,False,Saucysquid6969,t3_tb7fd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tb7fd1/which_beach_club_is_more_expensive_beach_point/,"Which beach club is more expensive, Beach Point Club (Mamaroneck) or shenorock (Rye)?",/r/Westchester/comments/tb7fd1/which_beach_club_is_more_expensive_beach_point/i06366z/,1,r/Westchester,0,1
"Playland Beach is reasonably publicly accessible.  Edith G. Read Preserve is a nature preserve intentionally kept in a natural state, but they go overkill with nasty signs warning people against even opening lawn chairs.  Rye Town Beach has tons of access restrictions; nonresidents must pay egregious sums for access.  

Greenwich also has very nice beaches, and is even more ridiculous about access. 

I don't know much about the Glen Island Park situation . . . are there any articles about it?   I'm curious.   

I think this area is richly endowed with natural resources and we should think of access as a birthright instead of something jealously guarded by individual landowners and by municipalities.

"What is your take, for example, on the area of and around Rye Beach? Do you think the access fees are unreasonable? Should more beaches like that be built and maintained?

If you walk along the shore just on the other side of playland, which is a conservation area that imo does a nice job at providing a public resource, it is really a far cry from what I think most people would consider an appealing place to go. I recall walking there once and seeing two people with chairs set up (the whole area has lots of signs forbidding such things), and all I could think was, dear lord these two people must have no sense of smell. As a little hike through it was fine but the rotting seaweed all along the rocky shore that day was borderline overpowering. Point being that the lovely little beach just around the bend is not something that I think just exists as part of the natural splendor around here.

A more apt example for my personal interest though would be the substantial development completed recently adjacent to Glen Island park. I can only imagine that they'd be quick to bury anyone who wanted to get in there with lies and FUD, or if they actually do have exclusive control over all that, it's a little sad and a step in the wrong direction imo.

"I agree, though in this area I imagine such matters go largely unchallenged because our natural shoreline tends to be relatively unappealing. Catch-22 if the reason people want access is because there's a sandy beach, but the sandy beach only exists because a private business operates with exclusive access. A lot of natural areas are also locked down in the name of conservation but then we get this dance between moneyed interests gobbling up some of the shoreline which only increases the need to conserve what remains, and the public ends up in a lose-lose position where access becomes a marginal and tightly restricted slice of the pie.

To my knowledge, if someone wanted to pick the fight and gain access to private shoreline, they'd be within their rights as long as they originate from public access (walking or taking some craft) and stay below the high tide waterline. But it would certainly be an arduous fight. 

I am curious though if beachfront properties that have created their own beaches directly secure exclusive rights to such areas under any law, or simply skirt by on public ignorance that there may be any obligation to have access.",t2_lhsib,getrill,0,1646949399.0,0,t1_i05ula4,i05ula4,False,Saucysquid6969,t3_tb7fd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tb7fd1/which_beach_club_is_more_expensive_beach_point/,"Which beach club is more expensive, Beach Point Club (Mamaroneck) or shenorock (Rye)?",/r/Westchester/comments/tb7fd1/which_beach_club_is_more_expensive_beach_point/i05ula4/,9,r/Westchester,0,9
