I’d also throw in, assuming you can do light hikes (I’m thinking mixture of a backpack with the kid in it) the crashed plane is pretty cool and made far easier with the raised path.

Wolf is probably the best bet with a kid which won’t be too bad.  I’d strongly suggest pluvio if it was just the two of you.

"I'm not too familiar with what is desirable or feasible with an infant.  Are you allowed to take a little baby on a whale watching trip?  I'd call to make sure.  The waves can be rough and the boat can slam down.  Adults end up in hospital from whale boat accidents, especially the smaller boats.  Make sure it's a covered, larger vessel for sure.

If the weather cooperates, do a picnic on the beach - chesterman or long beach.   Check out some walking trails, Tonquin beach is nice.  

I also recommend the Wild Pacific Trail in Ucluelet, and the Rainforest Loop which is near the junction.  Nice big trees on both trails.  

I suggest the Wickinninish for breakfast or lunch (or dinner if you're fancy).  Again, ask about bringing the baby.  For a family friendly experience I always enjoyed the restaurant in what used to be Jamie's Rainforest Inn - I think it's hotel Z now?  It should still be a restaurant, not sure about the quality as it's been years.  My wife and I got married there when it was Jamie's, so that tells you how much we liked it.

Shelter is kind of meh.  A lot of people like it and I did go there regularly myself, but it's kind of crowded and the food is just ok.  

Wolf and Fog is a much better menu / quality, but be sure to get rezzies as they fill up fast.  

Sobo is also child friendly, can be crowded and loud, but I really liked their salmon chowder, broiled oysters, fish tacos, and their desserts. 

Speaking of fish tacos, the Tacofino truck is reliably yummy and so is the Wildside Grill.

"So you might hate this comment and I apologize in advance. The only reason I’m suggesting the following is because you said you don’t normally wear make up.


If I were you I would buy some waterproof mascara, waterproof eye liner (if needed) and a coloured lip balm/tint. What I have done in the past is I have bought a coloured eye liner which helped add some colour. I have blue eyes so I did a rose gold/coral colour (it was a softer colour) and it looked great. Super natural look. I had to buy everything new. It cost me $50.00 (I got a free sample of mascara for some coincidental promo). It take up close to no space in your bag. I know fake eyelashes have become super popular recently and that is something you could consider as well. Wouldn’t even need the mascara then. 


I would practice putting the make up on and seeing how you like it and the time it takes to apply it yourself. 


Tofino can get windy so if you will be outside a braid/ponytail is always a great option if your hair is long enough. There are tons of different braids so if you want half up half down that’s cool. Dutch braid? Fantastic. Crown braid? You might need to go to a salon for that one unless you/spouse to be have super capable fingers. I will admit I do not. Legolas’ hair do? Super easy.


I feel like the beaches and forest are already such an amazing thing that no matter how intricate or simple you style your hair/make up you will stand out 


I would make sure a week or two before you elope to be really dedicated to your skincare routine, drink a ton of water and try to have a cleaner diet if some foods make you break out. Also remember to laugh and not be a total stress monster (it’s easier said than done).

You will look gorgeous, you will be distracted by your awesome soon to be spouse and beautiful Tofino.",t2_1ii4mm8,liisathorir,0,1644830136.0,0,t1_hww2bos,hww2bos,True,wantokk,t3_ss2sx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/tofino/comments/ss2sx6/hair_makeup_for_lowkey_elopement/,Hair & Makeup for low-key Elopement?,/r/tofino/comments/ss2sx6/hair_makeup_for_lowkey_elopement/hww2bos/,3,r/tofino,0,3

> Mike Farnworth said that several communities had activated emergency plans in response to the advisory, which he said is proof that the province’s early tsunami advisory systems are working.

> ""To be clear, this is an advisory only, and not a tsunami warning. The risk is limited to increased tidal currents. Until the advisory is lifted, stay away from beaches, shorelines and marinas, and follow the directions of local governments,” Farnworth’s statement reads

"A good instagram page to follow if you have it is:
Tourismtofino

Instagram page includes beaches, hikes, bike paths, events etc.

Although i will mention in july, its usually fairly busy with  tourist and locals, so keep that in mind  when going to restaurants and other places as some may have wait times/might be better to call ahead of time when there.


I know there is a business(cant remember the name for the life of me) that does charcuterie board that im pretty sure you can get delivered to a beach/romantic picnics!  Its a little pricey but if i recall correctly, they use local foods! 

You can rent bikes there and go riding through the trails of tofino along the multiple beaches!

Tonquin beach is amazing to go and watch the sunset, bring a blanket/towel, grab some dinner and watch the sunset.

Long beach is always a must well visiting! Along with the wild pacific lighthouse trail! 


Theres places/people for hire to teach you to surf (definitely recommend) along with places to rent kayaks, paddle boards, and surf boards. 

Theres also fish charters for hire along with wild life tours, if that is of interest for the both of you! 

Depending on what your preference are, the brewery are amazing to go around taste testing. Also tofino licks is amazing. With most resturants/brewery youll get amazing views.

"I say this as someone who prefers boogie boarding to surfing, saw a LOT of surfing injuries and only one boogie board injury (by someone who was an advanced boogie boarder - guess what?  they dislocated their shoulder paddling).  

As a beginner boogie boarder, you can just walk out to the first set of waves, wait until one's behind you, and then jump into it.  It's so fun :)  I don't know why it is not more popular.

"as someone who worked at the hospital for years, please be very careful.  Surfboards to the face can knock out a bunch of front teeth.  Paddling in fall / winter water can dislocate shoulders.  Leashes can take off fingers, or the skin on the hand (degloving).

Surfing can be dangerous if you have never had lessons.

My suggestion, if you just want to play around in the waves, is rent boogie boards instead and stay in the fluff.

"Thanks. And totally hear ya. I come from the most conservative riding in AB and that's originally why I left. In Victoria now. 

But unless you're rich (aka own property) the island is a crap place to live. I make good money but I'll never get ahead unless I can somehow enter the property ladder. I rent so I'm at risk of being renovicted at any time and ending up employed and homeless because all rentals are airbnbs pretty much. Also I have zero chance of ever getting a pet in a rental and I really miss having a cat. I used to pay 1000/month for a 2 bed 2 bath condo with 2 underground parking spots and pets allowed. Now I pay 1500 for a 1 bedroom with not even a balcony. I make 70k but after rent, groceries, gas, insurance - there's a pathetic amount leftover. 

You mention the people in alberta but even with their messed up political views they are a hell of a lot friendlier than the people on the coast I find. Victoria is nothing but rich and old people. I miss living amongst non-entitled people who have to work for what they have. In victoria there is literally never a good time to go to costco etc, because nobody around here seems to have to work so everything is busy at all hours. 

My other complaint is how ridiculously busy it's gotten here. The traffic is insane anymore. Takes over an hour to get out past sooke now after work and even then you're still hiking with everyone and their dog. Unless you're exploring FSR's it's hard to even find a campsite anymore. 

I love the island but I definitely think it's more fun to visit than to live. 

Also the rockies are way more epic than any of the nature out here. In my opinion anyway. 

Maybe we can trade places!

"My quality of life was definitely higher when we lived on the coast. I personally don't align with the ultra conservative Christian views of the majority of people that live where I do. I would move back in a heartbeat. It's just not in the cards for us at this time. Hating Alberta, to me, is very justified. THE current governing party that's pushing to teach KKK propaganda in our public schools, as well as teaching abstinence as the only sex education, removing important black musicians from the curriculum to replace them with the premiers grandfather. Trying to privatize our Healthcare system, cutting school funding, and wasting $30 million dollars on a ""war room"" to run oil propaganda ads in NYC and attack a children's film.

"There is no supply. It is all taken by speculators, investors and air BnB.

IF you can actually get a place to rent (while competing against 70 others desperate for housing)

Here are some REAL examples of rental space offerings in Tofino.

- 2 grand a month for a rat infested single bedroom shack that’s sinking on one side.

- 2200 a month for a unit in a 4plex where the stairs are about to fall off the building 

- 750 a month for a room in a shared staff accommodation which is absolutely filth

- 1500 a month for a bachelor pad but you can only have it for 4 months during the shoulder season then need to find a new spot before the tourists rent it out nightly.

- a space to put your trailer… 1200 a month no hook ups.

And that’s just the start of the list. 

On top of that there’s this dance we call the Tofino shuffle. Everyone who lives here knows the moves. Your rental space is sold or changed into an airBnB so you have to move out and try to find another space. Happens EVERY year to a great deal of people. 

Basically those who make this town a home and a community are forced out  in droves every year.

Yup! That’s exactly what we did. We found a space on the street of our Airbnb that didn’t have any signage (the police officer we spoke to about the issue suggested that) and we put a sign up and left all the windows open - we weren’t worried about that because none of our stuff was left in the RV. We didn’t get any calls or notes left on the RV! Glad we managed a way to park the dang thing without creating any problems for residents or accruing any fines.,t2_33k9mxdl,QuestionablyInnocent,0,1631739589.0,0,t1_hczy9ob,hczy9ob,False,QuestionablyInnocent,t3_pn5262,https://www.reddit.com/r/tofino/comments/pn5262/rv_parking_conundrum/,RV parking conundrum,/r/tofino/comments/pn5262/rv_parking_conundrum/hczy9ob/,2,r/tofino,0,2

"Well, loaded question. The nicest place I've been to on Vancouver Island is The Point Restaurant located at The Wick resort. Like a $100 tasting menu with $80 paired wines kinda place. $50 entrees. $15 cocktails. THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD and the service is impeccable. (Tofino) Next up is Wolf in the Fog, hippy with a side of elegance. Great food, very cool bar. (Tofino) Next is Schooner - great food, casual place. Then all the rest of the places are on par: Shelter, The Shed, 1909, Kuma...

I've dined at every place there as I live on the other side of the Island and I have friends in Ukee.... So any more questions, lemme know! 

For Ucluelet restaurants, I like Cedar Grill, The Blue room, Saki Sushi. But nothing compares to The Pointe and Wolf and Schooner - if you dont mind the drive to Tofino.

"Hi there! 

The path other commenters have suggested is definitely your best bet, it meets up with the Tofino Multi Use Path (or Mup as we call it) which runs from the Tourism Tofino office all the way to ""downtown"" Tofino. 

The Mup runs along the side of the highway (with a sizeable ditch separating them) that runs into town. For reference Hotel Zed is 2.5 km from the Tourism Tofino office. 

You won't be out of place using the Mup for your runs and will likely see other runners.

Running on the beach can be nice but you must do it at low tide and there will still be puddles so expect your shoes to get wet. In the summer  the beaches are generally wayyy too busy for running anyway, would not recommend.

In Tofino and Ucluelet there is plenty of service and open Telus networks and you can use their wifi finder to locate.  These are reliable and free wifi networks. **Zero** Shaw open or go wifi in the area.

Many other private campgrounds out of service areas will have a WPA/WPA2 wifi network for guests and some resorts will have a public network for people visiting or staying.

"Chances are pretty low. Not gonna lie. Especially if your looking for something relatively affordable...

There are people who live here all year round and can’t find a space to rent at all. So Taking up a space set for long term rental when you only want a few months probably won’t fly. Buuuuut there are the bnbs that stop short term rentals over the quieter season. 

As you get closer to December you might be able to find some short term rentals that switch to semi long term over the quieter season. Consider that, with the tourist season supposedly coming back this year, you’ll be in the running with about 100 others IF it even changes from short term rental at all.

Your best bet is staff accommodation if you are looking for work as well. Most resorts have something available at that time of the year for staff accommodation.

As for platforms. FB has multiple groups to try but that’s all I can think of off the top of my head. At least regularly used sites anyway. Maybe try reaching out to some of the bnbs and ask if they will be doing semi long term rentals over the quieter season? 

Not saying you CANT find something but it’s a major struggle with a bunch of digging and foot work.

"A couple things flying_dogs: saying “I know the family” doesn’t make you right, or the cop wrong. Nor does calling someone an “anon”. You’re just as anon. Also, calling yourself a health care professional means nothing. I’ve seen hospital cooks, janitors, and desk workers from my hospital claim the same thing on social media, and it’s BS. Are you a nurse, doctor or paramedic? I doubt it, because if you were you’d never say that “all public servants have been injured, and accept the risk” more BS, NO WE Don’t. We want to go home safe, like everyone else. 
I know the family too, and yes it sucks that Chantel was shot. It’s tragic. However, I’ve been in that cops shoes, with drunk people threatening violence, and it sucks too. Look at the story from the cops perspective…he got called because the family was worried, maybe someone was being held hostage, or was tied up, he HAD NO IDEA who she was, or what was going on. He shows up, and is cornered by a drunk person with a knife. Unless you were there, you just don’t know, so get off your high horse. He doesn’t deserve charges, and there is no “justice” to be had for Chantel. She got pissed-drunk and brought a knife to a gun fight, with a cop. Is that something you would do?

"I know the family, rando.  I spent the better part of my career serving this community.  I'm a health care worker and have not only personally witnessed police brutality more than once, actually, I DO know what I'm talking about, completely random anon.  I have much more than newspapers from which to draw my opinion.  

Speaking of newspapers, has Kamloops taught you nothing about how the very systems you hold up in your comment have been suppressing evidence for decades?  We all have many, very good reasons to be doubtful of the explanation we are offered here.  It is not my place to speak for the family or share specifics here, but I assure you, there is very good reason they are fighting this.

You're on the wrong side, and I'm not sure what your personal investment in this story is, but you really should be more respectful.  This family and community has experienced many consecutive losses and yet continue to provide support and leadership in the community.  

Even if I believed the explanation, and this police officer fired four times into the body of a person half his size, during a wellness check, when she had what sounds like a kitchen utensil, even if I accepted all the facts as presented in the news, that would still be unacceptable.  

I reiterate my point.  All public servants in emergency / social services have been injured by the public while on the job.  Some people have been injured grievously.  The risk is a part of the profession we accept.  None of us are legally allowed to do anything to any member of the public that would cause harm to another person, even in self defense.

It is not unreasonable to expect law enforcement be qualified (have at least a degree in social studies), be trained in de-escalation skills, and be expected to use the minimal amount of force necessary to keep all parties safe.  

That's not what happened here, and it's not right, but our current system says it's legal, and I say that needs to change.

"We are definitely not a cheap company.

Unfortunately do to our economy mostly using China for manufacturing over the last decade we’ve lost skilled Canadian factories.   So if you want to use high quality cotton, sourced ethically, and locally, you end up paying everyone.  The shipper, the manufacturers, the detailer(printing /tagging), the retailer and lastly the business designing/selling.

Cheap clothing is mass produced and ultimately ends up in the landfill.  Paying a bit more for quality, long lasting apparel doesn’t seem so crazy!

We also have higher prices because we don’t mass manufacture. Each piece is made in 15-100 pieces max.

>i wouldnt wanna go there and it turns out its boring and a waste of good money

Its a quiet walk on the beach or a bit of a short shopping walk, a bit of good food, an expensive room, surfing, a small skate park, hard workers in a resort village, park walks, and glamping. You're not going to find Spring Break Miami or Mardi Gras New Orleans here.

Our brains are wired to accept the things we are repeatedly exposed to, so the softcore ""people's farmacy"" shit morphs into ""plandemic"" seemingly overnight.

"You want a story originating from our communities to be silenced? Interesting, the story has had plenty of discussion, over Ucluelet way and in r/BritishColumbia, not a good look that to ""keep it off here"", especially considering how much this blew up by trying to silence those who were understandably concerned by both the anti-mask propaganda and the racism when they had their original comments deleted.

"There aren’t really spots that you’re more likely to see bears than in the forest and whales in the ocean.  If you want to see whales, sitting on the beach for a couple hours with binoculars looking for spouts can be a thing. I’ve seen bears wandering down the street in town, along the highway... in the woods. You really just need to spend time outside. 

If you want a guaranteed sighting or really high chance, take a tour. The whale watching tour is pretty fun.

"Plan ahead. Go in the off season. Camping costs very little. Head to Ukee instead. If you can’t afford to travel, don’t travel. It’s not like Doug in his van is homeless living in Tofino looking for a job. He’s driving 1000 kms to get there without a plan or enough money. Tofino is expensive for everyone, locals included. It sounds to me like you don’t understand the reality of living in a small tourist town. Last year visitors were shitting in peoples yards. And leaving garbage everywhere. And I guarantee you, that someone with a campsite or hotel room, isn’t defecating on local’s lawns. If there is no room for you, don’t go. And we both know that’s not what this is about.

Ugh yeah they advertise for people to come stay there and experience Tofino. Not to squat in the woods or camp in a van on a residential street and use all the public services without giving anything back. Nobody wants to see Doug from Manitoba parked in front of their driveway brushing his teeth and giving himself a cooler bath at 9 in the morning.

"Gone are the days when housing was easier to find off-season.  Tourist season is pretty much year-round now, so get your housing figured out first.  You'd need a heater if you plan to car-camp, as it gets damp and cold by Oct / Nov.  Don't heat your car / tent with a heater that would give you carbon monoxide poisoning. 

Many employers do scale back services in the off-season so the winter jobs tend to be occupied by the year-round residents, but if you do restaurant work you should be able to find something.  

I lived out there 10 years, and my wife was employed mainly in the tourism / service industry, and she got laid off / cut back every winter.  The only reason we left was we were rennovicted for the 4th time and there was literally \*nothing\* to rent.  Not a basement, not an off-season bnb, nothing.  I know essential service workers who may have to leave due to lack of housing.

Yeah tourist season has been running later and later with the new fascination for storm watching out here.

You’ll definitely have a better time finding housing in sept which is good. Weather is still pretty nice but starts to get rainier in late October. Way less tourists and locals tend to be in a better mood/more receptive to visitors. I think you’re making a good choice coming in the fall instead of the summer.

"You could literally buy a used board and wetsuit and then just give it away on your last day for way less than the rental would cost.
Renting is for the foreigners or Albertans who come once a year/lifetime and want to try surfing for a couple days. The used gear market in person and online is huge. Getting rid of if when you are done is not a hassle, and would take a couple minutes if you had something decent or desirable, ie not old rental Stuff.

My first board was 100 bucks, an old 9ft rental, still have it today. My first wetsuit was 90, also an old rental. Had to buy a leash for 10 bucks. I did already have gloves and booties though.

"My sister was a front desk person and stayed in the work accommodation as well. There is on-site accommodation and off-site. If you’re on site the accommodation is pretty nice, it’s a cute little house with 4 bedrooms, but she did have complaints about her roommates. The off-site work accommodation sites are a lot less nice, and known for being kind of loud with lots of partying going on. I think you’d likely be there if you were part of the cleaning staff.

"I want to be very clear, I wasn’t trying to have only rich people come this way when the pandemic variants chill out.

https://www.surfjunction.com/rates-rules/

If you can’t or refuse to afford these rates on top of basic travel costs, something has gone very wrong. We know living out here has higher costs of living, especially with few if any affordable higher density housing being developed, and stagnant wages have hurt us all, but not wanting to pay $25-35 for a booked night? Those are rock bottom prices, cheaper than a basic room for the night, about the same cost as bare minimum food for a day? How does one afford the vehicle to get out here if $25-$35 breaks the bank? I’ve scratched up more than $25-$35 collecting empties from dumpster diving, surely that isn’t hard to save up if the trip is booked well in advance (provided the front desk office of various campgrounds is staffed enough to have checking emails, I guess, which was barely a for sure thing in normal times, let alone pandemic worker troubles on top of the worker with accommodation and vehicle troubles of the coast).

Let’s face it, a lot of people do back road because they didn’t plan and implement their trip, get here and then act surprised that the whole coast is booked solid while the nice people at the info centre scramble to get people to go home or at least Port Alberni back through the Kennedy Lake highway cliff construction mess.

"Do not do “unmonitored” overnight parking, it is not ideal, it’s a plan that has led to at least 6 types of scenarios:

- garbage. It destroys the whole point of why people come out here by damaging the ecosystem. Sewage in the streets, [more] wild animal interactions that have the potential to kill them, and the clean up on the back roads especially. https://www.trailspace.com/articles/backcountry-waste-disposal.html

- lack of security. The “free” parking areas that don’t get tickets and monitored as much ... also have incidents of assault, vandalism, theft, out of control fires, and even death.

- fines and more irate neighbours and LEO interactions. Oddly enough, this doesn’t increase your security. Expect to get the bylaw officers, park rangers, or worse called on you, especially if you’re parked in higher traffic or residential zones, people are not cool with trail heads, driveways, roads, and loading areas being blocked, yet it still happens every year.

- long drives and flat tires and cell reception. It’s just harder on the vehicle, you will likely be out of the range of being able to call for a tow to the local mechanic, so you could find yourself hiking a long time on the west main or wherever and you will have to travel farther to your destination, probably the beach, if you can even find a spot now that host Nations are getting fed up with lack of funding and closing sites that used to be open to all free of charge. Genuine discussions are being had about gating even more access, it was so bad last year.

- clean water. Remember the garbage thing earlier? Well, you’re drinking that, better boil, cool, and filter everything ... that you hopefully didn’t get lost in the rain forest gathering from čims shit creek. Try to get around it with water bottles? We find those contributing to plastic in the water shed too... Remember that extra wear and tear on the vehicle? It leaks and spills and kicks up dust, that’s all in there too and nobody deployed a spill kit or clean up crew when it happens for all the other “free” campers.

- Nation to Nation colonialism. Who do you think you’re getting that spot “free” from, whose sovereignty is being disregarded by assuming you are free to use the actively in use territory because you didn’t see a sign or park rangers they were never properly afforded a budget for when they have greater concerns? 

Do the right thing, contribute to the community hosting your visit, book and pay a fee for a site. For the cheapest options, especially in the summer, try the various campgrounds at the junction between Tofino/Ucluelet, that’s as cheap as it reasonably gets. Anything closer to the beaches and communities pretty much goes up from there during the tourist season.

"So... quarantine for two weeks in a border hotel, at their prices, on your dime before you even get paid? Must be a really nice job, like management position wages or something.

Secondly, the accommodation situation there is grim, we're talking like like rent a house (if you're lucky) at like last I checked $2000 a month which lets face it is probably first and last months money down plus security deposit or rent a room in a shared house (hope you like trying to sleep in a cramped area with your American boyfriend ... which last I checked the USA-Canada border is still closed to non-essential travel, sorry if I haven't kept up to date on that) at like that house or apartment with however many else you are sharing it with (and their drama), which could leave you with the bill if things go sideways (which they already have in a pandemic in a remote community where the living costs are up there, the cops are not being cool to First Nations, and you're going to need to buy a used car or rely on your employer - the bus shut down). Or maybe your employer has staff accommodation secured, its still going to be a shared living space and people will complain about dates brought into the area. And trying to bush tent life is not really going be sunshine and roses, its a challenge in the rain forest, even before the security issues for being a part of the transient population of seasonal workers.

Let me put it this way, the two things prospective employers always ask me is if I have a place to live and if I have my own vehicle ... and I have lived here with my family for decades.

"Oh Tofino is not crime free, not at all.  Wow.  No.  There’s organized crime in Tofino / Ucluelet.

Tofino is an “end of the road” town, a place many folks “end up” because they literally just travel until they run out of road.  Unfortunately, tofino does not have big city services like shelters or food banks, so people in need of services end up in the campgrounds, in the ER, and in jail.

There’s a restaurant / motel that used to be called “jacks” that i think us now “the hatch” that I think has staff accom.  I think long beach lodge might have staff accom.

You need to have a safe place to sleep where you can lock the door and lock your stuff when you go working or surfing.

Don’t get me wrong, I loved living there, for sure.  If there is a way you can live out there safely, do it.  But don’t believe the hippy mecca sales pitch, that the campgrounds are all peace n love.  Sure there are good people, but the bad stuff that goes on only seems to affect the victims, who then leave the community quickly.

Yes and bro you literally wrote the answer to this in your comment. If we had done nothing, the death toll would be 5x... 10x... maybe more. Look what happen in the US -- and that was them doing a little more than nothing.

"Have any more died than any other year?

BC surpassed 1,000 total deaths in January. It is also important to note that these are deaths WITH covid - not necessarily FROM covid. If a person tested positive for covid 30 days prior to or at time of death it is added to the list. They could have been at the end of a battle with terminal cancer, but if they test positive they are added to the covid deaths. Further, they are using the PCR test which is wildly inaccurate. 

A few months ago, Bonny Henry stated that there had only been TWO deaths outside of Long-term Care Facilities. The average life expectancy after entering a LTC facility is 14 months.

Are we really going to shut down the entire world and destroy everyone's lives because of this?

Doesn't seem right to destroy the present moment and futures of healthy people because of these numbers. This irrational fear-based policy is not conducive to a thriving society.

Free the healthy and protect the vulnerable would be a far more balanced approach IMO

If someone is afraid they have the right to do what they feel is right to protect themselves - they should NOT have the right to push that fear and control over others.

"Is your travel essential? No? Stay home. 

It doesn't matter who you are, where your from, where you're going, or when you booked. Stay home. If you absolutely must travel and can't wait another year (oh the horror) you should quarantine for 2 weeks before interacting with anyone from another community. Lots of people on the island don't want people visiting, lots of business are checking drivers licenses and refusing to serve anyone that's not local. Most people I've talked to throughout the island want the ferries shut down to all but essential travel. Most places here are smaller communities that don't have access to large medical facilities to treat people if an outbreak happens. It's not about if you'll get sick, it's about the damage you can cause to the community if you bring the virus in.

"1. Just ethically speaking, don't come and put locals at risk during Covid if there's a travel ban. Even without a ban, consider that you're adding pressure to an already struggling small remote community.
2. Parking-wise, it's almost impossible to find non-paid parking places, even for stealth vans, especially during Covid. The municipality and residents have it very locked down.
3. Culture-wise, Van lifers aren't super welcome in Tofino even during regular times because everyone and their dog tries to do it. Covid has put everyone on even much higher alert. You won't be super welcome, regardless of how respectful you actually are.
4. Showers: There's public cold showers at some of the beaches. Not sure if they're open during Covid though. You can pay to use the 'surf club' hot tub and change rooms at Long Beach Resort, but it ain't cheap. I think like $20 per use.
5. Work: Common Loaf and Tofitian are the best places I've found to work on a laptop. Again, likely won't make much sense during Covid.

"Van life in tofino can be rough as it’s pretty dang wet from now until maybe March... not saying you can’t do it but it’s not easy either.

The above comment about tickets and towing is true-ish. 

Also the locals aren’t very friendly to visitors looking to just chill out here these days. If covid is still going and we have travel advisories when you’re thinking of coming by, I’d say rethink the plan. 

Work is slim, recreation is slimmer, housing (or parking in this case) is slimmest.

"Awesome thanks for the reply! I’ve been looking into staff accommodation jobs and I actually decided to get my van because I searched for 6 months looking for a house that’s available for rent and couldn’t find anything. 

I’m gonna keep looking for jobs that have housing but if not then I’ll most likely go the van route and look into a parkspass.

"People in Tofino get kind of touchy about “vanlifers” but with poolesland gone and so much housing being taken up by vacation rentals it can be impossible to find anywhere else to live. It’s probably healthier and safer than other options you may find as well. I know folks living in houses with horrible mold problems that their landlords refuse to fix, and a guy living 12 people to a 5 bedroom house. As long as you’re being respectful of the environment and cleaning up after yourself then I don’t see why it should be a problem. As others have said, parking your van anywhere in town is going to be tough. People tend to setup out on the backroads off the highway. If you pay for a park pass then a lot of the beaches have public showers. Another option would be to look into jobs with staff accommodations but be aware that many of them have issues and wouldn’t pass any kind of health/safety inspections.

"Making reservations?

Using the pull outs on Highway 4?

Ok with long stops (up to 4 hours, even longer if they screw up the blasting again and knock out the road) on Highway 4 because of the construction at the end of Kennedy Lake?

Not trying to feed wildlife?

Avoiding parking on the side of the road dangerously?

Not dumping any garbage on the paths, beaches, and back roads?

Yeah, its been a rough summer, even with the border ""closed"", which hasn't stopped a few USA license plates from showing up but really most of the people making a mess have been fellow Canadians. So the sentiment isn't great but no one has set up a road block, so its more or less business as usual other than even less evening group activities than other years.

I think you covered wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer, but I suppose you should be prepared for BC to go into lock down again and completely ruin your get-away plans. Which is easier than we would like, there is only one ICU in Tofino for this whole region.

And that's only this weird year, you ok with the possibility of storms and power outages too? Could be fun for surfing if you are experienced and like to read a good book to the sounds of a storm while tucked under a good blanket reading by a LED lamp.

It’s actually common. I have a few friends in the restaurant business and they’ve been contacted as employees to be aware that a coworker has tested positive but also been told to not disclose that information to anyone else for fear of it hurting the business.

"Make a friend that will let you crash at their place or a job that has staff accom are the cheapest options. 

It kinda sucks to say but consider not going to tofino until you can afford it. There is so many people car camping on streets and in driveways and in businesses parking lots this summer (there always is, but it's worse this year). The community has asked for people to NOT do this and besides being subject to fines, it's disrespectful.
