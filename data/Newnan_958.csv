Low Speed Vehicles

40-1-1(25.1) - means any four-wheeled electric vehicle whose top speed attainable in one mile is greater than 20 miles per hour but not greater than 25 miles per hour on a paved level surface and which is manufactured in compliance with those federal motor vehicle safety standards for low-speed vehicles set forth in 49 C.F.R.

"depends on the types of friends you want to make. 

are you looking for time to kill with other like minded individuals.  
are you looking for friends that you will make memories with for a long time.

or the types of friends that you just see on occasion so you don't get burnt out on to much social interaction. 

start with activities you like to do. and see if there are groups that perform said activities near or around you.

do you have co workers your age?

are you looking for new hobbies?

book groups, fall planners, community volunteers, meme groups, athletic programs like baseball, soccer, (most have already filled at this point). there are some places that do game nights for board games and video games. there are young mom groups, music groups. all sorts of things. 

it all really depends on what you really want. sometimes humans get lonely and look for others to confide in and search for a support group, especially introverted people, and making friends is more of a task and not second nature. 

so are you looking for where? or how to take that first step?",t2_nlg16,solarbaz,0,1634868693.0,0,t1_hhkjj75,hhkjj75,True,[deleted],t3_qcze0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/qcze0m/hello_i_24f_was_wondering_how_the_hell_to_make/,Hello.

"Sad to see that this is necessary.  Check out this moving statement from Dr. Chase Puckett:

&#x200B;

I have spent 14 years in this building.  From Lagrange St, it looks fine.  However the inside and the back of the building is horrific.   If you remember seeing how emotional many of us were after the storm, know that it was because we truly love this school and because we saw first hand the devastation the EF4 tornado packed.  It's easy to forget until we had to go in with teams to retrieve records recently and I was reminded just how bad the damage was.   I truly appreciate our board and superintendent's support for our school and community and don't envy the tough decisions they have to make.  I know they will make the right decision whichever way they think we need to go and we will all rise to the occasion.    
After seeing the renderings that were shared at the board meeting, my personal opinion is it would be better for staff and students to truly rebuild not patch up or repair the significantly damaged buildings but work to retain the unique architectural character the campus has been known for with a much more functional, safer, up to date, modern campus with room for growth.  We need cafeterias, hallways, bathrooms, and staircases that can accommodate 2500+ students and 220+ staff.  While I'm no expert on engineering and architecture, I trust my bosses to listen to the experts.  No one asked for a tornado and no one wants to rebuild a school while classes are in session, but we are committed to doing the right thing by our staff, kids, parents, and community.  We are also fortunate to be part of a school system that has historically made wise financial decisions and the financial challenges aren't nearly as profound based on what I saw presented at the BOE meeting.      
This rendering was shared at the recent board meeting.  It's not a final design by any means.  It's just a rendering that reminds me that even a modern building can maintain the historic charm NHS is known for.  If you missed the board meetings, definitely consider clicking in to our school system website at cowetaschools.org.  I share this all as my personal opinion, but know that I am not the decider in chief.  You can find this rendering in the most recent board agenda.    
Either way, our staff knows we are going to have to work through a couple long years with very challenging but workable conditions until we are back on our campus all together.  So for what it's worth, thank you all for working with us, being patient, and remembering that there is a reason we all love this school and community.  Buildings come and go.  Communities are what matter.  They don't make communities like this anymore!    
Your humble and grateful servant,

"Good luck. I’ve been looking for a preschool that does half-days for forever. I don’t even care if they’re religious. But it seems like everywhere is full. It’s insane.

I suggest your wife join mamas of coweta and chatty Newnan women on Facebook and have her ask on there. Also toddler moms of Newnan. It’s a good group to get connected to other parents of toddlers. Basically all of Newnan communicates exclusively via Facebook.

"So sorry to hear you're having a hard time.

Unfortunately, when people say we're full, it's actually true. They are building new apartments everywhere, but they are SO expensive. The ones near me are at least $1500 for one bedroom. You will have to do a lot of hard digging and maybe consider moving just outside of Newnan if you can drive or your family could drive to you and help you out. 

As far as online jobs go, there are a ton out there now. Do research (there are some online job hunting subs here) to make sure you're not getting scammed. If you could find a job and get a start date before you move, that would probably put you in the best position even if you can't find housing right away. If you could work out a 2 or 3 month couchsurfing thing with a family member, start working and get those disability checks coming in, then you can just worry about finding housing later.

Funnily enough one of my family members is moving back here too! ....is it you o.O kevin?

NEWNAN, Ga. — A metro Atlanta family is searching for a college student who was on his way to his mother's house in Newnan and, they say, never made it.

The family said Xavien K. Weatherly, a student at Grambling State University in Louisiana, hasn't been in contact for the last two days.

They said he was on his way to his mom's house in Newnan from his uncle's house in Norcross, but never arrived. His phone is only going to voicemail and they say it's ""completely out of character"" for him to vanish this way.

He was driving a silver 2015 Kia Optima with a license plate of CAN1934.

The family has filed a missing person's report with the Newnan Police Department, who said they were told he has made no contact since his mother last spoke with him. They did not have a report yet ready for release.

Anyone who knows where Xavien is or sees him is being asked to call 911.",t2_9y5dsuf1,According-Steak-2402,0,1622394114.0,0,t1_gzzoxzc,gzzoxzc,True,According-Steak-2402,t3_nofewp,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/nofewp/family_searching_for_missing_college_student_who/,Family searching for missing college student who was on way to mom's home in Newnan and never made it,/r/newnan/comments/nofewp/family_searching_for_missing_college_student_who/gzzoxzc/,4,r/newnan,0,4

"Hello, my name’s Kyle, and I work for the National Weather Service Office in Peachtree City. Just wanted to let you know that this video actually helped us quite a bit with our storm survey yesterday. With the damage still fresh there were several areas that were still extremely hard to get to, but with your video we were able to direct ground teams to areas that were the hardest hit (after some sleuth detective work to identify locations from areal shots) which allowed us to see the damage firsthand and gave us the confidence for a low-end EF4 rating.

"Heya! I’m a Newnan transplant (from Florida, been here a year) and I’ve enjoyed my time here. We have a mixed household including a seven and four-year-old. We’re just south of Downtown. There’s parks almost everywhere- nature and playground types! We love strolling Ashley Park (a large shopping plaza with quarter mile posts laid out along it for walkers). They put up a huge Christmas tree out there and had some kind of handmade market in an empty shop building that I didn’t get to attend but was super jazzed to see. 

Downtown also has a crafters’ market that I believe is the first Saturday of the month (if a local can confirm). The people are laid back and kind for the most part, and it’s easy to go to Atlanta or outward like Alabama/Tennessee/Carolinas/Florida for weekend or short trips (I’m a sucker for travel). 

I work as a dispatcher for transportation and will warn, please be cautious on I-20 if ever you need to take it. I-75/85, 185 interchanges are pretty well marked and navigable if you don’t drive irresponsibility. Atlanta can definitely be a hairy mess especially when weather and travel weekends kick in. 

I certainly don’t regret moving to the area and when I leave later this year, I will miss it. The people have been kind to me, both citizens and professionals (medical/dental experiences) and I’m appreciative of what I learned about myself while being here.

I can name 10 places that are hiring now. You’ll soon realize there is a big population of people that are too good to work some jobs. 

There are a few food pantries around the county. Make sure to ask, you will not go hungry. They are mostly hosted by churches. Lots of kind folks around here too.

Politics have been bad around here. Don’t play the game, you won’t change any minds. The last 2 elections have been a 2/3 Republican, 1/3 Democrat. A bunch of people don’t believe in COVID. It’s just the flu. No masks. Our county’s numbers are terrible right now. 

Try to gather as much money as you can before you get here. I’m sure you can find a room for rent. Just have references. 

All in all the area is gorgeous. The people are kind. We’ve all just been through a bunch recently. We all deserve some forgiveness and our actions to each other to be overlooked.

"Came here to say basically this. My husband and I came here from the Midwest with only what would fit in our car. We had a house ready to rent and jobs lined up but no money to speak of. I agree with getting out of Newnan proper for a less expensive living arrangement. You'll likely need a car or have to rely on Uber/Lyft to get around. I honestly don't know what public transportation is like in Newnan. I think there's a Dial-a-ride program that is pretty cheap but I haven't used it myself.

"Newnan is a fantastic place. It will be a huge change to the typical culture and pace of California, though I’m not particularly well-acquainted to Bakersfield. Housing is tight due to high demand, but there are several apartment complexes and places to rent. I think there’s even one off Newnan Crossing Bypass that is a “pay what you can afford” set up. I don’t know much about it, but it could be good for you. Ultimately, it’s a very welcoming community, so if you are really looking to land on your feet, you can always find a church (like SouthCrest, Crossroads, etc.) to help you get established in an intimate community, too.

"Please don't come here with the expectation to be homeless, that's idiotic. Pull yourself a little nest egg together first, enough to get a place and keep you alive for the first few months. Otherwise you'll hate it because of how insanely stressful it is doing the ""I have to find a job so I don't die"" routine.

Newnan is a great place and jobs are fairly easy to come by. The pay here is gonna be pennies compared to the same jobs in Cali due the lower cost of living but that's okay. You may want to look into a place in Sharpsburg or Whitesburg rather than in Newnan since they're close but living arrangements will be cheaper.

The people here are generally really nice but it'll be a bit of a culture shock coming from California.

Having done some work on foreclosed properties there are only a few areas I would avoid. Arnco mills is one of them. There were a lot of break-ins on abandoned properties that we had to secure in that area. There are a few pockets around the square that are... questionable but not easy to define in area.

"Sharpsburg, Senoia, and Newnan are all great.

If you like the country, Senoia is the way to go. If you like more urban areas, Newnan is the choice, but you have to pick the right area.  Sharpsburg is in between those so you get a mix of them. 

Peachtree City is...neat... Homes are expensive and the people who live there turn their noses up at others pretty often.

"Newnan is the county seat of Coweta County. Fayette County is about 20-30 minutes east of Newnan proper. 

Disclaimer time: I am actually a resident of Senoia. (Well mailing address Senoia, I live outside city limits) I am actually a delivery driver for a major delivery company, I have been in almost every town in Coweta/Fayette counties (with a sprinkling of Fulton mixed in)  


For starters, Palmetto, I would avoid. Fulton County, I would avoid. The crime is creeping southward out of Union City and Fairburn into Palmetto. Palmetto proper is serviced by the Fulton County School System. (Same with the City of Chattahoochee Hills) You do NOT want to be serviced by the Fulton County School System. Many people pay for private school to avoid that system. Chattahoochee Hills is trying to succeed from Fulton County and join Coweta County, if so then Chattahoochee Hills will become very desirable. BUT that will take legislative doing and I wouldn't hold your breath. So Chattahoochee Hill/Palmetto, I would count out, if for nothing more than the school systems. (But also the crime creeping in)

Fayetteville, I will split into two parts. North and South (reference to the square/downtown). North Fayetteville I would avoid like Palmetto (worse the further north you go). Crime is creeping in fast and the schools (all a part of the Fayette County School System) in north Fayetteville are starting to get ugly.   South Fayetteville is much better, like much better, but I rank it worse than many parts of Coweta County.  For example: Fayette County High School is a no go. Whitewater High School is in between. Mcintosh High School is a go. Sandy Creek High School is in between. Starr's Mill High School is a go. (I know I used high schools for reference but they cover large areas) The summary of this paragraph: The Fayette County School System can be good. But you must live in the right district, or it can be as bad as Fulton County's above.  


Now back in Coweta County, Senoia is good, Sharpsburg is good, Turin is good even. There are not many places in Coweta County I wouldn't go. (P.S. My no go in Coweta County is Pinson St, West Washington St, MLK Jr Dr, Spring St, Savannah St, Dodson St) And I wouldn't say I wouldn't go totally. In daylight or even early evening, I would go passthrough if I need to (like MLK). But I would not avoid nor seek out those roads. Greison Trail and Shenandoah Blvd are generally in between areas, they have their rougher spots, and they have their good spots.   


One piece of advice I would give: Your wife and you need to decide how countryside you want to live. You can live in relatively urban area (like the subdivision Summergrove) and be a minute or two from most stores or literally be the only house for 1 mile in either direction and be 30 minutes from commercial districts. Both are reasonably attainable in Coweta County. I will restate what someone else said, ""Newnan is mostly Coweta County with a Newnan mailing address""   


In my opinion (which I like the countryside a fair bit), here the cities in this area, most desirable to least desirable if I were home shopping: Senoia, Sharpsburg, Moreland, Turin, Brooks, Haralson, Grantville, Newnan, Peachtree City, Tyrone, (This starts my no go) Chattahoochee Hills, Fayetteville, Palmetto.   Note: Peachtree City scored so low because while home values are high and in general it is a nice place to live, I find it very urban for my taste. And Peachtree City had some poor planning that causes some very nasty traffic at times. (read: GA 54/GA 74 intersection and a couple miles in any direction)  


During your search, 80-90% of Coweta County is good area, and subdivisions are popping up left and right. I live about 4 miles from a subdivision (Senoia address) building and selling new homes right now. I sincerely think you can find a good home in Coweta County if you want to be here!",t2_2yeb62i7,thegloworm17,0,1610931829.0,0,t1_gjo6ir8,gjo6ir8,False,Deathbysnusnu17,t3_kzdiug,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/kzdiug/moving_to_georgia/,Moving to Georgia!,/r/newnan/comments/kzdiug/moving_to_georgia/gjo6ir8/,3,r/newnan,0,3

"It is very safe except for some parts near the square. I don't know what part of Newnan you're moving to, but many people here do love the courtesy that can often be had here, and also the country feel. Many county and city leaders are actively trying to prevent Newnan and Coweta County from turning into the cities of North Atlanta. 

You learn very quickly where to stay out of but I will tell you. I'm not afraid to walk the square downtown at 2 am.

As far as your child goes, I'm a product of the Coweta County School system and have family who work for the school system. Sure it has its problems like every system, but in my opinion, and I believe there are facts to back this up, Coweta County has one of the best school systems in metro Atlanta. I know your child is a bit far from going to school but still good information! 

Traffic in Newnan generally isn't an issue except in a few hot spots, like highway 34 within a couple miles of the interstate at rush hour. And the same for Lower Fayetteville Road. 

I will say a con of living in Newnan/Peachtree City. If you are the type of person who likes to have a Trader Joe's or a Dave & Buster's or something other than a Kroger, Target, and Walmart, be prepared to drive to Atlanta or another part of Atlanta. Costco would be on that list but we just recently got that near Peachtree City.
The point I'm making in this paragraph, we can sometimes be the last metro area to get things that every other metro city in Atlanta has. 

But I will say this, to me, that last paragraph I can live with, because the traffic, with very few exceptions is very manageable. I don't have to complain about sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in most cases in this area. That can't be said for Hampton or McDonough or anything really north of I-20. 

Coweta County has a stellar law enforcement agency, they hold their officers to a high standard, they had the same sheriff for over 20 years until the US Marshalls recruited him. Now his 2nd in command is in charge, running the county almost the same way, a good way. (That's why it's been landslide elections).  I will say the same about the fire departments. As a firefighter myself (not employed by them), I can definitely say they hold their firefighters to a high standard, lots of training, and there are paramedics everywhere. If you need their services, they will be there for you.

 I mentioned the county, because Newnan and Coweta County work very closely together. Sure they have their differences but overall I feel they really are teammates in many aspects.

In summary, as far as dealing with governments go, the governments here are pretty pleasant to deal with. I know I can call my county commissioner (direct) right now and he'll answer and listen to the issues. I enjoy living here and working here. And my job I can work in either Coweta County or Fayette County. Even though Coweta County is usually a harder job, I rather take it daily just because I know my surroundings and I know how Newnan works. 

If you do want to check out a couple of newspapers to see our news stories that's I don't believe is blown out of proportion, check out ""The Newnan Times-Herald"" and/or ""The Citizen"" both are online.

"The last straw for me was a 5am fire alarm malfunction. The fire department couldn't get it to turn off because they didn't have a key for it. It lasted almost 2 hours. Luckily it was April, so it wasn't cold. I still had an upset cat, dog, and lizard though.

When we first moved in (about a month or two? Sometime in Summer 2018) a person across the hall from us actually set their apartment on fire while cooking breakfast. The building alarms did not go off. My husband helped put the fire out with one of the extinguishers from the hallway. The entire unit had to be remodeled, the whole kitchen was a loss. 

Not to mention how high the electric bills are there, since the exterior walls have no insulation and most upstairs units have concrete floors.

"Newnan is largely a commuter city for Atlanta, so it has a fair amount of progressive people. Atlanta is pretty liberal

But its georgia so there is a very large amount of conservatives and super religious folks who may frown on it. Itd be a lie to say that it doesnt have some messed up people, there was a nazi rally there a few years back for example.

 Being in the city of newnan itself you will probably have no issues. But as soon as you start going more rural you may run into more issues. Really like anywhere you live, it kinda depends on where you go. 

I dont think youd have any issues, newnan is a nice city and growing very rapidly. Theres plenty of very progressive areas to visit in your off time, like others have mentioned downtown. Even atlanta.

"I grew up in Newnan/Moreland, left for a few years and came back. It has changed a lot, but is still a really good place to raise a family. 

LGBTQ+ is generally accepted. There are still a few shitheads just like anywhere else, and older folks may give some looks, but are too old south to actually say something. TBH, I am a straight guy, so I don't exactly have a finger on the pulse of the situation and can only comment on what I've seen and experienced. 

The Eastern part of the county has the most new growth and is pretty generic suburban transitioning to rural further out. Senoia has boomed in population but still feels like a small town with some amenities. They have even connected the golf cart paths from Peachtree City. Downtown Newnan is gentrifying to an extent with many of the classic homes being renovated and local businesses thriving on the square.  The Moreland/Grantville area in the southern part of the county is developing as more commercial, IE big new Amazon warehouse, but the residential parts are still quite rural in nature. Western Coweta county hasn't changed too much in the last 10 or so years, it is more removed from the economic centers and is very quiet.

Newnan is in a great location for enjoying the amenities of Atlanta on occasion without living there. For example if you want to go to an Atlanta United match it is only a 40 minute drive.

The Coweta County School System is pretty good as far as public schooling in GA. It's not the top, but it is a lot closer to the top than Atlanta Public Schools. My biggest critique is that the county could use another high school. East Coweta is over 3k students and Newnan HS is busting at the seams with no good place to build additional buildings. The middle schools are not nearly as crowded, because they have opened more.

There are options for private schools if that is your preference. Heritage is the older more established school and Trinity Christian is newer and larger. Both provide good educations as far as I know.

Faith wise, Newnan is majority Christian and church is pretty important to a lot of people. Most of the big churches are Non-denominational and very accepting. There are also at least some of every flavor Christian church to go to from Catholic to Mormon. I don't know of any churches in the area that are Westboro Baptist style. There are also many people where church does not play a major role in there lives.  If you are looking for a sizable Jewish or Muslim community, I don't know of one nearby.

Edit: If you move anywhere in GA, it may be a good idea to teach your child at least a little about gun safety. Hunting is a big pastime and it is not unusual for a middle school age kid to own a rifle for hunting. I'm not saying that everyone has a gun, but GA just doesn't have restrictions like New Jersey. Basically just making sure your child knows never to point one at someone and don't let someone point one at them rather than taking it for granted that your child just innately knows that sort of thing is huge.",t2_9to58,SaggingZebra,0,1589215856.0,0,t1_fqaase2,fqaase2,True,koolaid0916,t3_gh83s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/gh83s6/making_the_move/,"Making the ""Move""",/r/newnan/comments/gh83s6/making_the_move/fqaase2/,5,r/newnan,0,5

"So this is old and I can't help with vegan stuff, maybe the vegetable plate at Golden's. Outdoor stuff though here is my 2 cents. Starting with kayaking the 'hootch. The nearest put in is Whitesburg. Which is usually dead except for Memorial day weekend and sometimes the Fourth. IMHO McIntosh is the best take out. Probably 1 1/2 hour plus stops trip. The more droughtish it is the longer it takes, but there are more places to stop and check out. From  Whitesburg to Bend is all flat water and cow pastures where you can't see over the banks and there are no good spots to get out and explore. Down to Franklin with the amount of rain we have had would be relatively fast. We did it once in these conditions and were shocked at how quick it went. We decided to do it again in the same season after little rain. OMG it took all day but was still fun with places to stop and look around. we have ran into a couple of meetup groups over the years. Check out [http://www.georgiatrailoutfitters.com/](http://www.georgiatrailoutfitters.com/) for rentals. 

The Flint River Outdoor Center also offers rentals and shuttles on the Flint obviously. They have several different put in options and trip lengths. Including an overnighter with camping at Goat Mtn. The best thing about them is you get out where you park, so no waiting for the shuttle like on the Broad near Athens. 

Cedar Creek also does shuttles and rentals about 1 1/2 hours from Newnan. We bought our kayaks from them and they delivered them to Newnan.  We haven't tried them but Lazy River Rentals on the Tallapoosa is about an hour away.

Pine Mountain is about 1 1/2 hours south and has a lot of hiking options. One 20 mile, I think maybe?, trail and some different loops. Callaway Gardens is nearby and worth checking out at least once. They have a butterfly house/exhibit which is pretty cool. Another 1/2 hour south is Providence Canyon state park. Which is one of Georgias most visited state parks but if you can swing a week day isn't too busy. But you might want to call ahead to see if any large groups like elementary field trips are happening. 

About an 1 1/2 hours west is Cheaha State Park in Alabama. They have cabin rentals which we intend to do at some point. They also have a hotel which is not worth the price. The hiking is good though with good views. Not really mountains but elevated. 

Other closeish parks include Line Creek between Newnan and Peachtree City. It can get busy on weekends. Cochran Mill in Fulton co. usually kind of dead but we haven't been in awhile. Sweetwater State Park in Douglass co., busy everytime we went. Sprewell Bluff State park which is one of the Flint river put ins and is run by Georgia Power I think. Whoever it is does not accept the Georgia Parks annual pass and it is busy on the weekends. Moore's Bridge Park in Carroll co on the 'hootch is still under development. But you can park at the gate and walk in to have a look around. 

And the last thing I can think of offhand is not really outdoorsy but Asheville is about 3 or so hours away. Awesome weekend trip lots of breweries and outdoors stuff nearby like Pisgah.

"Meat and Great has a vegan black bean burger and a vegan hotdog, which is also amazing as a corn dog. This is not healthy, but no one eats corn dogs for their health. Garlic has a fabulous menu, I recommend green curry tofu, the corn fritters, and especially the coconut soup.  Pita at Ashley Park (or Thomas Crossroads) has an awesome falafel, but their rice is made with chicken broth so I usually opt for fries or rilles veggies. If you like supper lemony quinoa tabouli they got you covered, but they live their olive oil there. Dynasty is your huckleberry for Chinese delivery.  Scezchuan Tofu is delicious. Red ribbon has a veggie burger, as does taco Mac, but neither is exceptional. No one has impossible burgers or even beyond burgers. Of course you have chipotle and Taco Bell and Burger King for your bullshit fast food options.   Aarden’s Garden (juice bar) is located in Temple Avenue. Peach tree city really isn’t any better, but there are a few more mid to high price options.   I haven’t been to Salad Express but their menu looks promising.

Edit: my wife says she’s pretty sure the corn dog batter is not vegan, but sometimes we just don’t ask questions and hope for the best on bread stuff. Anyway, Tomo Japanese has lots of veggie sushi options and hibachi veggies as well.

"Welcome to Newnan!!  I love my little town.  While there are no vegan restaurants that I am aware of, Garlic (Thai) on the square has some vegetarian options, but I'm not sure about actual vegan dishes.

Like u/Velocitysnare said, Chattahoochee Bend State Park has some nice trails and some great camping.  There are also kayaking opportunities.  My son and I put in our canoe at Hwy 16 near Whitesburg and paddled the 22 mile run to Franklin a few years ago.  Lots of fun!!!  Also, on the other side of the river, in Carroll County, you will find McIntosh Reserve Park, which is also really nice.  When spring arrives, they will have market day on the square on the first Saturday of each month, which is fun.  You need to check out the shops on and just off of the square.  I can almost guarantee you will find what you're looking for as far as hiking, biking, and some really cool art.  Check out Leaf and Bean, and if it's to your liking, check out Ace Beer Growlers and Abide Brewery.

I hope you get settled in and love this little town as much as I do.

As for hiking there’s a park downtown that’s perfect for walks, there’s chattahoochee state park (I think that’s the name) it’s a little bit of a drive but it runs along the river and is a nice walk on a warm day.

"I live about 3 blocks from the square in Newnan and love it.  RPM is super nice during the summer months for some patio sitting.  There's usually live music on the weekends either there, the Cellar, the Alamo.  The square seems to be getting in more niche places (a popsicle shop, raw bar, etc) as well these days, so prospects are looking up.  Pretty good local food, good people for the most part (even if you don't agree with their politics, they're good folk).  

My sister and her bf ended up moving down here from NY after visiting and loving it, and they live in the Lofts (not as hip as it once was, but still not too bad).  The further you get out from the square, the rougher it gets (but still not terrible).  Greison is not bad, but Newnan isn't quite yet walkable (there is a trail in the process of being built from the more suburby part of town all the way to the square, but that doesn't look to be done until next year at the earliest).  If you're looking for more suburban, anywhere over in the Summergrove area is a good bet for that.

I work in Smyrna, and my commute is about 45 min in the morning and around an hour in the evening.  Any time you cross I-20 though, it's going to be slow.  So going to midtown might be a headache.  Your commute shouldn't be terrible though, with the only real sticky part being from 285 to the Fairburn exit in the evenings.

"Welcome! I'm a realtor and I would say about a quarter of the people who I help with rentals are looking at Newnan just to commute to the airport. Newnan and Peachtree City are a couple popular areas but there's not a ton for rent in PTC and the real estate is  more expensive.  Another area you might want to look at is Tyrone or Palmetto.  Palmetto is on hwy 29 that goes directly to the airport and Tyrone is very convenient to hwy 85.  

You could go closer to the airport but you're looking at Fairburn, union city or you're looking at places immediately surrounding the airport. If you want the nice downtown area as well access to shopping and restaurants, I don't think you'll find anything as good as Newnan on the Southside.  It's grown a lot and is continuing to grow.

The new Interstate 85 interchange at Poplar Road is set to open today, according to the Georgia Department of Transportation.

Exit 44 should be open by 10 a.m. if not before, said Penny Brooks, regional spokeswoman for GDOT.

On Tuesday, crews were out working on some of the final steps to getting the interchange open. Workers were painting stripes on the pavement, pressure-washing pavement, working on traffic lights, and posting signs at the ramps on the interstate Tuesday morning.

The project has been more than 20 years in the making, and a ceremonial groundbreaking was held in May 2016. The original completion date was at the end of February.

Though the new interchange is set to open today, there will still need to be some finishing touches, such as landscaping, over the next few weeks to months.""",t2_1q6do3l,waffle-fil-a,0,1553090610.0,0,t1_eiyhovq,eiyhovq,True,waffle-fil-a,t3_b3ce43,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/b3ce43/i85_poplar_road_exit_to_open_today_32019/,"I-85 / Poplar Road Exit to Open Today, 3/20/19",/r/newnan/comments/b3ce43/i85_poplar_road_exit_to_open_today_32019/eiyhovq/,2,r/newnan,0,2

"""Could expanding residential sewer options in Coweta County cut down on annexations and help preserve rural character?

It’s an idea Coweta County Commissioner Bob Blackburn proposed at a recent Coweta County Board of Commissioners meeting.

Currently, Coweta ordinances don’t allow for sewer service in single-family, residential districts. Certain higher-density subdivisions can be built with decentralized sewer systems, and sewer is allowed for senior housing developments.

Public sewer would also have been allowed in developments zoned RI-B, but that zoning district was done away with a few years ago. The RI-B zoning district was proposed for areas just outside the city of Newnan.

Blackburn brought the idea up when the commissioners were discussing an annexation of property along U.S. 29 and Old Atlanta Highway. The proposal is for a 40-unit subdivision on the 30-acre property.

“There is no way we can control the growth in this county,” Blackburn said. “Coweta has so many attributes that make it attractive.”

He proposed that the county draw a circle around the city of Newnan and “allow sewer on any land that touches it.""

“That is basically what they are after on these annexations – sewer,” Blackburn said.

County Administrator Michael Fouts said that, based on feedback from a meeting in October, the commissioners had discussed something similar. Fouts said he and members of the community development department would be meeting with a consultant to work on “what we’re calling the land guidance system.”

An update on that meeting will likely be presented at the next commission meeting, Fouts said.

The commissioners will meet March 26 at 6 p.m.

“I think it would help further preserve the rural identity of the county to use density as a tool against itself – to let density occur in the city,” Blackburn said.

“I’m not saying that this is the magic wand. I’m saying we’ve got to have a starting point,” Blackburn said.

The circle would need to be drawn by an independent, disinterested third party, he said.

Blackburn said he thinks that would stop annexations. With sewer already available, there wouldn’t be much incentive to being annexed.

“Why would you want to be double taxed? … If they stayed in the county, it’s just one county tax bill,” he said.

“It’s worth a try,” Blackburn said. “Maybe it isn’t the exact answer, but at least we’re doing something, not twiddling our thumbs and watching the county being devoured by everybody and his brother.""

“Cities are dense, let them get denser,” he said. The plan could “encapsulate the city.""

Blackburn and his family own a good bit of land in Coweta, and he was asked how he would respond to those who might say he was proposing this idea to help sell his own land.

“We aren’t developers,” Blackburn said. “I’d never do a home development, but I can’t tell somebody who bought our land what to do with it, what not to do with it,” he said. “I might not like what they do. At some point some people do need to sell their land.""

"""A local building owner and resident is looking for answers after the designs for a proposed event space were deemed “too modern” for downtown Newnan.

Amy Johnson purchased the building at 12 Jefferson St. last year in the hopes of turning the building into an event space for dinners, parties and receptions.

Johnson said her vision for “Twelve” was based on several ideas, including Panther Creek – a community center in Sargent, which also hosts a variety of events.

The space would also allow local restaurants the ability to host events that might otherwise force them to close their doors to the general public, such as a wedding party or any other event which would take up the majority of space.

“It’s a flexible space for anything,” Johnson said.

Through her work with Danny Martin, an Atlanta-based architect, Johnson said she spent time examining other buildings in Newnan to ensure her design was consistent.

“Twelve” included features such as a rooftop deck, which was approved in the past for the Greenville Townhouses, currently under construction.

However, the Newnan Planning Commission felt the renderings for were too modern and needed some modifications to help them blend better with the historic character of downtown, according to Planning and Zoning Director Tracey Dunnavant.

According to documents submitted to the commission, staff reviewed the certificate of appropriateness request and found it to be consistent with the standards renovations to structures in the Downtown Development Overlay District.

In documents prepared by Newnan City Planner Dean Smith, it was determined the proposed renovations would allow the historic building to be used as an event forum while still preserving the historic charm of downtown Newnan.

Despite the recommendation made by staff, commissioners expressed concerns about the design and tabled the issue until the next meeting to allow Johnson to make changes to her proposed elevations.

Johnson said she’s not happy about the decision to table the future of “Twelve” until the next meeting and as a result of their decision, has already put the space back on the market as a way of hedging her bets on the future.

“I’m not an investor, so I can’t sit on a property that isn’t being utilized,” she said. “It either needs to be what it is, or I need to sell it.”

Johnson is also a resident of Newnan, living in one of the two newly constructed townhomes on Perry Street only a block away from “Twelve.”

Following the decision of the Planning and Zoning Board, Johnson said she’s determining what her next step will be.

“Honestly, I was shocked and disappointed in the decision, especially after working with the city for an extended period of time to create a design that was consistent with several other buildings in the area,” Johnson said.""",t2_1q6do3l,waffle-fil-a,0,1552821802.0,0,t1_eiq2xob,eiq2xob,True,waffle-fil-a,t3_b2486o,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/b2486o/proposed_downtown_event_center_deemed_too_modern/,Proposed downtown event center deemed ‘too modern’,/r/newnan/comments/b2486o/proposed_downtown_event_center_deemed_too_modern/eiq2xob/,6,r/newnan,0,6

"Competition is a natural, healthy product of the free market. Stores locate next to each other to poach customers from one another, and also because at least one of the stores have already conducted the costly market research in an area to determine if their store will be profitable in that location.

That being said, retailers/restaurants are also careful enough to determine if the population density in an area is sufficient enough before getting into these competition wars, as they also don't want to poach enough customers to the point that neither them nor their competition can make a profit.

You mention the Costco going in across from Sam's Club. There's a reason you rarely hear about a failed Costco store, and that's because they're very careful in their site selection. If they thought the location in Fischer Crossing would fail, they wouldn't be investing do much money in it. In addition to that Sam's Club being one of the highest grossing stores in the country, they know much of their higher income customer base will be from PTC. The only reason they settled on Coweta County is because PTC gave them a ton of NIMBY pushback to build within their borders. 

It also benefits consumers. While the duplication of certain types of stores seems excessive, having multiple choice for products in Newnan does help to keep the prices we pay for goods down locally. Can you imagine how much more expensive or harder to find things would be if we just had one grocery store, one hardware, one sports store, etc.?

I do agree about things like hundreds of Wendy's. Just to have my own rant, since I moved here back in late 2017, 4 *freaking* Mexican restaurants have opened in Newnan (not including the 2nd Taco Bell), yet we can't even support a Checker's, nor get a place like Jason's Deli or Cookout. But obviously, people in Newnan have a clear preference Wendy's and Mexican food and they're merely responding to market demand, as I have yet to see any of these places close or not crowded. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",t2_1q6do3l,waffle-fil-a,0,1550288529.0,0,t1_egkt4b6,egkt4b6,False,waffle-fil-a,t3_aq55ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/aq55ry/new_storesrestaurants_in_newnan/,New Stores/Restaurants in Newnan,/r/newnan/comments/aq55ry/new_storesrestaurants_in_newnan/egkt4b6/,2,r/newnan,0,2

"""City staff and supporters filled the path near “Cleatus Creek” to officially declare the path open to the public.

The 1.9-mile connection links Newnan Crossing Boulevard to the Nixon Centre, Newnan Crossing Elementary School, and the residential neighborhoods along Highwoods Parkway and Shenandoah Boulevard.

The ribbon cutting event provided an opportunity for elected officials, as well as city and county staff, to get a “sneak peek” of the LINC, meet with Friends of LINC Board members, and ask any questions they may have about construction, funding, or future plans.

Mayor Keith Brady heralded the LINC project as a tremendous grassroots effort between the city and the public.

“It truly came from the community, and this was one of those ideas that will live on,” Brady said. “Friends of LINC is a huge reason why we’re here today.”

Jim Thomasson, vice president for Friends of LINC and one of the original creators of the linear park, said the project is a great example of the community working together to implement a quality of life initiative that will carry on for generations to come.

“It’s a reminder of when hard work intersects with a great idea, great things can happen,” Thomasson said. “This ribbon cutting is the proof of the power of a public-private partnership.”

Jonathan McCaig of the PATH Foundation noted the responsiveness of Newnan staff and the very compressed construction timeframe.

Kim Learnard, Director of Friends of LINC, said she enjoyed meeting all the people who came together to envision and create this very impressive linear park.

“It is the LINC that will bridge the physical divides of railroad tracks and interstates throughout our community, promote health and wellness, and spur future economic development,” Learnard said.

"""Bills have been introduced to do away with Georgia’s controversial “Certificate of Need” process for medical facilities.

State Sen. Matt Brass, R-Newnan, is the sponsor of the Senate version, Senate Bill 74. Both a Senate and House version were introduced on Thursday. The bills are nearly the same, except the House version includes changes to the rural hospital tax credit, Brass said.

The bill replaces the CON process for hospitals with a licensure process that allows facilities within a 10-mile radius to object to new facilities. Behavioral health facilities and inpatient drug treatment centers will be exempt from that process, said Brass. So will all facilities in the state’s Health Planning Area Three, a 13-county region in metro-Atlanta.

Coweta County is not in Area Three.

The CON process will remain mostly unchanged for long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities under the bill.

The bill also removes restrictions on Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Currently, the CON for CTCA requires that 65 percent of its patients be from outside of Georgia. If the hospital doesn’t meet that goal in any given year, it is fined $2 million. The fine increases if the hospital doesn’t meet the requirement in consecutive years.

Though hospitals would no longer have to deal with the CON process under the Senate bill, they would have to meet new requirements as part of the licensure process. Those requirements apply to hospitals within Area Three as well.  

“No matter where they are going – number 1, they’re all going to have to take Medicaid, whether they are for-profit or nonprofit,” Brass said.

Hospitals will also have to provide a certain amount of “indigent care,” for patients who cannot afford to pay.

Nonprofit hospitals will have to provide a percentage of indigent care equal to the rolling two-year average of all hospitals in the state, Brass said. For-profit hospitals will get to subtract 3 percentage points from the average for their indigent care quota. “That is essentially giving them credit for paying taxes,” Brass said.

If any hospital can’t meet those indigent care quotas, they will be required to pay penalties, which will go into the state Indigent Care Trust Fund. Trust fund money goes to rural hospitals and to Medicaid, Brass said.

Brass said he trust fund already exists, and the change is going to help build up that fund to help rural Georgia and help our Medicaid population.

The indigent care requirements are intended to help distribute indigent care among all the hospitals in Georgia, not just in isolated areas. In some rural areas of Georgia, hospitals are providing high percentages of uncompensated care.

The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Bill Watson, R-Savannah, a physician and new chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, which will consider the bill.""",t2_1q6do3l,waffle-fil-a,0,1549803195.0,0,t1_eg5i27q,eg5i27q,True,waffle-fil-a,t3_ap3lvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/ap3lvx/con_repeal_bill_introduced/,CON repeal bill introduced,/r/newnan/comments/ap3lvx/con_repeal_bill_introduced/eg5i27q/,1,r/newnan,0,1

It also has the huge assets of being in the least traffic congested atery in Metro Atlanta (I-85), proxmity to the world's busiest airport, being one of the top 10 safest communities in GA and Coweta County schools that are well above the state average (all things that would normally signal explosive growth and prosperity for Newnan).

&#x200B;

Yet, it's so far from all of the high paying jobs/action in Atlanta in terms of distance that people relocating to the region and developers who would bring more destination retailers, mixed use communities, food halls, etc. completely pass it over.

&#x200B;

Part of the issue is leaders/residents aren't really sure what type of future they want for Newnan. Some (natives) are still fighting to maintain its small town ways and pastoral feel, while transplants want to awaken the sleeping giant Newnan it is, a bona fide Satellite City to Atlanta.

&#x200B;

It hurts that Coweta County/Newnan didn't do more to attract investments like Great Wolf Lodge, Kia Motors, Facebook Data Center or Porsche, which would have made the city more of a destination and also helped it to become established as a high-paying job center. I know they're trying to sow the seeds for Newnan to become a health care ""mecca,"" but as long as Georgia's CON law remains in effect, the potential there will be limited. It would also be nice if leaders did more to attract back office development. With the country as a whole transitioning to more of a white collar economy, cities with a huge concentration of these types of jobs will be most desirable for people whonare looking for places to live.

&#x200B;

A fear I have is that Newnan will just neander at a slow and steady pace into simply being a run of the mill but aging bedroom community, which while there's nothing wrong with that, that will mean missing out on a lot of the amenities you find in many of the communities north of Atlanta and also never really receiving the prestige from outsiders it deserves.

As far as the film industry specifically, the move by the mayor/city council was ridiculously shortsighted. Even if it's temporary, you've already signaled to projects that you will be difficult to work with and they will be less likely to consider Newnan again in the future.",t2_1q6do3l,waffle-fil-a,0,1548736479.0,0,t1_ef8h0jd,ef8h0jd,True,[deleted],t3_akucux,https://www.reddit.com/r/newnan/comments/akucux/filming_in_newnan_on_hold_my_initial_thoughts/,Filming in Newnan on Hold.
