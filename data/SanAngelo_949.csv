And I've been on meds for a year at this point. Why get pushy about counseling now? I don't have the time and money to spend on counseling sessions that will consist of ""Yep, things are going well.

 >The Hum is a name often given to widespread reports of a persistent and invasive low-frequency humming, rumbling, or droning noise not audible to all people. Hums have been reported all over the world; in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and Madagascar, and are sometimes named according to the locality where the problem has been particularly publicized, such as the ""Taos Hum"" in New Mexico and the ""Windsor Hum"" in Ontario. The Hum does not appear to be a single phenomenon.

"Oh yeah, that's a valid complaint. I will say, there is a reason for it (whether or not you consider it a good reason is up to you, of course); when I was working there, only three people worked there, and sometimes one would do delivery.

 Pretty much your call happened at an unlucky moment (not uncommon) when about 5 pizzas were moments away from jamming up against each other in the oven, so they had to rush you on hold to not ruin everyone's food. Unfortunate, but a reality of small businesses when they get busy. He did hire more people after, though. There's a really narrow balance of ""I can't pay this many people when it's slow,"" and ""I need more when it's busy.""

Lee Middle School to something that doesn’t celebrate a traitorous Confederate general, the constant rebuking of building an interstate, the blatant disparity in the infrastructure between the rich parts of town and the “numbered streets”.

"[http://www.powertochoose.org/](http://www.powertochoose.org/) 

Many electric companies raised their rates due make up costs from the February storm.  ERCOT(the State of Texas) kept the wholesale price at maximum for days after supply and demand should have started bringing the price down.

The government refused to adjust this mistake, leaving the overcharged money in the hands of the generators.

Who pays for it?  Chariot, along with all the others, passed the cost on to the consumer.  Variable rate consumers got hit the hardest.

"Internet is Suddenlink only unless you live in the magical 2 mile radius that Frontier fiber covers (it's supposed to increase at some point). That being said my gigabit service is fine as long as you don't have to contact Suddenlink. AT&T had a fiber rollout planned here but last I heard it was delayed due to COVID. 

Home prices are getting bad here quickly only because people are coming here and paying 5 figure cash deals over asking price, just saw a house down the road that appraises for 368k and they're asking over 500k for it. I'm not sure they're going to get that, but the fact that they can ask for such is a testament to what prices are doing. That being said, you can still get lucky if you find the right combo of land and homebuilder or find a premarket listing.

I have a friend who's currently getting a build done by Spider Homes. I've been inside a cookie cutter home they built and it was nice enough for sure, but his build is the first custom I've seen from them. It's just in the framing phase so I don't have an opinion yet. They've been great to work with so far according to him. Areas to build... Might want to look into if there's anything available in the PaulAnn area, also there's a lot of construction and clearing going on all around the Southland area of town. I believe most of those are done by Shawn Box and his construction/realty crew.

Utils, gas, and grocery prices are all very reasonable IMO. If you're ready to get out of the mess of the city, it's a great place to be.

"San Angelo is corrupt. All the gov/devils that “control”  the sh!ty of San Angelo. Is the problem. I do have a solution to your water problem. For starters... the brilliant council you speak of, well they spent 40 million plus on water wells over by Brady,Tx. Every single drop is contaminated with radiation. Hence the BILLION DOLLAR water treatment facility(that still doesn’t filter anything but our bank accounts) was supposedly gonna get the radiation out. So it was never intended for US as a city. For good water. They stole “the city’s money”! So we get screwed twice. Heres my solution to ease your pain of the water problem. Nevertheless water is indeed important. But, why doesn’t anyone focus on some real issues.... like the corrupt cps caseworkers, corrupt judges, corrupt LAW DOGS as a whole, the corrupt lawyers, and most importantly the good ole OAG. They all work for the biggest Texas crook of all. The governor.he’s the biggest OAG lawyer in Texas. Feel free to look it up. They are all work together. Not for us mind you. So the next time you find yourself baffled by the straight up shaft we the people get. Maybe you can invest some investigation time as to why the cps are stealing our children. With the help of the lawyers. Whom just so happens to be agents of the courthouse. So they work for the judge. Most people don’t pay attention to this fact  federal gov gives cps millions upon millions a year. FOR BONUSES AND INCENTIVES. Please look that up. But they have no power without the lawyers and judge’s. And who operates the them? That’s right OAG. It a big club and we ain’t in it. They don’t give a chit about us.

"First, some context: My spouse cannot get the vaccine due to health conditions which also place him at high risk of complications from covid. I've already gotten both doses of the vaccine. I am, in fact, very concerned that he will catch covid and die from complications. And I am deeply offended that you think the people who have died and will continue die from this virus are acceptable collateral for you to be able to pretend things are normal and fine. 

I don't know how much clearer I can make this, given that you seem to have pointedly ignored all the scientific explanations widely shared over the past year, but 1) a pandemic is a public health issue and 2) your actions affect others. There are mutant variants circulating that are both more contagious and more deadly. Only 6% of the Texas population was vaccinated when Abbott decided to rescind the mask mandate. Not only that, but you're flat wrong - the recovery rate is not 99%, and even people who recover are still experiencing long term health issues. Wearing a mask is one of the simplest, least imposing things someone can ask you to do to protect others, and you aren't even willing to support a requirement that everyone put in the most minimum of efforts? To care about how your actions affect those around you? I guess I'm not surprised. 

There is literally no scientifically backed reason to lift the mask mandate. None. I don't agree with opening things back up to 100% capacity, period, but opening things back up to 100% capacity AND removing the mask mandate is beyond irresponsible. You want things opened up to 100%? I guess we can disagree on that. But things can open back up without removing a mask mandate. A mask mandate doesn't impede normal business operations. Wearing masks is the bottom of the barrel, minimum effort we can all do to protect people in our communities.

Winterizing all pipes in San Angelo, maybe not the best idea as far as cost vs effectiveness. 

As far as ERCOT, I think they were generally aware that a storm could do this; they just didn’t want to pay for the winter-weather regulation compliance mechanisms.

Why? 

Keep in mind that the water utilities's current theory is a backflow protection failure. If there's a company that deals with fracking chemicals within that fracking-heavy industrial area currently colored red on the city's [water map](https://i.imgur.com/cs6vVIC.png), where they mix the chemicals with water, and they had a backflow issue, the chemicals would flow from that company in to the main water pipes.

There's at least one name of a company that shows up on Google Maps in that area that, when Googled, does deal with fracking chemicals applied to fracsand. Whether they do it in San Angelo or not, I don't know.

> Social Security is not a socialist handout, we pay into it our entire working lives.

Except, no. 

Some people never see a dime from what they pay in. 

*Many* people actually get **more** out of Social Security than what they paid in. 

> [According to the institute’s data, a two-earner couple receiving an average wage — $44,600 per spouse in 2012 dollars — and turning 65 in 2010 would have paid $722,000 into Social Security and Medicare and can be expected to take out $966,000 in benefits. So, this couple **will be paid about one-third more** in benefits than they paid in taxes.](https://www.politifact.com/article/2013/feb/01/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-paid-what-yo/)

If your measure of whether or not something is *not* socialist is just whether or not someone has paid a little in to it, even if they get way more back after the fact, then *literally everything the government does* can never be socialist. Including free college, free healthcare, etc. All of it is non-socialist, because we all pay taxes, and thus we all pay in to the money that helps pay for things like college, and healthcare. And thus they're 'not socialist' just like Social Security 'isn't socialist'. 

So, again, Social Security is a socialist handout OR nothing funded by taxpayer dollars can ever be socialist. Pick an opinion and stick to it, because they both can't be true at the same time.

Anyhow, you still haven't explained why the *Federal government* should be responsible for *Texas's* fuckup.

> Now on to ERCOT

> ""The Public Utility Commission...

You start with a "", but never end. I applaud your attempt at quoting from another source, but it makes it very hard to tell what's your words, and what's not. Consider using a "" to end the quote, or using a > at the start of a line to indicate something is a quote. Either way, provide a link to your source in the future, so we can know *where* the words are coming from.

Why?

Well, because it looks very much like you copy/pasted some text from somewhere...

**and then edited it to lie**.

Because the closest example [source](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Can-state-s-grid-manager-be-held-accountable-14432168.php) I can find doesn't *quite* say what you've ""quoted"". 

Ignoring the first three (*completely useless*) paragraphs, which don't address the topic at hand at all, you quote in the fourth:

> ERCOT also overestimated the amount of power likely to be generated from wind and solar projects.

when in reality the original source says

> ERCOT also overestimated the amount of power likely to be generated from wind and solar projects **over the next three years**, according to NRG.

Better still, the quote is from *2019*.

Overestimating future **construction projects** has nothing to do with what happened a few days ago. And thus it looks very much like you're editing someone's words to try and win an argument, and failing miserably.

And quoting an article from 2019 *sure as fucking shit* has not a damn thing to do with the reality of what happened. Unless the authors were time travelers, and it's on you to prove that they were. 

> We seem to keep repeating a pattern here which is they don’t know how to forecast. 

So close to the truth, and yet so far. Yes, they fucked up their forecasts... for *demand*. They expected 67GW in an absolute worst-case scenario, and hit 69GW of demand. They also fucked up their forecasts for the availability of *natural gas*, because they anticipated a worst-case scenario where they lost a little under 10GW of coal/gas/nuclear power, when the reality is they lost around 30GW from thermal sources such as gas, coal, and nuclear. Three times as much. 

Texas is a state that runs on fossil fuels. You know how big oil and gas are here, right? You're aware of that much? 

If a state that is so centered around gas can be knocked offline by a couple of windmills freezing up (hint: it wasn't), then something is even more fucky than any of us can dream of.

The *reality* is that wind and solar produced *more than expected* for the storm in question, while natural gas plants went offline unexpectedly. This is established fact, confirmed by everyone from Governor Abbott on down to the workers in the power plants themselves. 

You're the only one here claiming this is somehow the fault of green energy. 

And I see downthread that you've claimed a source in... ""Source Texas Public Policy Foundation dated 2.17.21"". No link. Just... that. Whatever the hell that is. 

I can't find anything from ""Texas Public Policy Foundation"" that seems to be the source you're claiming exists. So you're either inventing a lie and hoping we won't double check, or you're failing to comprehend what you're reading. For example, from your supposed source (though I don't know if it's the same page):

> [Take out another 1,600-1,900 MW from lower wind production **than in the baseline**, and reserves are below 2,000 MW. That’s where Texas was Sunday night.](https://www.texaspolicy.com/ercots-assessment-of-resource-adequacy-shows-blackout-almost-inevitable/)

What's ""the baseline""? The word ""baseline"" doesn't appear anywhere in the document/forecast from ERCOT they're citing, so we have no idea what ""baseline"" they're talking about. Is it the baseline for yearly output? Baseline for winter time output? It sure as shit wasn't the expected output for the storm in question, since a special circumstance is never a baseline. So that sentence does not mean what you're claiming it means. 

So if they're comparing it to yearly average output... duh? ERCOT should already have known output was going to be lower in an ice storm, *particularly* since they were warned about winterization a decade ago. If they didn't, they're *morons*. And losing less than 2GW of output from wind when we were missing 36GW of output overall clearly shows *this was not a problem with wind*, and having those extra 2GW of wind power (again, above the """"baseline"""", whatever that is, because it's not above what they predicted for the storm) wasn't going to do much of anything without 34GW of power from... *somewhere else*. 

And considering the most wind has *ever* output in Texas is around [19.7GW](https://www.texaselectricityratings.com/blog/ercot-sets-new-winter-wind-power-record/), during ideal conditions, if you're expecting wind to somehow magically produce 1.5x more than it has ever produced before, you have unrealistic expectations.

If the page you're talking about is [this one](https://www.texaspolicy.com/the-texas-power-outage-started-with-bad-policy/), then it's obvious you're not understanding what's being said and are letting 'fake news' fool you. Take, for example, their whine about wind only outputting a fraction of the 32GW installed.

Well, we've already established that the most Texas has ever produced in wind is 19.7GW. In perfectly ideal conditions. So whining that the 32GW installed isn't outputting at a full 32GW is someone being intentionally misleading, because no one in their right mind should ever expect *miracles* to save them. Wind energy will never be outputting 100% power at 100% efficiency. That's a downside of wind, and something green energy advocates have been warning people about for ages. Just like how coal's downside is cancer, lung disease, and climate disasters like the storm. Every power option has downsides. For wind, the solution is either batteries, or building more windmills. If you have 30GW and reliably output 10GW, then you can probably expect double the output if you build double the windmills. Simple solution. (It's not that simple, but the idea is the important thing.)

Now on to ERCOT

“The Public Utility Commission sets the rules for the state’s deregulated electricity markets, delegating the day-to-day management of the power grid to ERCOT. The commission operates from two floors of crammed cubicles in the William B. Travis State Office Building, a dilapidated structure close to the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. DeAnn Walker, the commission chairman, earns $189,500 a year.

ERCOT is headquartered in Taylor, a 30-mile drive from downtown Austin. Its sprawling, modern glass and metal building has plush interiors with on-site fitness facilities that include a gym and sport court for volleyball, basketball and pickleball games. ERCOT chief executive Bill Magness earned nearly $814,909.

ERCOT, which receives no government funding, reported nearly $232 million in revenues in 2018, mostly from the fees generators, traders and retail electricity companies pay when buying and selling power on the wholesale market. ERCOT is run by a board dominated by power industry representatives. The Public Utility Commission chairman has a seat on the board, but no voting power.

ERCOT also overestimated the amount of power likely to be generated from wind and solar projects. The importance of accurately forecasting reserve margins came into sharp focus in August 2019 when wholesale electricity prices soared to the maximum price allowed in Texas, $9,000 per megawatt hour — compared to an average of $36 — and stayed that way for several hours, requiring ERCOT to call for conservation measures to avoid rolling power outages. 

We seem to keep repeating a pattern here which is they don’t know how to forecast.

"Electricity generation is complex. For starters, electricity goes 'back and forth' (sorta) on the wire 60 times a second. (This makes it far, far easier to send long distance. It's known as AC, or alternating current.)

What this means is that *all the generators* that are running on the same grid have to 'push' and then 'pull' in sync. If one pushes when a bunch of other generators are finishing up a push and starting to 'pull', shit breaks. I think fire, lightning, and explosions might be involved. 

And if generators slow down to 59hz rather than 60hz, they get out of sync pretty damn fast. Less than half a minute, fast. 

Anyone wanting to provide power in Texas either has to hook up to the existing grid *or*... lay out their own power lines everywhere. Assuming they're even *allowed* to do so by the Texas government, which I doubt they would be, since they're the ones who have said ERCOT has control over all power generation in the area. 

And if they hook up to the existing grid, they have to sync up with everyone else. Which means cooperation, and working with ERCOT. 

And power *transmission* is costly, and hard. It's much easier/cheaper to generate close to where the power will be used, which is why we have so many power plants within Texas. Most states have power plants, I believe, and that power *generally* goes to local needs (though definitely helps out at longer distances when they can, as long as they're part of the east or west grids that Texas chose not to join). 

So... trying to pull power from outside of Texas would mean intentionally going out of your way to set up power at a long distance, hook up to ERCOT's system, send power in to the state, all while still playing by ERCOT's rules.

So no. Not really.

There are Texas-based power companies that go out of their way to try and provide as much power from local renewables as they can. 

You can even search for them and go with one that tries to do 100% green energy only. [Here's](https://comparepower.com/) one way to search.

"> Since the government is so quick to fund other countries

First, I'm not really sure what the two have to do with each other?

Second... Texas doesn't fund other countries in any substantial way that I'm aware of, but I'm willing to hear otherwise.

If you're discussing the *Federal* government, first... uh... socialist welfare much? Like, don't get me wrong, I'm all for other states chipping in to help other states out when they need to, but it's not often I hear a Texan (I'm assuming you're Texan, but it's hard to tell) advocating for Democratic ideas.

Third, the Federal government spent [$39 billion](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/what-every-american-should-know-about-us-foreign-aid/) out of [$4,448 billion](https://www.thebalance.com/fy-2019-federal-budget-summary-of-revenue-and-spending-4589082) in 2019 on foreign aid.

Or ~0.88% of spending. Or, in other words, less than a penny out of a dollar. $0.88 out of $100.00. For things like making sure malaria doesn't become a global threat. Y'know, like SARS (COVID) currently is. Foreign aid spending *helps America*. And quite a lot, for what little we spend on it. 

And that *tiny infinitesimal amount of spending* just highlights exactly how little I see a connection between foreign aid spending and Texas's current self-made disaster. What do the two have to do with each other? (And if you're implying that 0.88% of spending is *too much* spending for things like preventing malaria from becoming a *threat to America*, wow.)

> the natural disaster emergency fund of some kind

Biden already did. [Four days ago.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/14/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-approves-texas-emergency-declaration/) To help alleviate the impact of the disaster, yes, so I doubt it's going to be used to pay people's electric bills (I could be wrong!) but I'm not sure how it's the Federal government's **job** to pay the electric bills that *Texas* chose to increase. 

Because, keep in mind, it was *Texas's* ERCOT that voted to increase people's bills, and it was *Texas* that (so far) has failed to do anything about it. 

Should the Federal government just pay everyone's bills now? Especially if they're bills that were essentially *invented* to be costly? I mean, I'm pretty liberal, but I don't know if I'm liberal enough to advocate for the Federal government paying money towards something that is a borderline scam. 

Because this *was* a scam. Texas deregulated and privatized the electric system. Made it for profit. Then ERCOT made a deal with natural gas suppliers that they wouldn't force them to cut in to profits to winterize their equipment so they could jack up the prices when the next winter storm came. So Texans would get charged a boatload, and natural gas companies would make a shit-ton of money. 

Why should the Federal government pay for that? They didn't have anything to do with it, nor did other states. This is entirely Texas's fault, mess, and problem.

> They already have a plan in place to substantially increase our taxes.

Well, I'm happy for you making $400,000+ yearly, but since you are, I'm pretty sure you can afford it. You can probably make do with a slightly smaller mansion. 

Everyone under $400,000, i.e. the rest of us, will be seeing tax breaks, last I checked.

Maybe something changed recently, but I haven't heard anything. There's a proposed change to the *payroll* tax paid by employers, but that's different from an income tax, and not a tax on you.

> I can’t even imagine what this would do to the elderly who have a fix income. 

Any elderly person on a fixed income is likely on a fixed income because that fixed income is Social Security, and Social Security is never taxed. Because it's socialist handouts *from* the government, paid for by taxes. So that would be like the government taxing the government. Which is a bit like you handing money to yourself. 

So... nothing. It would do nothing.

And if they're rich enough to be earning a ""fixed"" income of over $400,000 yearly, see above.

> If our broken government can keep giving people $600 a week plus unemployment to NOT work

The more we keep people from mingling about, the faster we can get back to work by defeating this outbreak. That's worth spending money on.

We wouldn't have to spend nearly this much money if we had managed to stop this latest SARS outbreak during Trump's era the way that Bush stopped the first one, but there's nothing we can do about that now. 

> How about we fine the shit out of the ERCOT chair members and they pay.

Fine them for what? They do what the Texas government tells them to do. They follow the Texas government's rules. Fine them for following the rules? How is that fair? 

And all they'd likely have to do is file for bankruptcy and the bill isn't paid. So... what then? Who pays the bill then?

> How about during a natural declared disaster prices have to remain what they were prior to the disaster so when ERCOT had to repurchase back the energy they didn’t have to pay outrageous prices.

That sounds like an interesting idea that the politicians in Texas would have to implement for ERCOT to follow, but it does nothing to help current bills.

And it also brings in to question... how would that be enforced? Is the Texas government supposed to become Communist now and control prices, rather than let the free market decide? And what if other states/countries want to spend more than Texas is willing to spend on the gas? Does Texas just... do without natural gas entirely, because the price won't come down?

> Wind and solar totally let Texas down.

Wind and solar produced [*more* power](https://mobile.twitter.com/JesseJenkins/status/1361415200373530624) than what they were expected to do during this disaster. (If you click on that link, scroll up for the full story.) How is that ""letting Texas down""? It was [natural gas pipelines](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/natural-gas-power-storm/) that froze up, because the report to ERCOT telling them that natural gas equipment had to be fixed to work in colder weather that they were given back in 2011 was ignored by ERCOT. 

And ERCOT is controlled by the Texas government. 

So it was the Texas government that ignored the problem.

Super impressed with your question.  Since the government is so quick to fund other countries how about they jump in and foot the bill with the natural disaster emergency fund of some kind   They already have a plan in place to substantially increase our taxes. I can’t even imagine what this would do to the elderly who have a fix income.  If our broken government can keep giving people $600 a week plus unemployment to NOT work then apparently they have the extra money somewhere.   How about we fine the shit out of the ERCOT chair members and they pay. How about during a natural declared disaster prices have to remain what they were prior to the disaster so when ERCOT had to repurchase back the energy they didn’t have to pay outrageous prices. Even better take it out of “Biden’s Green Deal”. Shutting down the pipeline was a mistake.

"What your suggesting is a deviation from traditional design models that use historic conditions as an indication of the level of design required. This isn’t a local change of pace. This is something that was brought up in classes as we are the first engineering group that will blatantly deal with global warming our whole career. We can predict a little bit, but shouldn’t be expected to predict the conditions that we have no data for. 

As far as the 250 year storm, I don’t know if it’s that high, but 10.1 inches of snow in San Angelo  and 4 inches (avg) across the state, AND keeping the temperatures low for a week; that’s a hell of an oddball storm for Texas. 

As far as future prevention, are you ok paying $15 for 1000 gals of water? The current price is around $6, with the 25year plan raising it to near $9 near 2025.

Well the stock show and rodeo generate a lot of income for the city and it’s local business owners so I’m not mad about the chadbourne st project. That road is shit and needed to be fixed and it’s the road most out of-towners take to get to the rodeo grounds. Maybe republic can give back 10-12million of their over priced payoff to help fix the infrastructure 🤷🏼‍♂️,t2_30ho2egp,friedrod,0,1613571696.0,0,t1_gnrlk1x,gnrlk1x,True,trooli,t3_lljdsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/San_Angelo/comments/lljdsn/will_san_angelo_be_safe_to_live_in_utility_wise/,Will San Angelo be safe to live in utility wise and will people leave in masses?,/r/San_Angelo/comments/lljdsn/will_san_angelo_be_safe_to_live_in_utility_wise/gnrlk1x/,3,r/San_Angelo,0,3
"I’m a recent ASU graduate of civil engineering, and I think I can provide a tiny insight into the world of utilities. Engineers usually design their systems so that the storms and weather patterns we see on the vast majority of situations are handled. For example, rainwater is designed for the 100-yr storm (that occur once every 100 years). 
The current situation is beyond the scope of a 100-year storm “normal operating parameters”. The storm that just occurred this week might be a 250-year storm (or greater), meaning the event was beyond the design of normal handling. Quite frankly, it isn’t efficient to build San Angelo’s pipe network to be compliant with permafrost requirements, and the extra $ would be noticed in order to fix it. However, using the cities money wisely is a big task, and some expectation of repair lie beyond the normal operational parameters. 
Now if we look at the utility problems, water and electric are the two that are failing us. I’m much more qualified to speak on water than electric, but from what I have read, ERCOT failed to generate electricity needs when every household and business is running the heater. Heaters are usually electric load heavy, and thus rolling outages. The broken lines are still being fixed here and there, but AEP and ERCOT are going to have to explain the lack of redundancy generation. This doesn’t rely on the city. 
Our previous utility problems (pre-freeze) came from the  public (dumping of benzene, napaphalene, etc), and shouldn’t be held against our elected officials. The current “Boil water notice” is a safeguard against any foreign debris that entered the potable water system when a main broke due to freezing. 
Overall, the utilities in San Angelo aren’t the best, but they are acceptable. The city will organize repairs and deal with broken pipes as quickly as they can. The aftermath may be days or weeks of work, but we will normalize. 

TLDR: We are impacted by the utility disruptions but will recover hopefully within a week of thawing. Regarding water, the city is making efficient decisions when installing water lines, which doesn’t help in disasters. Regarding electricity, ERCOT will likely be federally investigated.",t2_5azx8,gmanbme,0,1613571100.0,0,t1_gnrkgh7,gnrkgh7,True,trooli,t3_lljdsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/San_Angelo/comments/lljdsn/will_san_angelo_be_safe_to_live_in_utility_wise/,Will San Angelo be safe to live in utility wise and will people leave in masses?,/r/San_Angelo/comments/lljdsn/will_san_angelo_be_safe_to_live_in_utility_wise/gnrkgh7/,14,r/San_Angelo,1,14

The 2 are very similar, so you definitely CAN, in fact say that they are “LIKE” each other without that being an opinion. As you say, there is either facts or being wrong, and in this case you are the latter.

"> The recovery rate is outstandingly good.

... holy fuck, no it's **not**. 90% is *fucking horrible*.

The recovery rate for influenza in [2017](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) was around 99.87%.

The difference 9.87% makes is gigantic.

Lets say 160,000,000 people (vaguely half the population of the US) came down with the flu. At a 99.87% recovery rate, you'd expect to have 208,000 dead.

At 90% recovery for SARS/COVID-19? **You'd have 16,000,000 dead.**

90% recovery is literally *decimating*. (Decimate's original meaning was to remove/kill 1/10th.)

The **actual** recovery rate for SARS/COVID-19 is 94.8%. Which is still *horrifyingly* bad. 

At a 94.8% recovery rate, you only need to have about 19.2 million people infected to reach a million dead.

19.2 million is only about 5.8% of the US population.

If we hit 6% infected in our country at that survival rate? We will see a **million people** dead. 

We're *already* at 138,000 dead in the US. 

That's already more dead than the number of Americans who died in WWI. In less than six months we've already reached 1/3rd of all the Americans who died in the FOUR YEARS we fought WWII. 

If we all just fucking shrug our shoulders and let this disease infect everyone, we will have millions of Americans dead. 

Nothing. *Nothing* in the entire history of America has killed a *million* Americans. Even the Spanish Flu only killed 675,000 in the ~year it was around. But they managed to stop the Spanish Flu's spread with masks 'n shit. 

I don't *think* it'll get that bad in the US, because despite the visibility of morons not wearing masks or quarantining, I think there are a lot of people who *are* taking precautions, and *eventually* people will get on board. Americans have a tendency to do the right thing (after doing all the other things first) eventually. But we'll get there because people will eventually get it through their thick fucking skulls that this is an incredibly deadly disease.

"> We have vaccines for the flu and it is still around.

We also have vaccines for smallpox, rabies, polio, malaria, and a [bunch of other diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases), and those diseases are either completely eradicated or their some of their case counts are so low as to be less than 100 in some years. Others are definitely on the decline.

You don't know which this is going to be. 

And you better damn well hope it's eradication, since it can cause blood clots which could lead to having to amputate limbs, and there are also signs it causes brain damage.

EDIT: And if the 5.8% mortality rate holds, and ""everyone"" gets it like you think, we'll have 15,000,000+ Americans dead. No event has ever killed a million Americans, much less fifteen million. I don't think that mortality rate will hold if *literally* everyone gets it (because demographics aren't evenly distributed, and herd immunity starts to kick in once you have 94% of the population immune), but at that mortality rate we only need to have 4% of the population of the US infected (about 13 million) for it to kill literally more Americans than any other single event in American history.)",t2_59oak,Moleculor,0,1594869416.0,0,t1_fy7t1ln,fy7t1ln,False,[deleted],t3_hrtunn,https://www.reddit.com/r/San_Angelo/comments/hrtunn/105_new_confirmed_cases_today_bringing_the_total/,"105 new confirmed cases today, bringing the total to 1265.",/r/San_Angelo/comments/hrtunn/105_new_confirmed_cases_today_bringing_the_total/fy7t1ln/,5,r/San_Angelo,0,5

"There's only 1 ""good"" provider here: SuddenLink.  They have a monopoly here and there's no real choices aside from them. Most other towns in Texas have Spectrum (formerly TimeWarner cable), but San Angelo doesn't have that option.  


I believe Charter & West Central Wireless also have plans, but their upload/download speeds are awful, and WCW operates on 4G, so the latency is terrible.  


I've had numerous problems with SuddenLink over the past few years, but they're the best in town. Recently they've come under fire by the city board for undelivering speeds, but as far as I know, they've done some work to address them since the mayor lit a fire under their ass.

"Depends on where you live, but there are regional jets flying in and out of Mathis Field, and there's the hospital helicopters that take off on mercy runs and they're not required to file flight plans.  There's also jets that fly out of Laughlin AFB that cross over our town from time to time.

The die-off is going to really get bad here.  Abbott already said if people don't start wearing masks he's going to lock the entire state down, and if Abbott (another Trump supporter) has publicly stated this, you know it's not a hoax.  No excuse for these unmasked people.  None at all.

"I’m assuming you’re going to be here for military.  You’ll survive but let me tell you, this has to be the most miserable place I have ever had the misfortune of living.  I’m here on mil too and It’s flat, empty, boring as all get out, and for the majority of the city, very economically depressed.  There are two nice neighborhoods, Bentwood and Santa Rita but Bentwood is a country club neighborhood and Santa Rita is just a rich old fashion neighborhood.

There are a handful of good restaurants here and like two parks that are worth your time and a lake that alright.  If you’re into fitness there’s an awesome barbell club to the north of town called The Bar Athletic club that has an awesome community.  I’d also recommend getting a kayak, fishing pole, or inflatable paddle board to keep yourself busy on the water, it helps with the squelching 100 degree heat.  There is a super pretty river/ cute but economically depressed town that you can launch your kayak about 30 min south of SA called a Christoval.

"Texas state laws bar municipalities from offering specific types of telecommunication services to the public directly or through a private telecom company. The state law does allow some provisions for communities without any private telecom companies presently offering broadband service to residents. 
However, a few cities in the state have been able to get around these rules. Mont Belvieu, for instance, was able to begin building out a fiber network in 2016 to offer broadband services to residents. The [local district court decided](https://muninetworks.org/content/court-confirms-texas-home-rule-authority-build-finance-community-network) that the city of Mont Belvieu had the authority to offer Internet service to residents because the Internet does not fall under the state’s definition of a telecommunication service. 
In 2019, Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law [legislation](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=86R&Bill=SB14) enabling electric cooperatives to offer broadband services to customers, but municipal governments are still barred from providing broadband services to residents.",t2_4u8db,Annakha,0,1593911541.0,0,t1_fwyh2o2,fwyh2o2,True,MrPaleontologistSir,t3_hgjneu,https://www.reddit.com/r/San_Angelo/comments/hgjneu/suddenlink_complaints/,Suddenlink Complaints,/r/San_Angelo/comments/hgjneu/suddenlink_complaints/fwyh2o2/,1,r/San_Angelo,0,1

They are running fever and chills and just feel exhausted. These patients here think their life is over. The doctors and Respiratory Therapists watch oxygen levels and doctors decide for intubation. Putting them on a ventilator. We are having to wear 2 masks at all times with plastic gowns and gloves. Its come to a point we are having Sterilization to sanitize and sterilize our reused masks.

"I believe in what's going on around me. I'm not scared. I'm cautious. Be smart and do your due diligence. 

I don't know where the paranoia and fear is coming from unless you just keep it on the news 24/7. Which that's all they've been peddling for the past decade, so what's new. Should people be scared? No. Should people be smart? Yes. You can't scare people into being smart.

Everyone at the park and folks out on walks are being smart and maintaining their distances. Our grocery stores have been fantastic at going above and beyond the guidelines of preventing the spread. I've talked with many strangers in public (6 feet away of course lol) and people seem to be amicable and decent about wanting to get through this as safely and as practically as possible. This isn't the beaches of Florida. Seeing people congregate like that makes me rather nervous.

Part of me wants to trash this thread, there's nothing but bickering and fear mongering in here and not much of what I would say ""productive conversation"", BUT, we haven't had a ton of activity on this sub in awhile, and at least we're interacting on here; I say that's a good thing. Plus I don't want to be an asshole power mod like we have trouble with on the rest of Reddit at large; I'd rather go the free speech method for better or worse.

Keep it civil folks. Don't take it personal when you get downvoted or get a power trip when you're upvoted. People are going to do what they're going to do.

"we will be on shelter in place by monday, if not sooner. 


our city and county leaders didn't take this serious soon enough.


people are out driving around going non-essential places still, it's ridiculous. there is a sense of non-urgency and lenience here that was falsely implemented by our ""good ol boy"" local politicians. (i really hate to say this as i'm not a political person, but it's the truth)


there are without a doubt dozens of cases here, if not more, and have been for quite a while. the simple fact of the matter is there were not test being done and the test that WERE done the results have been pending for well over a week now. think about the fact that you can spread it without even knowing you have it, as well. take a look at the rest of the state, nation, world and what is actually going on.


if you notice now there's a ""case per day"", they're not releasing pending results, and are waiting for the right time to release the ""news"" and then put us on a shelter in place. something that should have been done initially.


now i am not saying it's some crazy dangerous disease that will wipe us all out, but it's a real threat to any human and needs to be taken seriously. there are precautions that need to be in place and everyone's daily lives will be interrupted for a while until things are contained, and people need to be okay with that.


everyone needs to do what's right and do what you can to help protect yourselves and your families and every living stranger because the tougher times are ahead.

Instead of getting upset, I stopped, took some deep breaths, and realized this will help me get caught up on things I would've ignored if work would've gone a million miles per hour. I needed to prep for a garage sale, pack some things, rearrange some things, work on the yard.

So instead of making doom and gloom of it all, I'm going to use this time to catch up with things that I otherwise would've put off.

"If you're looking for a quiet set of apartments, I'd recommend the Sunset Apartments on Sunset Drive.  They have STRICT rules about noise and yes they do toss people out on a 24 hour notice for flagrantly violating the noise rules.  I lived there about 10 years ago and someone moved in on the other side of a wall from me and they were blasting their music at 0200 on a Monday morning. I asked them to turn it down, they did - until I was out of eyesight, and then they promptly cranked it right back up (assholes).  I went to the office the next morning to mention it and the office staff said ""Oh don't worry, they're gone in 24 hours"" (I wasn't the ONLY one who had stopped by, apparently) and sure as heck when I got back to my place there was screaming, yelling (about being thrown out) and a lot of packing happening on the other side of the wall.  They were indeed gone by late that evening, and everything went back to being a nice quiet place to live.     

The Quiet Hours notice is right there in the lease and they pointed it out to me when I got my apartment.  Anyone who ignores what the office staff says really deserves the consequences.

"Hi there! Congrats on the life change. Angelo will definitely be a shift from city life, but it sounds it may be a nice fit for what you're looking for as well. Expect friendly people and fairly vibrant offerings for music and art by small town Texas standards. You probably already know it's a college town, so there's a guaranteed population of people around your age to meet. 

In terms of getting outside [Lake Nasworthy](https://goo.gl/maps/B95SUzKkbBTsCyVcA) has a handful of nice parks and spots to choose from. There's also a nice trail along the river downtown, the [San Angelo nature trails](https://goo.gl/maps/4ziLwwC1DQ5Hw5uQ8), [San Angelo State Park](https://goo.gl/maps/FmgCPdQmjg3KSi6n6) (don't miss the north shore entrance for hiking), [International Water Lily Collection](https://goo.gl/maps/zDbDtvMg1FLFAuU46), and the ""[KOA](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Koa-Running-Trails/219076534787523?eid=ARAxqtngE4RRr3drf4k6oL2mYX8PGigEZGfGbe4Uq0S6mRFPvczgEWTwF7t0OD0WNKNzapH8Rdnriu72&rf=185462808773515)"" loop popular for walking and running.
