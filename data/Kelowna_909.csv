"Right, but you don't build for current demand, you build for future demand and looking and where Kelowna is going, I can easily imagine that demand will come within the next 25 years. 

There are over 15 high rises either being constructed or in planning/proposal stages in Downtown Kelowna alone. Not including the Tolko mill sight which will likely add an additional 4 tower (minimum) and a slew of 5 over 1 mid rise buildings. 

The Landmark district plans for the next 30 years would be adding several more towers (in the old Capri mall location) and a ton more ""missing middle"" apartment/commercial projects in a localized region of town (from Spall down to Gordon is all apart of one massive master plan for that area)

The lots around the mall that once sat empty are being considered for development projects. The Midtown 5 over 1 in front of best buy is already in development and that project included a proposal for an additional 2 tower at the north end of the lot. An additional project with over 400 units is likely to go up on the corner of Dilworth and Springfield. The Jysk location right by Superstore has a proposal out for another massive residential/commercial project. 

The demand for more high density units around Kelowna is staggering. We're not building fast enough yet people continue to want to live here (sometimes I question why). A single light rail line that goes between these 3 emerging high density residential/commercial districts would make a ton of sense to start considering. I forgot to mention as well that UBCO is building a massive downtown campus project, likely to start development fairly soon; mixed residential/commercial on top of the campus itself. 

Anyway sorry to spam you. Kelowna will definitely be apart of a major population boom in the next 50 years and I think it would be insane for the city to not consider alternative transportation projects such as light rail (which they probably are considering based on [this article](https://www.kelownadailycourier.ca/news/article_ed1d9822-8df5-11ec-a6e8-8f4e1521a1c8.html))

"good video and it is an interesting conundrum: people want affordability and also want it to be more unique. 

&#x200B;

I sold new homes in Edmonton for over a decade and would always hear complaints about ""cookie cutter"". 

&#x200B;

Well that's how you make things more affordable, the more you can mass produce something the more you can use the economy of scales. Think of car manufacturing, you don't even hear the name ""hand built"" in cars unless you travel in exclusive circles  where the average income is well above anything you can imagine.

&#x200B;

What's the parking like for the quadplex? I imagine its more practical in less car dependant areas

I don't think Kelowna needs too much quadplexes as they aren't desirable for everyone, having a person live above you like in an apartment and the small space would be more for single people/couples who don't want a yard.

&#x200B;

Kelowna would do much better with more duplexes and skinny homes. Since I have moved here I have noticed a lot of homes on large parcels of land that could quite easily be converted into them either with a front attached garage or rear detached. doing more of those would double capacity.

"I've posted this on Reddit before it's a political statement:

Canada's GDP under this Liberal government is higher during this once in a generation pandemic and economic crisis (Excluding April May and barely June 2020) than the best months of your IDU CPC Conservative government's entire decade of darkness.


 After being elected in 2015 after a decade of stagnation, an economy in ruin, and in a recession, the PMJT  Liberals have gone on to lead the G-7 in economic growth. 


They saved universal healthcare with a new health accord. 


They drove unemployment to the lowest levels since the 1970's, and poverty to the lowest levels ever with the new tax-free child benefit.


 They've negotiated a universal childcare care agreement with 9 provinces and a universal pharmacare program with one province so far.


They oversaw the construction and implementation of the Enbridge line 3 from Hardesty Alberta to the port of Wisconsin, 1100km of pipeline.

They saved Energy East (TransCanada pipeline).


 They've approved the largest private investment in Canadian history, the Kitimat $40 billion LNG plant and pipeline, and purchased the mother of all Canadian pipelines the TMX. 


Now, we're seeing record oil production in Alberta, ever, and BC is the fastest growing province.


 We have seen record TSX highs 6x, broken tourism records twice, and for the first time ever, Canada beat the USA  in the economic competitiveness rankings.


 We have seen record foreign direct investment even when the oil prices were rolling into the Negatives


We've  seen manufacturing conglomerates like General Electric abandon the USA for Canada. 


The Liberals have negotiated CETA,  NAFTA 2.0, and the CPTPP giving 1.5 billion new customers for Canadian businesses. Three days ago, our government announced we are in trade talks with India, which add another 1.4 billion customers for Canadian products!

Despite the massive Covid spending to support  Canadians, their 

families and their small businesses' major credit rating agencies reaffirmed Canada's AAA credit rating.


 The IMF upgraded Canada’s growth outlook by most among advanced economies, and Canada's Covid debt to GDP ratio is now falling precipitously!


The Liberals have assembled the largest compilations of greening legislations in the history of North America and exceeded their long-term drinking water advisory elimination goal . 


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau led the negotiations with Iran to secure access to the shot down Ukraine airline flight 752 crash site and secured the compensation for the families of the loved ones killed by Iran. 


 In  Q1 2021, Canada broke the all-time venture capital investment record (and did it during the Pandemic) of $2.7 billion being invested. 


 Canada has been ranked the best quality of life, 5 years running, and in 2021, Canada beat Sweden as the best county on earth!


 Thanks to the Liberals aggressive vaccine procurement, Canada leads the world in vaccine distributio.


 Canada vaccine manufacturing  has been fully restored with deals with several pharmaceutical companies.


Now, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has untied the western world and NATO not seen since WWII.  He has identified the Russian economic weaknesses and campaigned the Western world to implement sanctions that had reduced  the Russian economy  to the size of Venezuela",t2_a1qaebu5,fighting4good,0,1648226288.0,0,t1_i231dw7,i231dw7,False,CanadainGuy16,t3_tnp7m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tnp7m8/soooo_have_i_pissed_off_everyone_was_just_looking/,Soooo have I pissed off everyone?

"Is sure did! There was a massive Oil patch recession, which sparked a series of layoffs, and lots of people who worked in Alberta and lived here lost jobs and homes. We can sure compare notes if you have some data. 
  
As for the rate hike, I did say, it was unlikely. But you are the one painting the ""never can happen"" picture. Even a 3% rate with HELOC would be difficult to sustain in several cases.  
  
Last year, in spring, there was an inventory shortage.  
  
I feel like you are writing the opposite of how it was for everything haha.  
  
You can just set a google filter for dates, and read the news from back then.  For example, this one is from last March which mentions inventory shortage.

"One word of advice, don't rent it out.

The tenancy act in this province is a complete disaster. Tenants have all the rights, rent increases are impossible and it's an all in all shit situation to be a landlord in BC. I could tell you a shitty story about how I just lost $30k even though the tenancy board determined I was not in the wrong (tenancy board allows referred to file disputes that can cost your thousands in legal bills with zero accountability for the tenants except a $100 fee) or another story from a friend of mine who lost about $60k just trying to evict a tenant who decided he didn't need to pay rent anymore..

And as far as the market, I think you've got a pretty good grip on things. Prices are likely to continue to climb, people keep talking about market corrections but I don't foresee that happening.

There could be a correction in this market or not, I think that depends partially on fiscal policy, which depends a lot on covid. The current situation exists as a result of maintaining record low interest rates which will continue if there any thought of another wave coming. Which there is. My bet based on this info is we will not see a massive correction in the next few years.
  There are other supporting factors at play including stay at home jobs which are here to stay pandemic or not, driving people to the Okanagan. 

As a final note housing prices double every 10-12 years on average in the Okanagan historically, and housing is a great bet during inflationary periods.

Places we looked at for 750-800k ish last May were 900k by November and around 1.1m now.

Basically every sale is cash/no conditions otherwise you won't be accepted. Could sell for 1.05m - 1.15m now.

I work as a property manager and get about 60 to 100 responses for each rental listing in about 2 weeks. There is so much competition and little availability in the rental market, I would secure a place before actually moving. This is for $3300-$3600/month for half a house upstairs 3/4br or $2100-$2500/month for 2br lower half/basement.

The demand is massive, probably 25-35% of all rental applicants are waiting to buy/just sold/ moved from somewhere else to buy. Ot just started easing up with inventory in the last few weeks.

Quilchena on a nice summer day is worth the drive. Playground is great and with a spray park as well it’s really a great spot to spend the afternoon. 

Kangaroo creek farm is a must. I have a daughter a similar age and it was a blast. The food truck there serves great burgers too. Definitely best in the morning.

"Weddings are all about environmental impact, though! Two people who just want to get married can do so with nearly no impact by simply going to the JP. However, two people who want a wedding specifically want an environment-destroying spectacle of themselves. Dozens of people making extra trips in their cars and often flights as well, kill hundreds of flowers, apparel that only gets worn once, often a lot of single-use plastics, etc. This spouse-to-be wants to specifically make extra impact by using classic cars with big inefficient V8s for transportation.

"The real issue is not what modality you choose;  it's venturing off trail of any kind that is the problem. Even footprints. The Knox grasslands and like ecosystems are the most sensitive, rare, and threatened ecosystem in BC; even more so than alpine.  More should be done to protect these areas in the Okanagan. Like establishing more parks and protected areas. 

The majority of the damage on Knox is done by hikers taking the short cuts to avoid the switchbacks all to save 10 seconds. Which is ridiculous because it sucks hiking looking down at your feet hiking straight up and the trails were cut strategically to maximize the views, reduce environmental impact and ease for the best hiking experience. 

Bike trails have come along way since the 80's and the trails on Knox are built and maintained by professionals with drainage and erosion control in mind. As part of the Park Master Plan.

"There was a fast spreading fire on Dilworth last year, starting near the electrical substation on Glenmore near Spall/rail trail and quickly lit up all the dry grass. If I remember correctly, it was windy at the time too. They still managed to put that out fairly quickly.

Just my armchair opinion, but I think Dilworth isn't overly high risk due to all the development on there (roads, fire hydrants, etc) and the central proximity to a few fire stations.

Knox is probably a higher risk for sure, although maybe still more accessible to crews than Okanagan Mountain Park (and even that would be managed differently nowadays).

As far as Rutland goes, I think it is fairly low risk, or at least not any higher risk than any other part of the city.

"Recently bought a place in Kelowna to move to for my partner's job. For context, we're both in unionized, civil service environments. Household income in the very low six figure zone. 

The insight from the mortgage brokers, lawyers, and agents I worked with seems to be that any supply that is created is scooped up and rented out by investors. Anecdotally, of my agent's recent sales were Vancouver investors.

When we were looking for a place we were repeatedly outbid $50k-$100k over asking, no inspection, no conditions by investors.

Building more supply may just result in investors having more supply to buy, which leaves the average individual, family, and generally anyone looking to have a home and actually live in the home.

"ICBC is a terrible company riddled with insane bureaucracy. Created by the NDP, they are the only for-profit public auto insurance provider in Canada. They run a monopoly on insurance in BC making it near impossible to legally drive a vehicle without their insurance.

The auto insurance industry is fucked.. ICBC are assholes, they charge too much/are strict, but you do get what you pay for in comparison to other insurance companies. If we play the compare game with Ontario or other provinces, we have it pretty good in BC.. ICBC was originally created as a non profit but has since changed to a for profit, revenue neutral company. This means whenever ICBC makes money, the provincial government comes in and takes it to do with the money as it pleases while private car insurance providers in Ontario answer to their shareholders. ICBC may be ahead of places like Ontario it doesn't mean we should be satisfied with what we are getting. It is similar to comparing what is worse, instead of what is better..

Now, ICBC can easily fudge the numbers so that the mandatory cost is overstated and the optional is understated: reducing the ability of competitors to compete. If we're paying too much, it is because the mandatory cost is overstated. ICBC used to charge us a high rate with the promise that they were investing the extra capital to give us cheaper insurance down the road, with a huge buffer in case of major natural disasters. Basically they wanted to buy a ton of assets like real estate and investments, use the income to lower insurance rates and they would have a huge nest egg in case there was a major disaster that totalled thousands of cars. It was a good deal for us.

But the BC government STOLE it from the people and then proclaimed they balanced the budget, and have done so on multiple occasions.

If we had cheaper insurance, we could afford to do things like insuring a second, tiny efficient car/motorcycle for most days and only use our big vehicle when we have to.

"Hey! A hopefully friendly redditor here to explain & make it maybe a little clearer!

I graduated high school in 2019. We had no “uniform”, but the way females dressed was always a… hot topic. I saw girls being pulled aside for the length of the skirt, the length of the socks, the *width* of the shirt trap. I’m not making this up. There’s a rule now called the “two finger” rule, where if the strap isn’t at least 2 fingers wide, you can get sent home. Other things that girls got singled out for were short length and crop tops. 

That’s about all I can remember, but these aren’t little kids I’m talking about from my situation. They’re 14-19 year olds who *should* be able to express themselves freely through their choice of clothing, but weren’t allowed to. This is definitely a relatively new thing, and I do think that schools need to stop telling females how to dress and start telling people how to *act* properly. Not just boys. Girls too. Anyways, I hope that helps and I hope you don’t feel too estranged from the shift that happened.",t2_3s9epl5y,nmdcDrgn,0,1647759574.0,0,t1_i1dlnwf,i1dlnwf,False,[deleted],t3_tgefmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tgefmk/walkout4consent_on_040422_at_10am_nationwide/,"#walkout4consent on 04/04/22 at 10am nationwide walkout to protest rape culture, dress codes, while asking for accountability and consent education",/r/kelowna/comments/tgefmk/walkout4consent_on_040422_at_10am_nationwide/i1dlnwf/,1,r/kelowna,0,1

The occasional misbehaving printer etc...   If this is accurate in your case, then you definitely don't need these services.  In fact, they're probably counterproductive. 

My advice:  Cancel this nonsense.  Contact Telus or Shaw, get whatever internet promo package works for you.  They'll install some basic wireless hardware in your home.  Just give them a network name and a password to plug into it.  Done deal.  This works fine for most people.  If you still need better performance/more options, then you can start throwing money and new hardware at the problem.  You'll probably be fine though.",t2_4n3cv8,fantomphapper,0,1647723011.0,0,t1_i1bp99y,i1bp99y,False,garfieldlover3000,t3_tebeyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tebeyh/what_the_best_wifi_service_in_town/,What the best Wifi service in town?,/r/kelowna/comments/tebeyh/what_the_best_wifi_service_in_town/i1bp99y/,2,r/kelowna,0,2

>More than half of drug offences were cannabis-related
Fifty-eight percent (55,000 of 95,400) of police-reported Controlled Drugs and Substances Act offences were cannabis-related. The other 42% were for offences relating to the importation, exportation, trafficking, production and possession of drugs and narcotics such as cocaine, heroin, crystal meth, PCP, LSD and ecstasy.

We eliminated 58% of the polices time spent on illegal drug enforcement in Canada when we legalized cannabis. They did not lose a cent in budget funding. Infact it has been increased.

That's a lot of extra time freed up with lots of extra $$$ and equipment.

"Could you elaborate how the dress codes are one sided?  

I think we’re in agreement that whatever the standard is, it should be equal for girls and boys.

I think within the school administration, they need realize there’s a difference between the gym and the classroom.  I always thought it was dumb that shortly after I graduated, guys weren’t allowed to go shirtless in the gym or on the fields anymore.  And from what I remember, this was a “make it fair” response to girls no longer being allowed to wear just a sports bra for things like basketball or soccer practice, which is equally dumb.  

That said, I don’t think guys should be shirtless and girls in sports bras in the classroom.  I dunno, I can’t really explain it, maybe I’m becoming an old, but I think there should be some sort of standard.

I haven’t seen anyone make an argument for what that standard should be.

">Why is girls showing their shoulders such a big deal?

It isnt. But schools and other authorities always make it seem like it is.

>It’s a time and place thing.  What’s wrong with saying all students, make or female, have to wear a shirt that covers their shoulders and pants/dress/skirt that go at least as low as the knees?

Nothing. However most dress codes are not at all equal.

>Overwhelming majority of professions have a dress code for males and females.  Why would school be any different?

Because being a school stufent isnt a profession and you are a kid, not a professional. And again, the problem is not about dress codes in general but about how one sided dress codes usually are.

>If a person wants to express their personality by wearing whatever kinds of clothes, they can do it on their own time.

As long as it is completely equal and fair, sure.

>Would it be ok for boys to wear no shirts in school?  Would it be appropriate for girls to wear just a bikini top in school?

Whataboutism. When I was in highschool some boys would routinely go shirtless during PE on hot days or go shirtless at school sport practices. I can also remember random events during hot weather like having a huge slip and slide and there were definitely some girls wearing bathing suits for it.

>Do you think it wouldn’t be distracting for female students if boys were allowed to wear nothing but a thong to school?

Again, this is arguing in bad faith. Obviously no one is going to go to school in nothing but a thong just like a guy isnt going to go to school only in a banana hammock.

"I’m being obtuse and trolly because everyone here seems to have an issue with what the current standard is, but no one will explain what they want the new standard to be, and why.

I take your point about spaghetti vs linguini straps, ya, it’s a silly defining line.

But I mean, when I was in high school, boys were allowed to be topless on school grounds.  On the fields, in the gym, in the hallways.  Now, as far as I’m aware, they’re not allowed….because, heaven forbid female students are distracted by male upper bodies?

Again, I get that spaghetti vs linguini is a silly differentiator, but at the same time, if someone actually wants to challenge and rewrite the current dress code, then they need to able to spell out new boundaries of a dress code that they can be satisfied with - because clearly, no one wants to see *no* dress code.",t2_dobnm2af,Potential-Brain7735,0,1647564066.0,0,t1_i13dkiq,i13dkiq,False,[deleted],t3_tgefmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tgefmk/walkout4consent_on_040422_at_10am_nationwide/,"#walkout4consent on 04/04/22 at 10am nationwide walkout to protest rape culture, dress codes, while asking for accountability and consent education",/r/kelowna/comments/tgefmk/walkout4consent_on_040422_at_10am_nationwide/i13dkiq/,-3,r/kelowna,0,-3
"Inappropriate comments, grope, rape, I fully agree.  No one deserves that.

I disagree about a low cut shirt that shows cleavage though.  The whole point of a woman showing cleavage is because she wants people to look at her.  It’s basic biology, and has been that way for hundreds of thousands of years.

I think it’s weird to say that boys should be punished for looking at girls or being distracted by girls (and vice versa), and I think it’s disingenuous to imply that girls and boys being told to wear clothes appropriate for school is “punishment”.  

I’ve tried to have this convo with other people in this thread, everyone just downvotes and doesn’t engage:

When I was in highschool in BC from 1999-2003, it was very normal for girls aged 14-18, some even as young as 13, to wear spaghetti strap tank tops, and low rise pants that blatantly showed their thong.  It was the style at the time.  I can also remember some of the girls at school wearing some incredibly tiny shorts and skirts (hella short cutoff jean shorts).  At the same time, boys were allowed to go shirtless at school, mostly in the gym or outside, but it was completely normal and regular for boys to walk shirtless from the gym to their locker or things like that.

Is that what people want to go back to?  All in the name of making schools a safer place where you’re less likely to encounter inappropriate behaviour?

Some time shortly after I left high school, that changed.  Girls were told they had to wear tops that covered their shoulders, covered their midriff, and shorts/skirts/dresses that went half way down their thigh.  At the same time, boys were no longer allowed to go shirtless, and also in line with the times, were told they had to wear their pants around their waste, not their knees.  Even after school hours, boys were not allowed to be shirtless, even in the gym (we used to play shirts vs skins for basketball practice, and then they had to switch to using pennies.  At first they would wear a penny with no shirt under, but someone complained, and then boys had to have a shirt on under the penny).

This was all done in the name of making a dress code that was equal for boys and girls alike, one simple set of rules for everyone.

When did having to wear a simple t-shirt become oppressive?

I’m sure that in school today, if a boy were to walk around in inappropriate clothing, they would be pulled out of class and sent home just like the girls.

From working at McDonalds, to being a pilot, or electrician, or soldier, or lawyer, or doctor, or chef, there’s going to be a dress code for all of those.

"No one is replying to you because you’re taking it to extreme, troll-like levels in my personal opinion. It’s about the double standard. They commented that their stepdaughter wasn’t allowed to wear shorts above the knee. Do you honestly think that was enforced for the boys? 

Also, you’re clearly are a man because NO girl would wear a thong bikini or nipple tassels to school. Ever. We got harassed and groped in hoodies and tights jeans. Boys would try to flip up our skirts or dresses as we walked by. Sexual harassment is a daily occurrence to girls in middle and high school. 

Obviously no one is advocating to send children to school in underwear. But the concept of a dress code needs a serious revamp. It’s also incredibly important to teach boys and young men about consent and respecting women’s bodies.

Your anecdotes from 20 years ago do nothing to prove/disprove the rule that these schools follow.

"Do you think it would be appropriate for your stepdaughter to wear a thong bikini to school?

I’m going to assume no, to which I would then add, you obviously have a limit somewhere for what you consider appropriate attire for school children.

Why is girls being allowed to expose their shoulder such a hill to die on?

If spaghetti strap tank tops are ok, is that the limit?  Or would you be ok with girls having the option to wear even less if they wanted to?

I can remember when I was in high school, it was normal for the boys to take their shirts off during PE class, or during sports practice (we played “skins vs shirts” all the time).  I graduated in ‘03, and within a couple of years, boys were not allowed to take their shirts off in school anymore.

I also remember in high school, that girls wearing spaghetti strap tank tops with the bra straps purposely showing was all the rage.  Same with low cut pants where their thong or g-string was showing.  14, 15, 16 year old kids.  Oddly enough, the main resistance to this came from the female teachers, who viewed the attire as inappropriate for school.  The male teachers had their hands tied, no matter how they approached the situation, they could be construed as being pervy and creepy.

If your 14 year old step daughter wanted to get a summer job at a whole range of businesses, she would be required to follow a dress code.  Why would school be any different?

Where is the limit on what is appropriate?  Should it be ok for your 14 year old daughter to wear nothing but nipple tassels and a g-string to school?

That's assuming every rental is newly purchased. There's a lot of people who have no mortgage on their rental property and are still charging what someone who just paid $1.2m is charging.

"One of the best 4 season climates in Canada.

That said, you almost couldn’t pick a worse spot to try to build a major Canadian city.  Every single thing that comes to the valley must be brought by truck.  There is obviously no maritime access for major shipping, and we’ve done a fantastic job of converting existing railway lines into bike paths.  Now we have civil engineering students at UBCO doing proposals for building new railways as their thesis projects.

Water will also continue to become more of an issue in the valley.  Technically the Okanagan is a desert climate.  Growing population will only stress our limited water supply even more, and will likely turn the lakes into disgusting sewage ponds (our lakes have extremely slow exchange rates compared to most big lakes in the province).

Most people move here because they want to escape places like Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, etc, but the long term result will simply be that Kelowna ends up as a shit hole just like those cities, and then the process will repeat in the Kootenay valleys (which fortunately don’t have the water issues, but have a fraction of developable land).",t2_dobnm2af,Potential-Brain7735,0,1647545681.0,0,t1_i124gkk,i124gkk,True,CanadainGuy16,t3_tg9hpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tg9hpw/why_do_you_think_the_renting_housing_pricing_is/,Why do you think the renting/ housing pricing is so high here/now?,/r/kelowna/comments/tg9hpw/why_do_you_think_the_renting_housing_pricing_is/i124gkk/,0,r/kelowna,0,0

"I think ""supply/demand"" is too simple, honestly, though it's useful and probably sufficieny accurate.

Housing is broken everywhere that's not strictly undesirable right now. It's _not_ because there was a huge influx of people moving from 1000-person towns to better/bigger areas. There's been people driven out _to_ those 1000-person towns to some degree as well.

From my perspective, high market churn caused this. Prices went up, people sold houses and kicked out renters to other new owners who are trying to recover costs at even higher prices. Put that in a cycle, and presto, here we are! But why did prices _initially_ start going up so steeply, and where did all that sale value get moved to? I'm not educated enough to know that really.

I moved away from the Okanagan because we got priced out, so decided to move elsewhere in BC (but still a decently populated area) and is a little less on fire every summer which is great for breathing. I could've moved to Maple Ridge or something for what Kelowna prices were, and honestly those places are just as attractive to me as a remote worker.

But I think that's partly it. Everything else is coming up to meet Vancouver area costs halfway. This... kinda? makes sense, except that Kelowna wages are hot garbage. I got sick of employers justifying 50+% lower salary in my field just because it was in Kelowna.

"Kelowna is the fastest growing city in Canada.  NIMBYs are in full force here like other places and basically all we build are upper middle class homes.  Condos are mostly far from current schools except Glenmore I suppose which has many.  

It's basically lack of inventory for a ton of reasons.  I am personally in the group where I either rent half my home or I don't own a home.  My neighbours paid multitudes less for their homes and one of them is a NIMBY and retired so can attend every council meeting.  The effects will grow as all our new schools are built in upper middle class developments and our old (70-100 years) schools in Rutland just continue to age.

A major point is the area really is beautiful and recognized across Canada and parts of the world.  People want to live here and tons of outside pressure is on Kelowna, beyond the earnings of locals.  This also catches the attention of investors who are, with good speculation, betting on prices to continue rising.  In our last 50 years I don't believe our top ranking cities had any real recession in prices so even if Kelowna dropped to 5th from 1st in popularity, prices would still inflate.

it is so expensive to rent here because they build very little housing for the working class rental market . there is building going on all around us but its all higher end buildings and big home subdivisions. they have built a few projects like central greens but they fill up asap. most of the older apartments were built way back in the 70 and 80s and are 4 stories high .kelowna seems to always be booming with construction but the majority of it has been built for the people who are moving here and not for the people who actually live here,t2_bmj7fqm3,jason733canada,0,1647538990.0,0,t1_i11n0x1,i11n0x1,True,CanadainGuy16,t3_tg9hpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tg9hpw/why_do_you_think_the_renting_housing_pricing_is/,Why do you think the renting/ housing pricing is so high here/now?,/r/kelowna/comments/tg9hpw/why_do_you_think_the_renting_housing_pricing_is/i11n0x1/,7,r/kelowna,0,7

"Local REALTOR here and I’d like to start by saying I’m so sorry to the families struggling right now. It’s almost impossible to get a single family house sold to a family that have subjects on their offer. Young families are being pushed into townhouses that are becoming inflated because of this. They are then being pushed out of townhouses which is increasing the cost of apartments. I’ve seen some massive luck if you create a video for the seller. Talk to your REALTOR about this. Also if you are doing a subject to inspection, book the inspection date for one day after offer acceptance. Sellers like this. 

I feel like the biggest factor is mortgage rates. With cheap money, people can afford much more. With the bank of Canada expected to raise rates even more this year I think that prices will come down Q4-Q1 2023. With the latest 25bps increase, for every 100k mortgaged on a variable, will equal $12 a month in increased payments. So with rates raising, payments will be sky-rocketing over the next year and there could be a big shock factor.

"Reasons: 

- A lot of people who owned multiple homes in Kelowna sold during this boom. These people likely had renters in their houses and secondary properties. A lot of people moving in evicted them, either temporarily or permanently. This leads to a huge spike in demand and a huge spike in rent shuffling (charging a new amount of rent compared to the previous agreement)

- The Craigslist effect on the rental market. As soon as someone puts a property up for rent, due to the previous tenant leaving, a new build, renoviction, whatever, they look on craigslist or whatnot for the ""market rate"" for their area. Then they add ~$100 to the market rate because they're not desperate or they ""did work on it"" or need a ""mortgage helper"". Then next month someone else does the same, adding more money to the rent, and so forth and so forth. Increasing rent well past the inflation rate or the rate of house valuation, even if they haven't had a mortgage to pay in a decade or more. 

TL;DR: It's greed. Housing is a necessity and there is a housing crisis so people will profiteer and morally justify it anyway they can.",t2_f6w58vb1,UrsusRomanus,0,1647530621.0,0,t1_i1118jj,i1118jj,True,CanadainGuy16,t3_tg9hpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tg9hpw/why_do_you_think_the_renting_housing_pricing_is/,Why do you think the renting/ housing pricing is so high here/now?,/r/kelowna/comments/tg9hpw/why_do_you_think_the_renting_housing_pricing_is/i1118jj/,11,r/kelowna,0,11
"Welcome fellow Ontario Expat, you'll love it here. 

The dry heat is more tolerable than the humidity of Ontario, but during heatwaves it's like opening the oven when you step outside. 
Also buy stocks in moisturizer, the climate dries you out like crazy (at least for me it does). 


There are little to no bugs here, compared to Northern Ontario/ the Prairies it's mind boggling.  To be able to keep your door open while you bbq and not worry about any mosquitos getting in is amazing. 

Winters are more manageable and usually shorter, right now there's no snow in Kelowna and some golf courses are open. Sure you get the odd year where it dips into the -20s and snows a little more, but it's nothing compared to the rest of Canada. Just get some good winter tires and you're set.
