Honestly give Google Fi and mint Mobile a look. Both are relatively cheap and use a combination of cell towers from the other companies so their coverage should be much better than going with just one of the big guys.

"Totally agree that it depends on where you live.  If you are near Digipen, it is not exactly an exciting, walkable area.  But just a tiny bit closer to downtown Redmond and you can walk to the transit center and take the bus to Seattle. You may want to buy an Orca Card, so you can just load it with 30 dollars, or whatever, and go to the University area in Seattle or downtown Bellevue, etc.  [ORCA card bus pass info](https://orcacard.com/ERG-Seattle/getACard.do;jsessionid=CQ5JVqhD34twHIsGkYrPeald?m=2)

In downtown Redmond there are plenty of food choices, ice cream, coffee, groceries, and a nice walking/bike trail that is more fun on week days rather than on busy weekends.  There is also a large park called Marymoor where there are movies at night and concerts in the summer.  If you are into sports, there is cricket, tennis, soccer, and bike racing all in the park. [Marymoor Park info](https://kingcounty.gov/services/parks-recreation/parks/parks-and-natural-lands/popular-parks/marymoor.aspx)

In downtown Redmond:  there is an escape room and axe throwing place (never been to either) but for stuff ""to do"" people go to Seattle--art museum, Space Needle, neat neighborhoods (University area, Cap Hill, Queen Anne, Ballard).  Hiking is very popular here and in the summer there is a bus you can catch to popular trail heads. No car needed but you do need to get to the bus : ) [TrailHead Direct Info bus to hikes](https://trailheaddirect.org/faq/)

Rent is definitely a shocker out here, especially compared to Houston and after the eviction/rent increase moratorium lifted this last year.

If you aren‚Äôt able to find a roommate, I would see what your recruiter can do to help find temporary housing. You can find cheaper rents in Seattle (barely lol).

Redmond recently released their 2021 annual community survey, and the #1 priority of ~400 randomly selected residents was affordability. :/

"I would recommend living at the hotel or renting a room. 1 bed apartment will cost you ~$2k plus utilities. Look up the hotel rates, compare to renting a room and decide which you prefer. There's no utilities at the hotel and if they have amenities like a gym that's a plus. Free breakfast if included will save you time and money, too.

Redmond is sprawled out in areas. The bus itself is fine, but it make take 1-2 hours to get somewhere out of that town. Look up the bus routes after you decide where you'll stay. Look at soundtransit.org and Metro on kingcounty.org.  There are scheduling/trip helps there. 

In Redmond itself, there isn't much to do for entertainment. Search on Yelp for what you're into. There's a VR place, indoor race car track, karaoke, bars and that's about it. Oh there is a race car gaming place at the mall, but haven't been there. Movie theatre there has recliners but it's pricy.

The dynamic was a suburb and you commute to work. It wasn't preferences like yours that built this place. You aren't actually making a case by saying that, you are simply telling someone like me to take it up the butt.  
  
I dont care about the sense of community a dense neighborhood can bring because there was a far better and more comfortable sense of community when it was the old dynamic. They don't tip in restaurants in Japan, we do here, why? I don't f*cking know but past implementations show it doesn't work for us. That doesn't mean we should deal with unpaid waiters anyway.  

  
Maybe the problem with America is people like you who are generally antisocial and don't give a damn about who is next to them. They take anyone and everyone and don't bother getting to know their neighbors because everything is strictly business. Just look straight ahead, enter the elevator, press the button and spend the evening watching Netflix.

"There has definitely been a shift in demographic but it's completely anecdotal.  
  
I just know that the white folks who were here were old washington native families.  
Now you know there are more white people coming here because the white population looks younger. They are in their 20s and early 30s and all over the place. While the ethnic families are mostly here from the Microsoft immigration boom years ago because they are either middle aged or young children.
  
I think redmond is losing its ethnic charm as someone who felt more fitting in that environment. Now it's mostly wealthy caucasian young people in the recreational environments and they are from Seattle which makes things feel a little more divided.

"I like your input on the town. The redmond feeling is definitely still there, it just a ton more strangers in it and the demographic seems to actually be getting ""whiter"" which is a little unusual to me. I think that can explained by how the town is attracting more people with money and not just tech endeavors.  
  
I'm going to have to disagree with you on your point about tech companies. You don't have to find a way to like them if they happen to be paying you. Your paragraph on it sounded like an advert to be honest. Who in the world thinks gigantic companies run on just software devs? If you want to control people and observe their private lives you need to be in every sector.
  
It doesn't matter if someone draws doodles or flies planes, if you are getting paid by Microsoft you are working for an ultimately evil organization. Same with the other tech giants. I know at least 3 folks working for these, 1 a PhD and former professor. Right from the horses mouth. They don't event grant these companies trust, they simply use them for the wage and hop around every 2 years before they get too sucked in or laid off out of the blue and screwed over. Many people in these are also floaters because believe it or not you can make a ton of money doing jack sh*t, especially with MS which had a major brain drain after the dot com crash.  
  
You need to read up on the ethics of software and intellectual freedom in the modern age. Microsoft has done the world of technological freedom a lot of damage. Not to mention how the people they pull in they basically turn into single-purpose Microsoft machines. Give yourself a few decades in one of these environments and you will realize your value as a developer has been reduced to interfacing with an entirely propriety development environment and any virtues you had as a talented student of technology is entirely suited for the company.  
  
So no. It's not a big ol ray of sunshine. Matter of fact it's quite creepy. I assume you are getting paid so no blaming you, I would take the salary too. A lot of these companies need to be whipped into shape before we give them any more praise or even worse, trust.",t2_jin9o77d,disgruntlo,0,1644427969.0,0,t1_hw90clh,hw90clh,False,disgruntlo,t3_soclhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/redmond/comments/soclhp/how_many_years_would_you_bet_until_redmond_turns/,How many years would you bet until redmond turns into bellevue?,/r/redmond/comments/soclhp/how_many_years_would_you_bet_until_redmond_turns/hw90clh/,-1,r/redmond,0,-1

"> Especially the part about boiling a pot of water - gas is by *far* the fastest.

...What?

I've had gas, electric, and now an induction stove. Gas was, by far, the longest to boil water, even on highest setting with the burner that specifically advertised as a ""power burner"" and shown as boiling water for pasta. That's just wrong.

> It took a little over 4 minutes to boil water on an induction cooktop. That was three minutes faster than on an electric coil (about 7 minutes), and four full minutes faster than on the gas range (about 8 minutes).

"I lived in San Jose, bordering on Santa Clara for a while and between the two towns, I prefer Redmond with a few caveats:

* You will get better weather down in Santa Clara. When I first interviewed down there on Valentines day, the people walking around were in shorts. In February. It has about 11 months a year of beautiful weather, which is probably twice what Redmond gets.
* Nature buffs would definitely be better off in Redmond. There are a ridiculous amount of hiking trails, a lot of camping grounds within a reasonable drive, and it was set up to be much more wooded than most towns of the same size. It is one of the weird places where you can feel like you are completely in a metropolitan area and 15 minutes drive later, you feel like you are in the middle of the woods without a sound of a car heard. I have even read of single people complaining that the only way to meet new people was to say that you love to go hiking.
* The only place that I recall that you can sail without owning the sailboat was the Waterfront Activity Center (WAC) at UW. You had to be a member of the sailing club, but if you are passionate about it, you won't mind the commute there and will be able to engage in it. If you like scuba diving, there is a large group called the Sound Bouys that dives in the Puget Sound.
* I can't comment on indoor shooting ranges, as I never went nor knew anyone who engaged in that. I know they exist.

"Washington is a 100% saner/better state, said as somebody who has lived and worked in both.

No income tax.

Must-grant concealed carry permits.

Much closer to nature, the Cascades are amazing for hiking, skiing, and camping.

Challenges tend to be too much water vs California's not enought water.

The state doesn't tend to turn the power off because of fear of fires.

If you want a California-style experience, Eastern Washington is ~2,hours by car.

Seattle is at the latitude of Paris!
Vancouver (Canada) and Portland (Oregon) are fun nearby visits (assuming Covid finally goes away).

San Francisco/Bay area is a couple of hour flight, extremely common to the point flights are called the 'Nerd Bird' because of all the tech types on them.

Light rail between Redmond and Seattle/Seattle Airport is under construction now completing in a few years - walk from the apartment you mentioned to the train station, ride to Bellevue or Seattle or the airport!

I highly recommend Washington over California.

Downsides:

We have four seasons, which confuses California types. Sometimes a fifth (smoke) but that is a wash with California.

You will need a car, preferrably a four wheel/all wheel drive, unless you hate nature or have friends who will drive you. Also a wash with California.

Washington is literally the Pacific Northwest... it is far to fly/drive to get places as all of the US (less Alaska and Hawaii) are south/southwest. That said,you can drive to some *amazing* places like Glacier or Yellowstone national parks in 20ish hours.

Politics is like Everywhere in the US, stupid. Drive 30 minutes outside the urban core and it is extremely red/Republican, while the core is just as extremelu blue/Democrat/woke. As a foreigner new to the space, shut your mouth and listen for a while to learn how to code switch between the two... the Democrats keep trying to make the state more like California (such as tax and zero gun rights) and the Republicans are not any better, just opposite and crazy. Nobody seema to get a low tax state where you can get an AR, and abortion, a concealed carry carry permit, a college education, a 30 or 50 or hundred round magazine, a great tech/biotech/business/aerospace/STEM job, and a drink is the best possible world.

"I've lived in both areas! Technically San Jose, but near Santa Clara, and Kirkland instead of Redmond, but I think I can weigh in. Both will have what you're looking for in terms of hobbies and the salary is pretty good for both. You will have more money in Redmond because cost of living is a bit lower and there is no state income tax. 

If I were you, I would pick Redmond because I find it a nicer lifestyle. Everything you like is closer. The area is less crowded and less traffic compared to Santa Clara. People drive better. Lower crime rate. The nature is nicer because the rain keeps things alive and growing. Lots of dead grass in Santa Clara. 

I'd say Santa Clara has better weather, usually warm and sunny. Redmond will be cool and rainy for half the year. I also think Santa Clara has better food options in the area. 

Overall though I'd say Redmond is the way to go.

"If you like living in an area surrounded by mountains and pristine nature, Redmond is a great choice.

The problem with many areas in Cailfornia including Santa Clara, is the horrendous air quality due to automobile pollution and never-ending forrest fires.

The climate in the summer and early fall in the Redmond area can't be beat. The winter is another story.  It tends to be gray and misty throughout the entire winter.  The only plus is that the temperature hovers around mid 40s F to 50 F, allowing you to still get outside.

If being surrounded by well-educated tech professionals is important to you, Redmond feels like heaven.  I live in Sammamish (the next town over) and our neighborhood  is filled with engineers and other tech professionals. It's the best neighborhood I have ever lived in, full of considerate, friendly, courteous people.  This place feels like a sanctuary from the rest of the crazy America that you see on TV full of idiot, racist, Trump supporters, and anti-vaxers. Close to 40% of the people here come from Asia(India/China) making it a very welcoming, safe, and tolerant area of the country.

"You can absolutely do hiking, nature, and gun stuff in the Redmond area, and 150k is good money (as long as the free rent thing is permanent. It's probably not quite enough to live on if you ever have to pay for housing here.)

Will you have a vehicle? I'm sure you can get to sailing places if so.

The condos across from downtown Park are nice and new, and there are tons of great eateries within walking distance. We also have the British Pantry across the street, and World Market down the road, which might sell some European treats you miss from home. 

The one thing you might not like, that Santa Clara does better, is the weather. It's pretty dreary here most of the year, which is the chief complaint of new immigrants. Santa Clara is sunny, bright, and also has some good hikes nearby. SC is a bit more expensive, however.

After the 2009 pandemic, several U.S. studies among 2 through 17-year-olds found that the nasal spray vaccine was as effective against influenza B viruses and influenza A(H3N2) viruses as inactivated influenza vaccines, but was less effective than inactivated flu vaccines against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. These data led ACIP and CDC to recommend against use of the nasal spray vaccine for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons.

Since the 2017-2018 season, the manufacturer of nasal spray vaccine has used new influenza A(H1N1) vaccine virus ingredients in production.  Because of limited use, there have been no effectiveness estimates in the United States since LAIV was recommended again in the 2018-2019 influenza season. Data from other countries have demonstrated protection from LAIV to be similar to that of standard-dose, egg-based inactivated flu vaccine in children.",t2_7t5o9,KevinCarbonara,0,1640793731.0,0,t1_hqf7wjp,hqf7wjp,False,KevinCarbonara,t3_rqmlmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/redmond/comments/rqmlmc/anyone_know_of_a_place_with_the_flumist_vaccine/,Anyone know of a place with the Flumist vaccine in stock?,/r/redmond/comments/rqmlmc/anyone_know_of_a_place_with_the_flumist_vaccine/hqf7wjp/,0,r/redmond,0,0

"Many people have heard of Spark Pizza that is currently in 8110 164th Ave Ne. It is right next to Luke Apartments and Chase Bank. However. What many people don't know about is that Spark Pizza was not the only tenant here. Over the last 25 years, there have been FIVE other tenants that used to hose their business here, and they were all restaurants.  
  
Before 1994, this building was a single-family residential house built in 1907. It was converted into a restaurant building in 1994, for the first tenant.  
  
In 1994, Cynthia and Robert moved to Redmond. Robert was known for being a head chef at a well-known Los Angeles restaurant, while Cynthia was known for her customer service and her art. As husband and wife, they both opened Country Garden Bistro in 1995, a French Bistro restaurant. Not much is known about this restaurant, except for it being in business in over 10 years, before in 2005, being closing by selling the business to Toni Monroe. They were thinking about moving to somewhere along the Sammamish Plateau, but plans never came to fruition.   
  
In 2005, the next restaurant in this building, Taste the Moment, opened up. It was a French restaurant and tea room. It was similar to Country Garden Bistro, as the former owner of the bistro mentions, but it had some differences. This restaurant only lasted for 5 years, as it closed in 2010 for non-specified reasons.  
  
In 2011, Graces 5 opened in the former space of Taste the Moment by Timothy and Katherine Sharpe. It was a organic restaurant mixed with many different types of organic food. It received positive reception, as many companies like Hopelink helped with it, and it also received many awards. However, in 2012, the restaurant shuttered due to over $30,000 worth of unpaid taxes Timothy didn't give.  
  
In 2013, Hugo's Restaurant opened in the space that used to occupy Graces 5. Hugo Tapia was the founder of this restaurant, and wanted it to be similar to Graces 5. It was a organic restaurant with many food to eat, just like Graces 5. Just like Graces 5, the restaurant received good reception, and it stood opened for longer than Grace 5. In 2018, the restaurant closed down due to unknown reasons that I can't find. The building stood vacant until 2019, and I remember walking past the building numerous times.  
  
In 2019, another restaurant opened inside the building, and still is currently opened to this day. Spark Pizza, owned by the owners of Woodblock, opened inside the building. It is a Italian Pizzeria that is fancy and comfortable for anyone who wants to eat there. In the menu, the names of the food are references of restaurants that used to lie around Redmond, like Frankie's' Pizza, which closed in 2016 to be turned into Hilton Garden Inn. Spark Pizza is immensely popular to this day and many people visit the restaurant. From what I heard, it temporarily closed due to Covid-19, but it might be reopened again.

"ProClub - yes they have my vaccination status saved and require masks. My membership ends with the year as I'm living part time in Arizona and they won't pause membership. Also, IMHO I've experienced much better gyms in that category for less money. 

On the other end of the price spectrum, Planet Fitness (Woodinville) also saved my vaccination status and requires masks, compliance is 90% or so on masks.

I've been doing a trial at f45 and was disappointed they never asked about vaccination status and members only wear masks when coming and going not while working out, some not even that. IMHO I'd be ok with the mask policy if they were checking vaccination status. I loved the workouts, coaches and everything else about it.

"24 Hour Fitness checked our vaccination status back in November IIRC and noted it on our account so when we scan in they see it. I haven't seen them ask anyone for proof lately but I suspect 99.9% have already provided it. 

Mask compliance is a whole 'nother situation. While the majority wear their mask, there are those who after 2 years still haven't got the memo that you're supposed to cover your nose. Then there a few asshats who put it on at checkin and after that it becomes a chin diaper. It pisses me off but I take solice that everyone's status has been checked and is ""supposedly"" vacinated. As it is, to lower risk we go during off times and if it starts getting to busy or there are too many idiots we just leave. 

I think if you want the highest compliance possible you should probably get a membership at the ProClub.
