Your absolutely right. People around here drive like they are in some giant city and the roads aren't wide. I'm not sure what it is but this place attracts tons of bad drivers. People might come here for the mountains but several seasons they have had to shut down camping spots and trails because of overuse. The medical care is hit or miss true but the pay at the local hospital is one of the lowest in the state. Pardee pays their nurses next to nothing. As for the crime part its rampant now and it use to be an Asheville thing but now because of all the migration and all the houses that are bought but only used once a year people are breaking in and stealing like its the end of the world. Most people around here were conservatives but I remember the mayor 2 years ago canceled the thanksgiving parade because of covid but then turned around and had a trans parade.

"There's a solid thirties/forties demographic here. I'd say the majority of people are senior citizens. From what I understand, this is/was a popular retirement area.

There are a lot of breweries and hiking/biking trails here. I've heard the hunting and fishing seasons are good as well although I no longer participate in those sports so I haven't tried that here.

Jobs-wise, retail, hotel hospitality, and foodservice employment opportunities seem to be a dime a dozen. You may have to consider employment in Asheville or Greenville if those don't appeal to you. While there have been some manufacturing opportunities in the area, and they advertise as needing full-time help immediately, they're not great at responding to potential employee inquiries.

I'm not sure where you're coming from, but there were some big changes for me to adjust to after my move:

\-You need to be on alert when driving *at all times*. I've never seen such atrocious driving. I'm not in the least sarcastic when I say that watching someone run a red light, attempt to merge into another car, drive without headlights in the dark, refuse to use turn signals, can't/won't turn off brights for oncoming cars. and trundling along at 10-15mph below the speed limit are daily occurrences. Best to avoid going out in the rain or snow because what little driving skills people might possess completely vanish in those conditions. You'll also need to be cautious and leave a lot of room if a school bus is stopped and you're in the oncoming lane (so facing the bus) because I've had two drivers just ignore the bus's stop sign and whip around it as if school bus stop alerts aren't ""real."" Another traffic note is that this city has grown past the capacity of what the roads can really handle so a lot of patience is required when you're driving. It's not uncommon to sit through a light two or three times with only a handful of cars ahead of you because of heavy flow. This lets up somewhat after tourist season (summer-mid fall) but can still be stop-and-go rather than consistent at rush hours, school drop-off/pick-up times and on the weekends.

\-The housing market is very high right now. You'll likely end up overpaying what your home is worth.

\-The farmers' markets and craft fairs are really nice. There are a lot of talented growers and crafters here.

\-Medical care can be hit or miss. There are really long wait times to be seen for non-emergency services. I'm booked four months out for a physical.

\-Vet care, if you have pets, can be hard to find. A lot of places aren't taking new clients right now, and once you are an established client, many do not leave room in their schedules for emergency situations, so you'll be directed to an emergency clinic where the cost of care is double-triple what an emergency trip to your vet would be. A few people I've discussed this with have said that it's a recent development due to the influx of ""pandemic pets"" and they are working from open-close on regular appointments and don't have the luxury of squeezing in emergency cases.

\-If you have pets that like to be outdoors, be aware of your neighbors' pet situations. There are tons of loose dogs here and they have no compunctions about wandering onto others' property. Mostly they're a nuisance, but on the off chance that they're aggressive or territorial, you want to be sure yours are safe. A fence would be your best bet, since it's an entirely foreign concept to people who live in the more rural areas of town that their animals should not have free run wherever they please.

\-There's been an uptick in break-ins and thefts over the past year although I doubt that's exclusive to this area. A few security cameras could be beneficial to helping deter that behavior.

\-From what I've encountered, the social/political views of the area are around 60/40 Republican/Democrat. Most people are quite civil if not friendly in person, but a lot of political vitriol gets spread on the community social media pages and local news social media pages.",t2_9ob5ml41,MiskatonicUAlum,0,1637098700.0,0,t1_hkwmslh,hkwmslh,True,d-moses,t3_quzkuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/quzkuk/demographics/,Demographics,/r/hendersonville/comments/quzkuk/demographics/hkwmslh/,4,r/hendersonville,0,4

"Unfortunately housing around here is really difficult. There’s way more demand than supply. Most bigger apartment complexes don’t allow more than 2 pets and have breed restrictions. We had to not entirely tell the truth about our pets in order to get in. Your pit doesn’t look like it could pass as anything else, but I did see people with obvious pits at the apartment I lived in that didn’t allow them. I think it’s more of a liability thing that actually strictly prohibiting them. 

Keep scouring Facebook marketplace for rentals and looking for signs as you’re going around town. Those are probably the best ways to find a place.

Almost forgot to mention that like… we have money. We work. Affording a place isn’t a problem because both of us together make over 5g a month right now, he is working two jobs with literally no days off, and I’m working 5 days a week, 40 hours, $15p/h

We also have a friend of ours that’s looking for a place to live, he’s only 19 though but he’s working 40 hours a week at $12p/h, so if possible we wouldn’t mind him living with us so he has a place to stay and it’s not like he’s lazy he’s working at the place my BF works on the weekends. And if that extra income helps us get a place then that’s great, it’s just that we’re all relatively young and have no rental history, but we’re all on the verge of going homeless with very little options.

The felony~~~ 

Long story short, my boyfriend was on a trip to Tampa with his dad helping him with some work, this is 6 years ago before we even met, so my bf was 21 at this time like I am now. They worked all day, then went out for some drinks, apparently my bf had gotten BLASTED like blackout drunk and they started arguing, my bf ended up storming out of the bar and trying to walk back to the house they were staying at during the job. He ended up one or two streets over, at the right house in the line but just the wrong street basically, because he was drunk! He tried to open the door but it wouldn’t work, he said he knocked, accidentally broke the screen door handle somehow, and ended up passing out in the lawn. It sounds pretty funny right? The elderly couple that lived there didn’t even want to press charges, they just wanted him to replace the screen door handle. So my boyfriend did! There was no bad feelings. 

Florida state decided to pick up the case and press charges FOR ATTEMPTED BURGLARY AND ATTEMPTED BREAKING AND ENTERING. 

My boyfriends family didn’t live in Tampa they lived over an hour away so after like 3 weeks of him being in jail and his dad not being able to afford bail his dad had to go back home and he was left alone in jail for 3 months awaiting trail just really scared basically, and his public defender did basically nothing to help him and he was told he basically had to accept this deal and say he was guilty and he had his license revoked and was on probation for 4+ years, it has totally ruined his life, obviously, it’s hard for him to find work, hard for him to find a place to live (obviously), but it’s just so ridiculous because once you meet him you realize he’s not some scary fucking criminal.

like he’s a lanky 5’11 blonde boy with diabetes and a cleft lip and palette. It’s fucking ridiculous to think he would try and rob a house. At 21, drunk as a sailer, didn’t even have a beard back then he has total baby face. I’ve seen the photos it’s just fucking sad to see how shitty the legal system or treatment of people in the legal system has gotten, especially the poor? Like they knew that he couldn’t afford a lawyer, but that he would be trying his best to pay all the fees that accompany all of the shit he went through. They ended up making over $4000 off of him over the course of his arrest and then probation and him getting his license reinstated n shit. 

So yeah, my boyfriend is a felon. For basically no other reason than he didn’t have a paid lawyer to prove that at most he should have been charged with like destruction of private property or something. Not attempted burglary.",t2_3qisddyb,big-basket-of-trash,0,1631631031.0,0,t1_hctr2lk,hctr2lk,True,big-basket-of-trash,t3_pla2h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/pla2h9/house_apt_camper_trailer_anything_for_rent_that/,"House, apt, camper, trailer, anything for rent that would accept my pets, bad credit, and a felony.",/r/hendersonville/comments/pla2h9/house_apt_camper_trailer_anything_for_rent_that/hctr2lk/,1,r/hendersonville,0,1

I personally have no credit history at all, which I’ve been told is even worse than having bad credit. I’ve never owned a credit card, So hopefully at least. Because my BF had bad credit before he even owned one, since his late grandmother stole his info to get cable and then never payed the bills, so since he was underage he’s had terrible credit. 

Even after finally getting a credit card and working on it for 1.5 years now his credit is still only at around 460-ish right now? So not good. 

But let’s be honest that’s not his fault that his dead grandma ruined his credit, right?",t2_3qisddyb,big-basket-of-trash,0,1631627890.0,0,t1_hctjnxm,hctjnxm,True,big-basket-of-trash,t3_pla2h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/pla2h9/house_apt_camper_trailer_anything_for_rent_that/,"House, apt, camper, trailer, anything for rent that would accept my pets, bad credit, and a felony.",/r/hendersonville/comments/pla2h9/house_apt_camper_trailer_anything_for_rent_that/hctjnxm/,1,r/hendersonville,0,1

Me (21yo F) and my BF (27yo M) have been together almost 2 years now. We met in Florida right before covid started. We were both working at the same restaurant and quickly hit it off and moved in together. In Florida we were staying with this other couple, who at first it was fine but it just got worse as time went on. They beat their dog, or just locked it up in the dark bedroom for hours and then got angry at it when it pissed and shit inside, like idk maybe take her for a walk that lasts longer than literally a minute? They also neglected their leopard gecko to the point that stuck shed was cutting off circulation to his fingers and after I intervened one day and removed it I realized that 4 of his fingers had basically already rotted away underneath the stuck shed. It was really sad. We argued with them a lot, they were constantly yelling at each other, living with them really sucked basically but we didn’t have any options around us that we could afford or get accepted into, so that’s why we ended up leaving for North Carolina, to be around my bf’s family and have some help.

Moving in with my bf to that house was the first time I wasn’t living with my family. Which was great because I literally moved to get away from my mother, who I don’t really talk to anymore. 

But my point is that while living there I was paying rent to the couple that we lived with, and so was my BF, so we weren’t on the lease, the landlord knew we were there but we weren’t on the lease. So no rental history, no rental history here in NC either other than maybe the one month we stayed in the trailer when we first got up here, the one owned by extended family that had the lot sold underneath them. And that literally just a month, but it’s the only time that me and my BF can say that we ever rented our own home.",t2_3qisddyb,big-basket-of-trash,0,1631627349.0,0,t1_hctigip,hctigip,True,big-basket-of-trash,t3_pla2h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/pla2h9/house_apt_camper_trailer_anything_for_rent_that/,"House, apt, camper, trailer, anything for rent that would accept my pets, bad credit, and a felony.",/r/hendersonville/comments/pla2h9/house_apt_camper_trailer_anything_for_rent_that/hctigip/,1,r/hendersonville,0,1

Me and my boyfriend moved here about 6 months ago, and ever since we did we have moved like 4 times. The first trailer we moved into was owned by an extended family member, but the land they had it on got sold and the new owners were charging too much in lot rent for it to be worth it for them to keep the trailer, it was in kind of bad condition with a window broken and floor problems and such, but it was still better than being homeless. 

We had a month after moving up here to find another place to live, and we didn’t so we had to move in with my BF’s mom. We stayed for about 3 weeks before we lucked out and got to stay with a work friend for the past like 4.5 months, but she’s going through a divorce and it just got too complicated as they fought over the trailer so we had to move back in with my boyfriends mom again. We have all our shit in storage and we’re living out of storage bins, sleeping on an air mattress in the living room for almost a month. 

I should also add that we’re only supposed to stay here 2 weeks but since we have no other place to go we don’t really have a choice, but the longer we stay the more risk we are putting towards his parents getting in trouble with their landlord, because they aren’t supposed to have dogs at their house. And we have two. Our cats are staying with a friend until we can find out if we have to give them away or if we will be able to take them with us when we move in somewhere, which we are really hoping for but I know it’s unlikely.",t2_3qisddyb,big-basket-of-trash,0,1631626368.0,0,t1_hctgbtw,hctgbtw,True,big-basket-of-trash,t3_pla2h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/pla2h9/house_apt_camper_trailer_anything_for_rent_that/,"House, apt, camper, trailer, anything for rent that would accept my pets, bad credit, and a felony.",/r/hendersonville/comments/pla2h9/house_apt_camper_trailer_anything_for_rent_that/hctgbtw/,1,r/hendersonville,0,1
"Forethought: I just started ranting basically. Sorry about the length but TLDR moving here has been one of the worst decisions I’ve made so far in my life. 

Me and my boyfriend moved up here from Florida to be around his family that moved here 1.5-1 year ago, we’ve been here for roughly 6 months and have had to move 4 times. As if finding a house wasn’t hard enough, keeping one is too apparently. First place was a trailer when we first got up here and within that same month they decided to sell the land and the new property manager didn’t like pitbulls, and we weren’t getting rid of our 9yo boy, so we went to stay with my bfs mom. Then we lucked out for a few months staying with a new work friend, but she’s going through a divorce and it got complicated and we couldn’t stay there anymore, so back to my bfs moms house we went. 

Now we’re stuck with no place again because everywhere has breed restrictions or no pets, but like he’s NINE YEARS OLD (if he hasn’t had a problem being a vicious evil creature from hell at this point, how is he gonna start now?)  and we have a 3yo shihtzu/toy poodle that is meaner than he is, not that either of them are mean it’s just for comparison. 

So now we’re stuck with his mom, as I said, but we can only stay here for another week because if we stay longer than 2 than they are violating thier lease, because their house doesn’t allow dogs either. 

We’re probably going to have to pay upwards of $350 a week for a hotel or something just until we can find a place to actually LIVE in. It’s just so ridiculous it’s not even funny. 

We also have two kittens staying with a friend right now because we’re not sure if we’re going to be able to keep them, even though I literally saved their lives and bottle fed them and bonded with them for the past 5 months. 

Moving up here has literally…just fucked our lives up. I don’t even know how else to put it. Me and my bf have been going through so much shit just trying to get a house and keep our pets and have our family together. I want to go back to school to become a vet, hence why we have so many pets, and it hurts so much to not be able to provide for them as I feel I should. I’m working a full 36hrs+ at Outback for $15 an hour and thier short staffed as fuck so if I pick up extra shifts I’m making 30p/h in overtime, AND my bf is working TWO JOBS with NO DAYS OFF and we’re making over 5gs a month now combined, and still no fkn luck. 

Because again they don’t give a shit about money they care about credit and dogs. I’ve never owned a credit card. My boyfriends credit got ruined by his grandma when she didn’t pay cable bills that she opened up in his name when he was still underage, so his credit has been horrible since before he even had a credit card, and even with two years of working on bringing it up it’s still at only around 460. 

Young people can’t catch a break, I’m hating my life because my pets are my life and if I don’t have them and can’t provide a stable home for them I feel like a horrible person and irresponsible even though I’m really not and I know that but just…it’s been horrible.",t2_3qisddyb,big-basket-of-trash,0,1631224912.0,0,t1_hc8hly1,hc8hly1,True,RiotGirlHeather,t3_p8kpki,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/p8kpki/why_is_it_so_expensive_to_live_in_hendersonville/,Why is it so Expensive to Live in Hendersonville?,/r/hendersonville/comments/p8kpki/why_is_it_so_expensive_to_live_in_hendersonville/hc8hly1/,2,r/hendersonville,1,2

In terms of allergies, it would depend on what her sensitivities are. There is a massive pollening in the spring. The tree pollen is so thick it coats cars in a yellow residue.  Using A/C and an air filter inside can really help.  Molds and fungi can also be an issue as it rains a lot and is generally humid.  Again, using A/C and an air cleaner will help a lot.

Power outages are definitely a thing. I would make sure she has a generator just in case.

Pardee is the main hospital in town. I think they are very decent and, since Mission in Asheville is cutting down on their primary care business, Pardee has been building in that area.

"hi...having visited Hendersonville last week for three nights, my response wont be as accurate as residents' but I can tell you I did see several Trump signs (why anyone would have these well after his term is beyond me but so be it). We live north of Payson, AZ and I understand completely your sentiments regarding Trump country. I will say that I never ever felt a political presence one way of another while visiting Hendersonville.

All that said, since we are coordinating a move too, can I ask you about  the logistics of your move? Are you using a major company (allied, united, etc) or a smaller outfit, Pods, UHaul etc. I'm honestly curious since the act of moving has me slightly petrified.

"We moved here 7 years ago from the Chicago area.  I've never had a good experience with a major moving company, so I was looking for an alternative.

We had 3 bedrooms, a living room, a formal dining room, a breakfast room, a double car garage full of stuff, many boxes of dishes, and a ton of miscellaneous stuff.

We ended up using ABF Upack. They will deliver hard sided pods to you (no cost for delivery or pickup).  You lock the pods with your own padlocks. They can arrange for movers to help you load and unload.  They will help you estimate how many pods you need and they'll even deliver extra for no charge if you don't use them. 

They delivered the pods on time, picked them up on time, and redelivered them on time.  They provided great movers on both ends.

Not a single item was damaged in transit or in the loading or unloading.  We also had some really heavy stuff and the movers didn't bat an eye at loading/unloading it.

We did rent a Uhaul truck in which we packed our fragile stuff, valuables, electronics, and clothing.  We also had to put our sofa in the Uhaul because it was too long for the pod.

It was also cheaper than the major moving companies.  I think we paid $5000 for everything.  We had 10 pods full of stuff.  The movers were an extra $600 ($300 on each end).",t2_lafhh,awhq,0,1625442184.0,0,t1_h42r8k6,h42r8k6,True,boulderskies1953,t3_odtgto,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/odtgto/moving_logistics/,Moving Logistics,/r/hendersonville/comments/odtgto/moving_logistics/h42r8k6/,2,r/hendersonville,0,2

Morris was bought out by optimum recently FYI. They’re offering me 200mbps for the same price as what I pay for 25 from AT&T. They might have a good offer for you but you might have to wait as you said.

"My husband and I retired to Hendersonville 7 years ago.

It's gorgeous all year round.  The weather rarely gets to extremes.  We can have our house open all day for a good 6 months of the year and open for part of the day for another 3 months.

The humidity is bad.  (I grew up in central Texas).  Many of the homes we looked at smelled badly of mildew.  My husband wanted a basement but after smelling those homes, we chose a home without one.  We often use our A/C just to dry our house out, not because it's too hot.

The pollen is really, really bad.  Your car and window screens will be covered in thick yellow pollen in the spring.  My husband started getting allergy shots for the first time in his life.  They help a lot.

Hendersonville is a nice little town, but it is a tourist town.  We don't like many of the restaurants here.  They are overpriced and the quality is not up to par in our opinion.  We've found Asheville to be the same way.  We often go to Greenville to eat out.  It's about an hour away.  In the last two years, there have been more moderately priced places opening.  For the first 5 years, we had 5 places we'd go to.  Now we have 8.  Most of those are fast food/diner type places.  There is no anniversary type restaurant we like.  

There is a Sam's Club here, but the nearest Costco is in Greenville.

I've found most of the locals to be really nice.  Some of the transplants are not so nice.

Dogs.  All the dogs.  It's hard to get the noise ordinances enforced.  There are at least 5 dogs within earshot of our house that bark a lot.  One neighbor lets his dog bark all day, every day.  It's a hound so it bays rather than barks.  There are many days we close our house and turn on the air because of the noise.

Mountain driving is more difficult than you might think.  Traffic can be heavy because of tourists.  People regularly go under the speed limit, don't use turn signals, and don't turn on their lights when it rains.  The most dangerous problem is people crossing the double yellow line on the narrow mountain roads.  I've been run completely off the road 3 times in my own neighborhood.  That's bad enough when there is a shoulder to go on but a lot of these roads have steep drop offs.  Downtown Asheville is about 30 miles from where I live.  It often takes a full hour to get there.

Flying anywhere from here can take longer than you may be used to.  Asheville has a regional airport and Greenville has an international airport.  My daughter who lives in Austin can't get to Greenville in less than 5 hours and at least one plane change.  My son who lives in Chicago can get a direct flight to Greenville that takes 3 1/2 hours.  I wanted to go with some girlfriends to Vegas for a long weekend.  I ended up not going because it was going to take 8 hours to get there and 8 to get back.

Health care is in flux here.  There is one major hospital (Mission) that was just bought by HCA. They've been losing doctors for over a year.  All my doctors have left.  They've been replaced by Physician Assistants.  On the upside, Hendersonville has Pardee Hospital and it's growing.  Many of the doctors who left Mission have gone to Pardee.  The support staff here (nurses, techs) are not as well educated as I'm used to.

Gas and groceries here are more expensive than where I lived before (Chicago area), but everything else is cheaper.

The electricity goes out quite a bit.  Trees fall on lines and it can take a few hours for them to fix it.  The longest we've been without power is 18 hours.  A lot of people have generators.

You asked about keeping the lawn mowed.  Most people in my neighborhood don't have lawns.  The lots are forested so you may find yourself blowing leaves instead of mowing grass.

We do get forest fires.  There haven't been any near Hendersonville since I lived here, but we do have periods of drought.

The state runs hard alcohol sales through ABC stores.  It's easy to get regular stuff but if you have a favorite specialty liquor, you may not be able to get it.  You can't have alcohol shipped here.

There is a personal property tax so in addition to paying for a car inspection and registration each year, you will pay property tax on your vehicles.

My husband loves it here.  If I could find a place where the weather is as nice and the area is as beautiful, I'd move tomorrow.",t2_lafhh,awhq,0,1621376694.0,0,t1_gymjjej,gymjjej,True,boulderskies1953,t3_ndnsvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/ndnsvi/retiree_living_in_hendersonville/,Retiree Living in Hendersonville,/r/hendersonville/comments/ndnsvi/retiree_living_in_hendersonville/gymjjej/,1,r/hendersonville,0,1

"North Carolina doesn’t offer discrimination protection on the basis of being LBGT+. Buncombe County (Asheville) is passing a local ordinance to offer such protection. For you, Henderson County (Hendersonville) will not have this protection. You might want to check the Employee Manual for your new job. I don’t think you will run into a problem at work but do you homework.

The Gay Community is spread out across the geographic area and generally is open. I think that’s a good sign of acceptance. Otherwise, we would likely have gay neighborhoods. There are a lot of married, gay male couples in the area. There’s a lot of single, eligible men. There are no gay bars in Hendersonville and the Asheville gay bars are there. Meet-Up App is used often for event coordination in the gay community.

Crime is very low here. And, there’s been no hate crimes targeting gay people that come to mind.

My husband and I have been inpatients at Mission Hospital (Asheville). There's never been a problem with him or I having visitation access or decision-making access if something happened. That level of security is really important.

You will face a lot more bias with people who are local for being out-of-state, especially if you say anything (even if it’s helpful) starting with “in New York, we….” You are in the South and people just want to be unabashedly themselves. If you want your Pride Flag on your house, I don’t think anyone will care. But, you are going to see a Trump flag on a house or truck or whatever. A local’s expectation is you should reciprocate and not care.

I’ve seen very few inter-racial gay male couples. It’s very, very Caucasian here. I don’t know of a gay couple that moved here, said “we hate it” and moved out of the area. I know two couples who made a huge sum of money selling their homes in Asheville and thought Florida was their next place.

You'll have to let me know what part of New York. We have a gay male friend from upstate New York in Henderson County. I am happy to introduce you to him. If you are from New York City, Hendersonville closes down around 10/11 PM or so and that's a challenge for people who have expectations to be able to order what-they-want-when-they-want-it.

"Retirees are not treated like second class citizens. Retirees are integrated/welcomed into almost every activity. Most Retirees have incredibly active lives until either the mind or the body gives out. We celebrate our Veterans in our parades. If you wear your Military hat, I would hope you might hear ""thank you for your service"" more often than you would expect. Our news often recognizes the person who reaches 100 years old and gives us their story.

There's a festival, event, function that can keep you occupied. Most often, they are free or have a nominal cost. But, it's very important to kick-in a couple of retiree dollars if you can spare them. Local people make modest incomes and it's vital to support the local economy.

Finding good help isn't hard. You can find adults who offer services to routinely mow your yard, do electricity, handyman work, basic home health, etc. The geographic area is well-suited for taking care of the elderly. 

Your biggest challenge will be to create a support network (friends, etc.) to help you when you reach the age when you can't drive. When I worked in the Post Office, I knew all the old folks who were found in their cars, often in the ditch. They all have great support networks so people pick them up, get them where they need to go, and keep them involved. You will need to be out-going to accomplish this and it's readily available. **Kindness is paramount here.** There are plenty of retiree communities if you opt to pursue that opportunity. 

I don't know your level of income but you should consider the cost of living is increasing rapidly. It's no where near metropolitan areas but it's acutely felt by people who have fixed incomes. I would stay in Henderson County (and avoid Buncombe County/Asheville). If you have the money, do it. 

I follow the seniors at Harris Teeters Grocer. They get a 5% more bonus (or something like that) on Tuesdays. You can literally walk down the isles and see what was the cheapest, high quality item in the local paper. That jar/box/item is nearly gone. So, I buy what they buy since they did the homework!

Whatever A Person Is Into: They are REALLY Into! To illustrate one example: The Rose Society has an annual event and there was about 50+ different varieties fresh cut roses to see and smell - all arranged by plant type/hybrid - for you to experience! This is from people's backyards. You can talk to growers, ask questions, and they tell you what works, doesn't work, what seeds are available, whatever. There's a MEN'S garden club and a WOMEN'S garden club. But, the examples go well beyond roses/gardens. You get the point that you can meet/interact with folks.

"Me! Lived in AVL about ten years now have been in HVL around 7. Its definitely different but i have never had a problem. .... its changing all the time for the better. I have some very awesome progressive straight friends now. We knew our daycare options would be a little limited ( many religious facilities would not accept our son) but our feelings about that are generally we are glad to know who those folks are and dont want him going there anyway- so thanks for letting us know! I would probably avoid the Edneyville area and were advised that by our realtor at the time as well. We started out close to town and now live out in the country past Flat Rock- everyone is nice - to our face anyway. We have very few neighbors but one is the best we have ever had and she watches Fox news all day everyday but we have grown very close in the three years we lived out here. One other same sex couple has moved by us and i wont lie that was thrilling and we definitely help eachother out and stick together. 

I will also add that we fostered here in Henderson county and never received anything but love from HVL DSS and they even gave us an award. Oddly enough i met a gay couple at one of the foster events and they lived in Buncombe county but were switching to foster through Hendersonville bc of discrimination they experienced ( so he says) at Buncombe DSS..... that did blow my mind and i take it with a grain of salt",t2_298f4aqr,KingJJoffer,0,1620670705.0,0,t1_gxmx4di,gxmx4di,True,AgentV21,t3_n728o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/n728o5/how_do_yall_in_hendersonville_feel_about_gay/,How do y'all in Hendersonville feel about gay couples?,/r/hendersonville/comments/n728o5/how_do_yall_in_hendersonville_feel_about_gay/gxmx4di/,2,r/hendersonville,0,2

"Property crime is high.  There is a fair amount of meth in the area.

There have been a couple of home invasions in the 7 years I've lived here.

I moved here from the Chicago area so I'm no stranger to crime.  I do the same here as I did there.  I keep my car doors locked and I keep my home doors locked.

That being said, I don't hesitate to open my house up during the day if it's nice (which it often is).

I've also found that the local news sources don't always report the crime.

The town itself is nice.  I find there aren't a lot of great restaurants, but that's been improving.  Some of the ones along main street are geared toward tourists and are quite expensive.  We've tried them all and find them to just not be worth the money.

On the other hand, Greenville has some great, moderately priced restaurants and it takes about an hour to get there.  It also has the only Costco in the area.

" Here's a [transcript](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/coastal/politics/2021/01/07/nc-rep--madison-cawthorn-spoke-at-rally-before-capitol-attacked) of his speech at the rally:

>“Wow, this crowd has some fight in it. I am so thankful that each and every single one of you who’ve come.  
“I just rolled down from the Capitol building about two miles away down Pennsylvania Avenue. And I will tell you, the courage I see in this crowd is not represented on that hill.  
“My friends, I will tell you right now that there is a new Republican Party rising. The founders of our great country saw to it that the people who consent to be governed should have a voice in that government.  
“But my friends, the Democrats, with all the fraud they have done in this election, the Republicans hiding and not fighting, they are trying to silence your voice.  
“Make no mistake about it, they do not want you to be heard. But my friends, when I look out into this crowd, I can confidently say, this crowd has the voice of lions. There is a new Republican Party on the rise that will represent this country, that will go and fight in Washington D.C.  
“I’ll tell you, I see so many of my friends who are up in Congress with me who are about to go back to that Capitol Hill and at 12 o’clock today we will be contesting that election.

**RALEIGH, N.C.** — State health officials said Wednesday that at least one coronavirus case has been linked to a political rally Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest held in western North Carolina two weeks ago.

Forest, who is running for governor against Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, was kicking off early voting in the state with an Oct. 15 rally in Burnsville. The rally was billed on social media as both a ""Back the Blue"" rally for law enforcement and a ""Yancey County Trump Cruisin'"" with people parading in vehicles with flags supporting President Donald Trump.

Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate to succeed Forest as lieutenant governor, and Madison Cawthorn, the Republican candidate in the 11th Congressional District, also were to speak at the rally, according to advertisements online. Forest posted online that more than 4,000 people attended the event.

""DHHS is aware of one case associated with a person that attended a rally in Burnsville on Oct. 15,"" Kelly Haight Connor, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email. ""Local health departments conduct contact tracing, and work to identify all close contacts of any positive COVID-19 case and recommend quarantine and testing. However, not all cases can be reached or provide complete information about their activities.

""People who have attended a mass gathering of any kind, including rallies, are encouraged to get tested for COVID-19,"" she added.

Forest has questioned whether masks work to limit the spread of coronavirus, and he had openly defied the mask mandate Cooper put in effect months ago, holding numerous campaign events across North Carolina [where few people cover their faces and where there is little social distancing](https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/forest-back-on-the-campaign-trail-draws-maskless-crowd-in-statesville/19189961/) among attendees.

He and Cooper have [frequently sparred during the campaign](https://www.wral.com/pandemic-dominates-debate-between-cooper-forest/19335342/) over the governor's handling of the pandemic, with Forest calling for restrictions on businesses and social activities to be lifted so people can return to their lives while officials [take steps to protect those most at risk from the virus](https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/from-forest-a-promise-to-protect-senior-citizens-from-covid-but-no-details/19348969/).

Cawthorn campaign ad prompts questions over use of West Henderson football field

Reporter: Derek Lacey

September 23, 2020 4:29 PM

A political ad filmed at a local high school is prompting questions about how public property like a school football stadium made it into a partisan campaign advertisement.

The ad in question was produced by the campaign for Madison Cawthorn, a Hendersonville native and Republican candidate for Congress.

The camera follows Cawthorn in his wheelchair down the length of the West Henderson High football field to the end zone, where he stands up.

The stadium is easily identifiable, with clear views of West’s falcon and “W” logos, and a view of the press box with its sign reading “Home of the Falcons.”

Apparently filmed at dusk and after dark, some stadium lights are on during the video, and at the end of the ad, the scoreboard reads “2020.”

Some residents have questioned the use of a public school in a campaign ad, asking why it was allowed to be filmed there.

Henderson County Public Schools officials said the public is allowed to rent school facilities, and no public funds were used for the ad.

Cawthorn was homeschooled and didn’t attend West Henderson High.

Cawthorn spokesman John Hart said the ad was filmed Aug. 14, the setting was rented, and it was chosen because it helped to convey the story being told in the ad.

“I think what he wants to convey is he’s a fighter,” Hart said. “He’s somebody who’s going to stand up to the status quo of Washington and fight for reform.”

The school system says that, as per its policy, facilities are available for rent and in this case were rented for use by Cawthorn’s campaign.

“The school system does not endorse any political party or candidate,” Public Information Officer Molly McGowan Gorsuch said in an email statement. “Henderson County Public Schools’ facilities, including recreation fields and stadiums, may be rented when they are available, per the Henderson County Board of Public Education’s ‘Community Use of Facilities’ Policy No. 5030. Per board policy, the West Henderson High stadium was rented by ‘Cawthorn for NC’ for video production.”

According to the school system’s facilities management policy governing community use of facilities, facilities can be rented for non-school purposes but all school uses, including athletic events, choral or drama productions, have first priority.

The School Board’s policy, in accordance with North Carolina General Statutes, says school facilities may be used by political parties for the purpose of annual or biennial precinct meetings and county and district conventions with just custodial and utility fees charged.

All other groups, including political parties not meeting for those reasons, must pay any applicable rental, kitchen, utility, custodial and supervisory fees.

Ranked by priority after school uses are polling places, school-related organizations like booster clubs, political parties for their precinct meetings and conventions, local government and youth organizations, and finally “all other groups.”

McGowan Gorsuch confirmed that Cawthorn’s campaign was charged $300, according to the current fee schedule for the private, for-profit or individual rate of $50 per hour to rent a stadium field for three hours and $75 per hour for two hours of stadium lighting.

The fee for a custodian was waived, she said, as is usually the case when the time of rental falls within the hours of the night shift custodian already working his or her regular shift.

"Yeah, I can only put the counter-point out there and see it fall on many deaf ears. I am only reaching the people who want to read the information. I sent it to the Eastern Band of Cherokee reddit and noted the report talks about the four Native Americans in Congress. Screw Madison, there's better reasons to read the report. :-)

What I'm seeing: Madison reads what is being put in front of him and he takes it as ""the truth"" because he's too naïve in his crusade that youth without education can change the world. I am continuously angry because he too could google this information just like I did.

Also, what I'm seeing: We are watching the perfect ""tool"" for lobbyists to present their positions on the House floor. ""Here kid -- read this three-ring binder!"" This might happen to every politician but I am acutely aware of this concern with someone like Madison who claims financial independence. He's stupid and his one-trick pony act to stand every time he's politically cornered isn't going to last long. He is much more fit that he plays down on television.

To balance the thought: I'm angry at Moe Davis because of his stand on the Second Amendment, military assault rifles, and red flag laws. He could not name a ""bright line"" for two guns on a ban on military assault rifles: a military assault rifle and a closely related gun was not one: ""we will have to determine a definition"" has been called-out as insulting. I think that is deeply unfair to people consider his candidacy: there is no security that he would ever do ""the right thing"" (whatever that means to the gunowner community). On Red Flag Laws, Moe supports decriminalization of marijuana so people want to know if that's the first condition/priority before he would ever accept consideration of the red flag law issue. Then, there's a lot of problems with the ""red flag law"" concept that need to be ironed out. His response: It will be modeled after North Carolina's laws. 

Lots to think about and still time to ask questions.

Shocking revelation here. A politician who has lied. Gonna be hard pressed to find one anywhere that hasn’t mislead constituents to get voted in. Too many people find a way to make what they lie about for their own agenda and vote accordingly. Happens every election with every candidate. Throwing shade at what he or moe davis either one believes in and voting for them accordingly would be a better served opinion based post than claiming a politician lies.

Political Candidates MUST disclose their financial relationships so voters can look to see if there is self-interest in their policy positions.

The rules are clear and each Congressman follows them: [Financial Disclosure Statements and Periodic Transaction Reports – Instruction Guide](https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/documents/CY%202019%20Instruction%20Guide%20for%20Financial%20Disclosure%20Statements%20and%20PTRs.pdf) (House Committee on Ethics). On page 33 of the Instruction Guide, each candidate is REQUIRED to disclose relationships for the last 2 years. 

Madison Cawthorn states he is the [CEO, SPQR Holdings LLC](https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/Search/Business_Registration_profile?Id=15412336) and filed his [Financial Disclosure Report](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2020/10036587.pdf). 

Section C, D, E, and F: Madison Cawthorn has omitted information that we know now is true. For example, real estate in Georgia.

Section A: Madison Cawthorn will benefit from Capital Gains Tax. 

Please listen to the debate. Madison says “stop the personal attacks” when Moe is saying “your proposals will financially benefit you.” I am angry and sick of Madison Cawthorn’s lies. I do not tolerate Ethics Violations. This is NOT a personal attack. He has self-interest. Some people care, others don’t. But, we should know them prior to our vote.

Almost all candidates across the United States FOLLOW the rules. I am angry at the media for not calling him out and pushing for transparency. This document is in the public domain and should be published.

Moe Davis offers the public his [recent disclosure](http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2020/10036587.pdf) (6/26/2020). I don’t have information if he omitted or lied about his disclosures.

She used a phrase that sticks in my mind ""Robbing us of the closure to our childhood that most of us hadn't realized we needed.""

Her two peers:

"I would stay away from Autoworx.

We took both our cars there for 4 years.  Oil changes, brake jobs, tune-ups.  Did not have a problem.

Then I take my car in for an oil change. My car takes synthetic oil.  So I pick up my car after the oil change and go home.  As I'm filing the paperwork for the oil change (yes, I keep all my paperwork), I notice that the paperwork says they used synthetic blend oil.

So I'm concerned, and I google whether or not my car will be damaged by having a synthetic blend in it.  I can't really find anything definitive so I give Autoworx a call and the owner answers.

I explain that they put synthetic blend oil in my car when it takes full synthetic.  I went on to explain that I just needed to know if the blend would hurt my engine and if I needed to bring my car back in to have the blend removed and full synthetic put in.

First he says they always use the oil indicated on the oil cap.  So I walk out to my car while I'm on the phone with him, pop the hood and tell him what it says (it says 0w).  Then he starts asking me how I KNOW they put synthetic blend in my car.  I tell him it says so right on the paperwork.  Then he starts asking me how I KNOW it just isn't a paperwork error.

At this point, I'm done.  It's a fucking $40 oil change.  If this is the what they do when asked about a mistake they made, I don't want them working on my car any more.

I ended up calling the dealer service department and they said one oil change with blend wouldn't be a big problem but that I should change the oil in 3000 miles instead of the usual 10,000, so that's what I did.

I later found out that they didn't fill my tires to the correct PSI when they rotated them (I specifically asked that they check the inflation because the light was going on).  When I checked, my tires had been filled to 36 PSI.  They are supposed to be 51 PSI.

I wish I could write off this experience as just dealing with a lazy worker, but I was dealing with the owner.

"I think it depends on what you are looking for, it is slower than a big city or high cost of living area but is not a 'small' town.  The younger population is growing, cost of living is lower, and its in a good location for outdoor activities. If you are looking for night life or late night activities then it might not be a good fit.

Hendersonville Population ~14K (growing) - median age 45
Henderson County Population ~ 110K

Hendersonville is in a great location (IMO), close to Dupont State Forest, Pisgah NF, and Green River Game Lands.

"My husband and I just moved here about 6 months ago for his job and we love it. We are in our early 30s with one toddler, liberal foodie used to be hipster types. ;) We moved from a larger southeastern city (600k+) and love the change - doesn't seem that shockingly conservative if you are used to living in the South or older (we worried about that too). Going out to eat is affordable and there is decent food to be found, Asheville is a relatively short drive, cost of living is cheaper than Asheville...and no traffic!  Also, just all the outdoor activities and things to do here are amazing.  Seems like there is always something going on each weekend whether its an outdoor concert, festival, big farmers market, whatever... and there is so much to do outdoors - hiking, kayaking, cycling,etc.  It's been a great change for us.",t2_zrmeh,armili,0,1508180436.0,0,t1_doge35j,doge35j,True,[deleted],t3_74nmhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/hendersonville/comments/74nmhe/tell_me_about_hendersonville/,tell me about Hendersonville!,/r/hendersonville/comments/74nmhe/tell_me_about_hendersonville/doge35j/,2,r/hendersonville,0,2
Hendersonville is a great small town with a very healthy downtown area which is growing every year. Sanctuary brewery is the best brewery we have in town which is a block off of Main Street. It is “conservative” compared to Asheville but the demographic is not nearly as “old” as people state. The past few years has changed that narrative with the growth of WNC .
