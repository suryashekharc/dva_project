"Zazah is a sweet and loving dog who is the perfect medium-size. This adorable pup will steal your heart with her big puppy dog eyes and happy tail wags. Her foster reports that she is very affectionate and loves to sit on the couch for cuddles and pets. Zazah has been getting along wonderfully with her foster sister and adores her. They love to wrestle, and Zazah’s signature move is jumping from the couch to pounce on her big sister. She is still a little wary of the outside world and strangers, so she will need a patient owner who can provide treats, encouragement, and continued training to build her confidence. In return, she will provide you with unconditional love and joy.

"Thanks for sharing that plan, it looks like a good start and I'm sure it will lead to a reduction in injuries, so this is great to see.

That being said, I'm trying to zero in on why I don't feel like it addresses the entire problem.  Visibility is part of the issue, yes, but it also seems to be about street hierarchy.  It's as though Alameda can't decide where it's thoroughfares end and it's neighborhoods begin, so we end up with these hybrid corridors that are basically 35 mph freeways running through our most densely-populated residential areas.  It's not a huge surprise that these are the same high-injury corridors that the Vision Zero team identified.

Stop signs and other installations would help enforce this hierarchy by reducing speed and access.  The ""Slow Streets"" initiative for example certainly helped, but also seemed somewhat temporary.  In Berkeley they'll cut off streets with concrete planters, which might seem extreme but I'm sure is effective.

Generally I'm impressed with the support this post has received.

It’s actually not a lot to have on hand. We have ridiculous number of projects that need to be paid for (street improvements, utility undergounding, park improvements, base reuse, new dog parks, etc)

Like we don’t even have enough to finish Jean Sweeney without state funding (funding that will get pulled if the NIMBYs get their way and prevent Alameda from doing its state obligation to allow for housing which would forces our taxes higher to make up missing state funds). Hell even the pedestrian bridge we want to build would cost $200 million. A city of our size should have a lot more set aside honestly but prop 13 has been killing our cities since the 1970s and the city has had to try to make up for it with regressive sales taxes and other fees (which are a tax on the poor, not the wealthy, but it’s all the city can do).

Eh it depends. Reddit is at its core a link aggregator. Some subs ban links and only allow self posts and some only allow links. When sharing a link you can editorialize a bit in the title but then some will complain that the title isn't the same or downvote because they disagree with your editorialization. I've found it better to just post the link with the title of thing you are sharing and put your comment in the comments of the post.

"It was never as you describe. Since this sub was founded it has predominantly been links and not self posts. When I took over the sub over six years ago, self posts were disabled because of doxing. 6 years ago we averaged 3 posts a month with 2k subs. Now we average 4 posts a day (more on the weekend when the Sub publishes) with almost 14k subs. That is about average for location subs of this size for this number of subs. Literally the only rule we’ve ever had for 13 years is that a post must be relevant to Alameda and the people that live here. 4 years we scoped that to just the City of Alameda and not also Alameda County. 

News links have always been welcomed here, just as have self posts as long as they meet the first rule. If you don’t care for it just keep scrolling. Do you get mad at posts on the front page that you don’t like?

"1) this has been explained a few times before.
2) Reddit is, by design, a link aggregator. That’s what it’s for. We have a community here too, that’s why self posts are allow, but there is a space for links related to Alameda. Most of the comments are on links around news anyways. 
3) the news links shared are manually curated several times a day. Not actually entirely automated. He explained this before. Most of the news sources don’t even have RSS feeds but are manually checked like the alamedaca.gov links and the Alameda Sun.
4) the stated purpose is anything related to the City of Alameda. News links about Alameda are inherently on topic. 
5) news links have been been shared here longer than you have been a user of Reddit.
6) the community has grown dramatically because of the news posts. They are timely so people sub to see it. Reddit admins have even featured the sub a rising star because of it. The community wouldn’t be here without the relevant content in the first place
7) most of posts are tagged and you can filter. I’ll tweak automod catch the ones the are not being tagged.
8) the user you are complaining about has ran the sub for more than 6 years when the old admin moved to Utah and he has puts a lot of free time and energy to grow sub from 1k to almost 15k subs.

Dear Peeps, 
Our person in charge of our social media sent a post in error that did not accurately represent  the nature of our lease transaction at American Oak.  It was a mutually and respectfully agreed upon lease buyout between the new building owner and American Oak.  There was no hostility whatsoever.  We wish the new occupants of 2319 Santa Clara the best of luck and good fortune in the spot that served us so well.

It was doable in my experience and likely a little easier with an e-bike.

I prefer to take the bus through when I can because  going through the tube on a bike is loud, dirty, and if you aren't a skilled enough bike rider to hold a line then you will likely struggle to keep from touching the incredibly dirty wall or railing.

"> Alameda’s Architecture – Victorian-era and Craftsman-style homes
> 
> Alameda’s primary calling card is its array of Victorian-era and Craftsman-style homes. **There are no Victorians in Alameda**, but there are six styles of homes here that architects and builders conceived while Victoria sat on the throne from 1834 to 1901: Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Modern (also called Eastlake or Stick style), Queen Anne and Colonial Revival. Alameda has examples of all these styles. In addition, the Island City sparkles with various types of Craftsman-style homes. The Storybook style also shines here. Storybook style sprang from the memories of men and women who served in the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War One. This special style has some whimsy to it.

As the city is in need of more multifamily homes, I wonder if it's possible to find some examples of modern multifamily homes which pay respect to any of these architectural styles.",t2_59j5p,jlhawn,0,1646939486.0,0,t1_i055iyh,i055iyh,True,zbowling,t3_tb1k6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/alameda/comments/tb1k6t/alameda_post_alameda_beckons/,[Alameda Post] Alameda Beckons,/r/alameda/comments/tb1k6t/alameda_post_alameda_beckons/i055iyh/,1,r/alameda,0,1

"I really think AC Transit needs to market this line more to riders of the current Transbay O line. If you currently commute to and from San Francisco on the O line then you're paying $6 fare *each way*. If you do this round-trip 5 days a week for 4 weeks that's $240. A monthly Transbay pass brings the price down to $216/month.

However, Line 78 has a lot of overlap with the Transbay O line (Fruitvale BART, Santa Clara Ave, and Webster Street) and if you take the timed transfer to the Ferry at Seaplane Lagoon then you get your bus fare totally reimbursed thanks to fare integration with SF Bay Ferry, so your total 1-way cost is only $4.50. If you do this round-trip 5 days a week for 4 weeks, that's $180. This is a significant savings over the AC Transit Transbay Monthly pass if you take the O line.

So, we know it costs less money, but does it save time as well? Probably! While during midday the O line can be very fast through the Webster/Posey Tubes and Bay Bridge, during commute hours traffic can cause this one-way trip  between Park St & Santa Clara Ave to/from the Salesforce/Transbay Transit Center to take *45 minutes* on a good day or even longer depending on traffic conditions. This assumes you leave Alameda around 7:45am and leave San Francisco for the return trip around 6pm.

Meanwhile, Line 78 arrives at Park St & Santa Clara Ave around the same time in the morning and arrives at the Seaplane Lagoon Ferry Terminal at Alameda Point for a timed transfer in less than 18 minutes. There is a 5-10 minute dwelling time at the ferry terminal before it heads for the Ferry Building in San Francisco for a trip that takes less than 20 minutes. This means the whole trip time to/from Park St & Santa Clara Ave will always be about 45 to 50 minutes with no risk of being stuck in traffic on the bay bridge or in the tube. You arguably get an even more comfortable ride on the ferry!

In conclusion, if you currently ride the O Transbay line mornings before or around 8:30 and you live in the area where it coincides with the line 78 route (most of the route!) then you can save money (at least $35/month) and probably time stuck in bridge/tube traffic by switching to line 78 for your commute.",t2_59j5p,jlhawn,0,1646854637.0,0,t1_i00eo6e,i00eo6e,True,zbowling,t3_tacif8,https://www.reddit.com/r/alameda/comments/tacif8/our_new_ac_transit_78_bus_line_to_the_new_ferry/,Our new AC Transit 78 bus line to the new ferry terminal is AT RISK of being canceled!

"I've ridden the 78 perhaps a dozen times in the last year, the bus for either the 7:25am or 8:00am ferries. It is rare that I am not the only person on the bus when we get to the ferry terminal (the later bus is often used by kids to get to Maya Lin and other schools (not sure I'd let my elementary school kids take the city bus by themselves, but good on those kids!)). Last week, I was the only person on the bus in the morning but there were around a hundred people on the ferry, so we may be capturing something like 1% of the ferry ridership, which is not good.

Truthfully, it's still just too easy to drive and park at the terminal. There is very little pain in driving and therefore no real advantage to taking the bus.

But will try to find the Transportation Demand Management Program PDF as listed on page 27.   When counting the parking outside the Warehouse 44 project I only counted 77 car slots and 23 motorcycle slots when looking at section A and D (Page 24).  Section E is in doubt as it does not take into account that a building exists at section B with parking already allocated (Page 24).    As per Clement Ave, is is anyones guess at it is not built yet for inspection, but the over optimistic allocation of parking slots on the Little John side of BV is questionable.  Even on the best of days I would not park an '82 Toyota Corolla knowing the side mirror would be missing within days.

Overall it would be interesting to see the amount of overflow parking from Pacific near will be utilized once the construction will be completed in regards to BV..  I know a number of households that have 3-5 vehicles on the street in that area.

According to the master plan there are garages on both ends that will fit 309 cars in the garages and 134 private parking around the outside.

"It actually does have tons of parking. It predates Alameda's removal of mandatory parking minimums. Around 1.25-1.5 parking spots per unit of just dedicated parking according to the TDP. There is parking going in right up against the building on one side on Buena Vista with a private drive and it's also widening Beuna Vista to allow on street parking. On the back side a small lot is there, and the there will be on street parking along the new Clement Ave. Frankly too much parking given that it exists along a high frequency bus line but this was all put in place before we removed some mandates for parking.

"“Traffic circle” is  an antiquated term at least in the US and a few countries. A lot of dictionaries still call them synonyms but transportation planners and the US Department of Transportation use the term roundabout to distinctly refer to modern roundabouts and reserve the older “traffic circles” term for the older terrible designs that don’t incorporate all the modern safety improvements since the 1960s that have been developed over the years. Old traffic circles were designed to improve speed and throughput only where modern roundabouts are designed to improve safety first. They have distinctly different patterns now especially with multilane configurations. Modern roundabouts also will have truck turn curtains and often angled entrances and exits instead of perpendicular if space allows with pedestrian bulbouts and medians to cross along edges. Traffic circles you’re also more likely to see stop signs instead of yield signs like modern roundabouts.

I didn't know a traffic circle was going to be the solution, and I don't know how that works with the crossing guards for the school kids (or how it works with the fire trucks from the fire station on Mecartney) but I'm glad they are looking into fixing up that intersection, anyway.",t2_7fqs4gmg,jmbirn,0,1646174397.0,0,t1_hyz0tnh,hyz0tnh,False,djsider2,t3_t3syz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/alameda/comments/t3syz8/mecartney_roadisland_drive_improvement_project/,Mecartney Road/Island Drive Improvement Project,/r/alameda/comments/t3syz8/mecartney_roadisland_drive_improvement_project/hyz0tnh/,1,r/alameda,0,1
"> anything is safer than an uncontrolled 4 by 4 lane uncontrolled stop for pedestrians. 

During the busiest time of the morning, that intersection is controlled by crossing guards. They do create some traffic delays (especially cars on Mecartney waiting to turn onto Island, which always over-flow the left turn lane) but at least all the foot and bike traffic heading to Earhart and Lincoln schools gets the cars stopped for them.

In general, cars that would go straight across the intersection stop on the opposite side of the road when the crossing guard holds up her stop sign. I wonder if it would be the same in a traffic circle, or if cars would enter the circle first, then just miss their turn from it if a crossing guard were stopping traffic there?

Some of this is actually hard to picture: Would the crossing guards be able to stop traffic in both directions at once by the roundabout, or would she need to gather the kids in a traffic island, have them wait, then stop the other direction traffic?",t2_7fqs4gmg,jmbirn,0,1646173689.0,0,t1_hyyz0w3,hyyz0w3,False,djsider2,t3_t3syz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/alameda/comments/t3syz8/mecartney_roadisland_drive_improvement_project/,Mecartney Road/Island Drive Improvement Project,/r/alameda/comments/t3syz8/mecartney_roadisland_drive_improvement_project/hyyz0w3/,2,r/alameda,0,2

"SB 9 item is back. I love how the Alameda Citizen Task Force NIMBYs are trying claim the staff proposal changes this round was their doing and their request when in fact it was my letter to staff as a lead of East Bay YIMBY who pointed out the error in staff’s understanding of the law that allowed them to come back with these changes and that new staff recommendation fits with my own recommendation, not theirs. 

On top of that ACT is still claiming that the state’s department on housing (HCD) letter to Alameda declaring Article 26 unenforceable is incorrect while also asking the city to reduce unit square footages for ADUs/SB9 units which would run against the housing accountability act and the housing crisis act which limit down-zonings like that.

"You should join. Its very easy and you may even know few Bayfarmers who have joined that I swim with during the family sessions.

Take a membership form that's located in new member box at the gate of each pool. Mail your check and filled form to the 70 something year-old volunteer that is listed on it. If you have any questions you can call her personal phone as well. Do note that this person has trouble with operating computers and has trouble with getting email to work due to her age. Please don't hold that it against this person or judge based on her age. She is happy to take hand deliveries at the listed address if you don't want to snail mail it to her. If you go to the pool and the membership box is empty let her know so she can refill. Or since this all works on a volunteer effort I can grab you one. Please promise to make some copies and fill the membership box with forms for others. 

Good news if you are a working parent like myself. For the family membership, volunteer requirements have been on average six hours per season. The pool asks you to donate two three hour blocks per year on a weekend or evening after 5pm. I would have to disagree with your insinuation that the volunteer requirements don't favor working families. In fact its quite the opposite as the times for volunteer match most working families scheduled. (After 5 and weekends only) Do work after 5pm or on weekends? If so I can take your two shifts per season so you can still be a member. 

How in earth do you have membership demographic data to support your statement that the pool ""disproportionately favors white families in the immediate vicinity"" I was not asked to disclose my non white race on the member for or allowed the pool to share my address with others.

At Weber is good at unclogging drains but a nightmare for larger projects. They did the plumbing for our addition and couldn't follow a set of plans. We had to make them move pipes many times because they couldn't follow the plans. We ended up unable to use several interior shelves in our bathroom vanities because the plumbed the sink drains badly. It took them four tries to correctly install a pot filler. While we were working with them they forgot to install a dryer vent before a basement slab was poured on another project and caused big problems.

"I'm not sure what they do now during covid, but pre-covid, Tuesdays were full Docent Days where they had volunteer docents who could provide tours throughout ALL of the carrier, pretty much every room, depending on their whim and the interactions with their tour group.

My understanding is on other days, just the carrier flight deck and a limited number of other spaces are available for self-guided tours.  Of course, this is all info from about 2018.

I do not recall the name of the gentleman who did my family's escort, but we saw all the major carrier spaces, including him having to go fetch a key to unlock some areas for us.  He had served in another Essex class carrier (I think the Intrepid which is another carrier museum in NYC) and knew the ship inside and out.  (He knew which bunk was his.)

If they still do the docent days, it is well worth a return trip.

&#x200B;

"I got a 72 hour ticket years ago parked in the street in front of my own house.  I talked my way out of it and then made sure I moved it a bit each time.  That case is on your landlord, of course, but if it was yours you could also move it six inches before 72 hours or pull it out of the spot and back in again and should be ok or able to get out of it using the same ""letter of the law"" tactic.  You could take photos/videos proving it moved and odometer reading too. Stupid/silly technicality battle to get into and a  waste of your time, but..

That does make me wonder if there is some process to get a permit to park over 72 hours?  What if you go out of town for more than 72 hours or are in the hospital?  I would hope there are some exclusions.  Maybe, ""there is a pandemic and I don't drive much now"" should be a good enough excuse too.

San Francisco handles this with residential parking permits.  I have no idea if Alameda has ever even consider it, but it seems it would solve things like this.

"I actually did speak with the traffic unit yesterday when they were here. I told her that it was my landlord's vehicle and that he was just out of town for the week, and that we don't have a driveway. She was very polite and understood that it was reasonable for us to park there, but lamented that ""nothing could be done,"" citing the Alameda code of ordinances which prohibits vehicles from being parked in the same place for more than 72 hours.

True, the truck was in violation of the letter of the law, but not the spirit of the law.

I actually always thought that the traffic unit considered the registration address of any vehicle before marking as abandoned.
