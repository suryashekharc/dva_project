"Lol those words mean nothing, spoken like someone who those words mean plenty about.

But as far as apologies go, you see those are earned and since everything you said is still amazing amounts of bullshit and you still haven't provided any other reputable source of anything believable, you haven't quite earned one yet.

And yet two years of statistical evidence shows a clear and deep difference in the states and cities that had lockdowns versus all the ones that did not.  Gee, almost like lockdowns worked and are needed.

I mean vaccine passports were largely a thing early 2020 even already for a lot of nations, and have certainly increased more now.  The hilarity to this is people like you are /literally/ the reason why they're gonna become a norm.  Because you feel entitled to risk everyone else's lives because you were too silly to educate yourself on facts and reality, yes, we're now going to probably have vaccine passports and identifications all because people like you choose to keep this virus a rollin' on.

And the day you and people like you finally realize ""Shit, we caused to exist what we feared would happen"", I'm gonna sit back and chuckle a little, but also feel some pity that it took you all so long to realize your ignorance.

These people do deserve a chance to better their families lives especially if they’ve helped our military with useful information that might have saved countless soldiers lives. The problem is placing them in an already economically depressed area that is still very much in a downward spiral is like placing a foster child in a crack house.

"Ah how lovely it is when people like you call others lazy and to think for themselves so hypocritically.

Time for schooling!

First, allow me to quote myself; ""you have total and completely believable evidence"".

Since you apparently did not understand this I'll translate as best as I can, I meant a reputable, unbiased, not bullshit source of information.  Not some [conspiracy drivel website trying to emulate what the inquirer was like in the 80s.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/signs-of-the-times-sott/)

But okay let me humor you from your own source, since you so /clearly/ think for yourself (at least so you claim).

We click your link, what do we see?  Fancy secretive looking photos, photos captioned mostly literally not even to what's in them, photos that somehow despite it being end of 2021/start of 2022 based on news article are of a resolution and quality of a camera out of the 2000's.  How convenient.  But again, humoring you, let's address these captions;

""Illegals hop from a bus"".  Really?  I see literally only two people in that photo, both of which look like they're probably airport workers.  They were unable to capture a photo of this PLANE LOAD full of people walking to the plane?  Really?

""Loading immigrant plane"".  Because literally no normal planes take flight at night?  Have you never looked at an airport flight times?  Have you never looked at a flight map?  You really believe literally NO airplanes fly at night unless they're doing shift stuff?  Oh hey look that guy in the grey hoodie loading baggage looks like the second one from the first photo.  Lemme guess, illegals were loading their own luggage right?

""below is a picture of illegals being dropped off on the tarmac and loaded onto a World Atlantic plane"".  Ah yet another conveniently fantastic potato quality picture that, oh look doesn't actually show anything of what it says.  Again I see maybe two people in that photo, one of which is \*gasp\*, surprise surprise the grey hoodie guy from the other two, meaning we have one unaccounted person we can't identify directly.

Now let's address their comments about the airline.  The airline seems to have a pretty fluid website that is far from minimal, and they do have some flight information listed on it but even at that it's not generally the responsibility of the airline to maintain that on their site, it's the airports doing the flights.

And as for the owner, odd that within minutes of simply searching google I found plenty of information on the guy they portray as shady and anonymous.

So here's our summary;

You provided a link to a site that literally cites /nothing/ of what they claim, says photos prove shit that literally don't prove it at all, can't even provide a single high-quality photo in 2021/2022 of dozens of people at all or a clear plane indicator.

Where exactly is the plane roster?  Where exactly are the actual photos of 'illegals'?  Where exactly is the /proof/ they were all illegals?

You call us the lazy ones, and that we don't think for ourselves yet you literally link one, single source, with no citations, from a media outlet literally well known for conspiracy bullshit and no fact citing.

Oh you poor hypocritical brainwashed fool.  I can literally only feel absolute pity for you, what pathetic hyper-paranoia you must live day to day by with your capacity of self-thought.

Please for sake of yourself and everyone around you, school yourself, open your mind.  I'm glad you've reached beyond the shitty perspective of a lot of mainstream media but you didn't need to go so far as to into the conspiracy realm, there is a middle ground, please do go find it.

Edit: And yes I did sorta stop 3/4 of the way through that article, it felt unnecessary to continue showing contradictions of that website's bullshit as there were still no citings at all beyond that point either anyways.

But I did find it hilarious that somehow the person taking the photos of the airplane in Texas managed to themselves make it ALL the way to PA faster than a plane just to be able to then catch up to and take photos of the buses already on the road.  And you literally didn't somehow find that weird.",t2_bjpat,synapt,0,1641645510.0,0,t1_hrrrfsf,hrrrfsf,False,No_Legend,t3_ryblap,https://www.reddit.com/r/johnstown/comments/ryblap/local_leaders_weigh_pros_and_cons_of_idea_to/,Local leaders weigh pros and cons of idea to bring Afghanistan refugees to Johnstown area,/r/johnstown/comments/ryblap/local_leaders_weigh_pros_and_cons_of_idea_to/hrrrfsf/,7,r/johnstown,1,7

The population of Johnstown isn’t declining because older generations have died or young people leaving to explore the rest of America. They are leaving because there are no jobs there to support a family or much less a single person that doesn’t want to live on welfare. So where do they think these people are going to work? The service industry? This most certainly turn into a disaster for the already high taxed residents to support them because there aren’t any living wage entry level jobs here.

"No, /everyone/ is still getting COVID, because that's how it works.  Vaccines aren't magic, they aren't a force field.  See if you're going to argue about vaccines and shit it helps if you understand the fundamentals, which oddly they usually (or at least used to) teach in like middle school science.

But since you did not get that education I'll be glad to provide you some schooling on it.

So basically a vaccine is not intended to /prevent/ you from getting something.  It's to make it so your body is able to deal with it /once/ you get it.  Basically it's like knowing something is almost certainly going to get struck by lightning, so you make sure it's grounded.  Or that you're definitely gonna have a flood so you put up sandbags.

You're making a safety wall in your body to be ready to handle the attack without taking the damage.  The clearest concept to understand from this is the fact that the death statistics of unvaccinated individuals is overwhelming to those of vaccinated.

Data example; November there was approximately some rough 33,000 people died from verified COVID. 29,100 roughly were completely unvaccinated, and the majority of the rest were people who did not get full vaccinations (or were past the 6 month point and did not have a booster), or had other critical medical issues that compromised them (such as being immunocompromised)

Clearly the unvaccinated are dying vastly more than those who have appropriate vaccinations.

That said, not sure why you're using tetanus as an example, more so even that you did you did so completely incorrectly.

Tetanus is a bacteria, not a virus.  COVID is a viral infection.  They are two very different things.  Bacteria are easier to deal with (usually) longer term, Virus' are not, which is why we have things like yearly (or even bi-yearly) flu vaccinations.

And even at that, you only have to get a tetanus shot every 10 years as an adult.  You get 4 in your first year, another around years 4-5 and then one every 10 years starting around puberty.  But again, bacterial vs virus, very different things.

So yes, vaccinated are getting the virus as well, because that's how it works,  Vaccinated people however are also drastically surviving the virus with no long-term ('long-haul') effects like unvaccinated people, shaking it off like a day or two cold for the most part.  Where as unvaccinated people are having their entire futures ruined by clotting problems, lung damage, loss of smell and taste, and who knows what else from future virus mutations.

If you would like some sources I will gladly link you a lot of proper ones for you to study up on in understanding how vaccines work.",t2_bjpat,synapt,0,1640116921.0,0,t1_hpgrbro,hpgrbro,False,riccipt,t3_rc0dty,https://www.reddit.com/r/johnstown/comments/rc0dty/cambria_county_just_reached_50_of_its_population/,Cambria County just reached 50% of its population for being fully vaccinates (the 1st 2 shots) :),/r/johnstown/comments/rc0dty/cambria_county_just_reached_50_of_its_population/hpgrbro/,1,r/johnstown,0,1

"So since you apparently have the mentality of a 5 year old, I'll try to ELI5 school you a bit;

No this is not the flu.  Yes it's a virus, but viruses come in many different forms.  Flu on average kills roughly 20,000 (surprise surprise, mostly unvaccinated) people in the US.  Worldwide average is said to be around 250,000.

We lost 250,000 US citizens in just 6 months of COVID. Six months.  We are now sitting at nearly 750,000 in two years, of a virus that shows frequent mutations and ever increasing secondary problems all because we live in an age of inconsiderate, ignorant and immoral adults that literally act worse than a 5 year old having a tantrum who think they actually understand what 'rights' are when they literally have no clue.

But hey sure, you keep thinking like someone with an IQ of 10, thinking LITERALLY that this is all a big pharma scam that somehow, LITERALLY nobody world wide has somehow burst the bubble of, cause it's totally logical to think something like this could possibly even remotely be just a big scam with every single literal millions upon millions of proper scientists, health researchers, etc, all being complicit in it.

We'll just ignore the literal impossibility of the logistics of that, and that the money to ""pay off"" all those millions and millions of people would be virtually impossible unless they were being paid like a dollar per person, but sure, millions of people would TOTALLY take a $1 to be complicit in a huge pandemic scam, sure, absolutely logical perspective.

"There’s usually a celebration downtown that you’d probably enjoy. There are a bunch of events like horse drawn carriage rides to take, music, etc. usually all free too. 

The Christmas tree should still be up. 

If you like breweries, Stone Bridge is downtown and you can try that. And downtown Johnstown also has America’s oldest record shop - George’s Song Shop. I cannot recommend that place enough. 

I would say try for an AirBnB in the old Westmont neighborhood and ride the Incline Plane down into town, but I think it’ll still be closed.

Politics isn't going to come to play unless you openly start talking about it, but Johnstown is fairly moderate. The county is mostly rural, so outside of Johnstown you'll meet more conservatives, but again it's not going to come into play unless you start a conversation about it. People usually aren't going to talk about politics with strangers around here.

Honestly, I would think the town of Bedford would be much much more up your alley than Johnstown. The town is safer at night compared to Johnstown, there's a lot more stores and shops in downtown Bedford, and the Bedford Springs is an awesome place to stay with a ton of history. The politics in town there are going to more closely align with yours too, since you seem to care about that.

"Yea hey, where did you read anyone even suggesting violence on my post?

Why don't YOU go back and read my posts before you make threats.

As far as harassment goes, identifying some clown who is harassing senior citizens is not only appropriate, it is necessary. Our entire legal system depends on citizens calling out those who violate our norms and our laws.

Excellent points made on how the crime and drugs effects others not involved it I did not think of it that way initially. The recent news of a bunch of low-life’s being snatched up for the drug trafficking seems like great news and would be nice to see them keep up that momentum.. every place has its BS I guess, it’s a real shame that the area has been so overloaded with it.

Housing prices are one of the reasons I’m looking to move here, it’s obvious everywhere else it’s $$$ while Johnstown still has some nice homes popping on the market at decent list prices. I would probably want to be in Westmont or Richland? 

On my last visit I did get to see more of the blight so hopefully there will be or is plans to start to improve that….. I liked the little traffic compared to what I’m use to and people I did interact with were friendly.

"At one time Johnstown was a city of about 100,000 and Altoona even larger.  If you include the boom towns that sprung up from iron ore and coal mining, the area likely rivaled that of Pittsburgh in size at that time .   The area is a shell of what it once was.  There were huge, huge, immigrant populations continuously streaming in from the late 1800s until the Great Depression started. Many of these people where Irish, German, Italian, and Eastern European, Catholic and had large families.  I don’t think the census records could keep pace with the growth it experienced at the time.  

The robber-barons from the big cities raped the land and other natural resources and stockpiled their wealth in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York, leaving the area barren of any way to support itself.  The countryside of Pennsylvania was 98% clearcut at the turn of the 20th century, and there is photographic evidence to demonstrate that if you can see through the thick dark haze that hung in the air day and night.  Not to mention the fact that the upper class steel, coal, and railroad magnates used the surrounding forests at their personal hunting and fishing grounds.

"The mountains and forests, state parks, and outdoor recreation are great, especially in the summer.  Most of that is outside of Johnstown proper though.  There are some great suburbs to live in around the area, and some cool small towns.  Ebensburg, which is the County Seat is about 15-20 miles north and is a great little town. 

The Johnstown area is not very diverse though, and unfortunately it hasn’t been spared from the issues we’re seeing elsewhere with national politics, and frankly, racist points of view.  However, not everyone is that way there, as I have a lot of family and friends that are very open minded and pretty moderate politically. 

One really interesting thing is the part Johnstown and the surrounding area played in the history of the industrial revolution.  It doesn’t get much credit nationally, but the steel, coal, and railroad industries that blossomed in the mid to late 19th century there played a huge part in powering the country for the decades following.  There are some great museums there, and unfortunately a lot of scars on the mountainsides from the coal mining that was once one of the largest economic drivers of the region.

P.S. since others seem to have misinterpreted my comments as “Ebensburg is great and everything else is sh*t” I’d like to clarify that all of my comments apply to the whole Altoona-Johnstown area and everything in between, not just Johnstown or Ebensburg.  There are some nice people throughout and there are some really awful people too.  I don’t think that any one town or city is big enough in that part of the state to offer everything a person would want or need to enrich themselves and live life to it’s fullest, so you have to look at the area as a whole.  YMMV.

P.P.S. I lived and worked there for over 30 years, and loved most of it.  I’ve lived in two other major metropolitan areas as well, and now reside in the National Capital region.

"This has everything to do with Trump and the Republicans. WOW are you that fucking clueless?

The Republicans in the state legislature have followed the lead of the national Republican Party: they try to thwart everything Democrats try to do.

In PA, the Governor is a Democrat and the Legislature is controlled by Republicans. 

When COVID hit America, Wolf was one of the few governors who got it right, calling for a state of emergency and enacting sensible policies to protect the citizens against a formidable enemy, coronavirus. 

While the asswipes in the Republican legislature wanted to follow stupid Trump's lead--and ignore the virus--Wolf acted, and we should all be thankful he did. In spite of Republicans trying everything to stop him, he used the power of the governor's office to enact a state of emergency that lasted until he would end it. Not satisfied with letting Wolf make any decisions on his own, the Republican scum in the state legislature put it on the ballot to limit the governor's power and to limit states of emergency to 3 weeks.

Unfortunately, we live in a fucked up state, and last week that measure passed, limiting any state of emergency the governor should declare to 3 weeks.

Once again, however, Wolf outsmarted them; he simply lets one state of emergency expire, then declares a new one. 

So the next time you feel like being a smart ass and calling someone a ""genius"" know WTF you're talking about.

My point was this type of action, by Republicans in our legislature, is adding to America's divisiveness; soon we won't be able to get our government leaders to agree to anything.

It's already clear Republicans at the national level are completely dysfunctional, fighting ""100%"" of Biden's agena (McConnell). They can't even agree to investigate the storming of the Capitol on 1/6 because all they care about is protecting that Orange Asshole.

Those numbers are pretty much the same in the immediate surrounding areas of Johnstown, though Biden won parts of downtown/Cambria City. So there are probably more moderate Democrats within city limits, but outside the city, it's not even close.

"Someone asked something similar to this a few months back, and here is my series of responses; I hope this helps.

Born and raised in Johnstown, and having moved away for decades, I found myself back here again in 2008. We are doing our part to renovate and revitalize, but the City--and state-provide only roadblocks and setbacks, not help.

The city that was once an ""All-American City"" (1972) is now the All-But-Dead City: named the poorest town in Pennsylvania, there is little to cheer about in Johnstown. Unless you have money and power--or both. Then you get to have a say in which blighted buildings get demolished. Other than that, Johnstown is at death's door.

"Toomey finally doing the right things now that he's on his way out, go figure.

Most people in the 13th district are going to give you the old ""but he's a *doctor* so obviously he knows the truth and is doing the right thing!""

Considering the deep red stance of the district, you'd have to depend on the GOP to put up another sensible candidate, but I doubt they're going to primary one of their own. And when you look at the field Joyce edged out in his last primary, the other candidates don't instill much faith in normalcy. You have a guy who cried to the state about Pennsylvanian's needing their voices heard, somehow by not counting many of their votes. The same guy who thought it would be a good idea to publish the names of those who tested positive for COVID-19. Then you've got another guy who wrote a book about Christian's rights in a ""post-Christian America"" lol can't make this stuff up.

"Here or in Ohio?  I paid $5900 annually on my last house I referenced in Columbus Ohio.  It was 4,200 sq ft on 15 acres and I paid nearly $500k for it, so I didn’t feel that a 1% annual tax was bad.  My previous house before that house was in Grove City (a  suburb of Columbus), was only 2,400 square feet, 1/10th acre lot, and had me paying over $12k annually on a home that only cost $320k.  They’ve inflated property taxes there to the point where it’s damaging the housing market.  That house (the $12k tax one) I sold for the same price 3 years later and it just sold again last year for under $290k, so they’re basically committing property tax suicide, dropping home prices as the housing market everywhere else in the city booms.  Here in Somerset County PA I pay $1100 annually.  That’s still high in my eyes given that it works out to roughly 4-5% of purchase price.

"It’s just out in the country not many neighbors.  I’m in Somerset County.  All of the surrounding houses are nicer than mine.  About 30 minutes from Johnstown itself.  Sucks being far from any stores and having shit internet, but my only purpose in buying such a home was to cut my living expenses in an attempt to accumulate substantial wealth in my 30s rather than 40s or 50s.  I own a lot of guns, so I’m not particularly afraid to live anywhere.  That being said, while I do feel safe out here in the country, I would never go into a town like Johnstown unless I absolutely had to given that it has one of the nation’s highest (per capita) crime rates.  Sure there are some drug people and drunk drivers out here in the rural parts, as is the case in all of rural America, but that’s nothing for someone like me who grew up in an area of Ohio absolutely ravaged by opiate addiction.  I actually feel very safe out here.  Never encountered anyone sketchy or even anyone who wasn’t polite.  Just normal people doing normal things for the most part.  Don’t feel any less safe here than I did at my last home south of Columbus Ohio that I paid 25 times as much for.  I really don’t understand the negativity surrounding Johnstown/Somerset.

"I’m guessing they were sold at tax auctions as another commenter suggested.  But I actually moved out to Johnstown (rather nearby Hooversville) for this very reason.  Lost my job when my company went under back in Ohio and lost my heavily mortgaged $500k+ home in the process of waiting to find a new job.  Now that I work remotely I don’t care where I live, so I started looking for the cheapest houses nationwide on Zillow.  I had never heard of Johnstown PA.  Cheapest real estate in the nation.  But I purposely moved here because property is worth 1/10 of what it was back in Columbus.   Here I paid $20k cash for my home that’s in good shape, and decently far removed from the crime of “downtown” Johnstown.  We’ve got half an acre and about 2,400 square feet.  Haven’t had to do any major maintenance in a few years now.  Not bad for $20k.  Having no real living costs has allowed me to save an incredible amount of money in just a few years, to the point where I’ll probably move back to Ohio soon and buy a home like my last one but this time without a mortgage.  I’m very thankful for the opportunity to buy a home in such a place and for such a price.  For me it was a life saver, and offered me a complete financial do-over in life.

If you start at the incline plan at the bottom and head toward Mill Creek road you'll come to a point where the trail switches back and starts heading back toward the incline plane go ahead that way a little bit and then you'll find another set of steps that are pretty rudimentary and the trail turns and goes up to the left then. That is all hiking trail or mixed use. when you get to that top tier right as you get to it there's another right that you can make and it's only hiking the whole way up to the top incline station. Otherwise if you keep following what is very obviously an old road it ends up on Blair Street. You can hike on any of that!

Bring every community leader and organization together, and invite the public.

While there is good work being done here by various groups, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, and the poor have been completely left out. 

I don't know if you read that paper I wrote about blight, but it does address some of the issues facing Johnstown: I'm certain there are that many issues over again that I missed, and we have to do a better job of inviting everyone into the discussion, not just this group or that organization.

Perhaps the main reason we have such a fractured town--with all its little kingdoms and such--is the lack of trust between folks: no one wants to give up their autonomy because they are afraid what someone else will decide about their community. We have seen this even in the sewer project, where each municipality made its own decisions about their connections, and each had their own agreement with the state. That is insane!

If we can't find a way to work together, we will perish, and that is what I think we have all witnessed in the past 40 years.

"Changes? What changes?

You mean that this week Road A is torn up, versus last week when it was Road B? Johnstown, if nothing else, is the one place in America where the roads are constantly under construction but never get fixed.

I was born and raised here; left for military service and such, and returned in 2008. My wife and I started a small real estate company, and have finished a handful of flips and currently have a dozen rentals. BTW, don't go into rental real estate in Pennsylvania: it's not a four year degree, but a Ph. D.

Anyway, Johnstown is mostly a quiet town, with the exception of the Police sirens screaming out to Oakhurst or Solomon Homes due to the ever-present drug crimes in public housing. Nearly [10% of all Johnstown crime is committed in our public housing](http://jhaonline.org/crime.html).

Economically, Johnstown was experiencing a slight uptick in the mid 2000s, when then-Representative Murtha brought Defense contractors here at the end of his House Defense Appropriations Sub-Committee gun. Unfortunately, with his death, Johnstown breathed the last of that windfall, losing much of the money wrangled/twisted/forced to come here. And with those Defense contractors leaving, so went the jobs, and the income, and the local economy...again.

But Johnstown has it's young people: unfortunately, the school district in Johnstown, from which I graduated from many moons ago, is now in the proverbial crapper. The current [Great Schools ratings](https://www.greatschools.org/pennsylvania/johnstown/greater-johnstown-school-district/) never exceeds a ""3"" for any school. But that's probably due to the incredible amount of [cronyism and nepotism](https://www.tribdem.com/news/experts-secret-meetings-violated-sunshine-laws-greater-johnstown-hiring-practices-focus-of-state-ethics-report/article_3b40ed28-6266-11ea-89d3-1fc6196c3c8f.html) in the district. 

As for Vision2025, to be honest, I haven't seen much. Oh, they've had their meetings, and they had [Carnegie-Mellon do a big study](https://johnstown25.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/vision2025strategicvision.pdf), but change? I haven't seen any meaningful change here. 

Johnstown [IS still the poorest town](https://www.tribdem.com/news/report-johnstown-is-pa-s-poorest-small-city/article_bfcf0ada-e18b-11ea-8d91-eb4f98c30aa2.html) in all of Pennsylvania, which limits the amount of tax revenues available to be spent on real change. When we started our business 12 years ago, Johnstown politicians were railing about all the BLIGHT in the city. There are numerous estimates, but suffice it to say there may be 1,000 blighted residential properties in Cambria County, and a great percentage of those are in Johnstown. While some private groups, like the Community Foundation of the Alleghenies--another name for Mark Pasquerella--has put private money into tearing down a few dozen properties, tearing down a few buildings each year will not solve the blight problem: we simply ADD more blighted properties than we tear down each year. What Johnstown needs is [a true housing study](https://tsabo63.medium.com/highways-to-hallways-5923acb96a82). 

There are lots of things to do here, of course. If you live in one of the better neighborhoods, like Westmont (highest taxes in the entire county) or Richland, you can have a nice home and expect to have good schools for your kids. Scalp Avenue resembles any other bustling thoroughfare, where shoppers buzz along the multitude of stores and restaurants. But that is Richland--not Johnstown. 

Johnstown, as others have said, can't agree on what to do, where to go, or who to put in charge: maybe everyone at the same time. Almost every street has its own municipality and its own school district, and all these little kingdoms prevent any real progress. Unfortunately in 40 years, Johnstown has only changed for the worse.

"V25 is indeed more of a small initiative incubator than it is an actual...do-er of things. It's been my experience that if you want to get stuff done but aren't sure how or need help finding people to help, they're a good group to tag in. 

The area has so many ""major players"" that it can be confusing. The Johnstown Area Regional Industries, Johnstown Redevelopment Authority, Discover Downtown Partnership, Lift Johnstown, Community Foundation of the Alleghenies... They all have different roles and ways of supporting and building the area but it's not always easy to determine how they interact. 

That being said, the area has changed a lot in some ways and not at all in others. Overall the downtown region is much more vibrant and communal than it was ten years ago. It used to be that considering a business downtown was a fool's errand, but now it is a legitimate option with community buy-in and support.

"You may be correct, but we will have to pay off the 2017 Tax cut to wealthy Americans and corporations FIRST.

By the way, if the former president had acted properly, we wouldn't have the economic mess and 530,000 dead we now have. We wouldn't be the world's leader in coronavirus cases, with millions out of work, schools and small businesses closed, and a full year of economic misery. 

The money is this bill helps the rest of us, not just the wealthy. I support Congress helping those of us who have been devastated by the former president's unwillingness to protect Americans from this plague, instead calling it a hoax, suggesting we treat it with unproven drugs or bleach, and causing economic and domestic turmoil instead of  acting like a grown up.

"Possibly worthy clarity;

Upper Yoder is otherwise a pretty large township that stretches waaaaaay out to the entire lower corner of the county.  If we're talking the more Johnstown-neighboring municipal that's technically Elim.

I also imagine the 60-distinctions may also be considering most of the old ""Wards"" modeling of Johnstown.  The city itself has 21 wards, most of which also have sub-areas to an extent.  For example Roxybury neighborhood is part of the 8th ward, but there's also the area around the hospital still referred to as just the 8th ward.

Johnstown is quite a diverse area when trying to find a home. There are too many factors for us to fully cover them here.

We have rentals and have flipped houses in Johnstown, and have used the same two people to help us purchase/sell all the real estate we have dealt with: Bill and Sue Lease with Re/MAX.

Bill and Sue have great experience in the Johnstown real estate market. They are honest, reliable, and will help you find a great home. If your credit needs work, they can even help direct you to folks who can help you improve it prior to shopping for a mortgage. They can help you in all aspects, and you can totally trust them. 

If you are a Veteran, don't forget your VA mortgage.

Westmont, Richland are the best in my opinion. (I'm a wesmont grad) unless you choose private. 

Depending on what your looking for, land, neighborhood, cost, access to shopping/restaurants ect...would depend where your best place to choose.

The Laurel Highlands Trail is great for hiking, the Ghost Town Trail (which was the Best Trail in PA in 2020!) is a short drive away and is amazing for hiking, biking, strolls, etc.  We go there 3 or 4 times a week 3 seasons a year.

We drive out to Linn Run State Park near Ligonier sometimes for beautiful scenery and natural rock waterslides.

Yes, Conemaugh Health Systems. It's really the only one right in Johnstown. Since it is the only option, opinions of it varies. It is the only Level 1 Trauma Center around. And I've always had great treatment when I've had to be there. 

> —Are there reliable mental health resources?

Definitely. There are a lot of community resources in the region. They're out there, but they usually do a poor job of advertising themselves. 

> —Is it queer-friendly?

Eh. It's not a major issue, but it's still a dying steel town in the hills of PA, so still plenty of closemindedness here. 

> —What is the arts scene like, ie galleries, theatres, festivals etc

Not bad! Someone else has already mentioned the Community Arts Center, which is great. They're currently running a great pop art exhibit by a local artist. The Bottleworks is also tremendous. Lots of exhibits, plus tons of activities and classes.  There is definitely a small, but very active artist community here. There are some smaller venues like VOMA to see local and regional bands.

edit: forgot to mention Johnstown is home to America's oldest record store, George's Song Shop. I cannot say enough good things about that place. If you have ANY interest in vinyl, you have to check it out. 

Plenty of ethnic and cultural festivals through out the year, all over the area. Lots of heritage and good food at these.

"Hello and welcome. 

There’s a large hospital and healthcare seems to be one of the largest career options for younger people. 
There’s many options when it comes to therapy and the like. 

I can’t speak for the LGBTQ community. But I will say the vast majority of older folks here are pretty racist and close minded (be prepared to see a ridiculous amount of trump paraphernalia.) Where as the younger community is usually the complete opposite. 
There’s a art scene with a few different gallery. But that’s not my thing so I’ve never been to any of them so I can’t speak for there reputation. 

Pros: 

It’s a beautiful area. 
There’s a ton of trails and outdoor activities. 
Things are cheap. 
It’s small but you can find mostly anything you’d require. 

Cons:

Very poor area. 
Drugs. Lots and lots of drugs and drug addicts.

"Did it really need to come to this? Did we really not see this coming?

Donald Trump claimed-BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION-that *that election* was rigged. He whined and complained for days prior to the actual election day. Then in 2020, Trump starting claiming long before election day in November that *this election* was rigged, and if he lost it would only be because it was stolen from him.

Trump has made it clear there are ""allegations"" of fraud, and the election was stolen from him. True, there *are allegations,* but only because Donald Trump himself has made those endless allegations without presenting a scintilla of evidence: over 60 court cases, the Trump legal team presented ZERO evidence of fraud, or of anything they told their followers. 

[Trump lies; Americans die.](https://imgur.com/gallery/ykskbHv) PERIOD.

Today, Trump incites violence in Washington, D.C, that led directly to the death of at least one person. We don't need to discuss his reckless mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic OR the farce known as Operation Warp Speed.

Mike Pence should call on the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, which temporarily removes Trump from being the president. Tomorrow, The House should draw Articles of Impeachment against Trump for Sedition and perhaps Insurrection. The Senate should follow by voting to remove Trump as president permanently.

"As the days go by, these people become more spineless, more hypocritical, they commit more and more crimes, and they become more dangerous. They say we should be concerned because 74 million people ""feel"" the vote was fraudulent and therefore we should overturn the election. First, they only believe that because so many Republicans in power, without being able to produce a scrap of evidence, keep telling them it was fraudulent. They've been saying that they would do this *if they lost* for the whole year before the election. Go back and listen to all the times Trump said he'd only accept the results if he won. Do his supporters think he some kind of psychic superhuman? Or is it more likely that he is an dalways has been a sore loser, considering he's never admitted defeat, not even the very first time he ran in the primaries. No election that he loses could possibly be fraudulent in his narcissistic kind. 

And, these Republicans are so concerned about the feeling of (they say) 74 million people. What about the other 80 million voters whom the GOP is trying to disenfranchise with all this nonsense? Don't they acre about them?

"John Joyce, R-PA, representing the people of the 13th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, has stated it is his intention to object to the Electoral College certification process slated for a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021.

Joyce, in a statement on his website, stated:

""***Unfortunately, the many unlawful actions undertaken by the Pennsylvania Governor's office, the Secretary of State, and what has been described as a rogue Pennsylvania Supreme Court exceeded and circumvented the state legislature's clear constitutional authority.""***

John Joyce, a dermatologist by trade-not a Constitutional or legal scholar-has made the terminal career decision to endorse the far-fetched scheme of the once-Impeached President, Donald Trump. Delusional as ever, Trump was heard berating Georgia election officials over the weekend in an illegal effort to coerce the Secretary of State there to change 11,780 votes for him. This is the guy that John Joyce is supporting with his objection.

Last week, when given the opportunity to speak up for the people of the 13th Congressional District, to fight for $2,000 of COVID aid instead of $600, Joyce chose to continue to support only the $600. It is striking that Joyce didn't object to *that*.

Now, with Joyce coming forward and objecting to the legal and certified election of Pennsylvanians during the 2020 Presidential Election, there is one question that must be asked of John  Joyce:

""If you claim this election had so many 'unlawful actions', how can we-the voters of the 13th Congressional District-accept YOU as our Congressional Representative, seeing that YOU were elected in the very same election that you NOW object to?""

Mr. Congressman, you can not have it both ways: either the outcome of the Pennsylvania election was illegitimate-and you will now step aside, and await the date of the Special Election that must be held-OR the election outcome for Pennsylvania was legitimate-and you will drop this foolish attempt of yours to object to these results.

If a landlord owns too many homes and can't afford to pay all the fees and costs associated with upkeep, then perhaps they should sell some of those properties and go buy more expensive properties in surrounding areas. The only reason landlords love to scoop up property in city limits is because they are a cheap and easy way to generate income.

"Thank you for the nice words. There seem to be some-even here in the Johnstown subreddit-who spend their time attacking the messenger because it is sport to them. I simply block them, and move on to folks, like yourself, who want to engage in decent and respectful conversation. 

I, too, hoped to find solutions that would allow us to renovate a number of properties: there are so many nice houses in Johnstown that could be a nice home for a family if fixed up. Unfortunately, the nice ones are mixed in neighborhoods that have gone astray, full of slumlord housing and nasty tenants, coupled with limited police and political entities that spend far too much time either arguing, or simply doing nothing to support real change.

Johnstown has changed in the past 40 years, and it won't be coming back to any past glory: that is the first reality to face. There is limited funding, stifling legal burdens, and a penchant-still-to hate the concept of consolidation regardless of the potential benefits. 

After working in this field for a number of years, I recognized this was not just a Johnstown problem, but more of a Pennsylvania problem, repeated throughout the Commonwealth far too often. Too much red tape, too many Rust Belt houses, and too little money or interest has led to much of the Blight we continue to see. 

I wrote this paper to ask for help: as part of the local landlord association here in Johnstown, I submitted in to State Senator Wayne Langerholc's office in 2017, where it was well received. The senator had staff attend one of our meetings where the paper was applauded, and we expected his office to build on it. Unfortunately, in the three years since meeting Senator Langerholc, no work has been done to introduce any legislation, to have further discussions, or for that matter to address any of the issues facing real estate investment in the state. And that is most disappointing. 

On a positive note, a number of groups are working to address issues independent of local and state government. There have been a number of Blighted properties removed, but my fear is that--while we are tearing down a dozen or so Blighted properties each year--the conditions continue to exist to CREATE more Blighted properties than we eliminate. 

Without addressing what is causing Blight, we can't stop it by tearing down a few old houses. Real estate investment must be viewed as an ""opportunity"" not a threat: too many see landlords as the problem, and have only a negative connotation of them. (I have received ugly comments about being a landlord just from this post). 

There is much work to be done, but I fear it won't be done due to so many factors--some listed here, some identified in my paper, and some not yet identified. We have an abundance of people who are good at complaining about the problems, but shift quickly into reverse when asked to do any work associated with fixing something.

Years ago, after we joined the landlord group here in town, I had a few ideas I thought could help landlords and the community. When I posited them to the head of the landlord group, his answer was telling: you've got some good ideas, he said, but if you want to see anything happen, you'll need to do the work yourself. 

In other words, if you want to bring about change, you need to ""be the miracle,"" and don't expect others to help too much. It is unfortunately true, and this is a key reason, I believe, why Johnstown will continue to die.

"Thanks for the responses.  
I do agree that the revenue would increase in the long run if the blighted properties are rehabilitated. I think (rather cynically) that one of the difficulties in any long term planning is that a true fix would require more than one election cycle, and most politicians don't believe a voter base would re-elect them if the short term results are poor, even if it's part of a plan for a long term game.  


And don't worry about sounding like a know-it-all. To me, you sounded informed, which is why I asked questions from you, so I could be better informed.  


My background is in ministry, so I've seen the effects of poverty (mostly overseas, but also in Johnstown), which is why I can be more sympathetic to the difficulties of the impoverished community. That's why I was wondering if there was a solution where they could ""pay off"" the debt in a non-financial way (a la community service, potentially working on blight?) and the government could decrease the burden on landlords through a tax rebate or something.  


Sadly, there are few good solutions.

"You have witnessed what we all have: the death of a city. Once upon a time, Johnstown WAS an ""All-American City,"" but natural and business disasters have led Johnstown to the doorstep of municipal death. Led by arguing, and mostly incompetent leaders, Johnstown needs those who live here--and HAVED lived here for generations--to stop theorizing about the cause of problems, and start studying. If you want to be a part of the Johnstown solution, I invite you to learn the truth about your own city, your neighborhood, and yes, even landlords.

No doubt there are many landlords here--as everywhere--that care only about trying to make money on real estate. These slumlords will rent to anyone who shows up with the first month's rent; no background check, no concern for what that new tenant may use the unit for, or how it may hurt the community. Some of these slumlords do use Section 8, some do not.

We have used Section 8 over the 12 years we have operated here. From our experience there is no discernable difference in a Section 8 tenant and a non-Section 8 tenant: we have both good and bad tenants in and out of the program. 

Section 8 is a funding source ONLY: they simply pay the rent for those who can't afford to pay it all or in part themselves. It is the responsibility of the landlord to enforce their own lease. And believe me, many landlords have no clue how to create a good lease, and even less of an idea how to enforce one. Slumlords don't even care to try to enforce a lease: all they care about is making money. 

If you want to clean up rental properties, petition your community leaders to require standard language in every lease used within the city limits: without it, prohibit the landlord from renting his/her property. I realize rules and regulations are not the answer to all things, but right now THERE ARE NO RULES that help folks like you have a say in who lives in our neighborhoods and in our town.

I encourage you to get involved, not just angry. I encourage you to stop blaming Section 8 tenants or the Section 8 program without serious evidence to support your claims: that only leads to more division, and doesn't help solve the serious problems facing Johnstown.",t2_2yw4yopt,tsabo63,0,1608592237.0,0,t1_ggmvbrh,ggmvbrh,False,tsabo63,t3_kh8y1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/johnstown/comments/kh8y1b/the_best_hope_of_johnstown/,The best hope of Johnstown,/r/johnstown/comments/kh8y1b/the_best_hope_of_johnstown/ggmvbrh/,0,r/johnstown,0,0

"1. Helping landlords become more profitable through progressive ideas such as the few I've suggested WOULD increase the tax base, thus increasing revenues for all governments. In PA, there are now close to 400,000 blighted properties: that is a lot of lost revenue. One of the primary reasons they are not rehabbed is due to the laws being so stacked against investors: improve the conditions, increase the number of investors, increased tax revenues. 

2. Sure, you can't get water from sand, but there need to be real ways of stopping the ongoing debt cycle for landlords in PA. A judgment (temporary loss) becomes Out-of-business (permanent loss) when one is unable to collect debts. Without a correction here, investment in Pa will continue to dry up (see Point #1).

3. It depends on the size, location, etc. In many states, there are job and civic programs to do this. ACRP here in Johnstown trains people doing some work like this, but economics requires a demand for more properties, and Johnstown already has too many old properties.

"You make some good points.  


It would be great to see good property owners developing places throughout the region.  


Unfortunately, for an area with a limited tax base to start with, all of these steps would reduce the government's income. While I would agree that increasing property values all around would, in turn, increase the tax base, it would be a long term improvement, at the expense of short term budget, so it's hard to sell it to any governing body.  


The point that seemed hardest to achieve would be collecting from former tenants. By nature, if someone has been evicted, or fallen behind on rent, utilities, etc, they don't have much in the way of liquid assets to start with, so collecting against them will increase the difficulties on them even more, which could lead to more homelessness and/or squatters.   
Now, I'm not saying there should be no punishment on them, but perhaps there could be a way to modify the system. Somehow dispense community service as the punishment, combined with something like tax rebates to the landlord for the losses? I don't know, I just know that you can't get more water by squeezing a dry towel.  


I have a question for you, though.   
By any chance, do you know the costs of demolishing a building?  
What if there was a way to make blighted (but not structurally condemned) buildings more habitable on a low budget? Volunteers and/or student/apprentice labor? Maybe a project of job training for physically capable adults in trade skills by having them serve as apprentices on projects in these old buildings?  
Taking it a step further, maybe some of the volunteer workforce could be the previously mentioned former tenants who owe a debt?

"How is it there are only invalid votes in the states (PA, GA, AZ, MI) that led to Trump's defeat? Why is Trump calling for votes to be tossed in those states only? Why has Trump filed suit in those states only? Why is there fraud-according to Trump-in those states only? Why is it Trump has not called for any investigations into states he won, like say FL or TX?

Did you know that mail-in ballots were also used in FL and TX; should we toss those votes also, giving those two states to Biden?

"John Joyce represents the 13th district here in Johnstown.

In   2016,   Donald   Trump   came   here   and   promised   to   bring   back   the   steel   jobs, promised   to   bring   back   the   coal   jobs,  promised   to   bring   back​ [​prosperity   to  Johnstown](https://youtu.be/C1hh4FdWVVg)​.   The   facts,  even   BEFORE   coronavirus   were   clear:   there   was   NO   increase  in   coal   jobs;   steel   jobs   were   down,  and   prosperity   had   left   the   building.

Dr.   John   Joyce   supported   Donald   Trump,  and   opposed   the   Impeachment   of  Trump.

The   night   Joyce   got   elected   in   2018,   he   made   a   pledge   to   the   people   of   the  13th   District:   to   serve   in   humility   and   serve   with   dignity.   He   promised   to   serve   with  more   civility,  that   he   would   listen   to   voters   and   put   the   voters   FIRST.​ ​[Here   are   HIS  words](https://youtu.be/PO8OamZ37wU)​.

But   here   is   that   same​ ​[John   Joyce   on   Fox   News​](https://youtu.be/5r_250SmaDQ) ,   calling   the   Impeachment   Inquiry   a  'sham'   that   it   is   in   the   'Soviet-style.'   He   claimed   the   President   was   denied   DUE  PROCESS,  but   was   corrected   by   the   Fox   host.   He   said   Rep.   Adam   Schiff,  the   lead  prosecutor   in   the   House,  was   acting   as   'a   witness,  the   prosecutor,  and   the   judge  and   jury.'   Dr.   Joyce   told   Americans   on   Fox   News   that   'the   witch   hunt   continues.'

Are   these   the   words   of   someone   who   pledges   to   use   humility,  to   serve   with   dignity, and   embrace   civility?   John   Joyce   promised   a   lot,  but   has   not   delivered   for   the  people   of   the   13th   District.​ ​[Here's   more   CIVILITY​](https://youtu.be/CgynaHIRyyo) from John Joyce.

John   [Joyce​ ​promised   to   protect   Social   Security​](https://youtu.be/wrMiO3JQIDg) ,   Medicare,  and   to   lower   taxes   for   our  families.   What   exactly   has   he   done   in   regards   to   those?   NOTHING   but   stand   with  Trump.

But   John   Joyce   did   not   run   in   2018   on   a   jobs   program:   his   main   stated   goal   was   the  ""​**huge,  looming   problem   of   the   inability   of   people   to   obtain   reasonably   priced  health   insurance**.""  ​

So   the   question   then   is   'What   has   Dr.   Joyce   done   in   his   term  to   address   this   huge,  looming   problem   people   have   in   obtaining   reasonably   priced  health   insurance?​

​Here   is   his   [Congressional   record](https://www.congress.gov/member/john-joyce/J000302?q=%7B%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%7D)​ ,   but   exactly   what   he   has  introduced   to   address   this   issue   is   not   there.

Dr.   John   Joyce​ ​said   [we   could   take   him   at   his   word](https://youtu.be/wrMiO3JQIDg)​ ,   that   he   was   trustworthy.   But  John   Joyce   has   become   just   one   more   member   of   Trump's   swamp,  not   working   to  help   shore   up   Social   Security,  or   Medicare   as   he   promised:   not   treating   others   with  civility   and   dignity   as   he   said   he   would;   not   working   to   reduce   the   cost   of   health  care-which   was   his   NUMBER   ONE   stated   goal.

John   Joyce   has   not   only   failed   the   people   of   the   13th   District:   he   has   failed  HIMSELF.

Now, it's 2020, amd John Joyce, much to my dismay, has been re-elected to represent the 13th. It appears, however, that instead of focusing on issues facing the people of the district NOW, Joyce's primary objective is to prevent the laws of the nation and the state of Pennsylvania regarding elections to be enforced.

John Joyce, a dermatologist by trade, is definitely a wolf in sheep's skin. Adding his name last week to the ridiculous [amicus brief](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/trump-texas-amicus-house-members) signed by over 100 other Congressional House Republicans suggests John Joyce *thinks he knows more* about PA election law than those who wrote it: Democrats AND Republicans revised the [PA Election code in 2019](https://patch.com/pennsylvania/newtown-pa/7-big-changes-voting-pa-just-signed-law) to permit mail-in voting.

It appears that John Joyce views his role in Congress as that of an elected official there to protect his crooked friends-like Trump-who commit crooked acts. John Joyce has been re-elected, and unless the rest of the House decides to throw this bum out due to his [seditious act](https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/18-usc-sect-2385.html), we will be stuck with him for another two years.

"But that IS what you are saying because that IS what the lawsuit is about.

Since you seem to not even have looked into the lawsuit this entire post is about, some clarifications from it;

\----

They claim; That mail in ballots basically violated federal law.

Fact: This has been a legally acceptable thing for ages.  Trump and his family not only utilized mail in ballots this year but also in 2016.

They specifically targeted mail in ballots because this is where Biden's sudden surge in totals came from (and unsurprisingly after all, Trump spent most of the year telling his supporters that mail in ballots are dangerous).

\----

They claim; Mail in ballots and other pandemic-related changes have lead to massive fraud.

Fact: Literally 0 evidence provided of this from any of the complainants in the lawsuit.

Trump has literally lost every lawsuit filed in relation to claims of fraud and then some, literally winning only one lawsuit entirely here in PA unrelated to fraud in the slightest and still not really giving him anything as a result.

His own government body, including individuals he has appointed himself such as Barr have stated literally no evidence of fraud in any form that could change the election outcome.

\----

&#x200B;

Whether you like it or not, the fact is this was a fair election.
