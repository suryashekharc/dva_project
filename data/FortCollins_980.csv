"Rarely do I do this, but you actually seem like a reasonable person, and I appreciate that. 
Do you think you, or I, or anyone for that matter really knows that much to “control” or even “direct” a community? This community, city, state… it has a life of its own. That’s not necessarily good or bad. It just is. 

I take issue with the perspectives on this Reddit, and many other CO Reddits, that seem to try and gatekeep who should or should not come here. 

People are coming here everyday (less so with the insane housing costs that make it to where our own teachers can’t live here), but they are going to come regardless. 

All the while, my friends are moving away. Because they cannot afford to really live here. Two kids in daycare costs 5k a month, IF you can get them in. Families are breaking. 
But if you know the area, history, want to work toward sustainability, etc…

I do understand the native heritage of Fort Collins. It's funny you mention that, I was going to include the portion in another comment to an alternate user. Again, I didn't say people shouldn't come here. They are welcome as long as they can appreciate the area for what it is, acknowledging past, present and future issues as a town.

It's really not a silly argument. Cities with such an influx of new populations can quickly lose cultures they have developed (the reason the individuals are moving here, in the first place). When I say contribute, I mean exactly what I said above. Go on a history tour of Old Town, help plant new trees when prompted, advocate for continued affordability of housing and continued updated infrastructure, to name four examples.

The aforementioned population increase is, without a doubt, increasing pollution and natural area wear.

"Hi, I just got a solar PV system installed here in Fort Collins. Its peak measured output is 6.5KW AC and near the equinox (right now in March 2022), I get 44KWH/day for a perfectly clear day as a benchmark. Clouds will make this lower of course. I don't think this will pay off as an investment, but I did this primarily as insurance against unexpected price spikes and blackouts. I will be soon be getting a 20KWH battery system installed and plan to take no energy from the grid during the expensive ToU hours. I might, however, dump to the grid during expensive ToU hours when I have sun and/or if it appears to make sense to dump the excess solar from the batteries into the grid at that time.

I suspect that the only way one make a solar PV system to have a long-term benefit to the grid and oneself is to include energy storage to dump excess solar energy during peak demand times. Since I'm currently using only about 12KWH/day and this could rise to about 20KWH/day with a roommate, I will likely have excess net energy production.",t2_7802bnba,montanaviking,0,1648182134.0,0,t1_i20ynb1,i20ynb1,False,infection-rally,t3_n0wpbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/n0wpbf/getting_residental_solar/,Getting Residental Solar,/r/FortCollins/comments/n0wpbf/getting_residental_solar/i20ynb1/,1,r/FortCollins,0,1

"**[Putin khuylo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putin_khuylo)** 
 
 >""Putin – khuylo""! (Russian: Пу́тин — хуйло́, IPA: [ˈputʲɪn xʊjˈlo]; Ukrainian: Пу́тін — хуйло́, IPA: [ˈput⁽ʲ⁾in xʊjˈlɔ]; extremely rude, commonly translated as ""Putin is a dickhead"") is a Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian slogan deriding Russian President Vladimir Putin. It originated in Ukraine in 2014 having grown from a football chant first performed by FC Metalist Kharkiv ultras and Shaktar Donetsk ultras in March 2014 on the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian War.

"Which is why people think it’s dangerous. Dive deeper into that research. The government is against kratom due to its ability to replace opioids for pain. They have been keeping people addicted to opioids so they can essentially turn people into cash pigs. So when they hear about a plant that grows in the ground, and is very cheap to process and ship, they start their censorship game.

Yes, kratom is a drug. 
No, it is not dangerous.
Yes, it is addictive.
No, withdrawals won’t be horrible, you’ll get a headache and won’t be able to sleep very well and your nose will run.

Basically it’s the same game they played with weed, except they are losing. There’s too much evidence to support the idea that it actually is helping people. More specifically, it’s helping people get off the opioids the doctors got them hooked on in the first place.

After three years of daily use *and quitting cold turkey* I’m more than thankful for the plant. Never had a bad experience with it and I used to take 20 grams a day. Sometimes more!

I quit a little over a month ago, no withdrawals, no negative side effects whatsoever. Nobody has died due to the plant, any death you hear of was a combination of other various drugs. The government hates this plant because, like weed, it has many properties that would eliminate certain medications that they make money off of.

Even an overdose of kratom will only lead to vomiting. It’s almost physically impossible to reach a lethal dose. The FDA has tried to ban it for years and years. They have failed due to the overwhelming support and positive evidence from the people.

"I would like to learn more about why the reasonable accommodation for this facility would be considered sketchy. From the residents speaking at the meeting it appeared that people were mostly concerned that it would destroy the character of their neighborhood, but if they were being legally muzzled from talking about the real underlying issue, I would definitely like to hear more.

Can you give me some idea of why this reasonable accommodation is sketchy?

You also claim they are 'real estate investors', but I looked at county records and they are only listed on one other house, which they appear to have owned since 2005. They don't appear to be buying up a ton of property to develop, at least not in Larimer County. Again, if you have information that I do not please let me know.

"Opioids and opiates are not the same thing. Related, sure, but not the same.  And as far as addicts using kava and kratom to help get off opiates, that isn't a bad thing.  They help ease the cravings and withdrawals, and are no where near as dibilitating. Methadone is worse than those 2.

Are they perfect substances? No.  But they are no where close to being as bad as an opiate. Those 2 things give such a mellow feeling, I wouldn't even consider it a euphoria. The worst thing you are really going to do is take too much and throw up.

And before you start to argue that those things can be addictive, so are a lot of things to some people.  Caffeine is addictive, but socially acceptable.

"Fun fact: they were made to *narrow* the entrances in order to reinforce that the drives onto College were one way in/out. There's also a minimum distance (which they met) the parking has to be from the College curb in order to allow room for cars to be able to stack if they need to wait while someone is parking/leaving. They also had to angle the parking in that first section to further reinforce that it was one-way travel. If I recall they also provided stacking for 9 cars in the drive-thru lane. Obviously that wasn't enough for their case...

I haven't seen what they've done with the second lane, but even if they had made a drive-thru stack next to the building and a 'clear' lane next to that and then parking.... you're always going to have the problem getting off College into the lot. No matter what you do, if it backs onto College even people who want to park aren't going to be able to get in to do so. Under your idea of widening, that gains you at most one car. UNLESS there's some kind of enforcement that if the drive-thru queue is full, you MUST continue on and a) park or b) circle around again. As long as a driver has a choice to 'extend' the drive-thru stack, you can't solve the problem from that end.",t2_xki0s,ac1dchylde,0,1648089438.0,0,t1_i1vslto,i1vslto,False,alltheusernamesargay,t3_tkm81m,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tkm81m/canes_drive_thru_is_just_dangerous/,Canes Drive thru is just dangerous.,/r/FortCollins/comments/tkm81m/canes_drive_thru_is_just_dangerous/i1vslto/,2,r/FortCollins,0,2

"And a prime example of how most people in this sub have no idea how things (especially zoning) actually work.

> the city needs to make sure that they never make a mistake like this again when they are approving properties for zoning.

The zoning was already there. The only time this would have any validity is for a rezone. Zones have *allowed uses*, and *drive-thru restaurant* is one for that zone. To deny that app based on zoning they'd have to remove that use from the zone, which means *everywhere* zoned that designation. What you're talking about are *development plan* approvals. And again, if it's an allowed use they'd have to deny it based on some other criteria, which leads me to...

> They need to make sure that all future restaurants on College have drive-thru lines that are adequate to the estimates of the traffic.

Guess what? They did. Estimates are just estimates. There is no way the city could have predicted *that* restaurant would have *that* many people in the drive-thru at once. I mean, according to this sub the food is shit, so unless you think someone at the city at the time should have known that Cane's was going to be extremely popular to the point of a statistical outlier... They do traffic studies. Those studies are based on specific numbers and trip generation and use. The study for that site is available for you to review. There's nothing that could possibly have told anyone Cane's would be a problem when the Wendy's, Panera Bread, Dairy Queen, or Taco Bell before them weren't. Similar vein, why is the Starbucks a problem but the two Human Beans aren't? Because...

Now if you want a practical demonstration of how this works, keep your eye on the proposed Krispy Kreme where Fazzoli's was. There was a drive-thru there before, and they're unlikely to change much. It wasn't really a problem for Fazzoli's. But Krispy Kreme? Everyone else in that entire block, on both sides, and likely out to and on College are going to be *pissed* if they get in there. You think Cane's and Starbucks are bad? Krispy Kreme will *destroy* traffic in the Harmony/College area. We've seen it happen elsewhere. But, that means telling Krispy Kreme that they can't come to Fort Collins period because we know they'll do that no matter where they go, and that their brand has to follow a different/higher standard because we know that brand will have tremendous trip generation. And you can do that, to a point...

Ultimately Cane's is to blame for their site selection. The city can only do so much to deny something (and for anyone who has actually followed development in Fort Collins long enough, you'd know they have done a *lot* to discourage and limit drive-thrus, especially in situations like that) before they are 'arbitrarily' discriminating against specific businesses.

Circling back to some of your options...

-1. The frontage road is a function of CDOT and both that and general access control for College are actually CDOT, not the city. Do they work together, yes. But CDOT is the actual authority there.

-2/3. It's already been pointed out but you're dumping excessive traffic on streets no designed to handle it, pissing off residential neighbors in the process, and violating a few other part of the code by doing that. If the street back there were not residential, or were larger (ie, collector) to be able to handle it, like Mason or JFK further south, that would be an option.

-4. Don't know in what manner they could make Cane's do this. Cane's could voluntarily do this in support of their customers but where the city stops is...

-5. Enforcement. Thing is, this is already there. You can't block a lane of traffic like that, and the cops *could* be enforcing it. They just aren't. Or so most people seem to think, but the research I did seemed to indicate that what they're doing *isn't* illegal, because they are making a legal turn and simply having to queue for it. But, even if it were, stationing one there would likely work for a short time, likely an off-duty officer with Cane's paying the overtime or something similar to say the church on Timberline. But this essentially relies on a) getting the message out to customers that blocking College won't be allowed any more and then continually enforcing it.

-6. Again, not really feasible in the current state. That's what that article the other week from CA was talking about, the that town was taking steps to declare it a public nuisance so they *did* have some authority by which to make such a change. The city can't just make such a proclamation unless there's some law or code or something being directly violated, and right now there isn't.",t2_xki0s,ac1dchylde,0,1648088755.0,0,t1_i1vr6si,i1vr6si,False,alltheusernamesargay,t3_tkm81m,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tkm81m/canes_drive_thru_is_just_dangerous/,Canes Drive thru is just dangerous.,/r/FortCollins/comments/tkm81m/canes_drive_thru_is_just_dangerous/i1vr6si/,2,r/FortCollins,0,2

"Hmmmm.  This is why it is so difficult to intelligently discuss this issue. Those advocating for wholesale adoption of alternate energy view it as religion. You can't argue religion because your religious beliefs can't be challenged.

"Thank you, I genuinely appreciate the edification. I may have swallowed too much of the urban legend around geese here in Fort Collins. Like I said the statements are based on my observations. I would say though that regardless of the species, geese (in the numbers found along the Northern Front Range) and humans beings concentrated around a resource that is as scarce as water is here on the Colorado Plateau are probably going to lead to some animosity no matter what. I will admit that shortsighted thinking like that is probably responsible for the loss of the native Grey Wolves here and the Lynx, Prairie-chicken, Sage-grouse along 14 or so other threatened or endangered species.

"So you're an advocate for reduced consumer demand vis a vis halting manufactured consent on the part of the owning class, via strict labor and productive regulation and collective ownership schemes? How enlightened of you comrade, welcome to the Marxist-Leninist left!

Edit: what I was getting at was balancing your bad faith critiques of sustainable energy sources with what you seemed to be implying, which was a critique of the ""infinite growth, infinite consumption"" model of neoliberal capitalism. I too agree that current production and consumption models are wildly unsustainable--the drastic changes of a ML economic and political model is realistically the only thing that could bring about that balance within anything resembling the rational and necessary timeframe. Take the EV case. Of course we can't just replace every ICE vehicle on the road with an EV, *because there's already orders of magnitude too many personal vehicles being used in the first place*. Without even bringing up the lithium or petroleum needed to make a Tesla, that should be the first criticism to begin with! In short, you were missing the forest for the trees, while also engaging in climate nihilism without the rationale to back it up.

"Hey there totally agree about these birds being a nuisance! As a bird nerd, I'm always in the mood to birdsplain/help folks learn little bird tidbits and I see an opportunity here.

> The worst part of this whole mess is that the resident geese that foul our parks and lakes and cause constant headaches on our roads here in Fort Collins aren't even ""Canadian Geese"". They are an invasive species brought here in 1957 by a ""wildlife conservationist"". They are much smaller than migratory Canadian geese that you will begin seeing later this month as they majestically fly along the front range. The difference between migratory geese and these mongrels is evident when you see them together and notice how much smaller they are.

You'll see a mix of Canada Geese and a separate species called [Cackling Geese](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Cackling_Goose/overview) here in Fort Collins.

Cackling Geese are the ones you're describing here as ""much smaller"" and they're actually the migratory population that comes in for the winter and then leaves back to the [Arctic](https://www.reporterherald.com/2014/02/20/cackling-geese-migrate-canada-geese-stay-put/).  Check out this [bar chart](https://ebird.org/barchart?byr=1900&eyr=2022&bmo=1&emo=12&r=US-CO-069) from birding megasource eBird showing what birds show up when around these parts (note the Cackling decline during the summer).  

So we have both resident and migrating Canada Geese, but moooostly just migrating Cackling Geese.  The introduced species was indeed the Canada Goose and it's quite difficult to determine resident vs migrating if you're looking at a Canada Goose flock during migration season. You'd mostly be able to tell by observing for nesting and general behavior over a longer period of time.  Or [brush up on your subspecies](https://coloradobirdrecords.org/Articles/status_of_cack_goose_co.pdf) well enough to ID what's sticking around all year.

Occasionally you'll see various hybrids between the two species, as well as hybrids with Snow Geese, Ross's Geese, and Greater White-fronted Geese.  Every so often we'll be treated to a Cackling-Goose-sized [Brant](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Brant/overview), which are plentiful on the coasts but rarities around here (there was one hanging out at City Park a few months ago!).",t2_670bf,BahRamYew,0,1648071801.0,0,t1_i1uo1j3,i1uo1j3,False,SnowGlobe17,t3_tk611c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tk611c/the_locals_here_astound_me/,The locals here astound me,/r/FortCollins/comments/tk611c/the_locals_here_astound_me/i1uo1j3/,2,r/FortCollins,0,2

"I actually had a bunch of suggestions for the city - I'm not sure how they square with street use or legal requirements, but they were ideas.

1. Require Canes to move the drivethrough line over to the Frontage Road south of the driveway entrance and move the sidewalk to match this.

2. Move the drivethru line to Remington - move the entire entrance over to Remington and make Remington a no-parking zone and put the drivers in a line in the parking spots that are on the west side of Remington.

3. Put in two drive-thru lanes on either side of the building and have all traffic exit on Remington instead of having the entrance and exit on College.

4. Require Canes post an employee on College who tells anyone who is blocking  College that they need to drive over to Remington and park and walk in and wait in a line of people who are standing.

5. Station a police officer on College near the entrance who will tell anyone who blocks traffic that they can't do that and tell them to move on.

6. Require that Canes either find a way to accommodate all of the cars waiting on their existing property - by acquiring nearby properties or otherwise - within a set period of time (one year) or else require that they move the entire restaurant to another site that is equipped to deal with the traffic requirements.

7. Permanently close the Canes drive-thru entirely and require that all customers, park and walk in the store for take-out.

And even if these are completely draconian and totally impractical ideas, definitely the city needs to make sure that they never make a mistake like this again when they are approving properties for zoning.   They need to make sure that all future restaurants on College have drive-thru lines that are adequate to the estimates of the traffic.",t2_b4blz,Eloquent_Cantaloupe,0,1648056211.0,0,t1_i1tj8sm,i1tj8sm,False,alltheusernamesargay,t3_tkm81m,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tkm81m/canes_drive_thru_is_just_dangerous/,Canes Drive thru is just dangerous.,/r/FortCollins/comments/tkm81m/canes_drive_thru_is_just_dangerous/i1tj8sm/,3,r/FortCollins,0,3

"Not a lawyer, but that's not how I understand this law. The first sentence refers to what horns you may/must have and how they can sound:

>Every motor vehicle, when operated upon a highway, shall be equipped with a horn in good working order and capable of emitting sound audible under normal conditions from a distance of not less than two hundred feet, but no horn or other warning device shall emit an unreasonably loud or harsh sound, except as provided in section 42-4-213 (1) in the case of authorized emergency vehicles or as provided in section 42-4-222.

And the second sentence refers to when and how you can use the horn:

>The driver of a motor vehicle, when reasonably necessary to ensure safe operation, shall give audible warning with the horn but shall not otherwise use such horn when upon a highway.

The two are distinct rules. So you can't honk at random people on the sidewalk (second sentence), and you also can't have an unnecessarily loud horn no matter what you use it for (first sentence).",t2_cjk3to7,shagthedance,0,1648006396.0,0,t1_i1r3i60,i1r3i60,False,AreUFreeFridayNight,t3_tju16k,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tju16k/i_thought_i_recognized_the_area_haha/,I thought I recognized the area... haha,/r/FortCollins/comments/tju16k/i_thought_i_recognized_the_area_haha/i1r3i60/,3,r/FortCollins,0,3

"Ugh. Every community has hate, but Laporte is not the Laporte you are remembering with the Berg killing/the Order/Peter Peters stuff. Peters is long dead, but his hate church still stands but has removed all signage due to constant tagging etc. We might be closer to Wellington vs Fort Collins these days, but Laporte is mostly awesome these days. Ever been to Me Oh My Pie?

Of course those people exist here, but saying no minority should ever step foot in Laporte these days is crazy, crazy. A local artist is a person of color and she has had some bad experiences that bring shame to our community but she also has had a lot of fine to great experiences.

"! THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM THAT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE !

My comments here may possibly upset some people but please hear me out and read to the end before jumping to conclusions. I would love to hear what others have to say (agree or disagree).

The worst part of this whole mess is that the resident geese that foul our parks and lakes and cause constant headaches on our roads here in Fort Collins aren't even ""Canadian Geese"". They are an invasive species brought here in 1957 by a ""wildlife conservationist"". They are much smaller than migratory Canadian geese that you will begin seeing later this month as they majestically fly along the front range. The difference between migratory geese and these mongrels is evident when you see them together and notice how much smaller they are.

[https://www.coloradoan.com/story/life/2017/03/06/father-goose-fort-collins-goose-population/98640248/?msclkid=59ab7f3aaa0911ec86e604b80eec9dd0](https://www.coloradoan.com/story/life/2017/03/06/father-goose-fort-collins-goose-population/98640248/?msclkid=59ab7f3aaa0911ec86e604b80eec9dd0)

Love the or hate them they are in fact a transplanted species that don't belong in this eco-system and cause much damage while providing absolutely no value. Originally brought here to provide ""hunting"" opportunities but these mutts are so full of fertilizer they ingest eating grass in our parks and ball fields they may very well be toxic to eat. Since most never leave town they can't be hunted anyway there no value from that. They are creating huge problems in the lakes around town depositing their fertilizer laden crap (along with what is already being deposited by urban runoff) making most lakes and gravel pits in the area unfishable. I used to enjoy grabbing a rod and walking or biking to a local pit for a couple of hours of fishing on a weeknight (now between the geese, the idiots who trash our public lands and the homeless that is becoming a distant memory).

Despite the best efforts of municipalities to get rid of them including the geese police chasing them out of parks, golf courses and off ponds with Goosinators (Google it if you haven't seen one), and using stuffed coyotes to keep them off city ball fields all they have managed to do is relocate them to cause problems in other areas. 

Sorry to those who seem to enjoy them but they are the equivalent of European doves here, Iguanas, and Pythons in Florida, Killer Bees all over the country, now Murder Hornets in the Pacific North West and so many other invasive and destructive species. There are many other natural local species of animals to enjoy.

I am not a wildlife biologist and no doubt have gotten some facts wrong here. These are my observations and opinions as a sportsman, avid hunter, and fisherman in the area. I don't have the answer to ending this plague on our Northern Front Range cities but it only seems to get worse every year and will continue to until we take some permanent action. I do not propose any kind of vigilantism or cruelty of any sort, but I would support some sort of official humane permanent solution to the problem.",t2_iioeiroc,Ikickhobbits,0,1647975354.0,0,t1_i1p35du,i1p35du,True,SnowGlobe17,t3_tk611c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tk611c/the_locals_here_astound_me/,The locals here astound me,/r/FortCollins/comments/tk611c/the_locals_here_astound_me/i1p35du/,10,r/FortCollins,0,10

"Sure, I definitely don't disagree. I guess we'll see, but in my view the material trends in this town are moving towards a fixed landed gentry (in full collaboration with the sclerotic town council, corrupt police and borderline sociopathic elites like OtterBox and Bohemian) in the form of boomer retirees and out-of-state landlords; college kids paying rent out the nose because they have loans and are too young to care; the actual working and service class pushed out to satellite communities; and creatives getting lost in the shuffle.

"I've had dogs since 1988 - 34 years, now. I can't begin to count the miles I've hiked and walked with bags of dog poop in my pocket, pack, or hand. I've always considered it just part of having dogs. (I even made an iron-on with a graphic that reads ""I hike with poop"".) I not only get bent out of shape when others don't bag their poop, but also when they do...and then leave the bag by the side of the trail. Take it with you. It doesn't matter if you're ""planning on coming back that way"" and you think you'll pick it up then. The second it hits the ground, it's litter, and everyone else has to deal with it - other people, wildlife, other dogs, etc. And it gets forgotten, missed, people end up making a loop, or whatever. Sometimes I get inspired and carry out other peoples' dog poop, but other times I just think doing that teaches people that someone else will clean up after them. I don't know what the solution is, but once you start doing it (picking up your dog's poop), it just becomes habit and after a while you can't imagine not doing it.

"Hi there, I have a lot to say about the company. I was a CSR and was let go in January after experiencing a mental health crisis. They fired me while I had an ADA claim open and while I was commuting home from the hospital after a voluntary 72 hour hold. They knew I was sick, and that I was going. I was fired for not meeting my compliance metric, but I wasn’t hitting compliance due to the fact that I was having consistent panic attacks at work. 

Systems break consistently, and sometimes they don’t get fixed for months due to systems being so outdated that they can’t handle the fixes that IT attempts to implement. The extra work that needs to be done by a CSR and the CSS team when this occurs is what led me to burnout. I was taking upwards of 1,000 calls per month, though. I was suicidal, largely due to the job. 

I wrote the head of the customer service department with feedback in December. The response I received was largely corporate, and promoted the the toxic positivity culture that runs rampant throughout the company. 

The pros: good benefits, volunteer time off (paid), and an excellent PTO accrual.

"For longer than not, I primarily drove a rear wheel drive geo prism and Toyota tercel. These are not winter cars and they had all season tires.

In the winter it can be good to keep a spare tire, electric tire pump, cat litter, mini metal shovel, jumper cables, blankets, gloves, hats, and flares or lights are a bonus.

Being dumb and driving in blizzards, I got stuck a hand full of times but was always able to get out with some shoveling and traction. Likewise, I've helped pull and dig quite a few other people too. So even if you don't need it, you could really help someone if it's on hand.

"Couldn't agree more, it's generational, cultural and more often than not learned at home by example, but the hatemongering of the last few years has reignited it, made it seem more socially acceptable, and empowered these idiots because they live in an echo-chamber and somehow think that everyone believes the same bullshit they do. It's mind control pumped by Fox, OAN, and all the vitriolic webcasts on the internets. These people don't realize that their new messiahs revealing the truth that has been hidden from them for so long just want to sell them hats, tee-shirts, and flags, or pump them for campaign contributions, until they bilk them out every last cent of their $692/week paychecks, and they can't pay their lot rent at the trailer park. They simply parrot what they hear and use these odious symbols of a dark past oblivious to what they stand for. I can pretty much guarantee you they haven't ever had a history or political science course beyond perhaps Junior high school civics and have no concept of what the symbol represents but they think it's shocking and besides it's easy to draw. It likely wasn't an ""adult"" (I use the term loosely) any way but this is the environment an entire generation is growing up in and you have to wonder what's next for them.

"As someone actually from here, it's pretty safe to say Fort Collins is less ""weird"" than it used to be. A major example of this would be Tour de Fat, which used to have a legitimate subversive energy to it--now it's corporatized and ticketed and a fraction of what it used to be, to the extent it happens at all. Similar example are some CSU traditions like the nudie run and the parties out at Hughes Stadium; legendary tailgates, epic bike caravans out to it, freaking Bob Dylan played there, that's literally the counter culture. I'd say the best current manifestation is FocoMX, which is the shit. Every spring and summer weekend should be like that, not just the one. Foco Bike Mob is doing some good work too. 


But, due to the convergence bias of transplants and transplant-adjacent out-of-state students--CSU historically has had 70, 80% in-state enrollment, CU was always more the magnet for OOS--this city is more homogenized than not these days.

"I go to CSU, and for the most part the religious nuttery is actually negligible compared to most other colleges I've experienced. It's also worth pointing out that the more liberal the institution, the more likely those people will be there to ""turn folks away from their sins.""

If anything, the business college is a bigger issue than the stump guy. Or, was, until stump guy beat the shit out of a queer kid.

"Why is it illegal to fly in this area?   I also checked B4UFLY right now and there's no guidance on this area.   And then I went to DJI's Fly Safe website and there is also no guidance on this area.

B4UFLY's - the FAA's official app - says this about the appoximate area that OP is flying in ""Clear for Takeoff, no active advisories.  Maintain situational awareness"". 

https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/b4ufly/

Where do you show it as restricted?

And I'm not even saying you are wrong  - I'm saying ""where did you find that out from?"" because B4UFLY is actually not that great an app.   It's the best one out there that I know of and it has a lot of missing information.   For example, you can't find in Fort Collins Natural Areas, or Colorado State Parks, or over Wilderness Areas and none of these are shown or mentioned in B4UFLY.   Aside from National Parks, the FAA primarily seems only concerned with air traffic safety and it mostly shows restricted airspace for issues of air travel safety.    So where does it say you can only fly a drone in one of 10 areas in Arapahoe National Forest?  Google isn't showing me anything.

This is all I could find - and it says ""follow FAA rules"" and then has a link off to the FAA's B4UFLY website : https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/fire/aviation/uas",t2_b4blz,Eloquent_Cantaloupe,0,1647848764.0,0,t1_i1i7j5a,i1i7j5a,False,[deleted],t3_tj45q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tj45q0/surfing_the_poudre_canyon_with_dji_fpv/,Surfing the Poudre Canyon with DJI FPV,/r/FortCollins/comments/tj45q0/surfing_the_poudre_canyon_with_dji_fpv/i1i7j5a/,1,r/FortCollins,0,1
