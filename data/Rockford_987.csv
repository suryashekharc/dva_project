"Have you checked out FB marketplace? It seems that all the good used, low priced vehicles are now being posted there over other online marketplaces. There are also groups relative to the price and year you are looking for that can yield more results.

With any used vehicle purchase, inspection is paramount but also is a thorough document review to check for accidents, liens and other deal breakers. It's best to buy a vehicle through private sale and often, FB marketplace will have a significant number of private sellers over other online platforms that dealerships inundate with listings. Buying an economical and practical vehicle for your specific needs is always best over a luxury or performance one, the depreciation and repair costs are much higher. If you are looking for specific questions to ask in any vehicle purchase see the link below:

"I'm familiar with this. The problem that I have with flag design contests, in general, is that the designs make really cool merch or really cool logos, but fail to be flags.

Think of the Pepsi logo, for example. Popping it onto a flag sans text of any sort meets the rules of flag design, but /r/vexillology still hates the thought since it's a logo on a sheet.

That's what a lot of the designs people came up with were, logos. Not flags representing a city or its people. The current flag does that well enough, being a logo I mean.

I was thinking about Rockford's colors as a sports identity in a growing midwestern city, and realized that this city really does not have any identity, at all. There's cool stuff here, and there's some cultural and historical artifacts, but there's nothing to tie it together.

"In my opinion, there are 3 distinct colors of our city.  
Rockford Red is the color assigned to the metal sculpture known as ""Symbol"" - you've probably seen it as you cross the Auburn St Bridge, or walked the bike path.

Since Rockford has also been known as the Forest City, one should also add Green to the list of the colors of Rockford.  Much more forested before the Dutch Elm Disease and mitigation caused the destruction of many of our city's trees, we still remain a city of parks and parkways.

Finally, since Rockford is named after the ""fording"" - aka crossing - of the Rock River, we should also consider a dark blue as one of the colors of our city.

Those would be my three candidates, and the ones I'd recommend for any flag design, should one be interested in creating a city flag.",t2_251fi66w,hcaneandrew,0,1647402853.0,0,t1_i0udmn2,i0udmn2,True,Kerithlan,t3_tf7zdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockford/comments/tf7zdc/what_are_rockfords_colors/,What are Rockford's colors?,/r/rockford/comments/tf7zdc/what_are_rockfords_colors/i0udmn2/,14,r/rockford,0,14

"I disagree.  The casino will offer more types of gambling, and will entice more people.  The point being, this community really has the bar set low.  A casino is the best they can do?

What correlation are you looking for?  Drugs use is a problem in Rockford.  Whether it be legal or illegal, is this the best your community can do? What exactly has improved since pot was legally sold in Rockford?  Where is the owner of the dispensary from? Have ANY of the forecasted financial benefits materialized?

The bigger question is why anyone would be resistant?  Maybe there's no incentive to be a productive member of this community.   No one is is panhandling to display their First Amendment rights.  They're there because the reward is better than the alternative of working in their mind.  If they can't work, who is helping them get to the resources they need?  It's not your cops trying to ""serve and protect"".  They drove right by and stopped at Starbucks, pretending like they didn't see.

"Since there are already so many slot parlors now, I don't think a casino is going to increase the number of resident gamblers.  The casino will most likely take existing gamblers from the slot parlors.

Cannabis has been legal for a few years, and there has been no documented correlation between crime and cannabis.  Crack and narcotics, are a totally different thing.  

The thing to remember about working with homeless people, is there is a segment that is resistant to help for various reasons.  These agencies cannot legally compel anyone to participate.  This segment is then held up as how the ""system"" is broken.  Actually, I've seen fewer homeless in my area the last few years.  The City is limited on what they can do about panhandlers, because of the law that allows it under free speech.  Don't assume these panhandlers are homeless.

Lived here for 6 years. No neighbor noise and decent area (sinnissippi park and trails are highlights), but they took away a LOT of amenities over the years and significantly increased rent. 

Management and maintenance are not great. They had a pipe burst and literally 4 feet of water come through the garage into the basement. Several cars and storage units completely ruined.

They have also had AC completely stop working in the middle of the summer. All of this within the last couple years (I've been gone since 2018). I personally had my car broken into and had frequently seen and reported car prowlers in that parking lot.

"I helped a local group that did warranty work for Samsung TVs like a decade ago. In short, the contract was not renewed because it was almost always cheaper to send these people a new TV than pay for gas and a couple of hours of our time along with the part. Replacing an LED strip is one of the more labor intensive fixes and I would be surprised if anybody wanted to do it for much less than what you could buy a basic TV for. Modern TVs are not made to be fixed. 

Replacing capacitors was usually the only thing that required soldering, so it might be worth your time if you have something to lift the panel and a couple hours to burn. Almost everything inside is made easy to connect for quick assembly.

There was also an incredible amount of misdiagnosis, but that's another topic.

Edit: I saw a comment reply the whole screen is black. The LED stuff I saw (and remember) was they were in strips. You might have a power supply issue. Don't take my word for it.

"I wish I knew how absolutely awful Homes Now is as a company. Seriously do everything you can to avoid renting from them. I know the low rent is tempting but they are beyond awful. 

Maintenance requests are often ignored. (I reported a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm that was never fixed) and there will be very little snow or ice removal. The entire year and a half I was there the buildings washing machine was filled with moldy clothes and was inoperable. When I finally had enough and put in my notice to vacate I actually had an office employee tell me that they would contact me if any potential new renters wanted to view the apartment. (Their policy is to send unattended applicants out with keys) This is not written in the lease and obviously made me (a young woman living alone at the time) feel very unsafe.

Also avoid private landlords (unless you know them personally or they come highly recommended) Many are seedy. I once went on a viewing with a landlord who openly admitted to posting property rental ads for properties of his that were already occupied because he quote “was going to raise the rent and I’m pretty sure they won’t stay if I do” 

Look for properties with a reputation for fair policies and tenants who have stayed for years. If we have to provide references why shouldn’t they?! If you know a current tenant ask them for their honest feedback. These generally well liked places often aren’t advertised as frequently in apartment finder or Zillow. It pays to reach out rental management to see if they have any upcoming rentals a few months in advance. 

Get everything in writing! Seriously it pays to keep an email and text exchanges between yourself and a landlord or property manager. Even if you feel like you are repeating yourself make sure everything is spelled out clearly in writing. 

Start looking early if you are able. When I first moved to the area I was a full time student who just needed to find an ok place to stay.

"But do you know why it doesn't? I've looked this up and this is what I found. 

The Chicago style hot dog came to be right at the tail end of the Great Depression. It was a cheap way to get a meal with meat, veggies, and bread. So they started selling them everywhere which meant every butcher and meat packer in Chicago started making them. 

When the Depression started to slack off and people started to have money again, they didn't buy hot dogs as much, but the butchers didn't immediately correct their production amounts. This meant that some hot dogs started spoiling. The meat packers didn't want to lose the money, so they still sold the slightly expired dogs. Those that couldn't afford to buy better food yet still bought the questionable hot dogs and **added ketchup to the traditional toppings to mask the weirdly sweet taste of slightly off meat**.  

This practice gained traction amongst the lower classes. Soon the places that regularly sold good hot dogs heard about the practice as well and putting ketchup on the dog became an insult to them.  They viewed people putting ketchup on a hot dog as that person saying ""Your meat tastes spoiled"" instead of as people saying ""I like ketchup on my hot dog."" 

So it came to be that in Chicago you only put ketchup on the hot dog if it tastes like shit or if you're a kid.",t2_ea7rg,gamenut89,0,1645709878.0,0,t1_hy8m7vc,hy8m7vc,False,naenaejuice,t3_syx101,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockford/comments/syx101/fellow_rockfordigans_im_looking_for_the_best/,Fellow rockfordigans!

Yes, mental health and drug addiction are issues, but that doesn't create an obligation for a property owner to have their rental properties trashed.  A landlord isn't responsible for peoples' mental issues or addictions and has no obligation to provide them housing to destroy.

"Nae Nae Juice? Great to see you on the thread again, very cultured and driptastic of you to stop by and leave us a little sneak peak of what goes on inside of your mind. I’d like to say, your CRJ fandom is driving me bonker due to how impressed I am. I would like to think I am the #1 CRJ stanny boy but I think you deserve that title for sure.( please send link to CRJ plush toy). I’d also like to put on record I am an avid listener to AJR and any song that is remotely relevant to Pokémon or Digimon, I’m quite the jack of all trades in that sense. I’ve mastered the Digimon world and have stepped into the Pokémon light in 2007, prepandemic. I have noticed postpandemic the lifestyle of Pokémon has changed and taken on many nuances.

"> choice I *paid* the mark

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"I hear you and you make good points. N95 masks are amazing. Here's the problem. Wearing the same N95 mask all day is pointless because it's filthy by the evening time. Really you need a couple per day, at least two. So everyone in this country needs several N95 masks for the week. Say 14 or however many. Multiply that by 350 million. Where are we going to get all those masks? And wouldn't it be selfish for us as a rich country to hoard hundreds of millions, realistically billions of masks for ourselves and not share? We simply cannot produce the number of masks to make it make sense. Masks mandates at the end of the day do more harm than good.
