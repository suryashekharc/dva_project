"Downtown Davenport or Rock Island - gives you the option to walk to restaurants/bars. If you don‚Äôt drive it‚Äôs easy to hop on a bus. If you do drive and feel comfortable in the Augie area, the apartments above the old Cool Beanz building are really nice and affordable from what friends told me. Downtown Moline is pretty nice too, especially if you enjoy bike riding. The bike path out there by the river is really nice and gives good access to the rest of the QC - downtown Moline also has more grocery stores compared to Rock Island and Davenport (both are basically food deserts).    
  
Also idk, there‚Äôs very few neighborhoods around here where you‚Äôd truly be in danger (unless you‚Äôre obviously very wealthy). Most people in the QC are friendly and just trying to live their lives haha.

"Eh, overall if you've seen ""trouble areas"" before in towns big or small, you already know what and where to avoid by looking at it.  Crime can be anywhere by anyone, but QC is pretty safe from what I've experienced.  Worked for Dish for about 4 years out here and I've seen a lot of the good and the bad.

Otherwise, best pizza (to a Midwesterner from near Rockford) goes to both Poor Boys in Rock Island, or Sports Fans in Bettendorf.  Can't stand QC-style pizza.  It's weird.

Steel Plow in Moline has some good burgers, wouldn't say they're the best, but if you're celebrating something and want a memorable experience; order one of their shakes.  Insane.

Whitey's hands down has the best ice cream.  No competition. 

Soi 3 in Davenport is our go-to ramen place when we're feeling like some delicious pain (some of it is very spicy)

LeClaire has a Mississippi River Distilling Company which is absolute fire during summer.  Great seats with a river view and some of the best mixed drinks I've had.

Front Street Brewery in downtown Davenport is great, haven't tried the food (if they have any, I dunno).

And make sure you don't speed anywhere on Iowa side.  Especially LeClaire.  You want speed cameras?  You got 'em.

"I love a lot of the food in the QC, but here's some, say, unusual things I like that people seem to get mad at every once in a while. I think if I have to die on a hill it better be a controversial choice, nobody is going to kill me over liking Lunardi's.

1. Chicken Enchilada at Rudy's - I used to work there in high school so there's a nostalgia aspect, and also it's drenched in cheese and huge. I know Rudy's is not good Mexican food but I think people miss the boat with this observation. There are plenty of places to get good Mexican, so I think Rudy (or whoever started it) decided to go completely in the opposite direction of authentic. Rudy's is so Americanized that it's now something completely different. I always think of it like the restaurant version of what my one aunt brings to a family reunion, and that's fine by me.
2. Whitey's Cherry Bon Bon Sundae is the most unique thing on their menu and is criminally underrated. They have lots of good stuff but I always tease my wife when she gets something like a Cookie Dough Shake because that kind of thing is the one way to make Whitey's taste like everywhere else. 
3. Uncle Bill's, to my taste buds, is distinct from and better than Wise Guys. It's a close race but I give it to Uncle Bill's. Yes, it's possible my brain is making me think there's a difference. Also, this opinion changes all the time so I don't know if I'd die for it.
4. I would eat at Trattoria Tiramisu over Lunardi's, it's much more interesting.

"Unemployment for decades was set at 13 weeks.  It has been extended a couple of times since 2009 and for the main reason of recessions and covid.

Saying that you cannot get find a new job at this time within 4 months (16 weeks) is definitely a sad state of how you feel about those who lost their job.  Unemployment is a terrible wage to try to get by on and it should be encouraged to get another job which certainly pays better.

"Having lived in Illinois most of my time in the quad cities, and working in Iowa. I filed my own taxes with the turbo. The chain stores charge way to many zeros. I filed/printed both Iowa and Illinois. And snail mail both of them. I included a letter in the Iowa one, claiming reciprocity. And claimed any and all taxes paid to be reimbursed. Soon enough a check or deposit is made in your account. Then you just pay Illinois taxes, Or vice versa. Do it with enough time on either end so they won‚Äôt be late. They love adding past due amounts daily for the time the check is going through the mail.

"You would look at Google for something like ""tif report LeClair Iowa"". You do that and see that in 2018 the state of Iowa compiled a list of the tif for all localities in the state.

You then further refine your search and start looking for an updated version of that report, hopefully for 2022, but 2021 is probably more available.

While looking at that, you may notice that the DOM branch of Iowa.gov also has interesting keywords relating to TIF for a 2023 fiscal year, and then might want to start branching into those areas.


Along the way, you very well may find out that specific Iowa employees are doing specific things to tif reporting - like doing the compiling of the eastern Iowa data.

"Yeah. I'm telling you all this not to be snarky or anything, but they really are simple.

Get the parts online from rock auto. They will be cheaper than the auto parts store.

Please watch a video on it but it's gonna be super simple.

Loosen lug nuts, Jack car up, place car on jack stand, take off lug nuts, remove tire, most likely 2 bolts holding the calipers in, take those off but keep caliper in place, remove brake fluid line, remove caliper, use C clamp to make sure new caliper is all the way in, place on rotor, install new brake pads using the old caliper as a guide, install the 2 bolts, install the brake line, bleed the brakes, tire on, lug nuts on, lower car, tighten lugnuts.

You're looking at like 5 lug nuts, 2 bolds, 1 nut on the brake like, and 1 nut on the break release.

"Can't help but have some advice. 

Calipers are very simple, since they need to come off anyway when replacing the brakes. Most of the time, they only have a single brake fluid line attached to them.

If you can change your brakes, you can change you calipers.

Jack (and preferably a jack stand), wrench for lug nuts, socket set, new brakes and calipers, some extra brake fluid, and a c clamp or something similar and you're all set.

"You're correct about the pricing by the book. That's what goes on at dealerships. Those book prices are based off what an engineer at the manufacturer says the length of time is required to accomplish whatever task at hand. 

Some independent shops use those book prices and charge like you talked about. If the book says 2 hours they'll charge for 2 hours if it only takes the mechanic 15 minutes. 

Some don't. Lots of independent wrenches charge for the time they got into whatever the job may be. They might quote you for that job from the price book though, it's always better to overestimate the cost of something and have the final bill come in lower than the quote.

Either way shop labor ain't cheap. At the very low end you're looking at $80‚Å∞‚Å∞/labor +parts +fluids +disposal fees. Body work cost significantly more. I also wouldn't recommend using aftermarket body parts because they usually don't fit right.

Also the markup on parts is dependent upon the shop when you go to an independent place as well.

I work on most of my own stuff. However, I refuse to mess with U-joints and drum brakes. The guys I take certain jobs like that to have no problem with me bringing in my own parts either.

"Moving out of Kimberly Club today, actually! Lol. I lived here about 3 years, and it was alright! I have a 2 bed, 1 bath, and the rent is about $845, but I was on a 6-month lease, so it was $50 more a month. Bedroom sizes are decent and the closests are a good size, kitchen is pretty small and not much room for storage. Also, no pantry, and that killed me, haha. Parking is not super great, but if only the people with parking passes park in your lot, it's not bad at all. 

You can get a garage for something like $60/month, but they're in need of a little restoring at some places. 

There are typically 2 washers and 2 dryers in each building, and each building usually has 12 apartments in it, so laundry can get busy at times. $2.00 / wash,  $0.25 / 10 mins dry time. A little expensive, in my opinion, as they just raised it from $1.00. It's one of the reasons why I'm leaving. 

They pay for heat, so living here in the winter is great! They are also pretty good about taking care of the sidewalks and parking lot with ice and snow. 

Mail is in the lowest level of the building, which is nice. But the main door to the building is locked, and FedEx rarely leaves packages anymore. Only the USPS delivery people have a key to the building. 

In the winter, my utility bills are usually less than $30. In the summer, my AC runs a lot (I've got leaky windows, too), and it's not uncommon for me to have a $80-90 electric bill. (I like the apartment at 67 at night). 

Mediacom is your only choice for internet and it's hit or miss.  

The majority of my issues were the neighbors. We have at least 1 apartment that constantly smokes weed and it just stinks up the whole building. It's a non-smoking campus in general, but when we would call to complain about the smell, nothing was ever done about it. The neighbors can make your life miserable anywhere though, so you may be totally fine. 

Noise between apartments usually isn't bad, but if there are screaming children, you're likely to hear them. 

I love how close to I-74 it is. It makes getting around town a lot faster than other places I've lived. HyVee Fast and Fresh at the intersection is a major blessing! The full HyVee is really close by too and hardly takes any time to get to it if there's no traffic on Kimberly. It's maybe 8 mins from Walmart too so it's a really nice area for getting places quickly. 

That was a lot and I'm very opinionated, but please feel free to DM me with any other questions.",t2_7tkek1l,Emmanemanem,0,1647608065.0,0,t1_i15b3ex,i15b3ex,True,Minespidurr,t3_tgypp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/tgypp9/looking_for_an_apartment_in_davenport/,Looking for an apartment in Davenport,/r/QuadCities/comments/tgypp9/looking_for_an_apartment_in_davenport/i15b3ex/,11,r/QuadCities,0,11

"Since ""good"" is subjective, besides ordering online from Saratoga Wine Exchange (I'm in IL and wine can be shipped here; not sure about Iowa), I've found Costco is actually the best place for wine I like. I'm an Italian red wine snob, for what it's worth, and they have DOC/G over there often, and their Kirkland brand of wine? Usually pretty good; not always, but I really like their Prosecco, Malbec for when I'm wanting something spicy, and their Pinot Grigio is pretty tasty.

"Because if the fit is garbage, you are going to bitch.

It‚Äôs bad enough insurance companies are putting aftermarket replacement bumpers on damn near everything. So they buy the bumper, paint it, install it, And when it doesn‚Äôt fit right, then they take pictures, send back to insurance company, to approve an actual OEM bumper, re-mix paint, paint the new bumper, and install it.

And sometimes it still doesn‚Äôt fit worth a shit, but you‚Äôre stuck with it.

If you would be open and upfront about not trying to hold them liable or drag them through the mud when your bumper doesn‚Äôt fit worth a shit, they‚Äôd likely be a lot more willing to help. Other option is they might paint it for you, and then let you take it home to put on yourself.

If we aren‚Äôt talking a bumper or fender that just bolts/clips on though, it‚Äôs a whole new ballgame.

"This is actually a really underappreciated way to meet good hearted people. Sure you get some who have to be there because of court, obligation to programs, schools and what not; but generally when you see people just help to help, they are that way in multiple ways of their lives. 

I always hate doing volunteer work but when I'm done I feel good and want to do more. It's always the issue of my time versus theirs and that's where I have to place my family value over others unfortunately. 

Now we have as a family done it. And it was fun. But as individuals, it definitely drags sometimes. 

To piggyback off you a bit more, the other huge thing is most of this type of work is low risk stuff, so you usually can talk. Great way to make friends, get to know people, and make yourself know.  

I will say, doing it for the churches feels good, but personally led me to a ton of future obligations I didn't want tied down to, and sometimes I would, sometimes I wouldn't. But everytime I wouldn't, they'd use my personality against me, guilt trip me, just always made me feel bad for saying no. But that's not all churches. 

I'm not religious either. So sometimes it makes awkward conversation to some folks. 

But, food banks are a great place. So is homeless shelters, most however don't use volunteers or when they do it's a small amount. 

Another place, and please, these people need it. Nursing homes. So many lonely old folks who want friends, and all their friends have forgotten them, moved on, visit sometimes or passed. There's a few around here where the people love young kids and adults coming. 

Ridgecrest I have sang for them during Christmas. We went to CASI for a game day, helped them play Wii Bowling. 
They love that stuff. We all should. But, I can honestly say, as I've grown, I've forgotten. And I can see why Nursing homes are kind of a dark place to be, you just have people watching you. Some care. But that feeling of being alone, being around others who you know will one day wake up dead... It's morbid. So, some young life coming in can make a huge impact on someone older. Everyone wants the best for the future, so bringing them yourself is showing them there is still caring in the future. 

My folks are getting up there in age. I don't want to see them being lonely or feel like my wife and I don't love them, so I'd hope if a situation like this was to ever happen, I could take care of them, or I could surround them with joy and love from others who could be there at times I can't. 

The older I get, and my parents, the more I see how fragile our lives really are, and what I've taken for granted. It's never too late to make the changes you want to see. 

Lose weight. Get healthy. Volunteer. Make someone smile.

"I feel absolutely attacked hahahaha!

You're not wrong by any means about the view of the stars out here a bit south of Aledo! Most Quad Citians would probably be quite amazed at the difference in the night sky when you get out here where the hoot owls fuck the chickens and away from all the street lights. Standing at Highway 94 and 40th Ave (about 5 minutes south of Aledo) you can see billions of stars directly over head and the lights of the QC, Aledo, Galesburg, Monmouth, Burlington, and Muscatine all glowing on the horizon. If the clouds are just right there's nights you can pick out Peoria glowing off in the distance past Galesburg. 

Although we're not all complete savages, there's most definitely banjos playing in the distance on a quiet night.... or it might be the sounds of meth cooking that you're hearing. Sometimes its hard to tell the difference

"I have five tattoos from three different shops in the area! Tooth and Nail for all around great work, Happy Cat Tattoo for the super nice staff, Chelsea (formerly known as Mama Chew) does extremely detailed line work, but her books are always solid booked. And finally, Silver Key has many great artists, including my personal artist, Josh, and is pretty nice!

If you're not picky, I'd say go to Ben at Tooth and Nail! He did an amazing job on the pieces I got from him, and the staff there is amazing. Beware though, Ben likes Ska music!!!

The other three tattoos are from Josh Kilby, who I recommend to everyone who wants custom work and doesn't mind someone who is kind of a quiet concentration type. He killed all three of my other tattoos, and last I heard, he was at Silver Key in Davenport. Here's his Instagram to take a look at his work:

"Lived in Davenport my whole life and your response is pretty good as far as restaraunt recommendations! There are some pretty shady places in the Quad Cities, but there are so many great places, too.

I personally recommend a handful of locally owned restaraunts - Los Agaves for Mexican fare, Grinder's for Italian-American food, Red Ginger for Sushi and Teriyaki, Olde Towne Bakery... there are many that I can think of.

"Bud, I don't have to show anything. Your willful ignorance and laziness is **not** my nor anyone else's responsibility. It's on **you** to educate yourself. But since you want to be right regardless of what you know (and therefore won't), I'll pick one of your concerns and give you a quick education off the top of my head:

When Trump brokered the deal at the table with OPEC, Russia, et al, in 2020, they removed and shutdown 10% of the world's oil production - especially in Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia. It takes *time* to ramp some of those services back up. Luckily, part of our own homeland deal kept Canadian and US producers restocking our own reserves to save jobs, as well, so our North American facilities were not as impacted and our reserves didn't take a hit. Regardless, the only reason for doing so was bc the PPB hit about $30 instead of the average of about $100. Now, why that sucked, besides the fact it killed our wonderfully low domestic gasoline prices we were enjoying there for a hot minute? Well like I said, it takes time to turn the pipes back in and along with some other global politics and the continuing pandemic, we saw our PPB price soar after Covid restrictions started easing up prior to all this as facilities and distribution issues tried to catch up to the surge in demand.

With me so far? Okay, now let's hit the other angle. The vast majority of Russia's oil is what we call High Sulfur (HS) oil, aka sour crude, sometimes referred to as Brent-Ural grade. Our west coast refineries are mostly engineered to handle HS crude, so we import Russian HS for a host or reasons (I'll touch on it in the next part). How much oil do we import? Well, if you do a quick google search, it looks like 7% of our imported oil is from Russia - but that's a misnomer. MOST of that is LNG and other petroleum products that have nothing to do with the gas at our pumps, *not* HS crude (we take somewhere between 190-220k barrels of *actual* oil a day, whereas that 7% is something like 600-700k barrels). The kicker? Because of the high sulfur and H2S content, *the majority of this HS is not even refined into gasoline**. It's just too corrosive and expensive to refine the contaminants out (we do get some heavy diesel out of it, but I'm not explaining how cracking towers work here).

So to wrap this up. Due to something called the Jones Act, along with physical pipeline restrictions, means that our HS refineries can't get US HS crude to them simply because of shipping restrictions between US ports and US flagged vessels (I can spend a whole nother book on just this Act and distribution logistics, but by now you've stopped reading so why bother). *However*, Dept of Homeland Security or DoD can (and my guess will) give a waiver that will give us around 45 days of leeway to lift the logistics ban for ships to use our and Canadian HS crude. Along with Biden releasing oil reserves and most likely giving an executive order to extend those restrictions (this is already in the news if you need to read up on it, I recommend looking at Wall Street Journal or other oil stock news reports), we should see prices begin to fall anytime. That's ""Econ 101"" as you put it, right? Simple supply meeting the demand, right? Hell, with the amount of HS/Brent crude Alaska and Texas pumps out alone, we could see $30 PPB again by April. 

Ya, no. You see, the PPB isn't set by some magical elf sitting on a throne at the head of a mysterious oil OPEC council. The global market reacts by something called ""speculation"" - it's why bad news is usually good news if you own shares in oil stocks/reserves/etc. Because ACTUAL supply and demand forces are meaningless right now. So idk about you, but Econ 101 principles states that if we ""lose"" 7% of imported oil, which again isn't even used for gasoline but I'm just gonna play devil's advocate for you, our price at the pump should also rise by 7%. Which idk about you, but that definitely went waaaay higher than 7%.

So no junior, it isn't doom and gloom just because we aren't taking Russian oil and lawdy lawdy no, it *shouldn't* affect the PPB for gasoline. It isn't **that simple**. The markets are, in a nutshell, fucked and have been for over 40 years now because they no longer accurately reflect commodity trading as they should. Want me to write another book about how speculation, commodities, and oil markets work? Cause come at me bro, I can go all day.

Or sit your ass down and stop spewing hyperbole like it's ""just that simple"". Be mad at the systems that fuck over everyone that isn't a billionaire and you and I can stand shoulder to shoulder bitching all day long about how fucked our politics, next-day point of sale distribution system, and markets are together. Our cost of farm land, price for fertilizer, that sheet of plywood, etc is completely fucked for a HOST of reasons that have nothing to do with oil prices.",t2_82otq8ro,moosewhippets,0,1646929759.0,0,t1_i04g631,i04g631,False,lesliedow,t3_t9icwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/t9icwh/john_deere_not_saying_if_they_are_selling_to/,John Deere not saying if they are selling to Russia,/r/QuadCities/comments/t9icwh/john_deere_not_saying_if_they_are_selling_to/i04g631/,1,r/QuadCities,0,1

Hyperbole ehh and misinformation? Show me facts about anything I typed before is either of those things? I mean you had to start throwing insults because you don't have any sort of facts to back up what you're saying. 

If you're so informed please enlighten us all as to where in the world most of the urea and potash supply comes from? How much natural gas is used in the making of anhydrous ammonia? How much wheat isn't going to be on the market this year because of what's happening in Ukraine? 

What was the price of oil in 2008 when everything went to hell? Our entire world is built around an average of $100/barrel oil. How does taking 10%-12% of that supply out of the system not affect the price? 

Econ 101 says that when you take away 10% of the supply of whatever the commodity may be the price of that commodity is going to increase because your supply is limited by 10% unless the demand drops as well.

 Pretty dang simple.

"I guess that begs the question of where is your limit to that pressure? How much pain are you willing to feel to apply it?

I'm all for shutting down Putin. Bomb those pipelines, stop buying Russia gas and oil. But if that's the case we have to turn on our resources here at home. It takes natural gas and oil to make every last thing that makes life in the 21st century cumfy for us all, food included. 

It takes 500 or so pounds of fertilizer to grow one acre of corn. The price of that 500 or so pounds of fertilizer cost 300% more this spring than last year, if you're able to buy it at all.. Fuel costs are at least triple and that steep incline doesn't seem to be slowing any. That means your food is going to cost 300% more or higher in a year from now or less. If we keep buying those inputs from hostile countries we are at their mercy for our food. Sounds like an awful idea to me. 

Are you really ready to pay $10‚Å∞‚Å∞ - $15‚Å∞‚Å∞ for a tube of toothpaste?

\- toppings underneath the cheese.  I like toppings to be crispy.  I like the grease on top of the pizza not soaking into the crust.  

\- the price.  people are always like with all the pizza places around how do the chains stay open.  well when you order 2 pizzas and the price is $65 bucks no wonder why dominoes is still around.

"Pretty much agree with everything you‚Äôve said, except the cost of living. When I was doing my research here months ago, QC is actually #3 lowest cost of living in the US with Des Moines being #5 for 2021-2022. Now that may have changed a little in the last 3-4 months, but that‚Äôs what I read. The only others in front of QC was Huntsville, AL & Fort Wayne, IN as far as lowest cost of living.",t2_1bih7wnc,Bockmeister87,0,1646708019.0,0,t1_hzsgh4n,hzsgh4n,False,[deleted],t3_t90w8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/t90w8a/moving_to_the_area_and_need_advice/,Moving to the area and need advice!,/r/QuadCities/comments/t90w8a/moving_to_the_area_and_need_advice/hzsgh4n/,2,r/QuadCities,0,2

"1. I would advise keeping an eye on all of the quad cities area for housing. You can get to and from anywhere in the QCs within 15 minutes due to the various interstates and highways cutting through - also 3-4 bridges to get across the river. Davenport is what I would call the ‚Äúleast safest‚Äù of the cities overall, but generally has the better restaurants and shopping (Costco, Sams Club, better mall, etc. are here). 

2. Thai - Lemongrass Cafe in downtown Moline. Chinese - Red Lantern in Davenport has been good. Mexican - Los Rancheritos (spelling) in Moline is also good. Bass Street Chophouse also in Moline is a good place for prime steaks. 

3. Moved here 16 years ago and hopefully you figure this one out faster than me :)

4. I moved from the South as well and as you can tell from the username the state to your east. Southern hospitality is a real thing - I‚Äôve found people here to generally be nice, but not the same. Was also a shock here when kids call their friends parents by their first name.

"Pay no attention to comments like these... the Quad Cities is a wonderful community with things happening all the time. I‚Äôm biased because I do love Iowa and we just had a massive income tax reduction. Iowa is now the 4th lowest income tax state in the country. 

I‚Äôm not going to repeat what others have said but we love to boat in this part of the country. I think it‚Äôs a wonderful thing to have one of the worlds largest river on our doorstep. Definitely take your dog on walks along the Mississippi. Get a bike too.

Festivals we have festivals almost every weekend and sometimes multiple festivals a day.  I personally love all of the outdoor concerts downtown Davenport (Blues, Rock music, Country, Pops). Plus we have food festivals galore all kinds too (Mexican, Ribs fest, pork... heck we have a whole weekend devoted to bacon, plus Jamaican you name it we probably have a festival for it) 

We are hours drives from multiple large metro areas Chicago, Des Moines (pronounced Da Moin) Twin Cities, St Louis and Kansas City. 

I know Reddit can be distanced from our real life persona but I‚Äôd love to be your unofficial tour guide. I know how lonely it can be starting in a new area. Plus I want to show that we in Iowa are nice and the Quad Cities is twice as nice as the twin cities. 

Most people who hate this area haven‚Äôt traveled enough to see how good we have it here. It‚Äôs not perfect but nowhere is. Best of luck even if you don‚Äôt need my help!",t2_4dm5c9et,MidwestRandoChick,1,1646707117.0,0,t1_hzseioo,hzseioo,False,[deleted],t3_t90w8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/t90w8a/moving_to_the_area_and_need_advice/,Moving to the area and need advice!,/r/QuadCities/comments/t90w8a/moving_to_the_area_and_need_advice/hzseioo/,3,r/QuadCities,0,3
"There are also tons of disc golf courses in the area.

"My wife and I just moved here a little over 2 weeks ago now! From CA. I already have lots of restaurants on my list from reading on this subreddit. From what I‚Äôve read, Duck City Bistro is THE upscale place to go and is phenomenal, but pretty pricey. We haven‚Äôt checked it out yet, but plan to. The Phoenix is a martini piano bar, looks classy. Front Street Pub for food and beer. Monarch, Thunder Bay Grille, Tommy‚Äôs and/or Jimmy‚Äôs for breakfast, Lunardi‚Äôs/Antonella‚Äôs for Italian/deep dish I believe, QC Coffee and Pancake House, Kitchen Brigade for burgers and beer, La Finca/La Rancharita for tacos, Zeke‚Äôs Island Cafe. Those are some of the mains ones on my list to try among others. Went to Front Street on Friday for the first time. Had to wait 45 mins-1 hour for our food since it was so busy. Food was decent, but the Goldilocks beer I had was tasty. 

We live at The Reserve At City‚Äôs Edge right on the North part of Davenport. It‚Äôs a luxury complex with really nice units. All modern and updated appliances with gorgeous and spacious kitchens with islands and our unit has an attached garage which has been incredible during the squalls. It also has Amazon Hub Lockers at the office which is super handy since we buy from Amazon very frequently. It‚Äôs probably a bit more than what you want to pay from what you mentioned. We pay $1,305 with water included for a one bedroom on the first floor with a small, personal driveway, $60 for WiFi, and we haven‚Äôt had our electric bill yet but I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôll be somewhere around $150-$200. The apartment has community events occasionally and it‚Äôs pretty close to everything you need/want. 5-10 mins to anywhere: Walmart, Costco, Target, downtown, Cinemark Theater etc‚Ä¶

Other places that were personally on my list of apartments when I was doing research include: 

‚Ä¢The Brenton

‚Ä¢Alexis At Perry Pointe

‚Ä¢The Bridges Lofts

‚Ä¢Union Arcade (downtown - my friend lives there and seem really nice, but parking garage is a little walk and isn‚Äôt connected to your apartment and it‚Äôs right on the river, so expect and be prepared for flooding eventually)

My other friends are renting a townhouse off of E 29th St and Brady St and it‚Äôs pretty solid as well and has a two car garage. They pay like $1,400 for a 2 bed 2.5 bath. You could try to find something around the $1,200 you mentioned. I think Alexis At Perry Pointe and The Brenton could be in that range. Definitely suggest getting a place with a garage though. 

Places to avoid, from what I‚Äôve read and heard, is don‚Äôt go west of the Palmer campus and try not to go south of it either. Something about avoiding Locust street too. This is just from reading other posts/talking to people from Palmer. 

On that note, living uptown is really nice and feels really safe. I would personally target north of Palmer, since that‚Äôs all Davenport. 

Sorry for the long message, but I hope this helps you somewhat!!
