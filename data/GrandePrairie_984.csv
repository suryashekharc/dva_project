"I've taken cabs before, while I do use Prairie cabs and there are some really great drivers there and if I can afford to I usually leave a pretty big tip for their service.

However, I have had encounters which amazed the shit at me and I hate myself for not sticking up for myself, so here we go.

I once had a Driver pick me up at my place, I told him I had to go to Purolator in the West End to get a parcel.  He said he's new to GP and needed instructions, so I gave him the address and told him the best route.  Well, this was over the busy season in winter, he ignored and went from my place on the east side all the way to the costco intersection, during rush hour.  I didn't say anything as I had confidence he'd figure it out.  No fault of his, after waiting in line they said my package was at Micheal's Hobby over by the Casino.  No biggie.  He didn't know how to get there either.  So I gave him instructions and we were on our way, he went through traffic, drove to the Podollan Intersection, drove up to the College in all the high traffic areas and made the turns to get to my location.  Little annoyed, I waited for my package and got in and off to my apartment.  Well the cab was 38 dollars at this point, which is ridiculous, but again, I said nothing and was making small talk on the way there.  I was mentioning I moved here during the Boom and he claimed that's when he moved here too.  So he lied about being new, he's been here 20 years now and then he took a phone call.   So as we approach my apartment, he drives past and parks at one of the buildings down the road on the same side (same string of buildings.).  I said, ""Hey, you missed my stop and didn't hear me because you're talking to a group of people on speaker phone""...   He said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, this is where I live.""  -  For some reason I said, ""ok, I guess I can just walk.""  - So I handed my card over to him, he punches in the total and gives himself a 20% tip and hands me the machine.  I don't travel well, I was uncomfortable due to my illness, I just wanted to get home.  So I grabbed my package and walked 1/4 of a block to get home.

Now, I told this long story because it details one of the many things that some of these drivers do:  They always talk on the phone, sometimes loudly and go into autopilot mode, sometimes they won't give you back change when you pay in cash,  they use the covid thing as an excuse to tip themselves on debit, they purposely go the longest routes, sometimes even going the wrong way to run up the meters, etc.

Now this is not for all, but for some at Prairie cab, which I've been using since I moved here, but I still use them despite quite a few trips leading me having to pay sometimes twice the cost of what the ride should've been.",t2_ctpj4kg5,JoelSquonks,0,1648004759.0,0,t1_i1r0duq,i1r0duq,True,TheOrangeLlama,t3_tkcsni,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandePrairie/comments/tkcsni/reliable_taxitransportation_services_in_gp/,Reliable taxi/transportation services in GP?,/r/GrandePrairie/comments/tkcsni/reliable_taxitransportation_services_in_gp/i1r0duq/,3,r/GrandePrairie,0,3

"Sorry but in Canada, and especially in Alberta religion does not play a huge part in the lower education levels, we have one of the highest rates of Atheism in Canada, actually all of North America has the highest rate of Atheism in 100 years, religion is dying. Poverty on the other hand is thriving, and it is very well known that the highest rates of childbirth are in the lower income bracket with 4-6 children per household, where as the middle and higher income earners stay around the 2-3 child mark or are child free, which is becoming disturbingly common.

When you have thousands of children born into poverty, of course we see a higher volume of lower education, they go hand in hand. I myself was born into a family of 6 kids, single low income mother on government assistance, and only 3 of us graduated, two have 3 kids before 25 years old, the youngest has no kids but makes $19,000 a year at 22 years old. It's almost impossible to get out of poverty once you've been born into it, I was lucky and got into heavy equipment operating and make a good income, and there are so many families in northern Alberta like mine, several people I went to school with that are convoy supporters and I guarantee have some of the same stickers came from poverty and now have multiple kids stuck in poverty.

"Why do people¬† think the Emergencies Act (passed in 1988 by Mulroney, Conservative) suspends the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (passed in in 1982 by Trudeau, Liberal) it is both delightfully humorous and painfully ironic. 

For the record - the Emergencies Act does not suspend the Charter - the Notwithstanding Clause does. 

You know the Notwithstanding Clause that Grant Devine (Conservative) used against striking workers in 1986, and Ralph Klein (Conservative) used to pass legislation against same-sex marriage in 2000, and Brad Wall (Conservative) used to strip funding from students attending Catholic schools in 2017, and against labour unions in 2015, and Doug Ford (Conservative) used against Toronto's municipal council in 2018, and Legault (Conservative) used against public workers wearing minority religious symbols in 2018. 

35 years of Conservatives ""suspending the Constitution"" and not one caravan to remove a Conservative Premier or Prime Minister. 

What a country!

"/u/pixieborn is correct. For example, Reddit itself is left leaning, and skews to a younger demographic. You'll get vastly different answers from this group than you would Facebook or Twitter users, and all social media would likely not get any response from seniors.  You not only won't get a wide range of people, you'll get one that is provably incorrect compared to the regular population. You may also get users within this group who wish to exaggerate or emphasize one aspect in particular, and perhaps use throwaway accounts to respond multiple times.  Getting real untainted accurate data, is really really hard.

Although an important note: under the current setup, the intention of plowing isn't to get down to bare pavement. But to smooth out ruts and to make the streets more drivable. I'm not saying that is the way it SHOULD be. But it is the way it is under current Council policy.

And yes, the snow removal process has been the same for years. That's because Council hasn't done any review whatsoever since 2014, so there hasn't been substantial change in 8 years.

To see some basic information about snow removal and my take, checkout [www.bressey.ca/snow](https://www.bressey.ca/snow)

If you are encountering a particularly bad street, I'd also encourage you to report it on [access.cityofgp.com](https://access.cityofgp.com/s/). I'm told by residents that they have been getting very good and quick service through this portal.

It really has been a frustrating year (I drive these streets too!). The approach/equipment hasn't changed compared to previous years. But having a cycle of heavy snow followed by days of extreme cold followed by two days of melt and rain followed by heavy snow and extreme cold caused big problems this year. It is unusual conditions.

That being said: we always should be looking for ways to do better. For years, I've been pushing for us to do a comprehensive review of our snow and ice control program. I'm happy to report that that will finally be taking part in the spring. We'll be benchmarking what we do against other northern municipalities, getting cost estimates for alternative service levels, and debating what is the best approach going forward.

I'll be pushing for there to be genuine opportunity for the public to give feedback into this process. I hope my colleagues will support me on that. The best way to pay attention for them is to follow the City on social media, or occasionally check [engage.cityofgp.com](https://engage.cityofgp.com). You are also always welcome to call or email Council, or come to a City Council meeting (there are two opportunities at each meeting for the public to call in over Zoom, or come down to City Hall and speak in person).

Although one challenge I will highlight if we want to do more snow/ice control: the budget challenge that will create. On a per-capita basis, our total City budget is less than the average of other Alberta cities. Despite that, we already do more snow and ice control than many other cities (for example: many only touch residential streets once or twice per season, we typically do 5+ passes). And many residents tell me that getting taxes down is a top priority for them. So any new approaches need to have the costs carefully weighed.  


For me, it's going to be a hard sell to support spending more on snow and ice control. But I do want to see if there are ways we can re-allocate money in the existing budget to change our approach. For example: if we hauled away less snow on non-cul-de-sac streets, could we get plows out quicker...? If so, that might be a tradeoff that many residents would embrace.

"Not to nitpick, because I understand your frustration, but we don't have the highest tax rate. We have the highest mill rate. So someone in Edmonton or Calgary will pay 50 percent more property tax for the exact same house down there. But the house price is ""worth"" 80 percent more. So as a percentage of value we are charged more, so it seems like we pay more. However, it doesn't cost any less to plow the strip of road in front of a house in either city. 

Point is we have less money to plow here per home. 

And because a city like Edmonton with high rise condos with 500 units pay property tax too, and the road out front of that building is about the same as 10 houses here, they have waaaay more money to plow per km.  They are denser.

"The downtown core is diverse, and getting better all the time, but u/ClownLoach2 is right.

This isn't a major metropolis - so it tends towards big box stores scattered over a large geographic area.  If you want shopping options you'll have to get around.

At least a small SUV is recommended - you need something with ground clearance - my first 3 years living here I had a car and I got high ended by ruts 3 times in one year.   After that, I stuck to larger vehicles.

Cabs are outrageously expensive here.  One guy owns all the cab companies and even a short ride is usually 30 bucks.  A ride from the airport - 15 minute ride - was 60 bucks for me.

I like your moxie - but this city is not good to get around in in winter.  It's long, it's cold, and the snow will be deep.  Do not underestimate it.

"IMO, you can't go without a vehicle in GP.  Transit is sparse, and GP is not at all cyclist friendly unless you're on the trails.  Haven't ever used a cab, so I can't comment on them directly.  I stopped riding my bike the 3km to work because of too many near misses of vehicles turning in front of me or cutting me off.  I tried biking slow on the sidewalk and crossing arteries like a pedestrian, I tried biking faster, in the right side of a lane, various routes, ect...  Nothing seemed to reduce the risk of getting run over.  I did it for two years and overall, there are not very many days where biking was nice.  

We have winter from November to April and you won't be biking at all during those months.  Then it takes until July for the streets to be swept, so there's gravel everywhere to slip and slide on.  Then it's nice biking except for the wind until October when the cycle starts again.

Edit:  I'll add in that part of the reason I don't consider biking to be viable in GP is the theft.  Unless your butt is planted on the seat or it's stored indoors out of sight, it's very likely to get stolen.  You can't use your bike for errands because you can't leave it locked up outside of a store without a good chance of it being stolen.  Your work also has to accommodate having your bike inside for the same reason.  It sucks, but the crackheads are rampant and will steal anything in sight.

Transit is fair and safe, but some routes shut down early so getting to evening events can be tricky. Cabs are safe and there are plenty of them but there are no ride-share apps available.

Whether or not it may affect their jobs has no bearing about getting the truth out to Albertans.

"Haven‚Äôt got past the homepage, and tend on the side already that I don‚Äôt think this is a good change Alberta is enacting, but definitely take the website with a grain of salt.

"Can confirm the calendar BS and add that the narcissistic  
abuser tendencies also carried over into his treatment of the bands that came into his orbit.  
I was in the scene in the mid- to-late 2000s, and my friends and I used to joke PSAH should be called ‚ÄúPeace Starts with Chris‚Äù because of how tied up the whole thing was with his ego. I honestly don't recall what social cause the festival was notionally about (think it pretty much came down to ""good vibes in the community"" but someone else can correct me on that). But what I saw him getting out of the event and everything that came with it was that he got to surround himself with an entourage of mainly younger guys (a lot of them high school kids) kissing his ass and enabling him to stay out smoking weed and getting to play the guru. If you weren‚Äôt on board with the program of ‚Äúhelp Chris recapture his youth and tell him what a great guy he is,‚Äù or if you didn‚Äôt donate your time to the legwork of his various projects, you got a version of his friendly hippie thing that was edgier: ¬†little passive-aggressive and belittling remarks, over-familiar ‚Äújokes‚Äù at your expense on stage or in front of other musicians, comments about how what you get out of the community depends on what you put in, shit like that. Always knew exactly where the line was to not upset the little fiction that we were all such great friends. There also seemed to be a relationship between your outward estimation of Chris as a leader of men and the billing your group was likely to get as part of PSAH or his other projects, and the likelihood that the guy might put in a surprise guest appearance during your set with some ""good-natured"" clown work.

Hard to argue (and tiring if I‚Äôm honest) with these silly comments.  Colds not being cured - true but so? Elderly and very unhealthy being more susceptible and typically have worse outcomes, of course but so? 

The government can‚Äôt agree on or do much of anything. Let alone multiple governments together. So how can any person believe they are all acting in concert against the masses with some sophisticate conspiracy. It must be tiring to be so paranoid. 

A vaccine that builds the required antibodies to help fight the virus and protect us against severe symptoms isn‚Äôt some evil government conspiracy.

"Although I doubt any intelligent information will help you but, as a fellow citizen of yours, I will give it a go: 

There are at least 4 points you may want to consider:

1. Something like 90% of truckers are vaccinated. Of course none of us can be certain how many of the folks there are actually truckers or if statistically the same ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated are present. If we assume it to be the same, most would be protected. 
2. Covid, like other diseases with high transmissibility, mutates. The most wide spread mutation now is Omicron. This particular one is less lethal than the previous however much more infectious. So although it is less likely to kill, it has killed more than Delta. This is purely due to the volume of infections. 
3. The reason our government has put in restrictions it to push more fellow citizens to take the societal view of protecting each other over their own view of a little needle.  It has helped but not enough, unfortunately. While tens of thousands die in our country and more are deprived their right to health treatments (cancer care, heart surgeries, etc) there are still people that believe their individual rights outweigh our societal freedoms. So much so they protest. 
4. And last, you question assumes some things to be true. You assume that they aren‚Äôt getting sick, they aren‚Äôt dying. I find it unfortunate how many people take their personal, uninformed view as truth. It rarely is. Luckily we have come up with an English word to describe most of what we believe. PERCEPTION. 

Let‚Äôs stop bickering about silly perceptions and look at facts. More than 5.5 million humans are dead from Covid. More have died or suffered from an inability to access the treatments they need because we have deprived them of this by flooding the hospitals with mostly unneeded Covid cases. There is a vaccine and it works against severe outcomes.

"Back in the 00s when Chris Thiessen was more well known in town for his ‚Äúpeace starts at home‚Äù battle of the bands and outdoor music festival, he was really really into something called the ‚Äú13 moon calendar‚Äù and would talk it up to anyone who would listen. One of his stated reasons for wanting to replace the Gregorian calendar with it was that it would bring peace to the word, as the current one has months named after Roman emperors and the Roman god of war. Which leads to war for some reason. Anyway, at this time he was on the board for some nonprofits as well as PSAH and would attempt writing cheques using the 13 moon calendar dates. So folks would have cheques with squiggly lines and nipple drawings instead of a normal dates, so they wouldn‚Äôt be able to deposit them.

"I'm probably echoing some of the things below, but oh well. There are some nice things about living here. My two cents:

\- Pretty high property taxes if you choose to buy a home. Check out some listings on [realtor.ca](https://realtor.ca) to see what I mean.

\- Rentals are plentiful, but it's a little tricky to sometimes find a place if you happen to have pets. Those who will rent to pet owners will nearly always charge a pet fee of at least $50 a month, and your pet can only be a certain size (i.e. small dogs)

\- On that note, utilities are crazy high right now for almost everyone. Like $400 for gas and electric in a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom duplex. Thanks UCP.

\- The municipal government is... questionable. There's a whole Twitter account dedicated to exposing the toxic work culture and bad practices (like nepotism) over at City Hall. To say nothing of the current City Councillor in Ottawa supporting the trucker convoy. The twitter account is gpab\_gopublic if you're interested in checking it out.

\- Road maintenance doesn't seem super well planned out. I get it, it's difficult with our cold temperatures sometimes, and Councillor Bressey is often on here explaining the process (btw, he's probably the best City Councillor). A good example of this is we've had some crazy warm temperatures that have resulted in a lot of melting snow and ice, and the ice has made the residential roads TERRIBLE. They're hugely pitted and an absolute nightmare to drive on. I hate leaving my house because of it. The City just announced that they've contracted crews to come and remove the ice this week, but it would've been more useful like two weeks ago.

\- People start small businesses here all the time, if that's something you're interested in. It's very entrepreneur-friendly and there are lots of resources for those starting out.

\- I like our airport. I've never had a flight be delayed and although it's small, it's generally clean and efficient.

\- If you're a Canadian Tire fan, we happen to have the biggest one in the country.",t2_ji9djuq4,PulledPorkSandwichez,0,1644869573.0,0,t1_hwy704n,hwy704n,True,Babypoopsalott,t3_srnx54,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandePrairie/comments/srnx54/whats_the_locals_scoop_living_in_grand_prairie/,What‚Äôs the locals‚Äô scoop living in Grand Prairie?,/r/GrandePrairie/comments/srnx54/whats_the_locals_scoop_living_in_grand_prairie/hwy704n/,3,r/GrandePrairie,0,3

However, we need to come to terms with the fact that we will never achieve 100% vaccine uptake. People who aren't vaccinated yet will most likely remain unvaccinated.

"You're definitely not wrong with points 2-6, but you frame them as though they are bad.  It's a (arguably remote) resource town that thrives from the natural resource development.  Resources are king because without them, you're homeless.  Most of the people that choose to live here live for the outdoors and all it has to offer.  If you're an indoors person, you'll be pretty bored here.  If you're expecting the ""big city experience"" in the form of entertainment, culture, festivals or ""never have to leave the city"", GP is not the place for you.

"The thing about GP is that there are lots of good things and a lot of bad things.

* You can't get a family doctor here. There are walk in clinics, but that's not the same as a regular family doctor.
* Community is king. I can't count the number of times people come together to support people in need. The Dream Home lottery that supports local charities sells out every year despite the drop in economy. If a house catches fire people pile on to send money, food, clothes, anything to help.
* It is conservative central.  If you're anything but die hard conservative you're a commie, fascist, socialist, outcast. I spoke out against the UCP during the last election and people (anonymously) sent me ""Fuck Your Feelings"" and ""Trump 2020"" stickers. 
* There is work here for just about anything you want. Oil and gas, technology, retail, small business, forestry, farming, you name it (except for fishing).
* Lots of outdoor activities like trails, swimming pool, parks. Summers are great here. Long days and beautiful nights.
* This year is strange weather-wise. Usually winter starts in October and ends in April. This year it started in November and seems to be ending now (February).
* Awesome lakes for summer activities near by
* Crime is pretty bad in terms of theft and vandalism. Drugs are a big problem.
* There are great new schools. Some of the best in the province.
* We, finally, have a new, state of the art hospital.
* It's a loong drive to Edmonton, the next biggest city. Pretty much everything you need is in GP though.
* Housing is expensive as are things like groceries and utilities.
* There are churches everywhere. Mostly Christian, a couple Mosques, a few others.
* There are liquor stores and cannabis stores everywhere. They may outnumber the churches.
* There's a college (or polytechnic as it's now called) which offers great post-secondary education. Seriously some of the best in the province.
* Lots of extra curricular activities for kids (hockey, soccer, archery)

"I hate it here so take this with a grain of salt, but here are my takes:

* it's redneck central up here. I thought small towns in south/central AB were bad for douchebags in lifted trucks acting like the rules of the road don't apply to them, but up here you really take your life into your own hands when you drive anywhere 
* add to that: the roads are shit. massive heavy trucks on every regular road through town = playing mario kart with potholes in the spring
* there's a lumber mill in the middle of town and there are huge semis everywhere all the time. it's like living in the industrial part of a city, except it's the entire city
* start taking vitamin D now. there were plenty of days I would leave for work in the dark and come home in the dark, never seeing the sun once. when I could see the sun it stays so low on the horizon in the winter that it feels like you never actually get a real day of sun. in the summer it can almost be worse when it's bright as day at 10:30 pm and again at 4 am. 
* there's lots of outdoor stuff for hiking and snowshoeing etc. if you're into that, which I am not. there are also a fuck ton of bears.
* it's five hours to edmonton. I didn't even think that would be a problem until I realized wow, this is actually the biggest place around for hours and hours
* the further north you go, the more backwards it gets. avoid anywhere north of like rycroft at any cost
* the culture is straight up oil and gas is king, climate change isn't real, vaccines are the mark of the beast, you get the idea. the willful ignorance is unreal.
* gas is maybe like 7 cents cheaper than the calgary area, so I guess there's that
* also there's a costco. best part of town tbh 

GP sucks ass IMO. I guess if you're a conservative #freedumb type with a lifted f-350, whose hobbies include include huntin', fishin', and riverboatin', you're probably golden though. good luck but please have an escape plan.

ETA: the winters are beyond brutal. I‚Äôve lived in Canada my whole life and have never experienced winters like this. Regularly -40, pitch dark, hurricane force winds, awful road conditions, you name it and it‚Äôs worse up here. I have never experienced roads that are straight up skating rinks like they are here. Winter is legitimately dangerous and so, so long (except this year by the looks of it)

"Depends on where you are coming from. I came from a large city and this place is wildly boring. If youre coming from a smaller place, this town has lots. There are a million kids here too.

Food is expensive, the restaurants arent anything to really write home about; any home chef could do better - youre just paying for the convenience really.

"I've lived here most of my life, about 40 years now. I've always said that in Grande Prairie you can do anything you want, just not that much. Basically, if you have a hobby or an interest there is a group in town and infrastructure to support it. Unfortunately, as we are a fairly small Northern town the group won't be that big and if you want progression it's a min. 4 hour drive to get somewhere else. 

For example, the local ski hill is Nitehawk (there are also downhill MTB bike runs there). It's a decent hill with a dozen or so runs. It's only 15 min from town and is well kept (except there was a landslide in 2020 that destroyed the chair lift). It's a great place to learn and to spend an evening in the winter. If you want to try a different hill, Jasper is the closest mountain at 4hrs away. It's the same story with nearly all hobbies.

I was quite jaded and really wanted to leave the GP area until the last year or so. Once I took stock of what we really have here compared to other Alberta cities, I think we are quite spoiled with easy access to local trails for biking, skiing, hiking, dirt bikes/ATVs, camping, etc. as well as amenities in the city. 

There is a lack of culture for music and theatre if you are into that. As I mentioned before, there are clubs and they are well supported but limited in production.

Overall, I'd say every city is what you make of it but Grande Prairie is a great place to be for work and family life, just be prepared to travel a long distance if you want a vacation.

Oh, and I hope you like the sound of diesel engines with open exhaust and piped Harley motorcycles.",t2_nymsv,Thinkbeforeyouspeakk,0,1644779334.0,0,t1_hwt8jx0,hwt8jx0,True,Babypoopsalott,t3_srnx54,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandePrairie/comments/srnx54/whats_the_locals_scoop_living_in_grand_prairie/,What‚Äôs the locals‚Äô scoop living in Grand Prairie?,/r/GrandePrairie/comments/srnx54/whats_the_locals_scoop_living_in_grand_prairie/hwt8jx0/,13,r/GrandePrairie,0,13
"Well, for me it's been a good place to work when I could, with that I found it kinda hard to make good friendships and my struggles with people my own age lately I think can be directly attributed to being older, but I digress...    


 It has a decent night life, there's some great bars in town, nothing too dance friendly or club like, aside from Madhatter's I guess.  For live music, the place to go is Better Than Fred's, amazing food, the owner is great and he hires really great staff.  As far as things to do, there's always things in the summer to do in Muskoseepi, it's a nice area to walk and just hang out in the grass.   I think I've been desensitized to the homeless problem, which there is, but for the most part they aren't aggressive types but that's just my experiences and if you see Yellow Boxes around town, probably safer to stay away and watch where you walk as they are needle drop offs and sometimes the needles don't make their way inside.    


I try to support local as much as far as restaurants go, but we have quite a great ethnic scene food wise.  For Thai Food, the best Pad Khee Mao in town is easily Canadian Thai behind Liquor for Less, the most bang for your buck for Lebanese is Tito's, it's literally the best Shwarma I've ever had in my life and they pile it high also the location downtown has poetry readings and accoustic acts and things of this nature, very great spot,  Gregan's makes hands down the best Fried Chicken and Wild Rose makes the best Poutine, but really there's no bad poutine (unless they use shredded).  As for Commercial, we have Boston Pizza, Montanas, Carls Jr, Pita Pit, Opa! and a boat load of Tim's....     


Groceries are getting kinda expensive here, but Co Op Pharmacy has the best Pharmacy Staff I've encountered, Safeway has great Produce and  Freson has a great East Coast section.  Butcher shops are really good here, great products from each.  Europa has some amazing Deli stuff,  Beaverlodge Butcher's Staff are 2nd to none and have some great products and Blackman's is Excellent as well.    


We have Gym's in every section of town, all are pretty good from what I've seen.  Trails are all over and I'm sure expanding soon, really great place to walk but the area around from Staples and Walmart area could be a little more pedestrian friendly, but if you face traffic so you have time to dodge the distracted drivers from running you over you're about 50/50 to walk away unscathed.  


I think for the most part, people are nice but there's a certain amount of negativity comes with the people who earn decent incomes and I get that I was once one of those people too,   I think the whole mentality of working in the patch, people have this expectation that, ""I need it now and I need it yesterday"" and it reigns to be a true way of kinda describing some of the people here.  You will occasionally see a dressed up woman treating people in stores not all that well as she walks her cart of groceries over to her husband's lifted Denali, or a guy in coveralls talking down to a convenience store worker because of his accent.  But not everyone is an entitled racist and people are like that everywhere, the pandemic has been hard and people are worn out everywhere.  


As far as roads too and from, well they're being worked on...   Heading into town from Edmonton is pretty fun, you can catch air off of the frost heaves in a loaded body job and there's a lot.  Leaving GP, heading South, there's highway 40...  I haven't been so scared in my life traveling down that road and I've had a stroke before...  Especially with the amount of welding trucks doing a buck 60 and passing on blind turns or service trucks randomly pumping the brakes because they're almost going to miss their turn into a lease road for work.  Let's not forget the bridge in the wintertime, that hill leading to town gets hellishly slippery and for the most part unkept after a thaw and freeze cycle, even when it was booming, so drive safe!  


There's some good fishing out at Sturgeon, as far as Pickerel goes...   Loads of Greenhouses, Dunvegan is really nice and there's a hidden gem out towards Wembley that's really great.  If you're into picking berries, there's some great Saskatoon picking down across the highway from Wembley...  


Other than that, rent is fairly expensive for what you're getting and if you're renting and moving out, don't pay for carpet cleaners because you'll get charged for it anyways and be adamant at going over damages as even though you'll move into a place with something like a clogged drain, if you get it worked on while you are living there, you will be charged for repairs, etc...  If you want a building with more than a washer and dryer per 50 people, I'd stay away from Boardwalk, if you want consistent radiant heat in the winter, avoid Boardwalk...   And if you pick anywhere else, expect to pay incredibly high...   As far as Utilities and what not, for my fridge and computer to run and occasionally the stove, I'm paying about 150 a month for a one bedroom.  


As far as public transport goes, cab companies are great but be specific and tell them where to go because they will intentionally take the longest routes to get an extra couple bucks and I think most of their machines require you to tip ontop of a buck 90 atm fee, but most of the guys aren't all that bad.  There's even one that offers you a toke of his joint, really generous but sometimes he gets pretty blasted to your location so he sometimes drives past your stop.   The buses are great, they run throughout the week and the drivers get you too and from at a timely manner, sometimes they even let you sit down before pulsing the gas, even if you have mobility issues.

"The first five lines is the percent vaccinated in each age category. It says everyone 5+ (eligible) is 65% & for all ages (including not eligible) would be 60%.

So above when I mentioned 60% double vaccinated, I maybe should have used the 5+ eligible number.

You can‚Äôt just ignore the under 11 category, because they are low risk of death. They still contract illness and spread it. One of my kiddo‚Äôs has 1/2 her class out sick right now. 

My point though is if you go take a look at other communities like Sherwood Park, Edmonton, Leduc, Calgary, Lethbridge, Red Deer, even Fort Mac, GP is under vaccinated. 

Also the North region has 12 ICU beds total, between here and Fort Mac. I think I‚Äôve read they may be able to surge to 14 beds. 

So when our ICU‚Äôs are over capacity, patients are transported to other health regions for care, as happened during Delta wave.

COVID is a virus; it changes often and it‚Äôs frequency of significant changes like mutations increase with the amount of infected.

"The situations don't seem comparable in my mind. If there was vaccine that reduces your chances of getting in a car crash (i guess driver training would be the equivalent) I think it would be beneficial for people to take it... I guess in my mind someone that chooses not to get vaccinated is like a drunk driver. Yeah you might not get in a car accident, but thats probably because most other drivers are sober. 

And your other comment seems to imply people are being encouraged to be obese, or that its a choice. I doubt anyone 'chooses' to be obese. Those whom are obese are stigmatized and discriminated in all aspects of north american life, so I don't really get where your statement is stemming from. The biggest factors in obesity tend to be income level, and social support. Yes people have the choice to eat healthier meals but in some locations thats a choice barred off by how expensive it can be. And if a person doesn't have social supports there more likely to suffer from depression that can also contribute to weight gain. Fat shaming only aggravates obesity as a disease.

Truthfully, those that haven't decided to get the vaccine aren't going to be swayed by what anyone says. I think peoples energy to even bother dissipated within the first year of the pandemic.

 I'm of the opinion that if someone actively chose not to get the vaccine and needs ICU care, they've lost alot of my sympathy. And if someone not vaccinated gets covid without a scratch, well good for them. They probably spread it to someone that wasn't as fortunate but apparently comorbidities means a humans life holds no value.

We're lucky this pandemic has had such a small CFR. I still think people should do their part in protecting themselves and others by getting the vaccine.

"Oh, so you're ""just asking questions"" - that's not scientific - that's politicizing the issue.

Secondly, you assume that young healthy men (you think you are, I guess) can't get seriously ill from the virus (that's not true) and thus don't need the vaccines. I guess you're listening to Bro Rogan's podcast where you learned this information.

The vaccines are effective and safe (I'll link Mayo Clinic as a credible source) - you've offered no sources but just some bs politically-motivated right-wing talking narrative that is demonstrably misleading at best and misinformed at worst.

"I'm getting sick of having to explain this to people, but here goes one last try. Freedom of speech is not what you think it is, saying you can't have freedom of speech on Reddit is the same as me coming into your home, saying something you disagree with, and claiming you're violating my freedom of speech when you kick me out. Websites are not public property, they are owned, operated, and moderated by people, who have a vested interest in not letting the site devolve into a hate filled rhetoric cess pool, as they are businesses run for money. Would you go into a business that was full of people who are spouting things you disagree with if there were alternatives? 

Also, freedom of speech does not mean you are free to say whatever you want without reprisal, as to do so would be taking away another persons freedom of speech.

"There so much wrong in this comment.  

I don't believe for a minute that there were 1080 vehicles ""surrounding the city of GP"".  Quit your BS.

You may not be about non-fearmongering/violence but they are showing the opposite by these blockades.  There have been lots of comments on the disruption that's happening in Ottawa with noise and the additional traffic.  This IS domestic terrorism.  People are shiting in yards because you guys are not organized.  Yes believe it.

They are doing more to hurt Albertans than for.  Blocking ongoing traffic affects everyone because they can't be bothered to be self-less and help one another.

Again it is your choice to get the vaccine but it is also your responsibility to deal with the outcomes.  I don't want to see people loosing theirs jobs, but if you won't help than this is only on you.  There are truckers who have lost their jobs for not getting vaccines not because of Canadian mandates but those of the US.  And don't believe for a second that Biden is going to change it for you guys.

Dancing on top of a war memorial is desecration.  Have more respect than that.  However I do agree with your point about the Terry Fox monument.

There is absolutely hate involved in this.  Hate for the PM, libtard s and all that jazz.  There have been attacks in Ottawa and even AB.  Look around at all the ""fuck Trudeau"" flags, same happened when the NDP were Elected in AB.

Why do you think Trudeau is hiding?  There is most likely some type of danger towards him.

This convoy is not for everyone in Canada and I'm ashamed that you say it is.  I don't agree with this convoy at all.

And for Tamara Lich who wanted Alberta to separate and become a US state.  I would never vote for that.  But you say this is about Canadian freedoms but your supporting someone who had wanted to seperate from Canada.  Definitely hard to belive she is more popular the the PM.  Listen I'm not a fan of him any more than you are.

For the others that ""may"" not have been sanctioned to speak for this convoy it's too late.  MOU and Canada Unity never heard of them.  But they are here like it or not attached to this convoy.  Apparently so has Trump giving praises and trying to rally his own convoy to DC.
