"I had the same exactly question 2 years ago and had to do some extensive digging. Your best bets are:

Grand lake Nordic center/golf course. Dogs are allowed off leash! I have two giant huskies and they were rubbish at pulling me so they ended up running around while I xc skied. Rentals are 12-14/day and trail pass is 15-20? Keep in mind all my info is approximate and 2 years old. 

Gold run Nordic center in Frisco. Dogs are only allowed on one outer perimeter trail on leash. I took an xc ski lesson here for only 50 bucks. 

Devil’s thumb ranch in tabernash. Supposedly amazing and you can rent skijoring gear and take skijoring lessons. I opted out because it’s super expensive. You need to buy a trail pass for each dog too.

Lake granby Nordic center too? Can’t remember, pretty sure there’s another one in this area. 

Aspen snow mass Nordic trail systems—not in summit co but they have 60 miles of trails!!

Another thing that helped was googling “xc skiing with dogs” instead of skijoring.

"Pretty much just recreation/change of pace. My Gf and I ski all the time and hate making the drive from Broomfield.

I've lived in CO my entire life and have lived in boulder, fort collins, denver, golden, and the springs and wanted a change of pace. I agree, ton of great rec areas but just gets old after awhile. Thought summit might be a good solution since I've never lived there and there is so much to do (outdoor wise). Haven't been able to explore much of summit besides skiing because the drive is so long.

"Amazing advice. The only one I would prefer to phrase differently is number 3:

Instead of thinking about car lengths, I would think about time. It's very easy to estimate: 

When the car in front of you passes something stationary (like a sign, a tree or even a road marking) start counting _""one Mississippi, two Mississippi...""_ until you pass that same object. If you are driving on snow or ice, I'd at least double the following distance from to ~6s. If you're going to downhill on snow or ice, I'd double it again. It takes a lot longer than most people think to stop on snow and ice, specially going downhill. Going uphill, I'd still keep plenty of space to the car in front of you. Gives both you and them maneuvering room. 

If you have to come to a stop on a hill in snow or ice, I'd also leave extra space as you never know if you or someone else is going to start sliding.


In my opinion, leaving plenty of space between cars is the most important factor of winter driving. As failure to do so directly risks hurting other people.

I'd also like to add one point: 
Maneuver extra slowly and carefully. A too quick lane change on a road with poor traction can see you visit the curb or ditch. This goes hand in hand with point 1 of taking it slowly.

At the end of the day, you driving slower and taking more time to arrive to your destination is still faster than you ending up in a ditch or worse.

"The bike path between Dillon and Keystone will not be plowed or groomed, specifically from Summit Cove to Keystone. Some areas will get packed out by people walking but the ~2 mile stretch from Summit Cove to Keystone will be deep snow.

Technically you do have the road but as someone comfortable riding in the road there is no way in hell I'd ride that stretch of road in the winter -- you lose the shoulder, the road is often icy, and the driver's are terrifying.

You're much better off making use of the Summit Stage if you won't have a car or simply want to avoid driving. I spent a season living in Silverthorne and working in Keystone without a car...the free Summit Stage did everything I need, if a bit slowly.

eta: for full accuracy, there is a stretch of bike path along Lake Dillon in Dillon that will get plowed, but it's still icy and not useful if Summit Cove to Keystone is deep snow.",t2_296slsv,trailwanderer,0,1636360732.0,0,t1_hjs7dgd,hjs7dgd,True,throwaway_yiiiiikes,t3_qoxg8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Summit/comments/qoxg8p/is_buying_a_bike_worth_it/,Is buying a bike worth it?,/r/Summit/comments/qoxg8p/is_buying_a_bike_worth_it/hjs7dgd/,3,r/Summit,0,3

It’s a tactic I only ever see used by guys above 50 - they insult themselves in order to “compliment” the women around them and start a conversation. I don’t think he was physically dangerous, but I do think he crossed a line by continuing to comment on other people’s bodies while we all sat mostly unclothed in the sauna, and I would understand if the woman I was in there with was made more uncomfortable by me leaving. 

Conversations in there are fine, but picking an enclosed, semi-private space to start hitting on a young person by commenting on their appearance means he was not great at reading social cues or body language, or maybe he likes making other people uncomfortable.

"I mean, you are on the Summit sub, so obviously we are biased towards Summit County. Still, I'd personally much rather live in Silverthorne than Avon.

Beaver Creek is great and has some amazing terrain, so you definitely need to go on powder day. The resort is geared towards posh families, though, and that's the people you meet.

Vail is an absolutely fantastic mountain, especially for skiers. Parking there is really expensive, even as a local, and even the buses are not free from Avon. 

You can't beat the convenience of four mountains near Silverthorne, ALL of whom offer free parking, ALL of whom can be accessed via free shuttles. 

From a pure living perspective, not much of a difference. Both places offer similar arrays of grocery stores, movie theaters, gyms, big box stores, restaurants, and nightlife. Summit is much prettier, but it's also much higher and colder.

If you have friends in Denver that would visit, then consider that getting over Vail Pass can be a real nightmare in the winter. That can work in favor of Avon (if your friends want to ski Vail/BC and can stay at your place before a storm hits), but will generally work in favor of Silverthorne.

You've also got all 4 mountains all equidistant for variety, and Beaver/Vail are not too far either. Living out here for a season, the ability to rotate keeps everything fresh vs skiing the same 1-2 mountains day after day.

"I’ve lived in both towns, Silverthorne is a bit more low key while Breck tends to have more things to do. 

Traffic in Breck can be bad, but once you start figuring out the area there are a few shortcuts/workarounds. Traffic issues can be even worse in Silverthorne, you can get completely trapped somewhere if the highway closes with lots of people on the road. 

As far as skiing goes, it’s hard to beat walking through town to the gondola; there are also a few questionably legal parking secrets if you’re further from the town. Silverthorne you end up being around 30min from Breck, 15-20 to the basin/keystone. Being in Breck really only adds 10-15 minutes to the keystone/basin drive. I also end up spending a good amount of time with friends in Denver and being in Breck adds about 30 minutes to that drive.

Nightlife wise there are a ton of fun bars in Breck along with the distillery/breweries for earlier on. Silverthorne bar scene is almost non existent, but angry James is a cool place to hang out and the amphitheater shows in the summer are always fun.

Overall if you’re looking to meet new people and ski half days I would choose Breck, but if you’d rather be a bit further from the chaos Silverthorne is a great place too.

Leadville RV Corral would be my first call but its a small place and stays booked up all winter long.  A few small parks exist in Eagle County but they will also be in high demand. I like Snowy Peaks RV Park in Buena Vista too. 

many area counties have some form of this rule ""no camping unit may be occupied for more than six (6) months in any twelve (12) month period"" so keep that in mind.

Also you have the Lake Dillon Theatre Company right there in the Silverthorne Performing Arts Center, the movie theater just a bit up the hill, and more access to everyday shopping like groceries and such.

"I (35 F) live in Silverthorne and like it, but there's not a ton of nightlife here (or maybe I'm lame now?). Breck seems to have awful traffic all the time and I have turned around and gone to Abay multiple times in the past few years because I couldn't find parking on a Saturday morning. That said, it has a cute downtown and is walkable and I bet it's fun on the weekends if you're cool with meeting a lot of tourists.   


There are full-timers in Silverthorne but I don't know of any locals hangout spots here. Most other people who I've met who are around my age have been at the rec center, but we mostly hang out with friends from the front range who come up to stay. There are some cool places here, though -- Fritangas and La Perla have super tasty Mexican food, Angry James is a solid brewery, and allegedly we'll get a food hall in the next couple months. It's easy to avoid the outlets and the river has a lovely bike path that runs along it, which you can take up to Dillon and over to Frisco and Breck. We also have a great forest fire right now, which Breck doesn't have.   


Are you up here to meet people or up here to ski, though?

I started working for an event staffing company. Innovative Team Productions I think. They provide event staff for local festivals and concerts and stuff. Super easy to apply & even if you never actually work any events for them, you can still check the available jobs to see what’s coming up in the area. 

But I dig the side hustle, has always sort of been my trick for getting to know a new area & meet people. It’s not great money or anything but that’s not really the point.

"Sure then let’s go back to Airbnb’s. This isn’t just an issue in summit. There is no department requiring you to apply for licensing and no inspection performed to actually verify if the listing can in anyway safely handle the amount of occupants that the owner lists it can handle. If the OWNER of the unit is listing it for 3-4 times the amount of people that could legally even live there, then that liability for their greed falls on them as the owner and they should lose their license. Similarly, if an Airbnb GUEST continues to violate Airbnb’s terms of service and the terms of the unit they’re in (including number of occupants and parties) then yes they should have their accounts suspended as a warning and if it happens again ban them. Which is already happening in California and Florida. Owners of Airbnb’s are already cracking down on the party thing because of the damage people are doing to their investment, which is why you see incidents with overpacked decks at a party that collapses. Owners right now see the writing on the wall and are installing noise detection devices and if it goes above a certain decibel they’ll warn you once and then can terminate the rental if you’re still violating it.

"You realize a lot of these airbnbs are entirely flouting occupancy and fire code as it is? In the state of Colorado, a bedroom legally has to have 4 actual walls that are permanently installed and a door (no partitions and curtains), a closet and a window to be legally considered a bedroom in an MLS listing when the home is for sale and most importantly and relevant to this problem, when a long term lease is established. 

So no, someone cannot take a 1 bedroom condo with a loft and legally lease it to 7 adults because this violates fire code and safe occupancy established by the state. There is NOTHING stopping Airbnb owners from listing the same 1 bedroom with a loft condo and claiming it sleeps 7 (1 king bed in the master, bunk bed + a queen bed in the loft and a sleeper sofa) and sure technically there’s a place for 7 people to rest their heads and sure it’s not a big deal for vacationing for a week… but when you’re sitting there trying to decide if you should rent your one bedroom out to a nice couple who works on the mountain or list it to sleep 7 and not care if it’s occupied most of the year because you make more renting it out for 4 nights than you’d make in a single month renting it to a pair of adults.

"that's fine to deed restrict but the issue is if you look at manhattan. tons of people ignore the no airbnb laws there.

Realestate in summit is so expensive because people are buying it up not just for a second/vacation home but to make money on it since it's so easy to give it to a management company and just collect checks every month. 

You remove crazy number of STRs and people sell for crazy prices and it sits on the market and prices drop because they need to sell because now their home isn't making money

The home I bought was a complete demo job. People don't want to buy homes in Summit that require work. Why.. because they want to STR right away. Want to make a killing? Flip homes in Summit county not the front range. Home I did it with last that we just sold made 95% since we furnished it for someone that is going to STR it. 

I bought the home for 30% under plus a 125k credit for renovations and someone that knows they can make a killing off it paid way over asking for it. That home would never go for the price it's in contract for right now if you can't STR it.

"Just wanted to share my feelings as a 5 year local. I just bought a condo here in Summit Cove, lived in Dillon Valley for 4 years. While we were looking to buy, I refused to even consider looking in Breck, because its the most touristy town (aside from Frisco) in Summit... Aside from constant traffic, two of my main issues with Breck is that there are only 2 small grocery stores in Breck and it's about a 20-30 minute drive to I-70 on non-busy days. (I go down to Denver pretty often to visit friends and to do some shopping). I much prefer living in the Silverthorne/Dillon area of Summit but that's really just a personal preference. 

Blue River seems like an idyllic place to live but idk about ""community"" because the homes are spread out. Plus you'd need to consider where you'd send your kids to school... Dillon Valley, Summit Cove, and the Willowbrook neighborhoods all have really friendly people, although I should posit that I'm not as familiar with Frisco and Breck as I am with Silvy/Dillon. Final note - the RE market really is crazy and we only lucked out because the sellers reached out to my husband via a coworker who knew we were looking to buy - otherwise we'd still be looking!

"electric resistance heating, if that's what your baseboards are, are always 100% efficient.  Electric resistance heating turns 100% of the energy used into heat.  Heat pumps are theoretically capable of greater than 100% efficiency - they can put more heat into the room than energy you put in to the 'pump'.  So unless you're getting 100% efficiency or better from your heat pump, and you can't get gas service, electric resistance heat is going to be cheaper.

Heat pumps can run both ways too though, so if you also want air conditioning you might consider a heat pump supplemented with electric resistance heat.  You can just turn the heat pump off at temperatures where it's less than 100% efficient.",t2_aa602ti9,Bitter_Sink_659,0,1612984922.0,0,t1_gmumor3,gmumor3,False,hijinks,t3_leq5b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Summit/comments/leq5b3/anyone_using_ductless_minisplit_heatpumps_to_heat/,Anyone using ductless minisplit heatpumps to heat a home?,/r/Summit/comments/leq5b3/anyone_using_ductless_minisplit_heatpumps_to_heat/gmumor3/,1,r/Summit,0,1

"To be honest- they’re all over the county, but it’s really hit and miss when/if you’re going to find them. I’ve lived in the county almost 20 years and never seen a bobcat or owl. Foxes are common, as are moose. Black bears are around, and a lot of smaller animals. My suggestion would be to get out of town and be familiar with the habitat of the animal you want to find. My instinct says down by Blue River is a good place to start. Lots of willows, and not as busy as other areas in the county, moose frequent there a lot. Up towards Kremmling or Montezuma is less populated as well. If you’re looking for eagles there are nests on the islands in Lake Dillon, and one that I’m not sure is active on a telephone pole on highway 9 towards Kremmling. Osprey are in Frisco and Silverthorne a lot as well, but they tend to be a little less active in winter.",t2_62jtrlrx,ThinkGuard,0,1611804841.0,0,t1_gl1la04,gl1la04,True,meyou942,t3_l6mryc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Summit/comments/l6mryc/potentially_a_strange_question_does_anyone_have/,"Potentially a strange question... does anyone have any suggestions for places to see wildlife in the county?

"\>  I know they are at the mercy of Polis like last March when everything shut down 

Gov Polis is an elected public official, and they tend to be pretty reasonable folks, not leaping around being dictators, although there's always exceptions.

Nevertheless, I am thinking the upshot is:  Things don't look good.  That's the summary, here's the full bull:

Starting with a link to an article in the local news from 10 days ago, from Weld County, which isn't Summit, it's on the Front Range, north of Denver.  

[https://www.greeleytribune.com/2020/11/13/tell-her-no-commissioners-governor-testy-regarding-covid-19-during-after-call-as-cases-skyrocket/](https://www.greeleytribune.com/2020/11/13/tell-her-no-commissioners-governor-testy-regarding-covid-19-during-after-call-as-cases-skyrocket/)

and a quote from it

""After the call ended, but before the recording shut off, James later remarked that it seemed the governor’s office was playing poker “with no  cards in their hands” on the call.

The governor did not request greater enforcement of any order he had  made, nor suggest application of a local order. The commissioners  expressed surprise at this in the post-call crosstalk.""

Then [https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/jxg0db/weld\_county\_moving\_to\_level\_red/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/jxg0db/weld_county_moving_to_level_red/)

and the neighbors [https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/k0e6l6/longmont\_mayor\_wants\_to\_restrict\_city\_hospitals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/k0e6l6/longmont_mayor_wants_to_restrict_city_hospitals/) from taking Weld County patients

and [https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/jxqe2v/air\_force\_academy\_locks\_down\_cadets\_to\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/jxqe2v/air_force_academy_locks_down_cadets_to_stop/) spread

but [https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/jygbrx/masks\_dont\_work/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/jygbrx/masks_dont_work/) (because they aren't worn) reports are still turning up

So to put it mildly, the only folks at the mercy of Gov Polis are the folks that he is trying to protect while other people are adamant about their rights.

Most of those links are from the r/CoronavirusColorado sub.

Polis seems pretty set on keeping them open.

"I don't have any inside info, but it seems like the way things are currently setup (no indoor dining, spaced lift lines), odds of transmission among guests during the day is going to be pretty darn low.

The two things I could see shutting things down are (1) shutting down resorts as a proxy for stopping travel into the state (or heavily cutting it), or (2) needing to shut things down because of transmission among resort employees.

"I completely disagree with both your drink choices (although tea is great) and your view of how the ski areas would be without the support of the current tourist industry.

Sure, IF Colorado had NEVER become an international ski destination we could have small ski areas similar to the midwest.  However, that ship has sailed and what we now have is large ski resorts.  

If they were forced to close because of lack of tourism they would never come back as small ski areas.  

1.  Ski resorts would never 'retrograde' to ski areas as the cost of obtaining and running one of the current resorts would necessitate running it as a large ski resort that caters to out of towners. Nobody would be able to afford acquiring one of the existing but now hypothetically defunct ski areas only to operate a small portion of it.
2. The cost of starting up a 'ski area' is astronomically prohibitive so the chances of a midwest style ski area opening up is slim to none.

"I am sorry about the reaction to your post. Clearly , attitudes have been informed by the summer, when infection rates in California were much higher than in Colorado. Right now, the situation is reversed and your wife and kids are much more likely to bring COVID-19 back to California than they are to bring it to Colorado.

As for the actual question. Copper Mountain is absolutely awesome for beginners. The terrain has a naturally increasing slope from West to East, so that the West end is almost entirely beginner-friendly and everybody can progress slowly to the East. You don't really every risk taking a wrong turn and finding yourself on a double black by accident. 

Since you'll be renting long-term, you should probably look into renting far from the actual resort. Copper has no attached town, and if you are coming from the West, Avon is a better option. From the East, Silverthorne, Dillon, and Frisco have more selection. 

Some shops have rent-to-own options.

"Utopia is pretty decent. Stay away from Big O. Summit Ford has decent deals on tires if you're looking for new stuff (Avoid their service department if you can, though. Don't let my neighbor know I steered you away...).

I disagree with the Summit Auto Group comment above. Had them change my oil and rotate my tires once. They had the truck for 2 hours after telling me to wait 15 minutes. Changed the oil and took one tire off the front left and switched it with the back (4x4 truck, they buried my locking hubs with a plastic wheel cap on the drivers side, passenger side lug nuts still had dust on them). Told me they couldn't get the caps off when they rotated the tires... went ahead and buried the hub anyway. I told them to take it back to the bay and try again. Once it was on the jacks I pushed the cap off with my pointer finger. They scammed me and wasted a ton of my time... and really only took two wheels off on a paid rotation. 

They did apologize for it though.

"Meeting people in general has been pretty damn hard since COVID (In my perception at least.)  


I've definitely wondered the best way to go about it without frequenting bars since I've moved past that stage in my life also.  Honestly, never in my life had much conscious thought about wanting to meet new people but now that I'm not working a ski bum job and partying regularly it just doesn't seem to happen naturally.  


I've given some thought to joining the Colorado Mountain Club and going on some of their group outings in the future.

"I would say that the location within town is more important than which town when it comes to snow. In general, it is rare that we are snowed in to the point where you can't make it to the supermarket all day.

Vail is a totally separate universe traffic-wise. The only way to get there realistically is I-70 and crossing it during a snow storm is generally a nightmare - mostly because it's usually full of people that aren't used to driving in the snow. The same is true for the feeders that go to Breck (US 6) and Keystone (CO 9).

Personally, if there is more than an inch of snow on the ground, I'll take the shuttle. It's free, it's frequent (although the schedule turns into a joke when the snow hits), and you don't risk your car getting hit by said people not used to snow.

"The road that closes the most is I-70. Specifically Vail Pass between Copper Mountain and Vail. It can close at any time of day when it's snowing, which can make getting out of Vail tricky if you're trying to get back to Summit county. The nightmare traffic you hear about only happens on weekends but can happen along highway 6 or highway 9 heading towards I-70.

6 turns into a dumpster fire when 70 closes and all the day-trippers get stuck in Silverthorne/Dillon. The road can back up a couple miles toward Keystone and the alternate routes get crushed too. This is the worst jam IMO and there's a bar in Summit Cove where you can wait it out. Highway 6 and highway 9 within summit county never close. Ever.

Swan mountain road and Dillon Dam road around the lake only close when the weather is really bad. They can be good alternate routes when traffic happens if they remain open.

Getting snowed in to the point where you can't get to the store is extremely rare - probably not likely over the course of a single winter. With the caveat that if your car has crappy tires you will be snowed in every day for 5 months.

Edit: If you drive to the mountain to ski every day you can probably bank on having about 10 days where it takes over an hour to get home regardless of where you live. The only way you don't make it home for longer is if you ski Vail and the pass doesn't reopen until hours after you finish skiing - this happens a few days a year max.",t2_e6kuk,c00tr,0,1601672943.0,0,t1_g7g3bu4,g7g3bu4,True,ATerriblePanda,t3_j42m6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Summit/comments/j42m6z/frisco_vs_dillon_vs_silverthorne_traffic_and/,Frisco vs Dillon vs Silverthorne traffic and winter road closures?,/r/Summit/comments/j42m6z/frisco_vs_dillon_vs_silverthorne_traffic_and/g7g3bu4/,13,r/Summit,0,13

"Is your driveway plowed? Are you living in town? Do you have a garage? So many questions. I think you'll be fine if you don't live out Mosquito. Definitely chains and watch the traction law level.
