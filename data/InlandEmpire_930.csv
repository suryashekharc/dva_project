"I agree... no need to pay for something that can be easily learned and done yourself for free.  I recommend checking out creditboards which is a community that has very knowledgeable gurus.  

One thing to note is debt to income (DTI) ratio is often the biggest barrier to buying a home, even more so than credit scores especially with how crazy home prices have got now.  So its a good idea to work on your total monthly debt  amounts if your expected exit DTI is over limits.  One trick to help with DTI ratio could be to consolidate any credit debt onto a 0% balance transfer card a couple months before applying for the home loan.

">NORCO, Calif. (KABC) -- An Eastvale mother is furious after discovering a video showing her daughter's preschool teacher leading a political chant in which the 4 and 5-year-old students were calling for President Joe Biden to leave office.

>""I was just in shock,"" said Christina McFadden, who told Eyewitness News the video was posted on a school messaging app that is used to communicate with parents. The incident allegedly happened on Feb. 18 at Turning Point Christian School in the city of Norco.

>""I had to watch it multiple times to realize, is this really happening?"" McFadden said.

>The video lasts only about eight seconds. You can hear a teacher asking the students, ""Who's our President."" The students then respond in unison, ""Biden!"" The teacher then asks the students ""What do we want to do with him?"" and the students respond twice, ""We want him out!""

>McFadden said when she picked up her daughter from school that afternoon, one of the first things she referenced was the chant.

>""The first thing she said to me when I picked her up was 'We want him out,'"" said McFadden. ""That was the great message she learned that day. Her first history lesson.""

>McFadden said the video was removed from the messaging app about three hours after it was first posted. In its place, a school administrator left a message for the families to whom the video was sent:

>""We use Brightwheel as a parent communication app to share about your child's day and activities. Earlier today a video was posted that has since been deleted as it did not share our school and church philosophy of honoring and respecting authority including those in government positions,"" the message said.

>The message continued, ""We are sorry for any misunderstanding this could of (sic) created. With courtesy towards the families of our campus and the children in the classroom I am asking you to please not share with others or post the video on any social media platform.""

>Eyewitness News reached out to Turning Point Christian School by phone and email and did not immediately receive a response. It's unclear what, if any, disciplinary action was taken against the teacher.

>Dr. Tyrone Howard, a professor of education at UCLA, said he doesn't feel what was shown in the video is appropriate behavior by the teacher.

>""I've always believed the role of teachers is not to indoctrinate students about what to think,"" said Howard. ""It's to help develop critical thinking skills so students can make their own decisions.""

>""I know private schools operate under a different set of guidelines and procedures,"" Howard continued. ""But I don't know even in a private domain that those leadership officials would want teachers telling their students what to think about a particular political figure.""

>McFadden said the school did not tell her whether the teacher was disciplined, only saying she had been ""repentant"" and had learned from her mistake. She only posted the video online, after blurring everyone's faces, when she didn't feel the school's response was adequate.

>""It doesn't matter, at this point, which side of the fence you're on. This can happen in your child's classroom, and it is happening,"" said McFadden.",t2_1m9ri0de,The_Steining,0,1647789953.0,0,t1_i1ev24o,i1ev24o,True,The_Steining,t3_tinemd,https://www.reddit.com/r/InlandEmpire/comments/tinemd/riverside_county_parent_furious_after_teacher/,Riverside County Parent Furious After Teacher Leads Political Chant Involving Preschool Students,/r/InlandEmpire/comments/tinemd/riverside_county_parent_furious_after_teacher/i1ev24o/,1,r/InlandEmpire,0,1

Edit: You can also call your nearest large hospital and ask to speak to a chaplain. Believe it or not, chaplains are supposed to be able to give nondenominational advice and guidance, unless their client asks for specific religious counseling. Tell them what you need, then ask if the chaplain has a few ideas or referrals.

there is a big difference between a customer paying surge pricing and a driver getting surge/promo/boost pay.

They won't have to both work and still be hungry. It's not unreasonable for the employees that make all the execs' money to want a bigger cut.

Any other cities within 20 miles that can say all that?

The rates for FHA aren't high lol. They are usually 0.5% lower than most conventional. They are 3% lower than DSCR or NonQM. 

You have pmi but you're going to have mortgage insurance on any loan with less than 20% down. Why take time to save up a down payment when the CPI is 7%? You lose the value of the dollar faster than you can save. With a mortgage, the rates are lower than inflation. 

Also yes collectilons stay on the credit report but they don't have a major impact to the score. I have seen people with a 700 FICO 2 years from the date they filed bankruptcy (chapter 7) and had a foreclosure prior to the BK.

"You’ll get there. Just keep working on your credit score. Keep your payments on time and if you can, pay a little bit more whenever possible 

What I did to improve mine was this: I got a small loan with an interest rate of 11%. I used this loan to pay off my credit cards (5 total. 3 credit cards, 1 Lowes card, 1 service card), which, when I added up the interest on all 5 was a whopping 81%. Once I payed them off, my credit score improved and I’ve been chipping away at the loan for a few months now and have kept improving my score. I was able to recently pay an extra $800, so that’s 2 less payments, which isn’t much, but it helps. 

Anyhow, just keep chipping away at the stone. You’ll get there and get that house.

"The very first thing I would do is file to get your credit report from all three credit reporting agencies as soon as possible. By law, you can get one report from each one for free. Get your reports and make sure everything there is accurate. Then, look at the areas that are hurting your score. Take care of those first… and keep making on time payments on all the other accounts. If you can knock off a smaller delinquent debt, do that first so that it will drop off your credit report faster. And no matter what… do NOT incur more debt if you are trying to buy a house. Even if you can make payments on time for the new debt, do NOT take on more debt. If you need a car… either pay it cash, or wait until after you buy a house to finance a new car.

You’re right, it's going to take time. It probably took me a few years to get out from my debt and increase my credit score enough to buy a house. Just take it one month at a time Until you get there, and monitor your scores monthly with Credit Karma, or some other free service so you can see your progress.

"Purely looking at politics is short sighted simple-minded thinking.

Theme parks, major conventions and sporting events like the Super Bowl and the Olympics bring money to the state. Oh, and billion dollar movies are made here yearly. So let Northern California shoot itself in the foot losing out on all that revenue for extra congressmen that won't make a difference (see Sinema/Manchin)... Yeah no. 

California has the most electorates of all states in the entire country.

"I am getting the sense from your statements that you don't have a clear understanding what the difference is between private and public property is. I may be wrong about that as I am only going by what you are stating in your comments. It's nothing to be ashamed of but if you don't know you can be setting yourself up and they (the governing agencies) can surely take advantage of you if you don't know the difference between what is private property and public property as the laws are different for each. 

Yes, it's true an officer could walk up on your ungated private driveway and ticket your unregistered vehicle although that will not hold up in court in most jurisdictions and will only be thrown out in court once you can prove the vehicle was not on public property, whether parked on the street or driving it on the street. You cannot even drive the car to the DMV to register it. You can go to the DMV and pay a fee for a temporary registration that will allow you to operate the vehicle on the public roadways but you have to do so before that temporary registration expires.

Business properties are a bit tricky. While business property is private property some businesses will not permit you to park an unregistered vehicle on their property and may have an agreement with a towing company that will come tow your vehicle away at the owner's expense even if the owner of the property has given you permission to park the vehicle on their property but don't make it clear to the towing company that a specific vehicle is not to be towed. I've experienced that myself when my employer forgot to notify the tow company to leave my vehicle alone which I was storing there for a month until I got the money to pay up all the back registration of vehicle I had purchased. I had to pay the tow and storage fees, and get a temporary registration just to get the car back which only set back more than I anticipated, but it beat losing the car entirely to a lien.

Like they say in courtrooms nearly everyday to what seems like at least one person if not several, ignorance of the law is no excuse. Telling the judge ""I didn't know that was a law"" is not a viable defense. You will pay for your ignorance. It's your responsibility to know what the laws are. Even courts will take advantage of you if you are not knowledgeable of what the laws are. They will walk right over you without a second thought.",t2_ae0h7cd8,DaUnknowable_Knowin1,0,1645498048.0,0,t1_hxwztd8,hxwztd8,False,max4621,t3_sm86ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/InlandEmpire/comments/sm86ag/can_a_sheriff_come_to_my_home_and_give_me_a/,Can a Sheriff come to my home and give me a ticket for my registration being expired?,/r/InlandEmpire/comments/sm86ag/can_a_sheriff_come_to_my_home_and_give_me_a/hxwztd8/,0,r/InlandEmpire,0,0

"In most cities if a car is parked on private property they are not going to walk onto their property to ticket an unregistered vehicle unless there is a city ordinance like the one they have in Corona.

"An agency doesn't form laws, write tickets, and collect monies. That would be people that are in some way connected to the agency and benefit somehow financially from it. Of course, there are those in the agencies that do benefit for handing tickets as that is job security in their mind, perhaps advancement if they get good reviews on their work performance. However, those are not even the ones I am alluding to here. I've learned it does no good in sharing the information with those who are not willing to find out for themselves to do their own research as they don't tend to really appreciate it and that is completely understandable. If someone offers me some information and I am receiving it from word of mouth, that is only hearsay for me and I still don't know what they are telling me is true directly for myself. 

For those who interested I recommend they follow the money trail, as it doesn't stop with agents that work for the agency. It goes well beyond that but it is traceable. But you are going to have to do some digging and sifting for that information. You are also going to have to keep an open mind to allowing it to reveal itself to you as it is. If you are truly interested you won't have any problem investigating it and won't put a timetable upon the researching of it, you won't cling to preconceived notions, nor will you form expectations for what the outcome of the truth of the matter might be. Only then will you uncover it. You may be disgusted and angry with what you may find that will have you want to climb to the rooftops with a megaphone and tell everyone what you uncovered. It may make you lose faith in humanity as many do a whole lot of bitching and complaining but they do nothing about it when they have the information. You may begin to fantasizing about taking violent action and I would strongly recommend not ever doing that because in war both sides lose yet those who fund wars always fund both sides but never are they on the battlefield nor are their young adult children. It can lead to all kinds of negative feelings and thoughts that you are going to have to confront in yourself if you are not ready to uncover the corruption which just may blow your mind at how incredibly cold-blooded and can seem to get away with blatant criminal activities that would land you in prison for the rest of your life 5 times over, yet they don't even seem like they can be touched and just deny their involvement and it seems to go away even when there is a huge public backlash. That's what I went through. I learned a lot from it which is why I realized it does no good trying to blow the whistle when people don't really care or are too lazy to do it for themselves. And some people just love to complain but that is as far as it goes for them. They are content with complaining. I'm not judging them for it just saying what I've seen and to me that seems pointless as it does nothing but make you feel like some powerless victim and I am no victim, but I have a great deal of compassion for all of life.

I don't know you so I am not saying this about you directly. But if you're not really interested but only sort of interested or have suspicions you might form ideas in your mind that you don't actually know are true and you may settle for that and may try to convince yourself that what you imagine is the truth is really the truth but it isn't really the truth. You just deceive yourself and then you find yourself trying to convince others that what you think is true is not just a thought but something you actually know when in fact you don't know and it is just a thought. It isn't something we consciously do, it is something we do unconsciously because we don't like what seems to be unjust and corrupt. You may think you want to find out what's at the root of certain things going on with our public systems but you may not prepared to find out the truth. If your mind is already believing it's too big of a task to undertake, it will make excuses as to why you shouldn't waste your time although there is a genuine interest to know and you will just flip flop back and forth and if you do any digging it will be half-hearted and you'll be easily misled by misinformation because there certainly is a lot whole of that going around these days and so you have to do a lot of sifting and that requires a great deal of patience.

In the bigger picture of things, however, it really doesn't matter as everything works out for the good. But it does seem to matter at this level in which we seem to live in a society where people lust for power and it's those who tend to be the most ego-centric that desperately want that power. Corporations routinely put profits over people. Just look at the current administration in the White House. And I honestly don't care if a Dem or Rep gets elected to that office either way. But I can see what a hot mess it is right now and there clearly is a whole lot of corruption in our government that has been going on from day 1 before the nation was even established. Then take a good look at how Congress behaves, making serious criminal allegations against one another and yet the only ones who ever seem to go to jail are the ones hired by the elected officials but never any of the elected officials. The American people get really upset about it but soon something on the news comes along and they forget all about it. They are all caught in some other matter that distracts them. It is what it is, I don't put my hope or hang my happiness in politics and government anyway, but many do and it's no wonder so many people are so incredibly contentious and extremely unhappy. People are at one another's throats it seems like more than ever which is exactly what they want them to be doing thinking their enemy is their fellow countrymen, but look who is influencing them. 

And that right there is a good example of what I was saying, if you are not aware of any of that yourself, you may likely settle for believing me or disbelieving me and that won't do anything for you because you still won't know. Or perhaps you disagree and that is fine too but I am not going to defend any positions. I'll let people believe what they want. When you do know and I know directly for ourselves, there is no desire to debate others about it, as most of them get their information from second hand from a third party, it's not directly know by them. When many others get tired of suffering and can no longer buy into what they are being told because things don't seem to add up they too will do their own digging and they come to know it directly for themselves. Then they will be ready to take action and change is inevitably going to follow. Violence isn't even needed, just knowing the facts and holding them accountable without letting them distract you is enough. But most people are insincere in what they say they care about it and what it is they say they want they don't actually want. They want exactly what they have while saying they don't want it but they don't do anything about changing it so their actions speak louder than their words and prove their words are insincere, they want what they have, a comfortable hell because at least it is familiar. And that's fine, they have what they create whether they are discontent with it or not.

"Ohhhh so it’s because you don’t understand how science works and rely on other people…media…to tell you. Well let me explain, science is based on research, peer-review, and consensus. Sometimes what is believed when a minimal amount of data is available changes when more data becomes available and shows that what was previously stated as true is no longer true. Science paradigm’s shift constantly according to the most up to date and peer-reviewed data. Peer-review is the process in which other scientists that are knowledgeable in the subject review the methods of a study, deeming it either acceptable or in need of more research or in some cases unacceptable if the methods and data don’t necessarily lead to the conclusions being presented. The study I am sure you are talking about did not say that masks don’t work science is far more nuanced than that. However, news outlets quoting portions of a study out of context might make such a statement. Here is a link to the [CURRENT](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html#anchor_1619457332454) CDC position on masks. They have been updating this consistently throughout the pandemic as it is an ongoing study. In case you don’t want to read it, here is the relevant portion for our conversation:

“The prevention benefit of masking is derived from the combination of source control and wearer protection. The relationship between source control and wearer protection is likely complementary and possibly synergistic, so that individual benefit increases with increasing community mask use.”

Masks work by shielding others from your germs, not the other way around. That is why it is so important for EVERYONE to wear a mask! Me wearing a mask protects you and you wearing a mask protects me. The more people that are masked in a community, the better protection they offer. There are some masks that do protect the wearer as well, like N95’s. And some that do a very poor job, like those made of polyester and other stretchy materials. But generally, YES masks do work, so please start wearing one.",t2_72888gov,Penguinkrug84,0,1645288063.0,0,t1_hxlcdrm,hxlcdrm,False,SoCalHouseInterest,t3_svpsyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/InlandEmpire/comments/svpsyy/governor_visits_fontana_announces_next_phase_of/,"Governor visits Fontana, announces next phase of state's response to COVID-19 pandemic",/r/InlandEmpire/comments/svpsyy/governor_visits_fontana_announces_next_phase_of/hxlcdrm/,10,r/InlandEmpire,0,10

"No, your SIL is grossly misinformed. 

However, if you do not register your vehicle and leave it on a public roadway they can certainly ticket the vehicle title holder (NOT the vehicle owner, which is the State, never the purchaser of the vehicle) or tow it. 

If you do not register the vehicle the DMV will indeed send you threatening letters in the mail that you need to either register your vehicle, pay the penalties if any, or acquire a non-op from them. There is no other option, only threats are made if you do not comply. 

I find this last one incredibly trifling, or revealing, depending how you look at it. 

It's your vehicle, the idea is that you bought it, you own it. But somehow you have to pay the DMV something every year that you own the car which is a tax or licensing of sorts. They are essentially saying that we really do not own our vehicles, the State does. 

You are just given a certificate that says you are a title holder but are not the actual owner of the property. The DMV, in how it operates, claims to be the real owner of the property which issues YOU, the purchaser and possessor of the property, a title as a mere ""holder"" of the property, NOT the actual owner of the property. Again, being a title holder of the property you are not an owner of the property as you would not need to have a title for it if you actually owned the property, you would have the original document, the ***Certificate of Origin***. Rather YOUR PROPERTY which includes the Certificate of Origin is mailed off to the DMV buy the dealership and manufacturer. The DMV receives the document, makes copies of it and files it away then destroys the original LEGAL document. All you will ever have, at least if you buy a vehicle in the State of California, is the title THEY hand over to you as if they are the owner of the property but are giving you permission to legally hold the property, that YOU are entirely paying for and being taxed on. 

The DMV being the issuer of the title that sends it to you while the DMV gets the actual origin document for proof of ownership from the maker of the property from the manufacturer. In turn, the actual property owner, YOU, gets cut out of the picture and is left footing the bill.  You hold the title, you hold the bill, and the State has passed laws that make this scam a legitimate practice. And most Californians don't know about it or don't care enough about it to investigate it for themselves. If enough Californians did just that then those laws would likely be pushed back into the courts and eventually the courts would be hard pressed to admit the unconstitutionality of this ""legalized"" practice.",t2_ae0h7cd8,DaUnknowable_Knowin1,0,1644977136.0,0,t1_hx4ambv,hx4ambv,True,max4621,t3_sm86ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/InlandEmpire/comments/sm86ag/can_a_sheriff_come_to_my_home_and_give_me_a/,Can a Sheriff come to my home and give me a ticket for my registration being expired?,/r/InlandEmpire/comments/sm86ag/can_a_sheriff_come_to_my_home_and_give_me_a/hx4ambv/,0,r/InlandEmpire,0,0

"I grew up in Ontario and moved to the Coachella Valley 4 years ago, La Quinta Cove. The biggest difference I see is in the traffic. Traffic in the Coachella Valley is slow and fast and congested on the weekends. There's a lot of people of age who are retired and drive super slow and sometimes a little dangerous; for example pulling into a busy 50mph street at 25mph which makes everyone slow down. 
Another difference is people are friendly and down to earth mostly. 
Summers are literal hell here with no humidity which makes it a bit more bearable than humid IE during the same time. 
The Coachella Valley is known for its Festivities and there's a ton of those. 
The sky seems to be always blue and clear with crisp air. 
There's a lot of Rolls Royce and Bentley drivers out here.

Therefore, even without specific evidence linking supplement use with improvement among people with COVID-19, these supplements may be appropriate for people in whom deficiency is suspected or confirmed. For example, a person with little sun exposure and a diet low in dairy products may be likely to have vitamin D deficiency. A simple blood test can confirm or rule out vitamin D or zinc deficiency.
