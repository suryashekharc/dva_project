"Yeah I mean you’re not getting hired if you fail. 

Stop immediately and buy dip stick tests on Amazon. If you are still failing in 3-4 days. You need to think of alternative options (clean friends piss). 
The way to execute this is to have to have the piss in a cleaned out travel lotion container. You’re going to want to warm that up with a couple hand warmers taped to the container so it is body temperature. Most pre employee t testing will allow you to close the door when you test after that it’s simple as using the squirt bottle to fill the cup a bit while you squirt the rest in the bowl so they aren’t suspicious.

You can get good crawfish anywhere but i would suggest Heinen’s to go, it’s across from Lake Charles Cryotherapy, right next to Chaser’s. I know Chaser’s owners, haven’t been but heard it’s a great atmosphere.
Another restaurant you have to try is Darrell’s poboys. Or Buffi’s poboys downtown, they’re both spectacular.
I’m mid 20s, a lot of friends like to go to Rikenjak’s or Crying Eagle.
Bisou Lounge is alright but expensive. The clubs are Cowboys and OBs but i wouldn’t waste my time there.
Of course what everyone knows are the casinos, Lauberge and Golden Nugget. I like Lauberge a little more but Golden Nugget has better restaurants.
They just opened a huge Barstool Sports bar in Lauberge apparently.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

the quality isnt top tier, but for someone who was born in the 80s and smoked in college\*(assuming in the mid late 90s ofc)\* you couldnt have had access to the quality

so yes its better than what you had but not half decent as low shelf shake in some legal and medical states

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

""Restoration of Sam Houston Jones State Park continues following Hurricane Laura. Our friends at The Nature Conservancy in Louisiana and CITGO Fueling Good donated and coordinated the planting of over 5,000 longleaf pine tree seedlings.
 
Now, it’s your turn. Grab your shovel, sturdy shoes and gloves and head to Sam Houston Jones State Park for a tree planting on Saturday, February 19 at 9 a.m. This second tree planting of more than 5,000 trees and shrubs was made possible, in part, with a generous donation of $10,000 from our partner, Sasol of Westlake.

"Yeah north LC used to be white and middle class. If you look at the alums of the high schools in the high schools in that part of town from the 40s-60s, including the ones that were closed like LCHS, they are mostly white. 

But during this era generally there was net black migration from rural areas into bigger cities, typically for jobs, across all the south. And across the south there was often white reaction against blacks moving into white neighborhoods. That, combined with desegregation of schooling led to white folks migrating out of these increasingly mixed areas. Resulting in what is termed 'white flight' where southern cities became increasingly black and on average poorer as middle class whites quit town and took their tax dollars with them.

The reasons for this are not because of any unique circumstances.",t2_ogsod,i_am_harry,0,1644383590.0,0,t1_hw6rp72,hw6rp72,True,Notasdark111,t3_so105d,https://www.reddit.com/r/LakeCharles/comments/so105d/north_lake_charles/,North Lake Charles,/r/LakeCharles/comments/so105d/north_lake_charles/hw6rp72/,7,r/LakeCharles,0,7

"My parents are older, my mom still talks about going trick-or-treating in Oak Park and having butlers answer the door with candy trays. 

But to add to what others have said — another impact was Sam Houston giving out land plots to graduates of the school to incentivize them to build/stay in the Moss Bluff area. So people built North of LC (if they had land) or South of LC because it was cheaper. 

Further — around the time of the shift I-210 was being built. Other stuff started moving out that way and it became way easier for people who worked at the plants to live in South LC and take I-210 to work. 

Nowadays you add in the school mess LC has and younger families don’t want to buy in North LC if they can’t afford private school or get their children in somewhere else. So younger families with children buy in South LC where they have access to the “better” schools and more amenities.

Google ""White Flight"". Basically the more black people that move into a neighborhood, the more likely a white person moves out into the suburbs (moss bluff) or country (south lake Charles).

It's the whole reason that inflation and employment numbers tend to work like a seesaw. Inflation is absolutely what the poor should be clamoring for if we had any goddamn sense.

"Rikenjack's wouldn't be the worst place to try recruiting. 

You ever play with a band creator loop pedal? Got one by Digitech called a Trio that lets me play whatever rhythm stuff I want, then the pedal will add drums and bass in tempo with what's playing automatically in a whole ton of different styles that you can dial through. Then you're free to play your own lead on top of yourself.

"No idea if that’s what the issue is today, but this recent investigation and report shows how bad it really is: 

>ProPublica undertook an analysis that has never been done before. Using advanced data processing software and a modeling tool developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, we mapped the spread of cancer-causing chemicals from thousands of sources of hazardous air pollution across the country between 2014 and 2018:

https://www.propublica.org/article/toxmap-poison-in-the-air

Excerpt:

>For residents of Mossville, Louisiana, it is already too late.

>	Among the most polluted pockets of the country, the community in southwest Louisiana has all but disappeared amid the steady encroachment of the South African chemical giant Sasol. The company’s most recent construction led to a buyout of more than half of the area's remaining residents. In the late 1990s, more than 500 people lived in Mossville. Residents say only 50 or so remain.

>	While it can be difficult to link specific cases of disease to pollution exposure, the evidence in Mossville has accumulated: In a 1998 health survey conducted by the University of Texas, 84% of Mossville residents reported having headaches, dizziness, tremors and seizures. An EPA study from the same year found that the average level of dioxins in the blood of Mossville residents was dangerously high — triple that of the general U.S. population.

""The most likely culprit is sulfur dioxide, which is not a safety risk and which is associated with a rotten egg smell."" - Straight from KPLC.

"All of Louisiana is in a flood zone. America's lands are set up with 100 year flood plains. All areas of land have the risk of flooding.  The key is the find a home in a flood zone x. Zone x is the lowest risk for flooding. And yes buy the flood insurance anyway. It covers more than flood waters from storms. It is free for your insurance agent to see which zone. It takes about 5 minutes max to see what zone. If it's an x zone, a yearly premium will be given at the end of the quote. (There is a standard 30 day wait before coverage starts unless it's bought when purchasing a home).. If it's any other higher risk zone, a zone will be given. After that, a elevation certificate will be needed to finish the quote.

If a seller is in a hurry or has become frustrated by botched deals or is in the midst of a sellers’ market or has a hot property or is cautious or anxious or a hundred other reasons, the down payment can absolutely be a factor. Regardless of whether it’s just an unfair perception or not, sellers may see a solid downpayment as assurance that the deal will close and will do so in the typical timeframe. In particular, if they are in a financial bind (e.g. they already purchased a new home), they may prefer what seems to be a more sure thing.

"I posted here a few months ago looking for interviewees and some feedback from locals about what to focus on in the documentary. Y'all were really helpful, and I was able to speak with a few folks over PM, phone calls etc. that guided the project. I really appreciate it. 

I've never made a film before and probably won't ever make another one. I just had it on my heart that this story needed to get told and tried my best. I lived and worked in Jeff Davis Parish for almost a year starting right after Laura. I'm still disgusted with how contractors, insurance, the government and the media have failed to aid SWLA after the disasters. One thing I learned is that SWLA folks are badass and get each others' backs. I don't have much money and funded the entire project off one night of blackjack at L'Auberge. I wish I could have shown more and rendered a more complete picture of the story, but this was all I could afford between working other jobs and learning how to make a film in my personal time. Any feedback/questions are welcome. I just hope this feels like it's coming from a place of respect, having gotten my hands dirty working hurricane recovery in the field, but ultimately recognizing that this is a story about someone else's community.",t2_eec5r736,ciggygnardust,0,1639072593.0,0,t1_hnvn6me,hnvn6me,True,ciggygnardust,t3_rcmva6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LakeCharles/comments/rcmva6/short_documentary_about_swla_one_year_after_laura/,short documentary about SWLA one year after Laura,/r/LakeCharles/comments/rcmva6/short_documentary_about_swla_one_year_after_laura/hnvn6me/,12,r/LakeCharles,0,12

"[Sam Houston Jones state park ](https://www.lastateparks.com/parks-preserves/sam-houston-jones-state-park) is still listed as temporarily closed. I'm unsure if that means only the camp grounds are closed and trails are open but I doubt it. I hope someone here can verify this.

[This might be a place to start](https://www.visitlakecharles.org/creole-nature-trail/) and Google lists the welcome center on the I-10 beach as open during business hours.

But if you're down for a two hour drive, [Kisatchie National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/kisatchie/) is a nice little gem, IMO.

Google maps link to [Backbone Trail](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MtJxThUVST8XxuZy5) which is my most hiked and camped trail but I've only been in that quadrant. I think there's 5 others total. Great place for hiking and camping for sure.

And if you're down for an even longer drive, [Poverty Point](https://www.povertypoint.us/) is a World Heritage Site. I found it interesting. It's somewhere over 3000 years old.

And there's some good kayaking spots off hwy 27 south of Sulphur if that's an option. And I just found this hiking trail south of Hackberry on that same route called [Blue Goose Trail](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gMovnZ7XAaFx8y3P6).

You can also self publish, there are a few companies that will print your book for you. you'll need to pay for the printing. Then you'll have to convince some local shops to sell your book.  


You might get some to sell on consignment, meaning they'll put it on display and take some of the profit if it sells instead of buying it directly from you to then resell.

"you can easily go down Hwy 27 from Sulphur to Cameron Parish to the Creole nature trail and to the beach at Johnson Bayou. Start by stopping at the Creole Nature Trail Adventure Point.

In Carlyss for the adults and the ride down you can stop at the daiquiri to go shop and get a daiquiris.   My out of state friends love to get them when they come in.

"I mean, yeah, I expect no less from *any* petrochem company. Profit-driven unethical behavior and environmental destruction is what the industry is *known for.* I've yet to hear of any socially, communally, or environmentally responsible company in the industry (beyond the products of their own PR departments.) The only constraint I've ever known of them to show is that enforced by legislation, regulatory bodies and labor organizations and only when the repercussions of their actions (or inactions) would cost them more than the profit they might bring in. I'm just curious what, in your opinion, makes sasol and worse than any of the other competitors in the area? The only really difference I can see is length of tenure in the area and most of the other refineries having the benefit of establishing themselves prior to the current information era, where their PR teams had more control of the narratives surrounding them; and which flag flies over their HQ.

"I worked at the Sasol project this study is referring to during the peak construction times, all the way until a few months ago.

They absolutely are disgusting to work for, the South African leadership is domineering through the PR stunt that is ‘Sasol North America’.

I personally had to assist them determine how to maintain this vast amount of property that they purchased in order to ‘keep residents quiet’.

Budget driven, the North American representatives chose the only maintenance program they could afford with the approved budget, but that was minimal effort and too little too late for the community.

Make no mistake, Sasol is very much driven by the same conquering and spirit-breaking overlord mentality that crushes their own country in cultural turmoil and oppression. They think that they can come here and spread their cancer, and Lake Charles had one of the cheapest price tags - our beloved representatives welcomed it with open arms - don’t even worry about millions of dollars of tax revenue, just come and ruin our community and our land.

"Scion Esports was born on November 23rd, 2011 when Lake Charles Scion put on the Lake Area StarLeague StarCraft II Thanksgiving Invitational… but it really came to life with the Lake Charles Scion Thanksgiving Open 2012, which featured Halo 4 less than a week after the game launched. The event was over 10 hours of couch-co-op style Halo on eight big screen TVs in the showroom of Lake Charles Toyota… mostly during business hours.

We’ve come a long way in the 10 years since, but looking back, we felt like there was no better way to celebrate 10 years than to go back to our roots… Halo.

So on January 29th and 30th 2022, we’ll be setting up the biggest Halo tournament Louisiana has ever seen, and the biggest Scion Esports first party event in our history.

"I'm not sure if the best of it's new or not, I'm not explicitly calling out the American press on this one, it's other news papers too and not exactly new. What I am explicitly calling them out by name for is more paid native advertising where it looks as if they are writing a piece on a business because the paper is interested and has things to say  where reality it's advertising. They often include at the end of said ""article"" that is an advertisement, but it's in smaller print and you actually have to make it to the end of the piece and pay attention to notice. This is a newer phenomenon in the media and it's not just them either but this feels deceptively slimy.

So maybe next year will have more competition. At the end of the day, there's money involved -- I assume they want enough competition on this thing that there's some incentive to buy ads to help promote your business. Worse things have happened. They've got bills to pay.

I'm assuming the ""best of"" voting isn't held to the same standards as, say, a presidential election.  Now that it's kicked off, maybe more people will be nominated next year, etc.
