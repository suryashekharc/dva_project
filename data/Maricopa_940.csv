"Good question.

Have lived in AZ for more than two decades.  In 2008 we were ready for our first house.  Rented a home North of 101 off Tatum at the time.  Looked a prices in the area and thought ""well, buying here is not an option"".  Even with the crash, homes were still too expensive for us.  Had some family living here at the time, so was a bit familiar with the area.  

Decided Maricopa would be a good spot to shop for homes.  

Bought in '08, and have been here since.  I've enjoyed living here.  

I like being away from the city, it's generally quite at night (after the 4th straight hour of barking, could you please bring your goddamn dog in?), and cow manure aside it generally smells like nature here.

Things are of course changing.  The 347 now draws my ire as the solitary problem that makes me fume about living here.  Spending 60 minutes in my car for what should be a 30 minute drive is exhausting.  It crushing to open Google Maps around quitting time to see a 8 mile long dark red line depicting the traffic.

"Yes! America just isn't the same without the front porch üôÅ In fact my chosen wedding song was all about front porches and swings https://youtu.be/BblV6AQsd2s   2:47 is my favorite 

Interestingly enough I just read a couple articles about the importance of the front porch
https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2009/12/its-a-wonderful-subdivision/
This and the links included in it were spot-on. One of the exerpts:

When a family member was on the porch it was possible to invite the passerby to stop and come onto the porch for extended conversation. The person on the porch was very much in control of this interaction, as the porch was seen as an extension of the living quarters of the family. Often, a hedge or fence separated the porch from the street or board sidewalk, providing a physical barrier for privacy, yet low enough to permit conversation. The porch served many important social functions in addition to advertising the availability of its inhabitants. A well-shaded porch provided a cool place in the heat of the day for the women to enjoy a rest from household chores. They could exchange gossip or share problems without having to arrange a ‚Äúneighborhood coffee‚Äù or a ‚Äúbridge party.‚Äù The porch also provided a courting space within earshot of protective parents [for more on this important aspect, see Beth Bailey‚Äôs From Front Porch to Back Seat: Courtship in Twentieth Century America]. A boy and a girl could be close on a porch swing, yet still observed, and many a proposal of marriage was made on a porch swing. Older persons derived great pleasure from sitting on the porch, watching the world go by, or seeing the neighborhood children at play.",t2_3l09lay3,NightSisterSally,0,1638470736.0,0,t1_hmyqbkc,hmyqbkc,False,AmateurEarthling,t3_pxzlf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maricopa/comments/pxzlf5/relationship_with_neighbors/,Relationship with Neighbors?,/r/Maricopa/comments/pxzlf5/relationship_with_neighbors/hmyqbkc/,1,r/Maricopa,0,1
It is part of the momentum of home design/living over the past 20-30 years of moving outdoor activities to the backyard. Housing developments have a back patio not only a landing at the front door so from the street all you have is front door and garage door and they're usually closed. Some older neighborhoods in up and coming urban areas are getting some porches and living space up front outside giving neighbors more opportunity to interact in person rather than just in passing.,t2_ihjd1,singlejeff,0,1638464506.0,0,t1_hmya2cg,hmya2cg,False,AmateurEarthling,t3_pxzlf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maricopa/comments/pxzlf5/relationship_with_neighbors/,Relationship with Neighbors?,/r/Maricopa/comments/pxzlf5/relationship_with_neighbors/hmya2cg/,1,r/Maricopa,0,1

"I have seen the exact tame thing happen in my neighborhood. But I find myself doing the same thing. I haven‚Äôt been trying to make connections with my neighbors since the pandemic started. 

I moved into a neighborhood as one of the first houses built in a new development. Before the pandemic we had monthly barbecues in the park. The pandemic ruined that and we barely got to know anyone who moved in after we stopped having those. I find that reaching out still works, though. If we want more connection, we need to connect more. Other people are going to be less likely to reach out. The habit has been broken.

"Hi!

Nice post.  Don't see many topics like this come up.

In my immediate area, I have a couple neighbors that I know and interact with occasionally.  One neighbor is a snow bird and is not usually around.  We've been here for a long time and have witness many, many people come and go over the years.

We used to hang out and party a bit with a few neighbors, but those folks moved too.    

Everyone will have a different view on this next item, but the pandemic has made frequent casual interactions with neighbors much less common.  It seems reasonable given the circumstances.  I'd like the new normal to arrive so I can realign my expectations of what being a neighbor is nowadays.",t2_4sag7,limbermind,0,1632936319.0,0,t1_heqvnh4,heqvnh4,True,AmateurEarthling,t3_pxzlf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maricopa/comments/pxzlf5/relationship_with_neighbors/,Relationship with Neighbors?,/r/Maricopa/comments/pxzlf5/relationship_with_neighbors/heqvnh4/,4,r/Maricopa,0,4

"Hello.

I've lived here for some time and am not immediately familiar with the laundromat situation.  Seems like something I should know.

Anyway, I'm not a ton of help here, but I could suggest you contact a dry cleaner and see if they offer a laundry service?

The one we've used has washed our large bed comforters on a few occasions (they're too big for our machine). 

Best of luck

Aaaaand it looks like the one we've used in the past has closed.  Weird.  Maps search reveals a single result.  Building seems odd for a dry cleaner, but maybe they can help.  I have never done business with this place.

"I feel that way about all faiths, period. Religion has brought more harm into this world than just about anything. 

Most discrimination in this world (racism, homophobia, to some extent even socio-economic) is related to religion. The Southern Baptist Convention was created solely on the basis of owning slaves. Take a look at the Troubles in Northern Ireland; besides the obvious rebellion against British rule, it was also a religious war between Protestants and Catholics. The hatred toward the LGBT community is completely religion based. The Crusades, the Taliban, ISIS, religious wars and terrorism. The violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims in the Mid-East, the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the fucking Holocaust - all predicated on religion. Not to mention the issues with the Catholic church shielding pedophiles and rapists for *decades*, look at the current scandal regarding the Canadian residential schools ran by the Catholic church.

The link is an anti-snake rattle you can put in the ground to help keep them away, also, the morning and evening hours are the most busy time.  Luckily rattle snakes don't stay in one place long, they are always on the move, so they won't take up residence around your house.

"There was a time where I'd swap between Orbitel and CenturyLink every 12-24 months. Orbitel wasn't reliable and would drop my connection to work for a few seconds a dozen times a day and their troubleshooting never found anything wrong. Century Link at that point was painfully slow in my area where my remote work really needed a decent upload speed and CentruryLink just couldn't provide that. About 3 years ago, frustrated with CenturyLink's speed, I begrudgingly gave Orbitel another chance and so far it's been mostly okay.

We use Centurylink at our house.  Had Orbitel for many years, but was never really happy with the service.  It may be great today, but years ago it left us wanting more.

We currently enjoy rock solid 140 down and 20 UP via their super-duper DSL service.  Works really well for us.

"I've been here in copa about as long, and there was a time where I'd swap between Orbitel and CenturyLink.  Orbitel wasn't reliable and would drop my connection to work for a few seconds a dozen times a day and their troubleshooting never found anything wrong.  Century Link at that point was painfully slow in my area where my remote work really needed a decent upload speed and CentruryLink just couldn't provide that.  About 3 years ago I begrudgingly gave Orbitel another chance and so far it's been mostly okay.  In the summer months during the hottest days there are still a few micro outages.  But it is down to one or two a day.

TL:DR, if it's been more than 3 years or so since your last attempt at trying Orbitel, it might be worth the hassle of switching.

"Hi, u/Rickysteelo 

My wife and I game regularly, and we are using Century Link.  I see your current experience with them is described as ""horrible"", so my anecdote probably won't get too much traction with you.

We're on the ~140mb down/20mb up plan.  It works really well for us and we've rarely been kicked from a session on any of the games we play.  We can both stream 2 HD streams while gaming and it still holds tuff.  Our gaming servers report pings below 30mS (Servers in Los Angeles) 

What Century Link plan are you on right now?  Is it the fastest you can get from them?

"Hi!  Welcome.

Copa's not so bad. If you're focusing on your studies, the stuff in the periphery won't matter much anyway.  Good place to be to hunker down and get your degree.

We moved here in 08', and internet service here was meh back then.  I was happy to get 30mb/s down and 2-5mb/s up.  Nowadays things are much improved.  We had Orbitel for years and ditched them eventually when CenturyLink began offering high-end DSL in our neighborhood.  Orbitel was sketch back in the day (daily dropouts, chunks of the day were inexplicable slow, etc.).  They may be great now.  Dunno.

I'm sure all providers offer packages of similar speed vs. cost in Copa.  We've been with CenturyLink now for 2 years I think.  I consistently get 130mb/s down and 20mb/s up.  It works well for all our needs.

I work from home 1-3 days a week and am in meetings for 2+ hours a day.  Said meetings are usually in HD with high quality audio (MS Teams & Discord).  Works great 90% of the time.  Wife and I are also PC gamers.  Most the games we play don't require tons of data (up or down), but it's critical that it does not go down. SOLID all the time.  

Watching 3 HD movies while streaming games on Discord in HD would be totally possible.

You'll be fine!

They do (or at least did in the past) contract with Cox for on-site techs.  As the guy who first hooked up my internet said that Orbitel sent all their techs to Cox for training.  So there is some kind of collaboration there.

"I work at a school in Chandler (I'm not a teacher) and I personally do not think School should be in session on campus at all. Administration seems to be planning for several different scenarios and have not given us a concrete answer yet. 

Some ideas my school might go with:  


\- Everyone stays in their home rooms and that teacher facilitates all the students classes with the main course still being created and graded by the subject teacher. Those with medical conditions would stay home and continue on line teaching. Might as well just stay home. 

\- Half classes with the teachers streaming lectures to the other half at home. The folks staying home would be those with medical conditions and volunteers. Again, everyone might as well stay home. 

\- And of course all online and all on campus with masks etc are also being planned for.

"The secondary route has been in the works for quite some time. But I wouldn't count on it anytime soon. As an example, the town has a railroad running through it. Mostly union Pacific freight, but Maricopa does have an Amtrak station. The station is just off the 347 main road in town, dividing the southern part of town from the rest. When the train was stopped at the station, it would block the 347, causing a huge delay for cars. There is one other road around, but it was prone to closure from flash floods any time we got a good rain.  Which I'll grant you is not often, but that is no solace when you can't go home for an hour because of it.

It took a decade to get plans approved, funding secured, and construction done to put in an overpass.  This was without the need of negotiation to use tribal land, which complicates things considerably.  Maybe there's been some movement on that front recently that I've not heard about, but it took over a year for construction on the overpass, so even if plans and funding was sorted, construction still puts that a ways away to not count on it yet.

"There are a few obvious things in town, but there is a little more to do if you actively search it out, but it can be hard to find.

UltraStar -It's a 'multi-tainment' center next to the casino.  It's got a movie theater, bowling alley, arcade, laser tag, restaurant, and bar all in the same facility.  

Copper Sky recreational center - Swimming, sports fields, gym, etc.  They are many programs / activities on offer and they're always trying new things. 

True Grit - half bar, half restaurant. 

Mr. E's comic's -  If Magic the Gathering and D&D is your thing.

Library - Not just books and internet access.  They're active with the community and offer many programs and activities. 

Facebook groups - Have interests? Most of us do too.  Board game nights, D&D, sports, parent/kid activities, drone flying, Minecraft etc.

The town also puts on a Salsa Festival every year, and with the Casino and UltraStar, there's usually a carnival in the winter, and the occasional outdoor concert / event.

But for the most part it is currently a mostly happy bedroom community with aspirations of more.  The town is growing for sure, the relatively inexpensive home prices are attractive (it's what brought me out here over a decade ago), and for the most part it's got that small and closer community feel.  Now, to the things that you should probably know, it sounds worse then it is laying it all out there, but the things to consider that you can't know being out of state.


The 347 - THE single main road between here and the highway is factor. Make sure your auto insurance covers glass replacement!  I often get chips & cracks.  We've got a noticeable influx of 'snow birds' in the winter, Canadians and other colder climate dwellers with winter homes that cause additional traffic, who are often rolling roadblocks not in a hurry to get anywhere and don't consider the left lane to be a passing lane.  We've got aggressive drivers who can get a little road-ragey.  And when the inevitable accident occurs, if it's bad enough to shut down a section of the main road in, depending on what section of the road, you may just be in for a good long wait or have to 'go around' which can add an hour.  This isn't likely to improve any time soon as that main road for improvements, and all other potential points to build a new road are through tribal land. Maricopa is sandwiched between Gila River and Ak-Chin reservation land which makes that any discussion on road improvements complicated.

Utilities - Over simplified, the costs are higher because power / water has to come from further away.  Winter times, you need little to no electricity for heating, but summer will gobble your money with the AC bill.  When looking at homes seriously look at the AC units.  Does it seem well maintained / new?  I once had a shot motor on an exchanger and since I didn't notice it right away my bill (dual AC unit home) went from 500 bucks to 850.  Keep it well serviced, AC is life.  

Also like most of the country there is little competition for internet.  You can choose between DSL which is slower, with slightly less hiccups.  Or the local cable company which is faster with more outages (But getting better from my experience).  But remember that they're both routed through the same backbone line out of town, and sometimes when it starts getting really hot, the connections on both get spotty; literally their network equipment overheats. 

Education - As has been stated, the local schools are.... not great.  As a result many charter schools have swooped in.  I don't know much about them, but from what I understand the state overall doesn't really look out for teachers, so high turnover, which leads to inconsistency and instability. 

Health care - We've got plenty of dentists! There's primary care and urgent care available as well as some of the common specialty docs (eyes, gyno, etc).  But if you're needing an ER, you're driving to Chandler Regional, a 20-30 minute drive away.  Low risk for most, but if you're got a known condition where time may be a factor.... well there ya go.

Weather - Winters are great, summers are brutal. not uncommon to be in the low/mid 110¬∫s with spikes to 118¬∫.  Yeah, it's dry heat which helps, but things can get serious quick.  Always have water, crack the windows of your car.  Don't brand yourself with the seat belt buckle. AC is life.

Again, to me it's a great little town on the (slow) rise, especially if you can tele-commute.  Commuting to chandler or surrounding area isn't the worst, but not great.  Commuting further is of course possible, and people do it, I'd not recommend it if possible.

Sorry for the book! Hope it's helpful!

Edit: Demographics - Varies, but a lot of new couples / starting families in your age range buying first time homes.

The biggest problems I would say are the smell from agriculture and the commute into the Valley. But it's not so bad - you get used to the smell. And there's more and more jobs in Copa so you might not even have to commute.

Water here is also about double what I paid in town. Global water chargers upfront so minium payment is like $90 a month for water and sewer but the water is cheap so I water the lawn all summer for like maybe $20-30 a month more.

"Chimmimg in late here :)

Lived in the Copa for 10+ years now and it's definitely got its pros and cons.

I don't know of anyone with power bills anywhere close to $1,000.  We're in a 2,600 sq ft home with a pool.  Highest summer bills run $300 - $350, depending on weather conditions, visitors, traveling, mood, etc.  ED-3 is our only electric option which does make one scratch their head.  The water utility is the same, only one option, and it's approximately $100-$120 per month, every month, regardless of time of year (the majority is for their 'services' and the least for actual usage).  We used Oribtel 40M services for the majority of our tenure here and it worked well, no major complaints.  CenturyLink installed fiber in many developments a few years ago when they rolled out Prism TV.  We just recently switched to CenturyLink 140M DSL service and it's been pretty fantastic, so far.

The commute does suck but, rush hours sucks all over the Valley too.  My spouse works in Tempe and loathes the daily commute, especially during snow bird season.  On rare occasion, a fatal accident can shut down a section of the 347 highway and cause quite a disruption.  In the years we've lived here, it's happened about 1/2 dozen times where it affected our commute.  I mostly work in the field (traveling all over the Valley and State) and I actually chose Maricopa (over the other sprawl cities at the time like Laveen and Queek Creek) because it is kind of central to Valley and closer to Tucson.  Lastly, Maricopa is still used as a by-pass/shortcut for folks traveling from I-10E to I-8W which can make for strangely thick traffic in town at times.

The night's sky out here can be beautiful, especially looking South.  We have a North-facing balcony so we get to see all of the fireworks in Chandler and other towns too.  Being 'remote', we do see some wicked sand storms out here.  Something to consider if you have breathing issues (which applies to most of AZ but, a little worse sitting in the middle of the desert).  It's also ever so slightly cooler out here than in the Valley with less urban heat island effect.  It is still a relatively small town, still growing with new and exciting things from time to time.",t2_5hmiu,msearthmuffin,0,1579145173.0,0,t1_feir7qn,feir7qn,True,HeyFuckFace4,t3_eoww6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maricopa/comments/eoww6y/debating_on_moving_to_maricopa/,Debating on moving to Maricopa,/r/Maricopa/comments/eoww6y/debating_on_moving_to_maricopa/feir7qn/,2,r/Maricopa,0,2
"I lived in 'Copa for five year ending last 4th of July, now back in the valley. I had an 1850 sqft 2 story, no pool, no solar. I kept the AC at 82 during the day in the summer, 76 at night. My electric bills were never over $300 in the summer, and as low as $90 during the winter.

I now live in Phoenix Metro on APS, 1600 sqft one story with pool, no solar, brand new AC, same temps as before. My highest summer bill was $330, and my lowest winter bill so far is $165, I think due to the pool more than anything.

I did enjoy Maricopa in general and have no regrets about living there, where the low cost of home ownership helped during difficult times.

"Not a dumb question, but I'm not sure precisely what you mean.

Permission from UltraStar?  I've been working with them to plan and host this event for several years now.  Permission from Geek & Sundry?  They do not 'own' the event, though they have coordinated a livestream and helped promote events at local game stores in the past.  This year, they didn't announce their involvement with TableTop Day until much later than usual compared to years past.  When they did finally announce that they'd be participating this year,  they also announced that they'd  be having their event later in the year.  Their announcement came after UltraStar and I had already gone ahead and planned for the last Saturday in April as has been done in years past.  

UltraStar has advertised on Facebook and other social media, but they do not have much of a Reddit presence so I posted myself here.  There is also a post on the website and throughout the building there are ads.  But please spread the word to anyone you think would be interested!

"Hey dizzlemcshizzle,   (cool handle)

&#x200B;

thanks for your insightful comments.      I agree, definitely, some do not want to stay in town.    I know some do want to find a girlfriend in town.   Me for one.   I may be in the minority. 

Also, as you point out, I think everyone goes to different dating sites and they are all spread out.    Maybe, if they knew about a local dating site, they may leave the expensive sites and go for a free site.   (Free chatting, emailing, IM, winks, who's interested, etc.)

"A dating SITE? Would be interesting, but might be a bit much. IMHO (M, 43) I've done match and OKC and the Maricopa pickings are pretty slim (raw numbers, not character judgments)... Seems like a lot of starter families and snowbirds, very few singles, or at least few that are seeking relationships online on those sites.

I just now did a search on OKC in 85139, 18-60 y/o women (seeking men), no other search criteria, returned 28 results. Surely match has more, but there will also be crossover, etc.

FWIW: I also wonder how many singles in Maricopa are actually looking to stay in Maricopa, and whether that might influence their decisions about how/where to date online.

Surprise Police Department - Sergeant Tim Klarkowski:

Aggravated Assault Suspect Arrested

On 2/12/19 around 7:30pm the Surprise Police Department received a call from a resident who indicated he had been shot at. The victim said he was in the drive-through of the Bubba‚Äôs Market (15445 N. Greasewood Street) when he was confronted by two males. One of the men immediately started cursing at the victim and yelling at him to leave ‚Äútown.‚Äù

The victim put his car in reverse and backed out of the drive-through. As he was backing up the same male suspect continued to yell at him as he pulled out a handgun. The suspect then fired three shots, striking the victim‚Äôs vehicle multiple times. The victim was able to escape unharmed. The confrontation was captured on video by a camera mounted to the victim‚Äôs dashboard.

Since the initial report, our investigators have been able to positively identify the shooter as Baltazar Aguirre, a 27 year old resident of Surprise. Working collaboratively with the Arizona Department of Public Safety, our criminal investigations team has taken Baltazar Aguirre into custody. 

Aguirre is being booked into the Maricopa County Fourth Avenue Jail for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon as well as numerous probation violations.",t2_1ijftdhz,notmspandasden,0,1550636475.0,0,t1_eguuajh,eguuajh,True,notmspandasden,t3_asju7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maricopa/comments/asju7l/baltazar_aguirre/,Baltazar Aguirre,/r/Maricopa/comments/asju7l/baltazar_aguirre/eguuajh/,1,r/Maricopa,0,1

"It's a bedroom community, kind of boring but it's not a bad place. Probably the biggest draws are the casino and movie theater. 347 sucks ass but supposedly they're expanding it to 3 lanes. 

Really it's incredible what this city has become. I came out in 2003 and let me tell you, there was nothing out here. We had 3 gas stations, a little grocery store, a restaurant, a night club, the jail, and the fire department. 

And now we've got tons of gas stations including a QT, we've got Bashas', Fry's, and Walmart. We've got 3 McDonald's, a Burger King, Taco Bell, Karl's Jr., Sonic, Arby's, KFC, Long John Silver's, and Panda Express. We've got a little Mexican place called Alaberto's and another one called Tacos N More. A sit-down Chinese place, Cilantros, Chipotle, a little family run donut store, a Dunkin Donuts, Barro's Pizza, Little Caesar's, Pizza Hut, Dominoes, and Papa John's. There are three Starbucks as well as Crate Coffee and Honeycutt coffee.

There's a Goodwill, Planet Fitness, a physical therapy place, 24-Hour Fitness, some crossfit place, a dry cleaners, a therapy/counseling place, a suicide prevention place, and doctors offices like Banner, Sunlife, and some independent clinics.

There's a new carwash so that makes two including the one at Circle K. Supposedly we're getting a Dutch Bros. Coffee.

Lots of schools, some private and a lot that are public. Lots of churches. A Central Arizona College campus.

"Maricopa is the type of community where if you engage, make friends, and participate, you'll love it. Its small enough that you'll get to see friends at the grocery store, hardware store, or movies. 

If you tend to stay home, don't make friends, you'll likely find the commute to be too much trouble. 

I know lots of people who have moved to Maricopa, were homebodies, and the 347 commute wasn't worth and moved back to the East Valley (Tempe, Chandler, Gilbert). I know other groups of people who, even with great circles of friends, their commutes to Scottsdale or Downtown Phoenix were too painful, so they punched out.

On the cheap you can hike a trail in one of the area parks or take a nice drive and catch the sun set at the [Windy Point Vista](https://goo.gl/maps/HGkhM4HgjRw).

**East**: Drive out past Tortilla Flats on Apache Trail, [here's](https://goo.gl/maps/kJxC7rnvvgE2) a good spot to turn around if you don't want to go all the way to the dam, lovely mountains.

**North**: Sedona, if you've got an extra hour and SUV with decent clearance that can take a hard-ish road, drive up i17, past the normal exit for Sedona then take the [Schnebly Hill Road exit](https://goo.gl/maps/gtmkQZJ1fDm) and come in down the mountain ridge that all the 'pink jeep tours' charge the tourists for.  Even if you don't go that way, the views are spectacular. If you wish to hike around a bit, There's a nice place to park and take the Marg's Draw trail, [here](https://goo.gl/maps/73XBMTYEpSF2).  On the way there, you could also check out the cliff dwellings at [Montezuma Castle National Park](https://www.nps.gov/moca/index.htm).

**Phoenix**: There's a ton of stuff, from the Science Museum, to the Zoo, and concerts/shows depending on your tastes... but you probably know about that stuff already.  I listed things a little further out, but still doable as a day trip, as I've done most of these myself.

"Hi, u/dlmaricopa and welcome to the sub!

Ahh 347.  It's always been an instant conversation starter for so many.  I could talk about it for hours, but I'll answer your direct question.

I personally don't feel that 347 is an unsafe road.  There is nothing that I can point to and say ""that is unsafe"".  This is only my opinion.

I've been driving the 347 twice per day (on weekdays) for nearly 9 years.  I've seen some amazing acts of total disregard for safety, none of which have ever been caused by anything inherently wrong with the road, again, in my opinion.

As I see it the issue is with users not hardware.  

Following too close for 70+mph.  Forgetting their manners.  Thinking that moving one car ahead by endangering 3-4 others can actually get you somewhere.  LEFT LANE CAMPING.  Speeding (those folks going ~90mph).  I can drive good, but you suck at it mentality.  Snowbirds.  Holding/using their phone in any capacity while driving.  Shaving, makeup, bowl of cereal while driving.  Assuming their 5,500 lb SUV can handle anything like the sporty little Honda that just passed them.

Drivers from Maricopa seem to have no chill or respect.  It's odd. 

All that being said...I drive in a unique manner.  I would consider my style aggressive, but with a sharp adherence to basic driving safety.  Blinkers, always, and not just 60 micro seconds before I dive into your lane.  I make attempts to always give the person in my arrival lane plenty of warning and leave them a gap.

If I'm in a line of slow cars and a small gap exists in the left lane for a passing maneuver, I'll let it go.  Not worth it.  I can wait 15 seconds more for a larger, safer gap to come up.

I detest being tailgated, and rarely engage in it myself.  I'm always trying to police myself to leave a healthy gap commensurate for the speed I'm travelling.  Given this, you'll never find me in the left lane when the right is open and flowing.  Even when I'm the only car for 500 yds.

I speed.  I almost always travel with cruise locked at 72-73 mph.  I generally dip down to 60 mph for the slower spots near controlled intersections (cement plant, riggs, etc.).  To expand on this: If anyone out there has the means to own a vehicle that has distance-maintaining cruise control, do so.  5 years ago this was quite a luxury item, now it is available on many vehicles, albeit in different incarnations.  They work really well.  It takes my judgment of what a safe following distance is and hands it over to a computer that checks it 100 times per second and makes corrections via throttle reduction, braking, or throttle increase.  Highly recommended.  I think it's helped keep me safe for years now.

Change to 347 that would reduce backup, congestion, and improve flow:  Third lane would be pretty sweet.  The light at Riggs seems wonky: stop 300 cars to let 20 through-What?  This is dreamy, but overpasses/underpasses at all the lights.  Alternative high speed routes to get to I-10.  Make the ""slower traffic keep right"" signs read ""left lane campers will be drawn and quartered"".

Wow, this turned into a wall of text.  My bad.

Maricopa Road was a 2-lane, and Old Maricopa Road went across the freeway, turning into 56th street. The pavement on Warren Road ended just south of Teel, and to get to SR84 you followed the power lines south of Robin.

Everyone drove really shitty, really big cars from the '60s and '70s. Al from the feed store had a mid '70s Granada, my dad drove a Fairlane or a Coronet, the folks at the machine shop in Hidden Valley had Dodge pickups, exclusively. The dirt roads played a huge part in the shittiness.

Mayfair Market was shit. Seriously, one of the first memories I have from that place was finding chicken bones in the barrel of pinto beans. I can only remember going in there like 2 or 3 times.

The post office was **exactly** the same. Well, maybe not exactly, the office had a lot less shit in it. But what you see now is basically what's been there since the '90s.

Hope fly with mail in ballots becoming more popular  that will change though. ,t2_4c3v2,Lleu,0,1472426101.0,0,t1_d70iw9o,d70iw9o,False,DemocraticEgg,t3_4zvqfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maricopa/comments/4zvqfg/how_to_vote_in_arizona_video_by_john_greenwere_a/,How to vote in Arizona video by John Green(we're a swing state!

"How exactly are we a swing state? AZ has voted Republican in every Presidential election since 1952, with the exception of 1996. Both our Senators are Republican, 5 of 9 Congressmen are Republican, and 19 of 30 state senators are Republican.

DSL is dependant on your distance from the DSLAM so if you are too far you won't qualify for the same speed.  Also they don't advertise anything here over 40 so I'm not sure where you are seeing 60.  CL generally does 12/20/40/75/100 but nothing I've seen shows 75/100 being available here.  I'm also across the street from the DSLAM so I'd definitely qualify for 100 if it were available.,t2_58266,derpderpin,0,1470193120.0,0,t1_d61zljk,d61zljk,True,mydogisbuddy,t3_4q06yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maricopa/comments/4q06yw/frustrated_with_centurylink/,Frustrated With Centurylink,/r/Maricopa/comments/4q06yw/frustrated_with_centurylink/d61zljk/,1,r/Maricopa,0,1
