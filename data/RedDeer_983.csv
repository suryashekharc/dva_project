"The commute to downtown or south side Red Deer is faster than driving from the north end (usually). I’ve always heard people say they don’t want that commute, but it’s seriously only like 10 or 15 minutes

"I've lived in Penhold since 2011 and we like it well enough. We considered innisfail but both work in red deer so we decided we didn't want that long of a drive every day. We started in the trailer park and when we upgraded to buying a larger home we didn't even consider red deer, mostly because it's quieter here. 


Pros: had a nice grocery store (IGA), dentist, clinic, pharmacy, vet, banks, all the usual amenities. There has been so much growth even just since my oldest was born 9 years ago that I feel good about the direction this town is going. The multiplex is very nice and the library staff are amazing. There are often free baby to preschool programs at the library, for example. 


The town tries to maintain a close-knit community feel with community Christmas (typically hot chocolate, cookie sales, and crafts at the library), a fall fair (pre-covid this meant midway rides but even the last couple years they kept parts of it going, including a stellar fireworks show). 


The fire department is always visible at community events, and a few times each summer they host spray days where they just hose kids down from the fire hoses, which is loads of fun for them. 


My kids go to Jessie Duncan elementary and we have had wonderful teachers every year. 


All this is to say it's great for young families!


To me the commute is also a pro. I lived in Clearview in red deer, and worked on the south end. After I moved to Penhold my commute time stayed pretty much the same at just under 15 minutes. Plus it's all highway driving; it's easier in the car, and the highway is plowed more reliably than random streets in red deer. So I like that. 


Cons: trains. I joke about the line from Blues Brothers about how the trains come by ""so often you won't even notice them."" In reality I live spitting distance from the tracks and really barely notice. They don't blow their whistles through town anymore (or they aren't supposed to; the odd operator still does). 


There is also no nice trail system like red deer has. There is tranquility park but it isn't much. There are a few playgrounds, a baseball diamond, an outdoor rink, and an all wheel track /skatepark but not much really for outdoor activity besides that.


Property taxes are higher than red deer, but we bought our home for much cheaper so it balances out. Also, if you buy a brand new home, taxes are waived the first year. 


There is no transit to red deer. A pilot project was run but due to low ridership it was scrapped (it didn't help that COVID happened at the same time and people weren't working).

I think this is a fantastic opportunity to see a new country but keep in mind that Canada is MASSIVE. Even Alberta is big.

You will need to get comfortable with driving long distances to get to all the places you will want to visit.

Red deer is a decent midpoint. It's a relatively small city and halfway between the 2 major cities- both are a little over an hour away.

There's really good camping about an hour west of Red deer. There is a lot of public land where you can camp for free (you will need to make a friend so they will tell you where to go).  In the summer one of my favorite things is to drive the forestry trunk road and take in the amazing views and see the wildlife- get a backwoods map if that's your thing.

For winter sports - Red deer is not in the mountains- you will need to drive for good skiing.
Many public parks have outdoor rinks where you can skate whenever you want.
There are lots of paths and trails to explore withing the city- heritage ranch, MacKenzie trails, etc.

As far as volunteer opportunities- the humane society is always a good bet- may help you meet some new people.

Cons: higher taxes, commute can be painful in the winter (but I’m not sure with the new traffic circle how that’ll be), it can take longer to resell there because it’s a smaller market dwarfed by Red Deer.  It’s policed by Red Deer County so response times are really long (if you ever need it).

"It won't save energy, either  
Although not always part of their basic cleaning services, many duct-cleaning companies often also clean the heating and cooling equipment (heat exchangers, cooling coils, condensate drain pans, fan motors, fan blades and fan housings).  
  
Another sketchy claim made by most duct-cleaning operations and their trade association is that dirty ducts and equipment overburden heating and cooling equipment, which wastes energy. Again, it intuitively makes sense that a cleaner system will run smoother and last longer — after all, that’s why we and HVAC-equipment manufacturers and repair services recommend that you regularly change your filters. But the page “Benefits of HVAC Cleaning” on the National Air Duct Cleaners Association (NADCA) website stretches this benefit too far by stating: “According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 25 to 40 percent of the energy used for heating and cooling a home is wasted.”  
  
That’s misleading.  
  
Although much of the energy used to power heating and cooling equipment is indeed wasted, that waste is because of inefficient equipment, lousy insulation, leaks around doors and windows, and unsealed ductwork. While there’s some benefit to cleaning and maintaining HVAC equipment, that benefit is relatively small, and little energy waste is attributable to dirty ducts or equipment.  
  
CMHC researchers found that when duct cleaners also cleaned the blower-fan blades, there was a small reduction in airborne particles. Cleaning the blower fan might also slightly improve your system’s energy efficiency.  
  
The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home’s cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn’t build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.  
  
Also consider having your duct system inspected for leaks, because leaky ducts lower efficiency and introduce air-quality problems.  
  
But we don’t recommend hiring a duct cleaner to perform these tasks; too many don’t really know what they’re doing, according to the ratings of duct-cleaning outfits we have collected from local consumers. Consider hiring a top-notch heating and air-conditioning contractor to do this type of work, or pay them to do it during their next service visit. Readers can access Checkbook’s HVAC company ratings through Feb. 28 at Checkbook.org/washingtonpost/ducts.  
  
Issues that warrant cleaning  
In general, consider duct cleaning only in response to specific identifiable problems. For example, the EPA suggests having air ducts cleaned if there is visible evidence of:  
  
•Substantial mold growth.  
  
•Infestation of insects or rodents.  
  
•Substantial deposits of dust or debris (if registers were not sealed during a renovation project, for example).  
  
If anyone in your household has specific health concerns, such as allergies or asthma, consult your physician first. It’s important to identify the problem so your doctor can suggest alternatives to duct cleaning. Start by identifying whether your ducts are part of the problem (they probably aren’t) and whether getting them cleaned will help (it probably won’t).  
  
If you're worried about mold  
If you suspect a mold problem — either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents — cleaning ducts won’t do much good if it doesn’t eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system’s evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor — and most duct-cleaning companies — can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.  
  
If you suspect — but aren’t sure — that what you see is mold, you might be tempted to have it tested. But experts we consulted generally recommend against it, reasoning that:  
  
•Mold is present in all homes; it becomes problematic only when there is a moisture problem.  
  
•It’s generally not worth the cost to test for mold or to identify the different kinds of mold present. It’s better to track down and eliminate moisture problems — whether under a sink or part of a heating and cooling system.

"If you or someone in your family suffers from asthma or allergies, you may be considering getting your home’s heating and cooling ducts cleaned. But even if you have no special health concerns, cleaning your ducts may appeal to you at an intuitive level. After all, if your ducts are clean, all that air flowing out of your vents should come out clean, too, right?  
  
Well, actually, no.  
  
Although duct-cleaning operations may insist duct cleaning is essential for your health, the evidence does not support their claims. Companies that perform duct cleaning often advertise health benefits or suggest duct cleaning will lower your power bills by improving your system’s efficiency. Some ads even use language like, “Studies have shown . . . ” but no data back up these claims. Even if your ducts are dirty, cleaning them probably won’t provide any measurable benefits. In fact, the little independent research performed on duct cleaning indicates that the process stirs up so much dust that it creates a bigger problem than it solves.  
  
10 home design trends to watch out for in 2019  
  
Although it intuitively makes sense to clean ductwork — after all, you dust and clean the rest of your house — the fact is dust that settles in your ventilation system generally stays where it is, unlikely to become airborne unless disturbed. Under most circumstances, the dust is inert and harmless, and stirring it up with cleaning equipment actually creates bigger issues.  
  
Little research has been done on the effects of duct cleaning. Government studies from the United States and Canada and health professionals who have investigated duct cleaning stop short of recommending against it, but they also don’t endorse it as a routine measure.  
  
A study done by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency researchers measured dust levels and HVAC system efficiency in test homes during a one-week period during the cooling season and found duct cleaning did not significantly improve dust levels or system performance. Based on that report and other independent research, the EPA’s official advisory on duct cleaning concludes:  
  
“Duct cleaning has never been shown to actually prevent health problems. Neither do studies conclusively demonstrate that particle (e.g. dust) levels in homes increase because of dirty air ducts. This is because much of the dirt in air ducts adheres to duct surfaces and does not necessarily enter the living space. . . . Moreover, there is no evidence that a light amount of household dust or other particulate matter in air ducts poses any risk to your health.”  
  
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.  
  
Like the EPA, the CMHC concluded that duct cleaning is unnecessary:  
  
“Ideally, the inside surface will be shiny and bright after cleaning. Duct cleaning may be justifiable to you personally for that very reason: you may not want to have your house air circulated through a duct passage that is not as clean as the rest of the house. However, duct cleaning will not usually change the quality of the air you breathe, nor will it significantly affect airflows or heating costs.”  
  
The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methodologies. The CMHC study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they were part of a study, and the researchers did not control for time spent or methods used. The EPA study prescribed and controlled methods used on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have changed since these studies were conducted, the air ducts in homes haven’t.  
  
Regularly change your filter  
Frequently changing air filters is the best way to keep dust, allergens and other particles out of your home. With a newly installed system, or a system in a home you’ve just moved into, check your filter monthly to determine how quickly it gets dirty at different times of the year. Most should be replaced every two or three months.",t2_15juv3,Healfezza,0,1648063621.0,0,t1_i1u2sv5,i1u2sv5,False,MashMashMaro,t3_tkw5rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeer/comments/tkw5rt/recommendations_for_furnaceduct_cleaning_company/,Recommendations for furnace/duct cleaning company?,/r/RedDeer/comments/tkw5rt/recommendations_for_furnaceduct_cleaning_company/i1u2sv5/,2,r/RedDeer,0,2

Freedom: driving a car.

Responsibilities: following safety laws, having your vehicle registered and insured.

Consequences: fines or jail time for not following the laws.

Responsibilities: safety of staff and customers. Paying taxes. Following labor laws. 

Consequences: fines, closure of business.


Freedom: control over your own health.

Responsibilities: don't endanger the health of others. 

Consequences: limitations and restrictions during public health crisis.

"My take on his letters and speeches is that he takes an absolute principle of things and tries to push it onto reality. The issue with that is that reality is much more complicated. An example would be the freedom of speech. In its principles, of course everyone is entitled to freedom of speech and it should not be restricted. The reality is that it gets abused and threatens freedom of others and that’s where the reality hits and the absolute principle does not work.  
Same thing with masks and vaccine mandates. Of course nobody should be forced to inject their body with random things. The reality is that society has certain processes for the greater good like mandatory vaccinations for other things that benefit the society overall at the cost of someone’s freedom.

"Exactly, if rocks/gems are your thing, you'll probably find more that you'd ever need.

On the one hand, I do find it odd that such a place has the money to rent out the arena for the weekend. (And do it country wide) I would've never thought there was that sort of money in it.

On the other hand, I love unusual rocks. The standard rocks we have here naturally in AB are largely pretty bland. So it's a great opportunity to find some more interesting specimens. 

If you're the crafty type, they also sell jewelery style gems or many types.

"“They say” is the rcmp from their page about recruiting… under the step for interviews. Pretty valid source. 

And they have a page on the PARE, sure. But point out where in the recruiting steps they do it? There isn’t one because they don’t have a physical test.  

RCMP do not have higher standards compared to any other police. They have lower. That’s obvious by just comparing recruiting. They’re bottom of the barrel. You can’t even point out one thing that gives them higher standards. 

The only thing the rcmp have is a cult of worshippers like you who come out to over inflate and worship them.

There used to be a house on the Michener land (one of them). I saw it sat empty since I was a kid(41 now). I always wanted to see what was inside, so in my teens we climbed in through a second story window. Well it was full floor to ceiling with stuffed animals. There were narrow pathways between the mountains of stuffed animals. Years of dust covering them all, both floors and what rooms we could get to were full of the stuffed animals and some old old furniture. It was so unbelievably creepy. I’m not a believer, but it felt like every toy in there had seen horrors and death. We did not stay long. The images of the dust covered stuffed animals is burned into my memory. Why did someone hoard them all?

"Man I can't say enough good things about Red Deer. The trail system that goes thru the city and links up the river, major city parks, and the 2 best dog parks in all of Canada. All of the parks are really fantastic. 

3 community pools. The community centers are large and have tons of activities for kids (Collicutt Center and Dawe Center and one more that starts with M). Lots of sports for kids with some really amazing facilities (Bower Ponds). Canyon ski hill is also great for kids and the park with the lazy river for summer (somebody help me with the name).

They just had some major fireworks for Mardi Gras and the Canada Day festivities are fun. Westerner Days are Red Deer's version of the Calgary Stampede. 

And because of the size of RD, everything is relatively close by. Not sure about rents but I'll leave that up to you.

"Yeah exactly and the BLM organizers denounced anyone who rioted or looted. Have the truckers done that? No. Their entire protest is to cause disruption while not all of BLM was disruptive the majority was schedule protesting in close down streets.

They weren’t holding any city hostage for weeks on end. They were also fighting for actual rights and freedoms being infringed rather than protesting medical science.

The trans mountain protestors didn’t block everyday activities they blocked the construction of what they disagreed with. These truckers are punishing innocent people who had nothing to do with what they disagree with. That’s the problem.

You condemn these other protest that block things and cause issues but it’s ok for truckers now? Don’t be so hypocritical because you believe what they believe.

"Its A great city!  
**Pros:**

Great central location. Close to edmonton, calgary, Sylvan lake and not to far from the mountains.

Has good amenties. Rarely have to go else where for things other than stuff like ikea and other odd ball shopping.

Parks and Walking Trails really are fantastic. Its pretty deceiving. You dont expect Red Deer to be as  ""pretty as it is"".

Bigger city but still has a big town feel to it. Traffic is good even during rush hour. Can be from one end of the city to the other in 15 mins. Alot of great rec centers and other infrastructure.

Affordable real estate

**Cons**

Nightlife sucks  if your still into that. Was a happening town in the early 2000s. But nightlife does seem to suck everywhere now. Not sure if its the advent of tinder and all these apps lol.

Homeless situation downtown. Most of the time they are just quirky and weird and harmless, just want to be left alone. But the safe injection sites and homeless shelters are downtown so thats where they hang out. Does bring crime to the city.Although, if you want to live in any city in alberta your going to have this issue.

Hospital is busy. Wait times suck. Not the staffs fault though. Hopefully kenney wasnt bull shitting about the billion dollar expansion.

Red Deer gets hit hard  when the oil economy takes a dip. Also sees  some of the most growth though  when oil booms.

Dont know where you live but if your not from alberta, the wheather is bipolar  and winters can be long with some ugly cold snaps. But manageable.

Alot of people like to shit on Red Deer and I have no clue why. Its a great city with lots of character.",t2_d0rkopws,Dillyvanilly187,0,1646359286.0,0,t1_hz9i9tv,hz9i9tv,True,Decent_Ad_3968,t3_syc2wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeer/comments/syc2wz/what_are_cons_of_living_in_red_deer/,What are cons of living in Red Deer?,/r/RedDeer/comments/syc2wz/what_are_cons_of_living_in_red_deer/hz9i9tv/,2,r/RedDeer,0,2

"Check out Red Deers Realtor on YouTube. He explains some of the points you just asked about and a few more things like what do in the summer, winter, etc. - 

But let me break down a few of your points as well..

1.) Sylvan lake - although it seems like a nice beach town, don’t be fooled. When my parents lived there, they noticed a lot of confederate flags, anti mask attitudes and crowded beaches. They were so happy to sell their place move back to Red Deer. 

2 - lots of jobs. My friend actually works for a great logistics company based out of Calgary. Google Traffictech. 

3 - Red Deer is very friendly but we do have some assholes who are always a little louder than the rest of us. Red Deer is changing and is supportive to people from all backgrounds. Sylvan, not so much.

4 - lots of good vets! We’ve had our dog into emergency twice in her life. Both times they saved her life. We also have great dog parks here!!! Your pup will love it! 

5 - healthcare is a tough one. We just got lucky and knew someone who was a doctor, but before that, we did a lot of walk in clinic visits.

6 - watch “best things about Red Deer” from Red Deer’s Realtor on YouTube. He explains the best things about this city perfectly!

"Hey there! Thanks for considering Red Deer! It's a great place to live! Being right in the city is great, I had a medical appointment today and left 10 min before the appt to get there.

Cedarwood and Piper Creek are the vets people most likely recommend. I looked into it and I believe Cedarwood is the recommended choice among people with show dogs and the RCMP dogs. I have started going to Deer Park Vet with my injured kitten and I love it there. Everyone says our dog parks are superior to the cities, so I guess I'd believe it. :) 

The only major downside is snow from October to April. I would also look into Blackfalds and Lacombe as other small town options, lots of places to explore.

"Red deer is awesome. Have lived here for 8 years vs Camrose. Only place to avoid is downtown. As there is a very high crime rate. But this also goes for Edmonton or Calgary.

Red Deer currently is very car oriented city. We have transit but it's every 30 mins. That's what I miss most vs living in Edmonton.

We have two malls... Technically. Ie. One is dead one is mostly alive.

The trail system is very much like Edmonton/sherwood park. Lots of ""black path"" aka mixed use trail.

Bower ponds is wonderful in the summer.

Sylvan lake is the hot spot in the summer, for better or for worse. Tends to get overcrowded.

"Hey OP ,

Grew up in the city but left after high school for university but frequently visit my parents in Red Deer. Currently live in Calgary but work for a tech company that has a branch office in Vancouver 

The Amazing 

* Great place to raise children if that is something you desire. 
* Incredibly low rent and home prices....last time I checked the lowest in the country for a city over 100,000. 
* Trail system is spectacular , if you are a cyclist, hiker or nature lover. 
* Really green city,  the amount of green spaces really adds to the charm of the city.
* Red Deer College is an excellent transfer college with great instructors , small class sizes and used to be affordable. The affordable aspect has most likely changed. 

Not so cool 

\- The economy in Red Deer is struggling hard. Jobs are available but one thing you will quickly observe is the majority of jobs are low pay with no benefits. If the oil patch makes a recovery that could change. Lack of economic diversification is an Alberta wide problem but in Red Deer it is more tangible if you are looking for work. 

\- Racism ......this sounds crazy but in this regard Red Deer is taking steps ackwards. When I was a kid in the late 90s -early 2000s , high-school grad in 2008 .....even though Red Deer was all white..... the city from my perspective seemed very open to refugees and newcomers in general. My mom volunteered at Gates United Church from 1990-2015 and she has noticed the change in the city. It is  hard to explain why , but the drop in living standards and almost 8 years in recession has darkened the hearts of people and made people feel more insecure. Maybe more insecure people = more racism......who knows, this is not my area of expertise but the difference in peoples attitude is noticeable. 

If you can OP and this is a stretch visit Red Deer for a week if possible , you will be able to investigate for yourself and get a better sense of the city. Also OP, I work in Vancouver quite a bit and it is such an urban place.......Red Deer is almost the complete opposite .

"I'm just outside of Red Deer, in Blackfalds. I bought in 2019, at that time Blackfalds was the best bang-for-buck property wise in the outlying areas around Red Deer from my perspective.  That being said, if you want to be close to the lake than Sylvan is a really good option, just know that the town becomes extremely busy during the summer season due to tourism to the lake. 

Red Deer and surrounding area have a really large Filipino population, I haven't noticed any huge issues with racism but I would expect there are bad apples anywhere you go. 

Plenty of good vet options in the area, there is also a 24 hour pet hospital in Red Deer for emergencies. 

No idea about GI referrals, but it might require a specialist in Edmonton or Calgary if there are not any available locally. Perhaps discuss with your doctor a referral process to determine where you might be able to receive treatment. Worse comes to worse, you can get a treatment plan from your current GI in BC and bring it with you, get a General Physician here and start a referral process. 

For jobs, I would suggest securing one before moving out. I don't really know anything about your field of practice, but there are openings in the oil/gas sector with oil prices increasing which might require you to work away. I know there are also driving based positions that have day trips between Calgary and Edmonton. I am sure you could find something in shipping and logistics with experience.

Best part about Red Deer is having most of the ""big city"" amenities but none of the traffic or infrastructure issues that come with being in a big city.

"Your question is perfect here.

I moved here for work 9 yrs ago and was from northern BC. Congrats on leaving the insanity that is the Lower Mainland. Winter will be a shocker here for your wife but bright sunny winter days are the opposite of Vancouver's winters. People are friendly. Regarding your race question I don't think your wife will have a problem. There are way less Chinese and Sikh families here but there are still lots of newcomers. On my cul-de-sac (or close, as they call them in Alberta), there are a mix of people (from Colombia, Jamaica, Thailand). I think there are Mexican social groups in Calgary and Edmonton which are relatively close to RD.

The best thing about Red Deer to me are the paved walking trails that crisscross the whole city and the parks. There are 2 off leash dog parks that are absolutely amazing. One is 50 acres (Oxbow) and the best one is about 100 acres. The larger one is literally a dog Disneyland (3 Mile Bend) with multiple ponds, paved trails beside a river. Was just there yesterday with our 2 pups.

There are a ton of vets here in this city and finding a good one will be pretty easy. On the other medical question, I can't answer but Red Deer does have a large  enough population to support a lot of specialists and we are sandwiched between Calgary and Edmonton that are huge hubs. I just googled GI specialist and looks like there are at least 2, Dr Ryan and Dr Syed and (possibly?) a GI clinic out of the hospital.

I think Sylvan would be more expensive to live in than Red Deer but with gas prices in Alberta being 40 cents cheaper than Vancouver that probably won't be an issue.",t2_a5092jh0,JohnyPneumonicPlague,0,1646324953.0,0,t1_hz77345,hz77345,True,JayString,t3_t5trhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeer/comments/t5trhn/want_to_move_to_red_deer_from_vancouver/,Want to move to Red Deer from Vancouver.,/r/RedDeer/comments/t5trhn/want_to_move_to_red_deer_from_vancouver/hz77345/,6,r/RedDeer,0,6

"I have lived in Sylvan Lake and Red Deer my whole life. It is a good area. 
1) work opportunities are picking up. I would say you shouldn’t have much problem getting to the 25-30 hour range. Depends on your education. I would start looking on indeed, job searches, LinkedIn stuff. 
2. Might find the odd Redneck racist here but overall I think it is not bad (I am also white male so not really exposed.)
3. We have good vet clinics in red deer. My wife actually works at one. We also have two very good dog parks. 3 mile bend right by the river where your dog can go swimming and the smaller Oxbo park No river access. Then we have so many trails that you can walk them on with a leash. 
4. Hospital and doctors a little trickier although red deer is expanding its hospital with 1.8 billion dollar project over the next 10 years. Like said above may need to go to a Edmonton or Calgary 1.5 hours away for specialist. 
5. I love that it has everything I need without being a big city 100,000 people. I love that your about 2-3 hour drive to mountains for skiing/hiking. 2 hours or so from Drumhellor Badlands.

"So as far as Red Deer goes, the things that I can personally speak for is that overall, it's a nice city. I was born and raised here. Moved back after a stint in Calgary. What I really like about Red Deer is the beautiful trail systems, the outdoor activities and our amazing hockey team (the Rebels). Definitely worth checking out a hockey game. Much more affordable than NHL! We have some really cool businesses too. I would highly recommend the Gasoline Alley Farmers Market on the weekends. Also, some really neat places downtown. Downtown can be sketchy but nothing like Vancouver. Overall, it's pretty safe. As far as doctors go, even getting a family doctor can be difficult.

There is no solution, this is never going away, and we're going to have to learn to live with this virus from here on out.
