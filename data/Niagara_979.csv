"You're obviously a bit off the deep end and I'm not going to feed this discussion on a dead post anymore, so I'll respond with my final thoughts and then you can have your space to respond. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't have at least 1-2 of the co-morbidities that went along with covid. Very few people are perfectly healthy. Did those co-morbidities make severe infection and death from covid more statistically likely? Yes. Should they have died from a disease that we have the tools to prevent the spread of? Nope. 

As for ""main stream propaganda"", you don't seem to realize that you're the one consuming the propaganda of conspiracy theorists and bad actors. The reason your theories about scientists being censored, etcetera, are so exciting is because our brains are wired to like exciting information. It's exciting to feel like we have an ""in"" on the truth. The real science of masks, vaccination, physical distancing reducing the possible spread of covid is pretty simple and boring.

As for research, I do *plenty* of my own research. From ""main stream propaganda"", as well as the stuff you subscribe to. I then use all of that information, assess the biases of the sources, assess my own biases, and then come to a conclusion. I'd recommend checking out mediabiasfactcheck.com as one source for checking the biases of news organizations. It's far from perfect, but it's a good jumping off point. 

Lastly, if my wearing a mask and getting vaccinated makes you feel compelled to attack me, I think you need to reassess your idea of ""who gives a shit"" about what other people do. If I shouldn't care about this guy painting symbols directly associated with mass genocide on his truck, then you shouldn't care that I chose to post it here. I sincerely urge you to do some research from reputable sources on how we as humans are vulnerable conspiracy and false information, and then reflect on the content that you see online, on TV, etc.",t2_55r8ekuo,niagirl,0,1647829588.0,0,t1_i1heef3,i1heef3,False,niagirl,t3_t82kf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/t82kf8/starbucks_in_welland_swastika_hammer_and_sickle/,"Starbucks in Welland.

"Hey, I know you’re trying to be helpful, and I appreciate the places you suggested (thank you!) but giving unsolicited advice about an individual reactive dog doesn’t really help me and our stressful situation. 
I want to clarify, my dog is a three-time adoption fail. He is already in training. And trust me when I say we’ve tried all the harnesses that apparently solve this problem (they often don’t and in this case didn’t). This is behaviour he likely picked up a few owners ago and working with him requires a lot of patience. Sometimes that’s really difficult and I like to take him on decompression walks when I can - ones where we don’t have to work on training as much and he can just relax because he’s not around his triggers. 
This morning he had a really stressful walk, so frankly I posted here hoping for judgement-free answers for places that I could use for his afternoon walk.
Like I said, I appreciate the suggestions for places to walk, and I’ll definitely check them out, but assuming I’m not working with my dog (and an expensive trainer) to fix this is just another thing among the many things that make having a reactive dog so difficult.",t2_8t91evwb,Whatexists_,1,1647643552.0,0,t1_i17piu1,i17piu1,False,Whatexists_,t3_th7yg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/th7yg5/my_dog_is_onleash_reactive_so_walking_him_can_be/,"My dog is on-leash reactive, so walking him can be pretty stressful sometimes.

"First of all I'd suggest sourcing a good trainer to help you teach proper leash etiquette. Sometimes just changing to a head halter or a chest halter will significantly change the dog's behavior. Otherwise you just have to train away the bad behavior and often it's both owner and animal that need the training.

The friendship trail is an amazing place I regularly bike it and run it all over from Port Colborne to Fort Erie. The Niagara Parkway trails especially up and around Lewiston bridge are great, and tend to be quieter outside of busy weekends. If you want to avoid crowds on weekends go south of Chippewa and work your way down from there.

But seriously consider the training or a new no pull harness, it's easier to correct the behavior than it is to keep having to worry about a reactive dog.",t2_adsj48s6,SaneCannabisLaws,0,1647627604.0,0,t1_i16myv4,i16myv4,True,Whatexists_,t3_th7yg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/th7yg5/my_dog_is_onleash_reactive_so_walking_him_can_be/,"My dog is on-leash reactive, so walking him can be pretty stressful sometimes.

"I will tell you, as someone who has worked at a dispensary, that they 100% cannot give you information about cannabis products and their relation to cancer treatment. It’s a Health Canada thing. So, unfortunately, you have to do a lot of reading yourself, or befriend a staff and talk to them outside of work about it. 

RSO is different from typical thc oil that you’d find at a dispensary - most common ones found at dispensaries are the redecan one, medipharm, and solei (in my experience). I read below that grand cannabis in thorold has RSO, so I would check with them first and see if you can grab it easily. Otherwise, OCS would be your next best bet for regulated** RSO. You could also try to find a place online to ship to you, but grey-market cannabis is not regulated, so it’s a buy at your own risk situation. I don’t want to insinuate it’s bad, but if you’re more comfortable getting it with the provincial sticker and seal, it won’t exactly be the place you would want to look. Some people get squirmy about stuff like that, so I just want to make sure you know before you order it from wherever.

Edit: you may want to look at r/CanadianCannabisLPs , r/OCS , or r/trees and ask there. I know a lot of budtenders and just people who have a wealth of cannabis knowledge hang out there. You may find someone who has used RSO.

"Someone correct me if im wrong but RSO is made using solvents like isopropyl alcohol or grain alcohol. You use the solvent to disolve the THC and separate it from the plant matter, then let the solvent evaporate away and you're left with RSO.

Most legal concentrates at the dispensary are solventless products that are made a totally different way, this is because making any kind of concentrates with solvents is dangerous (possible kaboom) and the final product can be dangerous if there is any solvent leftover in the concentrate.

Poison control centers in the United States received about 1,800 reports involving use of kratom from 2011 through 2017, including reports of death. About half of these exposures resulted in serious negative outcomes such as seizures and high blood pressure. Five of the seven infants who were reported to have been exposed to kratom went through withdrawal. Kratom has been classified as possibly unsafe when taken orally.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/kratom/art-20402171)

Kratom has a number of known side effects, including:

Weight loss
Dry mouth
Chills, nausea and vomiting
Changes in urine and constipation
Liver damage
Muscle pain
Kratom also affects the mind and nervous system:

Dizziness
Drowsiness
Hallucinations and delusion
Depression and delusion
Breathing suppression
Seizure, coma and death

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"I've been wondering the same thing as I would like to have a friend from Canada pick me up after walking across the bridge.

Canada makes this difficult.

I don't think you can enter the duty free lot from the Canadian side.

There's metered parking spaces on clifton hill which is easily walkable from the border entrance, I think it might be best to have the friend walk across, then have the friend call you once they are across then wait in a specific location, then you can drive to the location to pick them up once they call. If you sit in a metered spot even for a couple minutes with you in the car at the wheel I don't know how bad they are about ticketing for just rolling up to one of those spots for a few min.

If you are worried about not finding a spot have the friend in a place where a car can pull up quickly and get them. Make sure the friend knows what the car looks like.

If you were picking up a friend on the US side and the friend was walking from the Canada side to the USA side its so much easier, because there's a ton of places to just pull up and pick up someone for free.",t2_6r5hf,SaraAB87,0,1646689676.0,0,t1_hzramlg,hzramlg,True,iamsosillylol,t3_t8zrkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/t8zrkp/help_picking_someone_up_at_rainbow_bridge_canada/,HELP.

"Definitely, I went just over five years ago so want to preface by saying things may be different for those who have went more recently 

First the space is jam packed. 25+ dogs of all different sizes together in the same room. The spacing is very minimal, so expect to get super close to the dogs in your group.

Moving to the actual training, there wasn't much structure. A bunch of miscellaneous drills (sitting, laying down, how to properly walk, stay, etc) that all dogs are doing at once - so there's not really any specific feedback being provided by the instructor to you

Now that may be most training schools, but my issue was how corrections were made. He strongly recommend prong collars and corrections were made by popping the collar (to be balanced treats were brought by owners and encouraged to be used, but anytime multiple corrections were needed the prong collar was the preferred choice). A few other individuals there mentioned he had a background in training police dogs, so that's the best way I can describe it. The training wasn't to help teach your best friend, but more akin to training a police style pet.

The damage took a while to undo. My friendly puppy suddenly became super protective of us and developed issues playing with other dogs - none of which existed before Dave's school.

When we called to discuss with Dave, we were told our dog needed specialized 1v1 classes with him to break this - at a much higher cost. I won't even get into how patronizing he was 

We moved to Toronto shortly after and found someone who specialized in training through positive reinforcement, and it was night and day

"Hey /r/niagara!

I come to this subreddit with one of my projects that I have been working on - my 3D SketchUp model of the future skyline of Canadian Niagara Falls in Google Earth. This model contains all various proposed buildings near the Falls, including some older, stale, proposals that were made in the early 2000s that never ended up materializing, but weren't built as something else.

It contains 21 towers, including the major new ones that were proposed over the last few years. I would unfortunately consider it unlikely that many of these will be built in the near future, considering that many are hotels that would be directly competing with each other for market viability, but I like to be optimistic and paint a vision of what could be someday.

I work on lot of other skylines across Canada and have many in the works.

"I'm going to write some tinfoil hat business, but there's more connections between Niagara politics and the provincial conservatives than coincidence alone might allow:

1: LaFleche did a great job covering the CAO story.  This was a scamzilla to get a friendly CAO installed to allow Caslin et al to skim off the region.

2(A): Pelham's been cleared 4-5 times on this story, and after 4 years, Mayor Junkin hasn't managed to ""find"" the missing 17 million he accused the town of hiding

3: Dave doubled down and ran for Regional Chair to shine more light on what he was seeing:

"Not wise to bring a razor to a gun fight apparently.

As /u/BrandyBeaner pointed out the timing relative to WW1 is interesting too. For those who aren't too familiar with the WW1 timeline, Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated by Serbian nationalists on June 28th, Austro-Hungarian empire spent the next month planning and justifying through diplomatic manipulation a war with Serbia, and by July 29th had started bombarding Belgrade with artillery. In the meantime every country in Europe had been trying to discourage anybody from attacking anybody by throwing around various ultimatums that ""if you attack so-and-so I'll attack you!"".

At the point of this article, armed conflict was still limited to Serbia and the whole chain of events that brought all of Europe in was just starting, with Russia coming immediately to Serbia's defense, which triggered Germany to come to Austro-Hungary's defense against Russia on 1st August.

At the time this article was written (August 2) not much of what was happening on the ground was publicly known, but what we know *now* is that France was obligated to defend Russia against Germany, and was already mobilizing to do so, but Germany was a few steps ahead and was already moving preemptively on France. They sent troops into Luxembourg and demanded free passage from Belgium. On August 3 Germany declared war against France.

The rest is cribbed directly from Britannica:

>In the night of August 3–4 German forces invaded Belgium. Thereupon, Great Britain, which had no concern with Serbia and no express obligation to fight either for Russia or for France but was expressly committed to defend Belgium, on August 4 declared war against Germany.

>Austria-Hungary declared war against Russia on August 5; Serbia against Germany on August 6; Montenegro against Austria-Hungary on August 7 and against Germany on August 12; France and Great Britain against Austria-Hungary on August 10 and on August 12, respectively; Japan against Germany on August 23; Austria-Hungary against Japan on August 25 and against Belgium on August 28.",t2_ajjk,cecilkorik,0,1644460988.0,0,t1_hwbcw28,hwbcw28,True,grimsbylibraryonline,t3_sosfq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/sosfq4/a_murder_took_place_in_grimsby_beach_in_1914/,A Murder Took Place In Grimsby Beach In 1914,/r/niagara/comments/sosfq4/a_murder_took_place_in_grimsby_beach_in_1914/hwbcw28/,6,r/niagara,0,6

"There is no business that I am aware of that will procure and bring the goods over for yourself.  While it seems like a great idea for a business, certain goods can come with a ""hidden"" cost as well depending on the product and not just a matter of paying the HST/PST, since a tariff or duty could be applied.

Re:  PO Box, yes you can get one, depending on the setup they may charge a monthly/annual fee or a fee per package, worth checking into the options if you are looking to ship a large amount.  For example if you order three different cables and one of them is on back order, the vendor will probably ship what they have in inventory and then ship the back ordered one when it comes in, this will result in two charges by the PO Box company.

Re:  Crossing the border.  Do not take advice from Reddit and read up on the requirements as these have changed a few times.  During pre-Covid times, it was easy, have a passport or Nexus, go across answer the questions by the US Border Team, do what you need, pay the bridge toll to come back to Canada, talk to the Canadian Border Team, answer their questions, and go.  Depending on the value of the goods, you might be sent inside for payment purposes for any taxes, duties, or tariffs that are being applied.  This is the tricky bit.  Generally declaring under $50 results in a quick THANK YOU AND GO, and over $50 is a hit and miss on if they will ask you to pay the duty/tax on a product(s).  Under COVID, you need to fill in the Arrive-Can app prior to getting to the Canadian border.  There is no guarantee that they will let you go with ease and if your Arrive-Can information is questionable or incorrectly filled out, they can hit you with a quarantine order as well.",t2_4mypp7mg,The-Raccoon-Is-Here,0,1643151132.0,0,t1_hu7tlcq,hu7tlcq,True,redditnewbie6910,t3_sbv1fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/sbv1fw/question_for_shippingdelivery_from_us/,question for shipping/delivery from US,/r/niagara/comments/sbv1fw/question_for_shippingdelivery_from_us/hu7tlcq/,1,r/niagara,0,1

"Donating to kids in care is absolutely beautiful idea. That said, FACS doesn't take used items.

Most foster kids are not kicked out when they are 18. The vast majority leave care before they hit 18.

Only kids who are <16 can be taken into care. Kids who are 16+ must *consent* to care, so on their 16th birthday, a kid in a foster or group home can do more or less whatever they want. They can leave their foster or group home and go back to their ""real home"". They can attempt to make it on their own and try to score a place on youth welfare. This happens a lot because for the most part, kids in care don't have a lot of warm and fuzzy feelings towards FACS. They they find out that the government is going to give them **$733 a MONTH**. Then the mental image of making it rain is replaced by their trustee managing, to some degree, their major expenses like rent which gets sent directly to their landlord in a lot of cases. As is often the case, the reality is far less exciting than the imaginary.

The more supportive option is called Voluntary Youth Services Agreement (VYSA), which basically helps 16/17 year olds who don't have other options to get and set up their own housing and finish high school. It provides additional support - financial, social, housing - compared to youth welfare, so kids on VYSA tend to have small apartments that they share with a roommate or two. It is a lot different than those who only qualify for youth welfare. Those kids are renting rooms in flophouses, shacking up with their SO's family, or selling drugs/sex to survive. 

The thing is that as they over 16 kid has to consent to VYSA *and* the agency has to be willing to enter into the agreement. So basically, your VYSA kid is the one who is going to be more cooperative and will not be a lot of work for the case manager. 

Once a kid turns 18, if they are on VYSA, they can go on a continued care program which keeps them supported until they turn 21. There is actually a fair bit of money available for kids who used to be called Crown Wards, and the days when foster parents gave kids moving boxes and garbage bags for their 18th birthday are long gone.

as /u/stars33d mentioned, the FACS foundation runs Gift of Hope which collects funds for youth in care. Those funds are used for a variety of things, including to help set kids up on their own once they decide to go that route.",t2_xt5l3,EtOHMartini,0,1642168945.0,0,t1_hsmnjxt,hsmnjxt,False,NotScaredOfDucks,t3_s3e0r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/s3e0r6/does_anyone_know_a_nonprofit_to_donate_clothes_to/,Does anyone know a non-profit to donate clothes to in Niagara Falls?,/r/niagara/comments/s3e0r6/does_anyone_know_a_nonprofit_to_donate_clothes_to/hsmnjxt/,2,r/niagara,0,2

"For every day needs, I find Zehrs and Sobeys does a good job with selection - more prefrance to Zehrs.

For bread - the Udi's brand is the best there, however quality control is garbage. Some loaves have giant holes in the center and all the way through. I get my bread at Costco - called Seeds & Grains. They come in a two pack. 

There's also Edible Options and FarmBoy for more expensive but quality alternatives for grocery stores.

There's also Susie's Gluten Free bakery in Grimsby which is awesome.

Unsolicited advice that I wish I knew when I found out I was celiac: Try and get more familiar on how to cook foods without gluten and life will become a lot easier (ie. Rice dishes, salads, the wonders of potatoes, different kinds of mushrooms and chickpeas, etc). There's so much you can do without gluten. It's just the ""quick and easy"" stuff that suddenly disappears and is a bit shocking to adjust to.

Good luck!

"Greenhouse production earns \~$340 million dollars annually in Niagara.  By far the largest agri-business in the region.

Greenhouses are overwhelmingly owned by Christian Reformed families.

Christian Reformed churches are organized and well funded, and function as central banks for their members.  As such, politicians in Niagara who align with the Christian Reformed viewpoint find themselves well funded and receiving positive coverage in local ""independent"" media.  

So, the more right wing social conservative you are in Niagara, the more funding you get, and the more positive coverage you get. Also, since we are small and not a lot of people vote, a church block of 500 or 1000 people can make a huge difference. That's literally how Oosterhoff got the nomination: he showed up to the nomination with 500 members of his church, beating out Rick Dykstra.

"Be Russell Oliver and open a store where ignorant and desperate people bring you crap and you tell them its worth less than the spot price and then you buy it from them because they're too lazy and impatient to go somewhere else.

I mean, imagine you own a whole bunch of gold. Are you going to sell it all to someone for less than the spot price? Not if you can help it right? So why do you think anyone else is knowingly going to?

That's not a rhetorical question by the way, it's a thought experiment. There absolutely *are* reasons that other people will knowingly sell below the spot price, but you have to really understand why and cater very specifically to at least some of those needs and situations if you want to have any success at all. It's a very, very competitive marketplace, you aren't the first person to think of this. The question is how far are you willing to go? Are you willing to go further than other people?

"It’s hard to believe anything the gov says anymore regarding the pandemic no matter what side of the vaccine stick your on when the government since the beginning was preaching “Stop the Spread, get your vaccine” and now it has nothing to do with stopping the spread. They’ve lost the argument and I think that is the problem as to why you have things being regurgitated. You have things being regurgitating because the gov keeps regurgitating the same goddamn messaging and restrictions on peoples lives. The course needs to change and we need to adapt like many other countries are doing. The answer is no longer vaccine. It’s part of it yes, but it’s not the be all/end all to curb this thing. Everyone is aware by now the vaxx can spread just as good as the unvaxxed so the merit of mandatory vaxx should be up for debate at the very least.

Regarding your comment about healthcare, for those who make an honest living and pay their Canadian taxes, we shouldn’t be “constrained” for 300 ICU patients in a province that is 14 million strong. That’s not our responsibility to manage nurses and ensuring we have enough of them, we pay the government to manage that aspect, and we pay high in comparison to other countries who have managed nursing staffing better then we have. The healthcare system has been a mess pre-Covid and the gov has failed to improve that and Covid just highlighted front and center, the extremely vulnerable state our healthcare is in and how poorly managed it is.

"Maybe it's not, but it's hard to tell when it's supporting other people who are hateful. At this point nobody's actually listening to each other anyway. It's assumed that the non-hateful anti-vaxxers would've at least listened to the words coming out of somebody's mouth by now and understood that vaccines and boosters are not to prevent spread, they are to keep you out of ICU and prevent the currently-in-progress collapse of an overwhelmed-by-numbers health care system.

Rather than mindlessly regurgitating the same ""muh freedumbs"" ""doesn't work anyway"" argument that's been beaten to death. Even if it doesn't work perfectly, it's the best option we've got.

Agree with Dean’s sentiments here regarding Jeremy’s comments. Im double vaxxed but I agree that mandatory vaxx should not be a thing.
