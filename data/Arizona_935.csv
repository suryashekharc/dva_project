"They're definitely a type of [*undulatus*](https://whatsthiscloud.com/cloud-varieties/undulatus/) cloud, but it's difficult to determine the height, so they could either be really thin [altocumulus clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altocumulus_undulatus_cloud) or [cirrocumulus clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrocumulus_undulatus).  I'm leaning more toward altocumulus because of how much space there is between the rows of clouds.

The rows themselves are caused by wind shear.  In other words, sharp changes in wind direction with height cause the clouds to arrange themselves in rows.  With undulatus clouds, the rows are arranged in a manner that is perpendicular to the wind flow aloft. There is an upper-level ridge building into the area, which would cause an abrupt change in wind direction aloft, which could further explain the presence of these clouds.",t2_4b11q,giantspeck,0,1648278629.0,0,t1_i261csw,i261csw,True,LSUTGR1,t3_to9npc,https://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/to9npc/it_doesnt_take_much_to_find_the_inspiration/,"It doesn't take much to find the inspiration behind our state flag, especially today.",/r/arizona/comments/to9npc/it_doesnt_take_much_to_find_the_inspiration/i261csw/,1,r/arizona,0,1

"Phoenix Zoo is good, especially for kids since they provide a lot of educational content and it is laid out well.

Im sorry but Ill take data over your work experience. I personally have seen more than you have dealt with in your 20 years.

I agree that the Berkeley study was not perfect and a longer study would be better and I am sure we are more likely to get it with filtering becoming more widespread in the US.

any statistics on these claims?

...

don't worry I do. 

* A study found that in places that lane splitting was legal only 0.4% of motorcycle accidents involved lane splitting.

from 2005 - 2009 when lane splitting was only legal in California. [source](https://www.ots.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/67/2019/06/Motorcycle-Lane-Splitting-and-Safety-2015.pdf)

* California had significantly less motorcycle rear-end crashes than the national average.

* California had less motorcycle deaths, despite being denser than most places

* Its also been found that ""lane splitting riders were less likely to suffer head injury (9 vs 17 percent), torso injury (19 vs 29 percent) and fatal injury (1.2 vs 3 percent)""

"the point is to increase safety and reduce traffic. Being hit from behind is extremely dangerous for bikes and often kills motorcyclists, filtering allows bikes to reduce that risk by being between cars. 

it also allows us to move to the front where we are most visible, again a huge advantage in safety terms. Also with motorcycle being more capable of acceleration when the light turns green we are not in anybodies way. This means there are no negative effects for the cars either.

I mean, what in the world is the point of not allowing filtering? what issues could you possibly have with it?",t2_a8lv3z5j,BestAtempt,0,1648163033.0,0,t1_i1ztk7n,i1ztk7n,False,Psychoboy,t3_tm0t7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/tm0t7r/arizona_governor_signs_sb1273_legalizing_lane/,"Arizona Governor Signs SB1273, Legalizing Lane Filtering",/r/arizona/comments/tm0t7r/arizona_governor_signs_sb1273_legalizing_lane/i1ztk7n/,2,r/arizona,0,2

"You are wrong. You are just stating your feelings as fact but they are both unsupported and uninformed. 

lane **splitting** is safer for motorcycles and better for everyone. Every legitimate study has shown the same. lane filtering is a lesser form of splitting and so by extension lane filtering is also safer. 

This is either fear mongering, or science denying and neither should be tolerated.

"AZ law is that your DL expires at age **65** and requires renewal each five years thereafter.  Also your motorcycle endorsement expires and you are required to retest rules of road and road test.  This adequately addresses aging drivers. 

You could argue for periodic road test requirements for people age 72\~75 plus.   

Two interviews were cited in the article:  

1) A Lyft driver claiming people don't understand the rules of the road.  How many of the poor drivers she sees are snowbirds licensed in other states?  My east valley community traffic volume roughly doubles during snowbird season.  Most of the traffic violations, speeding, and aggressive driving I witness occurs during snowbird season.  **US Rules of the Road** are largely uniform across the country and the rest of the world.  Probably the last significant Rules of the Road change was adoption of *Turn on Red* in the 1970's by Eastern states, Western states allowed this prior.

2) Maria Wojtczak, the **owner** of DrivingMBA has a conflict of interest.

"Hate to say it, but southern AZ counties are corrupt as hell when it comes to drugs and politics. These guys sound like cartel guys, they usually get a pass, and the judge gets a fancy house. I'm surprised they got any time at all.

  
When I worked for a PD in AZ, (won't say where) we had a case where a cartel mule had multiple bales of marijuana in the open bed of his pickup, and a submachine gun lying openly on the seat next to him. Judge dismissed the case as an ""illegal search"" with everything in plain view, and the mule making threats of physical harm against the officer.

The initial case was for theft of alcohol from a convenience store after they refused to sell to him after hours. He physically threatened the clerk, then shoved her and took the alcohol and walked out with it.  He was sitting in the parking lot drinking it, and as the officer approached, told him he would ""take him out"" and flashed a MS-13 gang sign at him as he approached. All charges were dismissed, along with the drug and gun violations, and the judge refused to hold him for the feds or INS.

"1) water will be a problem in the future
2) power grid is pretty, been here for 12 years, only lost power like 2 times, max was a couple hours 
3) haboobs (dust storms) are kinda rare but may happen durring Monsoon season...anywhere from mid June through Sept.
4) lots of hiking. Any hill, like South Mountain or especially the mogollon rim.
5) id say Glendale is kinda sketch...north west phoenix.

"**Bisbee 1,000** - October. You race through a historic mining town built on the side of mountains, and run up 1,000 stairs throughout the race. Beautiful, lots of art.  About 7 miles I think.

**Mesa Half** - one of the fastest in the country. Feb each year. Very well organized, good swag, great race finish expo too. 

**Arizona Rock n Roll** - the biggest half of the year. MLK weekend each year. 

[**Aravaipa Races**](https://www.aravaiparunning.com/) has something going on every couple of weeks. All trail runs. Summer races are at night. Bounces around all over the state.  Beautiful locations. The distances vary, and a single race event usually has 3-4 options between a 5-10k, 20-30k, 50k, 50 mile, 100k and/or 100 mile. Whiskey Basin races around Watson Lake are beautiful,  did the half last year. 

**Pat's Run** is in April. It's 4.2 miles and honors Pat Tillman. It's massive. You can usually finish before the final starting corrals are even released. 

The **Tucson marathon races** are in December. It's great to watch the sun rise over the mountains as you head downhill. 

**Man Against Horse** - 12.5M, 25M, 50M. Prescott, AZ, October. A human vs horses trail race. 

**Sedona races** - Superbowl weekend, Saturday. Tough 5k, and the half bombs downhill then back up. tough races but pretty.

"So wild. 

I have always wondered if tunnels form in certain areas because of what is under the ground. Like are the following underground water paths that create an electrical charge. It seems so random, but I think about this because I was next to a tree that got hit by lightening, out camping in the grand canyon many moons ago. It was the weirdest experience. The hair on my arms and neck stood up, there was almost a greenish tint and then lightening struck a tree we were staing next too. No thunder, no rain, but we were at the front end of a storm coming across the canyon. The ground definitely was charged before the strike. So I have always wondered if the ground was creating a charge for the tornadoes to follow.

It seems so weird that the funnels would hop scotch like that.

"So they‚Äôre holding a country hostage with pricing because of an attempt of a greener movement due to climate change? If that‚Äôs the stance that the opposing believe, why would they not be bothered that people who align with the same views as them are also screwing them over directly in the process by price gouging for not getting their way?

That in itself sounds like a problem yet people are in favor of it.

I‚Äôm not the most politically educated individual but if this is the true sentiment of what people think, I think they should really reevaluate the way they think that this stuff works.

Also, oil companies get government land for pennies, thus not really giving the state much of anything and then take a majority of the profits and end up costing all of us tax payers to pay the loss.

"ROFLMAO, I just looked up houses in LHC and that is NOT affordable. Even compared to Show Low / Lakeside its expensive. I can find houses in the east valley for much less, and I'm sure there's cheap around Tucson too because the metro areas have suburbs.

Now go to the Midwest and houses are much cheaper. Back east (the South and the far north) you can get a home in a nice town surrounded by forest for far less still.  

Flagstaff has been expensive for decades, back when Californians discovered it and moved there in droves. It became East SF back in the 90s.

And no, it isn't a swamp cooler like the one you linked, with the tradeoff being that you need to connect an exhaust hose to a fixture that you set in your window to blow the hot air out.

I can understand going with a more affordable unit, but let me say, I got mine when I was 17 because my dad never let me turn the house AC to a comfortable temperature for my room, which was sun facing and above the garage, and I've never looked back.

"Honestly, the noise is a plus for me, it helps me fall asleep. If a fan or something advertises itself as silent I'll usually skip it for something that doesn't claim to be quiet or silent.

That being said, I ended up buying [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Arctic-Air-Pure-Chill/439527009) cheap-o $30 small evaporative AC on the recommendation of someone else. The plan is to figure out how I like the technology, if I feel like the cheapness of the product is limiting me, but it otherwise seems legit OR if the thing breaks then I'll invest in a proper full set. If for whatever reason evaporative cooling doesn't seem like the greatest option then I'm only out $30 which isn't nearly as big a deal as the $300 models I'm seeing elsewhere, and then I'll invest in something else that will cool my room - probably the one you linked since it doesn't look like it's an evaporative cooler, no?
