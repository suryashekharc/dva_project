"There isn't much to do in the way of entertainment. Major businesses you might take for granted elsewhere (Trader Joe's, Total Wine) simply don't exist here while others are leaving (Bed, Bath, and Beyond just bounced). It's country living without the greenery you would expect to find or the low cost you'd hope for.  But there are plenty of conservative types due to it being a mix of retirees, military, etc.  If you're not into Big Ag and factory farming,  prepare to be disappointed. They load up the fields with chemicals all day and night long.  At least we can see how Arizona's water system is prioritized.
 
Any point of real interest (Phoenix, Tucson, Vegas, San Diego, Rock Pointe, etc. are still 2-3+ hour's drive away.  You'll want to get away often to do any decent shopping or entertainment, so you'd better like long distance driving.  

Summers are too hot to exist, and it almost seems impossible how little rain we actually get.  You'll have days that are immensely hot AND humid, and you'll even see thunderheads forming on the horizon, but by the time the sun goes down,  they mostly just stay on the distant horizon, teasing us with their lightning flashes.  The closest thing we have to a refreshing storm are the Mad Max-style wind and dust storms reminiscent of the Dustbowl Era.  Try not to be outside or breathe on days like those because,  as we've established, chemicals from the fields in the dust, now in the air.  You can sometimes substitute that dust for smoke from California wildfires.

In brief,  if you like dune buggies, dust storms, unbearable heat, and a lack of art and culture, Yuma may be for you.   But if you enjoy a clean environment with shopping and entertainment options and a place where kids can have fun outside without fear of heat exhaustion, skin cancer, or breathing what's in the wind...then maybe yuma isn't your bag.",t2_dixde,thecwestions,1,1647455823.0,0,t1_i0x0oql,i0x0oql,True,ElkSand,t3_tfixgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/yuma/comments/tfixgv/what_should_i_know_about_yuma/,What should I know about Yuma?,/r/yuma/comments/tfixgv/what_should_i_know_about_yuma/i0x0oql/,4,r/yuma,0,4
"Grew up here. Love that it’s small, yet big. Obviously has it’s pluses and minuses. 

Hot in the summer and traffic is always light during the summer. like someone else mentioned electric bills are high but you don’t really need heat in the winter so it kind of averages out. Great weather in the winter but good luck getting around town in a hurry. It’s the sunniest city in the world I think so if you like the sun and hate clouds it’s perfect. Something like 300+ days a year of sunshine. 

Good food for the most part. There some sketchy places but I’ve always felt real safe here. 

Someone said a 3 hour drive to anywhere but I think 3 hour drive isn’t all that bad. 3 hours to the beach. 3 hours to one of the biggest cities in the country. 6 hours to the Grand Canyon. I think about 6 hours to Vegas and LA. Also less than 2 hours to Mexico if you’re ever feeling adventurous.

"I would have less of a problem with this if it added to things but for the time being it doesn’t. You’d think opening Palo Verde would ‘double’ the service but since they limit the service at each the average visit is still weeks off. 

If there’s a shortage of vets it seems that would be the biggest reason to have appointments so the visits are metered. And if it’s an emergency then well it’s an emergency and you pay emergency pricing. That’s fair.

If their goal is only urgent/emergencies at FH then they’ll be successful but it’s also at the cost of burning the less fortunate and those on limited income who want to care for their pet and suspect something is wrong….and have to pay a minimum of $155 to find out if they’re right.",t2_3mwqllio,Puzzleheaded_Nerve_2,0,1645908812.0,0,t1_hyk5c9x,hyk5c9x,False,Puzzleheaded_Nerve_2,t3_t1fwtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/yuma/comments/t1fwtw/foothills_animal_hospital_appointment_system/,FootHills Animal Hospital Appointment System Change,/r/yuma/comments/t1fwtw/foothills_animal_hospital_appointment_system/hyk5c9x/,1,r/yuma,0,1

"Makes sense. You may very well be right. It does seem weird to open another clinic if there’s a ‘shortage’.

This change hasn’t been rolled out very well. Their website still has a section that lets us choose an appointment date in the future and then someone supposedly calls you. “The website still needs to be changed” was what I heard when I asked about it.

I am wondering how it works when a bunch of people are calling at 7:30a for the day. To me it’s a shitty system to only find out at 7:30a what the rest of your day will look like and when you can show up. And I wonder if that’s after XXX waiting on hold as a bunch of other people are calling too for the same thing.

"cryptid???I found a bird in the street by my house one night, when i walk outside my security light turned on and i noticed the bird then appeared to be a duck, but when the light turned on the bird looked over at me. At this point i knew it was something i never seen before it was obvious at this point, so i ran after it and it was a running bird because it was really really fast like a roadrunner kinda fast but size of a duck. I actually caught the bird but it was becuase it had ran to the gutter of other side of street and stopped and turned around to see if i was still after it, i was right behind it and it fell on it's ass like a baby falling down on it's diaper. so i scooped up the bird in my hand and it is sitting in my hand at this point with it's legs dangling off my hand. to my suprise when it opened it's mouth it was like looking down at a crocodile's mouth it appeared to be teeth at first so i almost dropped it. apparently this bird had a duck bill that was serrated like a jagged opening of the bill was end to end so it appeared to be teeth. it bit my shirt and obviously was not very smart bird because it was kinda didn't know what it was doing and not dangerous i had woke of my parents at the time and neither of the seen a bird like this. it had a pidgeon type head with the purple shine like pidgeons had small chicken wings , black feathers and bright yellow eyes, and it's stomach was a fat ball almost with white. and it had little pencil legs with huge feet no web on foot with three toes which each toe was as big as my fingers, couldn't fly if it tried i bet. but my first impression was the ibis from egyptian lore or something. i had put it in a avon box but the bird was taller then the box so i just let it out.....it hopped outta the box and i have a raised cement porch so it ran off the porch and fell and rolled on to it's back where it sat for a second like it was disorientated now it stood up and started walking like a chicken. Never figured out what kinda bird it was should of never let it go. anyone who might know by description let me know i could draw a picture also if anyone wants to see what it looks like. closest bird i could find was a prehistoric bird. it was a baby proabably little smaller then full size duck. could of out ran me easy.",t2_9kyaawyo,Amazing_Rooster7391,0,1644383163.0,0,t1_hw6qvsm,hw6qvsm,True,Fiendguy18,t3_lqkev0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yuma/comments/lqkev0/whats_your_cryptid_or_paranormal_encounter_in/,"What’s your cryptid or paranormal encounter in Yuma ,AZ",/r/yuma/comments/lqkev0/whats_your_cryptid_or_paranormal_encounter_in/hw6qvsm/,1,r/yuma,0,1

"I’m a little late to the party but since I’m I recent transplant and I have had a lot of out of town visitors I can share what I usually bring them to do. Obviously the sand dunes are a great destination. We go to Buttercup from Yuma. Out of this world, especially if you go in the hour before sundown. Climb to the top of a dune in your bare feet, and just enjoy the beauty. I have been at all times of day and it’s MUCH better in the golden hour! Bonus, buy a plastic sled and go sledding in the dunes. A once in a lifetime experience! We also go to the hot springs about twenty minutes further down the road, called the Holtville hot springs. They are super janky but HOT!! And fun. If you are adventurous, go check out 5 palms hot springs (found in google maps but not Apple Maps). Be warned it’s a popular nudist spot but totally worth going, it’s another completely unique and stunning spot. There’s a nice old guy who takes care of it. We go with our kids and everyone there has been respectful and waited for us to leave or bathed with a suit. A nice tip is to go in the SUMMER because a lot of the nudists are snowbirds living in rvs nearby, and they leave. And also the water is lukewarm not hot, so in the shade it’s actually perfect on a 100 degree day. Trust me. 
We go to the Yuma Swap Meet (the Mexican one near the airport) for sweet bargain secondhand finds, authentic Mexican food, and a fun Mexican-but-not-in-Mexico vibe. Saturdays and sundays in the winter  are the best time to go. Sundays they have live music at the end of the day, its cool! 
Go walking along the river from the east wetlands park. Take a right and follow the river. It’s shady and pretty and flat and perfect for kids! 
There is a sweet ghost town/western museum called Castle Dome where you can feel like you are back in the mining days and visit a glowing cavern. Awesome for anyone who likes history or the west or has an imagination. 
Our favorite coffee shop is Sunshine cafe. Great artistic summery vacation vibe with tons of outdoor space, plants. 
Go swimming in the river! Bring shade as it can be hard to come by. There are tons of places to go, not just the parks. 
We love Yuma. There isn’t a lot of stuff for someone young and single, with a lot of time.

edit: I was able to answer my own question:

https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/undeclared-medication-results-heavy-fines

The second incident occurred on Saturday when an 89-year-old female U.S. citizen from Sun City, Ariz., applied for entry into the U. S., declaring medication and other miscellaneous items. When asked numerous times if she had anything else to declare, the subject responded she had nothing further to declare. Upon a subsequent search of her purse, officers found two undeclared bottles of Carisoprodol (100 pills) and Valium (90 pills). The subject admitted she was told by the pharmacist in Mexico to hide the pills inside her purse. The medication was seized and the subject was penalized $2,000. She paid the penalty and was released.

“The U.S. Customs Service enforces Federal laws and regulations, including those of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A new bill was recently passed by Congress that amends a portion of the Controlled Substances Act (21USC956(a)). This amendment allows a United States resident to import up to 50 dosage units of a controlled medication without a valid prescription at an international land border.

These medications must be declared upon arrival, be for your own personal use and in their original container. However, travelers should be aware that drug products which are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may not be acceptable for such importation. FDA warns that such drugs are often of unknown quality and discourages buying drugs sold in foreign countries. Please go to http://www.fda.gov/ora/import/purchasing_medications.htm for further information.

"Mexican: Durón’s or El Charro if you want quality, family-style meals. 
Taco stands: Tacos el Cositas (straight up simple street tacos done well) or El Taco Dorado (flautas, folded tacos, and more with immaculate presentation and consistency)
Those four safely would be my picks for “better than what you have at home”… Ha ha

Other local picks of mine: River City Grill (more upscale), Prison Hill Brewery (food’s good and locally influenced even if you’re not there for the beer), Angry Italian (food truck with incredible pizzas, pastas, and calzones), and Rolls & Bowls (‘sushi’ that’s very Mexican-infused, plus teriyaki bowls and such).

All of them have FB pages and should be easily found under those names on Google Maps, Yelp, or whatever. (Cositas and Rolls Bowls are both located in the Foothills on the east side of town, and the latter also has a location in San Luis, south of Yuma and on the border.)

On that note, if you’re wanting a quick jaunt into Mexico you’d probably be better off crossing at Algodones vs San Luis. It’s smaller and way more tourist-friendly too, and also set up a bit more easily to pay to park at the Quechan lot and walk across. Monday would be quieter but honestly if you go in the morning and don’t wait too long into the afternoon it probably won’t be too much of a wait.

"Thanks to all of you! I did drive to the sand dunes, walked up the dune by the Old Plank Road and took a panoramic picture of the visible segment of the wall from there.

I also drove to the actual border crossing, but was disappointed that I couldn't stop there to observe the goings-on. To my great astonishment, I actually thought is was esthetically much more pleasing (there) than I would have thought.

"Hi…. I did EXACTLY this a few months ago. You can have your dentist recommend/get a discount for an AirBnB in Algodones. OR you can ask your dentist to get a discount for you at California Hotel (FUNNY I know). The dentists in Algodones have a vested interest in maintaining the safety of their patients. 
There are alternatives: The Casino is in California, a 1/4 mile from the border. You can stay there. BUT, staying in Algodones allows your dentist to work on you later than if you have to leave before the border closes. (When I went, the border was closing at 2pm). I stayed at the hotel 2 nights in order to get more done. 
I’m happy to share my experience with you at any time. I’m from Oregon; was born and have family in Yuma. Where do you reside? What dental work are you having done? How long did your dentist recommend you stay?

I live on acreage out near fields and this year i did notice the chemical smell for  few days, but thats the first time in 20 years i had any inclination of chemicals in the air.  As for shit to do, you can offroad, you dont need a poltical flag to do that, fyi those ppl at the dunes acting that way flock here to the sand dunes to be able to do that.  In the summer get a boat go to Martinez lake fish, ski, cool of its amazing out there. There used to be a couple of swim clubs for kids but those dissappeared years ago, we have some very competitive soccer and baseball travel teams for kids.  San diego is just over the mountains 3hrs away we somrtimes hit the toad early beach eat shop and come home late.  Yuma is what you make of it.  But the community always comes together to help out anyone in need.  For the guy who posted all the negative shit feel free to move away buddy,  that is unless you were writing that from one of the prisons, then i get it you cant leave, but there are two south of the city.

"Yuma is kind of a bummer.  If you're young and like going out, enjoying fine dining,  entertainment, or the arts, forget about it.  That's not to say that these things can't be found,  but they're indeed a rarity.  People have said ""cost of living,"" but that's not entirely accurate. Housing is a little cheaper,  but grocery and other services are on par  with Tucson or Phoenix.   Don't expect a big difference there. 

The community is largely military, agriculture, snowbirds/retirees, and Mexican American.   People like to buy quads, stick political flags on the back,  and drive them over sand dunes like they're marauders in a Mad Max film.  If you're into this,  it might be right up your alley,  but if Geriatric Fury Road sounds silly to you,  you may not enjoy the local ""culture"" as much. The Big Ag culture can be a little unnerving, literally. My family and I live close to some fields,  which seemed a little country-romantic at first,  but they spray the fields with loads of chemicals day and night.  Many of these chemicals have been found to cause nervous disorders such as Parkinson's.   If/when it rains,  some of those chemicals wind up in the water table, so water quality here is awful.   Without a good reverse osmosis system,  the water is basically undrinkable. Fortunately,  it doesn't rain more than 3-4 times per year.  As a result,  the chemicals are in the fine dust particles which are blown around in the air by strong winds because,  as we covered, there are fields everywhere and very little vegetation to slow it down.   Some days here are reminiscent of the Dust Bowl Era.  On those days,  if you take your AQ device outside,  you'd be shocked to find it unbreathable.  

There are places you can live which are positioned further from the fields,  but not too far because fields and factory farms surround the city on all sides and throughout.  When they're not spreading chemicals, they're burning excess.  It's dusty, windy, smokey, and hot,  so most people hide indoors,  particularly from May to October,  so it's no surprise that obesity is a major issue here.   It's not just due to inactivity either.   Public transport isn't great and to say that Yuma is a bit of a food desert is an understatement.  If you like junk food and shopping at grocery stores like Fry's, then it will be right up your alley.  But if you're more of a Trader Joe's type, forget it.  We don't even have one of those here. 

Yes,  Yuma is considered good for families,  but based on the aforementioned environs, you may want to consider what type of life it would be for your children.   For example,  in our previous city,  our son was attending swim school weekly.  His skills were coming along nicely, but after moving here we discovered that there are no comparable swim schools, only instructors that can either come to your house (if you have a pool) or meet you at a public place for exorbitant cost. Education in general is average, and schools exist, but few are highly rated. 

I could go on,  but this just about covers it.  There is a reason that Yuma is considered a transient community.   Most people use it as a stopgap or stepping stone into other positions & places.  Outsiders typically only stay for 3-5 years at a spell.  Most of that time is spent trying to get out of Yuma. It's about 3-hour drive in any direction to any point of interest (Tucson, Phoenix, San Diego, Rock Pointe, etc.)",t2_dixde,thecwestions,0,1640289299.0,0,t1_hppypb3,hppypb3,True,TheBuddhistTraveler,t3_rn1n69,https://www.reddit.com/r/yuma/comments/rn1n69/relocation/,Relocation,/r/yuma/comments/rn1n69/relocation/hppypb3/,14,r/yuma,1,14

"There’s a chance it was a deorbit burn of the second stage that launched the Starlinks. Im not sure how quickly after deployment of the sats they do it, but if it were overhead the second stage MVAC engine burns are clearly visible at night. I watched SpaceX’s DART launch (it came out of Vandenberg SFB north of LA) the prior week from out in the desert and it was still visible here a couple hundred km up and well off the coast of Ensenada. Also could have been just the cold gas thrusters on it stopping the spin they use at deployment if it was still backlit by some sunlight.

"Ha, classic YRMC. The management at YRMC is absolute dog shit and they can get away with this because they are the only major hospital in the area. They abuse their medical staff and allow unsafe patient to nurse ratios. I’ve heard from some of my classmates (I’m in NAU yuma nursing program) that their nurses they follow get 7-8 patients per shift. Also they have “overtime pay” which they have on paper but in practice they will send you home just before you hit that overtime hour, even if they are understaffed just so they don’t have to pay you. They are so cheap they don’t even have proper Foley catheter kits for the patients. Nurses have to go run around looking for equipment and even resort to taping the Foley to the leg with tape because they don’t have stat locks. YRMC is a terribly run hospital, with amazing staff. Not to mention everything else you experienced. They somehow were able to decrease staff DURING the pandemic and not hire new people.

"I saw what looked like a pyrocumulus cloud, not really a pure smoke column but probably due to the current instability (i.e. thunderstorms in the area) the fire was able to initiate deeper convection.  Looked like it was above a fire on the side of a ridge North of Yuma.  It was in the general direction of the fire (Clip Fire) the other commenter mentioned but seemed closer.

In the satellite loop you can see the fire start on the west bank of the Colorado River and the subsequent ash cloud thereafter.

"The city of Yuma might not have many adventurous attractions, but there are definitely several nearby locations. 

At a short driving distance, you can immerse yourself in the tranquil solitude of the desert. It is actually such a pleasant experience to be in an open space where it seems the advances of humanity have barely left their mark. It reminds one of the simplicity of life and allows one to disconnect from the outside world.

The deserted areas that come to mind are located to the North, along highway 95 and also nearby in California, just to the North of freeway 8, near Tumco  Historic Mine.

If you would prefer to stay within the city, I would suggest  taking a stroll through the historic downtown area. It is nice and you can also walk to the nearby river. 

As for gastronomical places of interest, I would suggest Da Boyz Italian restaurant on main street. The food is amazing and the ambient beautiful! If you love coffee in a historic setting, I recommend North End Coffeehouse. I love that place! If you want a taste of Mexico, definitely visit The Chili Pepper restaurant, it is quite a popular local establishment. 

There are numerous other places I could mention, but hey getting lost and finding new places is an adventure in itself! 

Of course every experience is what you make it, but I am sure you can find yourself a pleasant adventure in the Yuma area!",t2_a17ef7ru,Heart_Naive,0,1633298438.0,0,t1_hfa253o,hfa253o,True,dhowl,t3_q0nfj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/yuma/comments/q0nfj9/is_yuma_a_good_place_for_a_family_vacation/,Is Yuma a good place for a family vacation?,/r/yuma/comments/q0nfj9/is_yuma_a_good_place_for_a_family_vacation/hfa253o/,7,r/yuma,0,7

"As far as I know (and can find) it's still $6 for all-day, and something like $10/day (most recent I can find) if you're doing overnights, though the sign has always said ""with prior approval""... not sure exactly if that's just so they know for sure which cars are longer-term and maybe put you in a particular section.
