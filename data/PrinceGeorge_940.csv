"Yes and why would you put addicts looking for help inside a former prison, why do you need locking steel doors for youths looking for help, seems like exactly the wrong place for a treatment centre. A correctional facility is designed to keep people locked up, away from the general public, it’s typical not the best place for people looking for treatment. 

What do you mean the city wouldn’t allow it, we have multiple buildings in the city already that offer services to youth, Charlie’s house, AimHi, Nechako Youth Treatment program and so on. The city would jump all over if the province built a youth specific treatment facility, I feel like you’re just spewing nonsense at this point because you absolutely no idea what you’re talking about. 

I will make this absolutely crystal clear for you, the province of BC and BC Corrections does not and will not house adult and youth offenders in the same building. Why can’t you understand how damaging it would be to possibly house youth offenders in the same building as possibly the same people who victimized them, like how do you not understand how this can be a bad idea. I won’t even get into the problems with youth gang members being housed in the same facility as the adult members and how that could cause serious issues. Or we can get into the issue of early institutionalizing of young offenders when put into adult centres, with adult rules and adult settings. PGYCC is very different facility compared to PGRCC, with a very different housing setting.

No, there aren't.  A correctional facility is a special type of building.  

For instance, there is one in downtown Edmonton sitting unused as the remand services were moved to another building several years ago and they haven't been able to find another use for this building.  It will likely be demolished before it is reused.

Further to that, you'd never catch the city permitting such a facility in just any area.

Youth can be sentenced as adults but will remain in youth custody until they become adults, I’ll make this as clear as I possible can, BC corrections does not house adults with youths and for a number of reasons that are so long it’s not worth listing because the idea is asinine. 

PGYCC even though empty serves a very important purpose, it can function as overflow, housing for problematic youths from Burnaby and is the only centre outside of Burnaby that can house youths. It’s also important to keep those youths close to the communities they come from, it’s not fair to the youth from Fort St John to be housed in Burnaby which is 15hr+ drive for any parent wanting to see their child.

"Crime depends largely both on where you live and how used to it you are.

I'm an East coaster who has moved around a bit in the last 8 years (wanted to see the rest of Canada). I moved here to PG about three years ago. In my adult life I've had to call 911 eight times. Twice for medical emergencies for older family members about 5-10 years ago. The last six were all crime related things I've seen since moving to Prince George - most of which were assaults I witnessed in appartment buildings I lived in around downtown (I've moved several times to try to avoid it... It doesn't seem like it matters where you go downtown, even if the crime can't afford to live in the building it'll find a way inside).

PG is a lovely city and there are definitely good people here I'm very happy to have met. That said, I got the go ahead to work remotely and will be leaving PG very soon. Which seems to be pretty normal for a lot of ""younger"" people who moved to PG. Since I've moved here I've witnessed close to a dozen people start work at the company I'm with, move here, spend about 2-3 years here and then go elsewhere citing not wanting to live in PG as their main reason for leaving.

"My advice to you is to ask about places, even if they say not pet friendly. 

In your message, include a description of your pet, and show that you understand their risks to accepting a pet as a landlord. Demonstrate how you will ensure that your pet does not create issues in the suite. 

Reaaaally talk up the pets positive aspects (doesn’t bark, naps all day, under 30lbs - whatever applies). Offer pet references. Explain to them that you are desperate in this challenging housing market, and tell them how great of a tenant you are. 

In my experience this has had multiple landlords make an exception for me. Granted, I do have the advantage of having a very quiet and relatively small dog. 

It’s always worth explaining your situation and taking a shot. I’ve encountered multiple landlords who say “no pets” in the ad for simplicity, but are actually pet lovers and can be understanding if they believe you won’t cause them problems. Landlords want reliable, courteous tenants who seem trustworthy. Send a friendly message and show them that’s who you (and your pet) are 🙂

Good luck!

"Context: I was born and raised in Vancouver so my ideas of high crime/dangerous city and good transit is based on that. I live in the bowl area. 

Transit: Buses are regular if infrequent; might be 20-40 minutes between buses but they go to the important places like the university or the hospital. I mostly walk everywhere even though I own a car and my roommate straight up doesn't own a car and they're fine. Many of my coworkers bike. 

Jobs: I see hiring signs everywhere. Workers are so needed that the pharmacies here have had to shorten their hours due to lack of staff. 

Crime: Some homeless folks in the downtown area but otherwise I would consider this place far less sketch than Vancouver. Locals have advised that it would be wise to avoid living on the streets with tree names.

"There's tons of work actually, but retail/cashier/etc doesn't pay well, like most places. And housing isn't the deal it used to be.

Crime is definitely on the rise, avoid living in the west VLA area -- basically draw a circle around the intersection of Victoria St. and Milburn Ave, and avoid that zone mostly. There's a ton of homeless people and drug addicts these days, especially around the courthouse downtown, far, far worse than it's ever been. After the big fire years of 2017 and 2018 we had a lot of refugees move here that just stayed. But overall it's not an unsafe city.

Public transit is decent, and services most areas, but service is infrequent. However, it's certainly functional. PG is very broad and spread out, however, and very driving-centric. But if you live in the ""bowl"" area (ie: not in one of the on-the-hill suburbs of College Heights or the Hart Highlands) you can get everywhere easily by bike, even though bike infrastructure is basically nonexistant (ie: sharrows).",t2_4jm2x,loercase,0,1647197976.0,0,t1_i0iv76v,i0iv76v,True,jennnayynay888,t3_tddnhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/princegeorge/comments/tddnhc/thinking_of_moving_to_pg/,Thinking of moving to PG,/r/princegeorge/comments/tddnhc/thinking_of_moving_to_pg/i0iv76v/,8,r/princegeorge,0,8

"Until last year Camp Trapping was an alternate resource for these youth. A big reason there is a decrease in youth at the centre is because Trudeau made changes to the Youth Justice Act. Harder to convict kiddos and more options for care outside of a custody centre to address factors contributing to “criminality.” (We have two other FTAPS in town, used to be three with Trapping). It’s important to keep it for the youth who do get sentenced so they aren’t housed with adults. Lots of great work being done there despite small numbers.

"We had been looking since November. There was basically no inventory in November and December. 

In December we offered on one house and offered about $20k over and didn’t get it - there were at least 7 other offers. 

In January more stuff came on the market and it went absolutely bonkers. We offered $50k over on a small (less than 1,000 sqft) house and didn’t get it. We finally got an accepted offer when we offered about $60k over asking and there were about 5 other offers. 

Go get an account on [honestdoor.com](https://www.honestdoor.com/) and take a look at what things have sold for (it doesn’t show the listing price, so you would need that info from whatever MLS service you’re using). If doesn’t need tons of work and it’s not in a bad area, most things in the $350-450k range are going for $40-60k+ over asking and are “selling” on the day they start accepting offers.

"Honestly you are 100% right about this being a particularly popular movement among christian nationalists. Coming from that kind of background (most of my family are so religious I would genuinely consider it a cult) I am very familiar with the general concept of the rapture and antichrist. This is something that has been brewing for a while, the general belief is that the rapture is near and everything going on in recent times are signs of that. The UN is a sign the antichrist is coming/already here, the vaccine is the mark of the beast, the virus is just a device for satan exerting more control over Christians, you get the picture. Its why a lot of the convoy are completely blind to reason.

You're correct that people shouldn't be swept under the rug. What is happening is that Prince George seems to be the collecting area for the region's homeless. In turn we are seeing an increase in crime and an extra strain on emergency and city services. This extra strain is causing increased costs to businesses because of breakage and theft. It is also having an effect on our property taxes. It's unfair for the tax payers of Prince George to be paying for these increases caused by the influx of homeless people.

"Good. I'm getting tired of theses anti-mask, anti-vax morons that are so self entitled they have zero regard for what others may be dealing with. I see them coming in more and more where I work. We've gotten complaints from other customers. On top of not wearing a mask for their 5 minute trip into a store, they refuse to social distance. I'm constantly trying to maintain social distancing and it's a losing battle. If I'm trying to get an item for them, they are practically glued to my back. 

I have health concerns myself, to the point that if I get a bad case of covid, it's game over. I live with, or frequently see (core group), family that have health issues. I do not want to chance getting covid and unknowingly pass it on to my elderly father, or my niece and nephew, one of which is too young to get vaccine.

All this ""freedom convoy"" is, is an entitled, self-important screaming tantrum. ""The mandates/masks/vaccine inconveniences ME."" ""MY life it disrupted."" ""I want to go to the movies/bar/restaurants again.""

Then there are the ""let our children breathe"" signs. I have a nephew who is severely asthmatic. He wears his mask everywhere he goes, all day at school. He can breathe just fine. Masks do NOT interfere with breathing. If you ""can't breathe"" it's all psychosomatic. Learn anxiety coping techniques, put your mask on and act like a decent human being.

Don't misunderstand, I'm pro-choice. If you don't want to get the vaccine, don't get it. But wear a mask when your out and about and **DO NOT EXPECT THE SAME LUXURIES AND PRIVILEGES AS THOSE THAT ARE VACCINATED.** 

There are options for getting the necessities, curb-side pick ups or deliveries. Going to bars/clubs/restaurants/movies/concerts, those are **luxuries.**

"Here is the serious question you can ask everyone
posting support for the ""Freedom Convoy""
If the Freedom Convoy is just about truckers'
opposition to vaccine mandates, why is it being fear-
headed / fundraised / lead by these three NON-
truckers?
1) Tamara Lich - Sec. of the Maverick Party - a far-
right Western Secessionist party with strong ties to
white nationalism. She also has direct ties to the
failed ""Yellow Vest"" movement. It's her name on the
$4.5 million Kickstarter for the convoy.
2) Patrick King - A known and avowed white
nationalist who was recently pushed aside by Ezra
Levant, and the alt-right movement in general, for
being too extreme.
3) Ben Dichter - anti-vaxxer alt-right politician who
posts ""Crusade Against Islam"" videos.
These are not hangers-on. These are some of the
direct leaders of the convoy with a major hand in it's
creation / organization.
So before you start passing around the Convoy

supporting. The most important part of a snake is
the head.

Cash reward for its return. This cup is rare, there is likely no others in town and definitely not in new condition like this one as it was discontinued years ago. It was an extremely thoughtful gift out of love, it’s not just a cup.

**UPDATE #2**

After dozens of shares across several groups and thousands of views on Facebook my cup was turned in anonymously to the student union and handed over to security. It smells very heavily of bleach so someone got shamed into returning it.

"Good question.  I think I still would.  I say that mostly because the rental market has gone insane the last few years as well with all the work on the pipeline.  It will probably be better for you in the short and mid term to buy rather than rent.  

When it comes to the long-term, all bets are off, as it's hard to say what will happen to the rental market once the pipeline work is all done.  

A side note, if you are planning on buying in the near future, definitely go for the fixed rate mortgage as the Bank of Canada could do between 2 and 4 hikes this year alone.

On the other hand, there's a lot of talking of upcoming recession which could lead to housing market crashes at the moment (January 2022, in case anyone is reading this later), so buying at the moment could also be risky as no one wants to have a $400k mortgage and a house worth $250k in X number of months....  if you've got stable work and the down-payment handy though, this could also bring a wicked sweet buying opportunity too.",t2_zhrqo,Rymanbc,0,1642919982.0,0,t1_htunrt9,htunrt9,False,akurjata,t3_e4ck0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/princegeorge/comments/e4ck0e/the_moving_tovisitingwondering_aboutbest_of/,The Moving To/Visiting/Wondering About/Best Of Prince George Mega-Thread,/r/princegeorge/comments/e4ck0e/the_moving_tovisitingwondering_aboutbest_of/htunrt9/,2,r/princegeorge,0,2

"I've seen a few posts like this lately. I don't know if any of them are legit, but as I am a firm believer that there are many, many things in this world that we can't even begin to explain, I would not be surprised at all.

That said, a couple of weeks ago I was heading to my bus stop to go to work, around 9/10 in the morning. I catch the 55 near Tabor. Which is why I am mentioning this, one of the posts mentioned the Tabor area. Anyway, I was maybe a half block away from the big wooded valley area on 5th, between Ospika and Tabor, next to the RCMP building, and hear this god-awful screeching. I have noise cancelling earbuds and heard it over the podcast I was listening to. There were about 3-4 of these sounds, then nothing. I know it wasn't just me that heard it because there were a couple of people shoveling their driveways, that looked up at the sound and towards that area. 

I know the area dips down to a small valley, and on the other side of 5th they have had bear awareness signs up in the past.  But it didn't sound like a bear to me. It sounded more like an overly dramatic husky crossed with a banshee and fighting with a cougar.",t2_3ke5ycw4,snwlf1,0,1642867959.0,0,t1_htr9apt,htr9apt,True,the_man_stan_,t3_sa0sh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/princegeorge/comments/sa0sh8/strange_creature_in_the_city/,Strange creature in the city,/r/princegeorge/comments/sa0sh8/strange_creature_in_the_city/htr9apt/,5,r/princegeorge,0,5

Esslinger recommend them to us when they were full up and BST knew right away which brake pad/rotor was the issue after a quick test drive (which turned out to be the opposite of the one I thought it was), found it was rusted, cleaned up the rotor, and it was quick and cheap fix.

They asked if it was sitting for a long time, but its used everyday. After a investigating what might caused the rust, we figured out that it was because the sprinkler at night was spraying the side of the vehicle a little bit.

"When I moved here in 2018 I had a great experience with getting an out of province inspection. 

Thought I’d go back to get a van I’d recently purchased looked over (am converting it). The van is from an old job I worked and was regularly maintained, inspected but I wanted to do my due diligence. 

They quoted me 10k worth of repairs, asked me if I wanted to book in for it, without even offering to go over the work order with me. The said that my signal lights weren’t working which I knew was false because I check them before I drive. That was a huge red flag for me. Like why make that up?

The parts they wanted me to use had a napa auto parts SKU, which I used to look up prices directly through Napa with the exact same parts. Every single part they quoted me had been doubled (or more) in price. PLUS a service fee. 

I had brought it in and mentioned I had two main concerns (abs kicking in when not needed) and to look at the battery indicator. They did not even look at either. So my beef is, why lie about indicators, why price gauge me without even explaining it to me, and why not address my two main concerns? I am a female and went by myself and really felt like that was taken advantage of. 

Took it to Canadian tire and they sorted the abs piece at legit a quarter of the cost and  they were able to diagnose the battery light. I was able to replace the alternator myself because of this and for significantly less. 

As for the other 9500$ worth of work I was quoted? Turns out wasn’t necessary.

So I was all “sure go for it” expecting to pay whatever the usual markup would be for the (pretty inexpensive) part from wholesale.

They invoiced me something like $35 labor (can’t remember exactly what) plus the part price. I called them on it at the front desk, and they all seemed sheepish and the guy removed the “labor” cost.

"I can understand that. When I first started cycling I would have supported bike paths. I was scared to ride on the road back then because I kept having bad experiences when I rode in traffic. Over the years this has changed for me as I learned better techniques.

A few things to think about: Road maintenance is usually better than bike path maintenance. So bike paths are likely to accumulate crap that would be swept away if on a road. When I ride on the road I behave like other traffic so am treated like other traffic. Bike paths often put cyclists in an unexpected position at turning and crossing points. I think this increases the likelihood of an accident.

Thank you for this thoughtful and erudite response. You hit the nail on the head.

>when I applied I was likely the most qualified but, I also have to wonder if I was a token to fill a quota""

And this is why, under most circumstances, equity (equality of outcome) will fail miserably. Equality (equality of opportunity) should always come first, and in most cases, should be one of the the only benchmarks.

I recall reading this one study done on blacks in the American South, who were leveraged by equity into positions that they normally wouldn't have gotten both due to their education/experience _as well as the prevailing racism._ What made a lot of them eventually leave/quit is that they hadn't been promoted due to experience, but rather because they ticked off a box on someone's equity balance sheet. They were moved into that position without the underlying experience and fairness of process that would allow them to thrive in that position. The fact that they were a diversity hire only made the situation more untenable, both through other's assumptions made of them, as well as their own internal imposter syndromes being enhanced by a lack of experience reinforcement.

Your friend's doubts is why equity will _always_ undermine those being helped. Only a combination of true equality from step one, buttressed by a clearly meritocratic system, will provide them with the confidence and self-assuredness they need to thrive.",t2_5cymt,rekabis,0,1641240230.0,0,t1_hr461fj,hr461fj,False,rekabis,t3_pdh3dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/princegeorge/comments/pdh3dr/review_of_prince_george_schools_finds_clearly/,Review of Prince George schools finds “clearly discriminatory and systemically racist” practices,/r/princegeorge/comments/pdh3dr/review_of_prince_george_schools_finds_clearly/hr461fj/,1,r/princegeorge,0,1

"Question: If the main crimes in PG are break-and-enter crimes, are the victims mainly businesses or residential homes? 

I know PG citizens might roll their eyes at yet another question about safety in the city. And I do apologize.

A (good) job opportunity in PG has presented itself and I am in the process of considering the different factors associated with a possible relocation.

I am at the stage of my life where I have long felt sick of moving around, and want the next place to be a more permanent home. Therefore, if I do decide to move to PG, I hope to purchase a (preferably detached) home at the earliest and reasonable opportunity.

I have heard that the main crimes in PG are break-and-enter incidents. Do such criminals usually target businesses? [This article](https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/local-news/prince-george-rcmp-investigating-sudden-string-of-break-and-enters-to-downtown-businesses-3372049) seems to suggest so.

Or, do they also target residential homes (as in detached houses)? This [CBC clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShWbM5abw84) shows two residents in PG. One of them complained that her husband had to sleep with a baseball bat and that homeless people had been in their yard. The other one complained that she felt imprisoned in her own home (because she felt unsafe going for a walk by herself). I know that those were in the specific context of a homeless camp set up near their area. But in general, how prevalent are such sentiments? Do residents in PG regularly (if not constantly) feel threatened that criminals might break into their homes while they are working, sleeping, or just chilling in their own home?
