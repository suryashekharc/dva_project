"I am new to the SR area but know SF public trans really well. I think getting to golden gate park on public transportation is not feasible unless you really like the (long) experience and it wouldn’t cost less than gas. 

Taking the smart train to the ferry to the n Judah train would work but take forever. You could also take a bus from the end of the smart train i think, or take the 101 bus to the GG toll plaza and switch to another bus or Lyft from there.

Conceptually you are kinda trapped into going from a spoke to a hub to another spoke - the system is not set up to do spoke to spoke well. There might be some special way a longer tenured local knows.

I am a public transport champion but I would just drive. Parking isn’t too bad depending on when you choose to go. Queue up some soothing podcasts for any pending road rage.

"Healdsburg is a cute little town. It's pretty central to Sonoma County.  I'm a big fan of the coast, so I always recommend going from river rd to jenner.

Then you can be a real tourist and go lose some money at the eyesore casino on your way to Sebastopol rd where you will find the best Mexican food in the world. 

All this can be done in about 100 miles, which is pretty cool. 

Lake Sonoma is great for camping.

"I would start with having Harmony in Graton test the soil. They have a handout that describes how to do the sampling and you can spring for the basic (50ish) or the deluxe (150ish).

The folks there know a fair amount and they can also definitely recommend further expert advice. 

Then you can hire a landscaper to do the improvements or you can DIY. I have fruit trees at my place in west county and was a vineyard manager for many years and I can tell you almost every property needs organic matter, either through cover cropping or direct addition, and gypsum, which improves the soil structure and promotes good drainage. there are more specific recommendations for specific sites, especially if the pH is weird or there’s a serious excess or deficiency of some mineral/nutrient, but that will get you 80% of the way there.",t2_5hn7si24,Easy_Quiet_9479,0,1646841079.0,0,t1_hzzfyjt,hzzfyjt,True,phatsystem,t3_taacvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonomacounty/comments/taacvu/soil_expert/,Soil expert,/r/sonomacounty/comments/taacvu/soil_expert/hzzfyjt/,10,r/sonomacounty,0,10

Willys in healdsburg is one of my favorite starting spots before going out for drinks in healdsburg. There a multiple tasting rooms in town but if you want to go to the actual wineries dry creek road has quite a few. However I am unsure of tasting room hours on weekdays. Elephant in the room bar is on the south end of town if you want a more mellow place to have drinks. They don’t serve hard alcohol though. About 10 minutes north is Diavola pizzeria and geyserville gun club bar.(same owner) I work at Diavola and both menus have a wide array of great food.

This really became practice for a lot of places in early 2020 during Covid. Be sure to make sure they are open before arriving. Also don’t try to do more than 3 wineries in a day.

Healdsburg  borders 3 wine AVAs, Dry Creek North & West (Great Zinfandel), Alexander Valley East (Cabernet Sauvignon), Russian River South SW (Pinot Noir and Chardonnay). There are MANY great places to go taste there, just make sure they are open. A few of my Favorites are: Simi, Breathless, Truett Hurst, Soda Rock, Seghesio.

"Teachers are awesome.  I know many who teach in this district, they put their own kids in the district schools which shows the level of confidence they have.  Most parents are very happy, elementary schools are where most of my friends are and they have really exceptional school cultures of inclusion and restorative justice.
  
That being said, the current superintendent has the teachers on the verge of a strike, possibly as soon as next week over disproportionately low wages compared to the rest of the county and state.  A report was just released by a neutral third party arbitrating the disagreement that says the district can afford to give the teachers significantly more money than the district has offered in negotiations, and the superintendent is now trying to spin it to parents that teachers will be responsible for program cuts and are being unreasonable.  The report says that despite multiple extensions, and high priced lawyers, the superintendent and district bargaining team couldn’t or wouldn’t provide basic financial information.  It’s not a big leap that they were either intentionally withholding budgetary info, or are so incompetent they couldn’t provide it.
  
So, good place for kids, not a great place for teachers right now, but you know the teachers care about the kids and love the district and believe in its schools, otherwise why would they stay and fight for this instead of just leaving en masse?",t2_fpcoq,speshuledteacher,0,1646496313.0,0,t1_hzgprhh,hzgprhh,True,Good-Swordfish-7503,t3_t75j6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonomacounty/comments/t75j6y/cotatirohnert_park_school_district/,Cotati-rohnert park school district,/r/sonomacounty/comments/t75j6y/cotatirohnert_park_school_district/hzgprhh/,3,r/sonomacounty,0,3

"I’m not that upset with the PD as yet- mostly just the BOS for not having taken action yet (though I am hopeful action is taken after Tuesday’s BOS meeting), and disgusted that Mase has created this spectacle and continues to lie instead of just resigning quietly and with dignity. She’s a distraction and she knows it. But apparently doesn’t care.

Also~ Remember that Reddit skews way left- that’s why you’re getting all the hate here. And actually… you’re not really getting much “hate” just a few downvotes here and there from people defending a drunk and a liar. 

Just take a look at the Facebook comments on Supervisor Linda Hopkins’ page, and the PD comments on the latest Mase article: people want her GONE.

Reddit is great in many ways, but is a waste of time in getting some (probably ultra liberal) people to gauge the Mase situation in a reasonable fashion. & I myself am a Democrat but I won’t stand for blatant lies, crimes and cover ups by a public official.

"I was wondering the same, then remembered… It’s Reddit! 

I think Reddit leans heavily towards the left in many respects, which is fine…

But I think sometimes the “wokeness” of this particular situation, what with Dr. Mase being both Indian and female… a lot of people want to give her a pass, and then resort to the usual accusations or just assumptions of racism and sexism for those of us who want her out. 

I think there is also a lot of other people who want to downplay the DUIs because she’s done a “good job” battling COVID- this also misses the point. 

This is not a referendum on how well she did or didn’t enact restrictions pertaining to Covid. Some people disagree with how she did it, other people like it. 

This is about her ability to lead and have credibility. 

I think there’s a lot of people confused about what it means to be a health Director and how it is a leadership role. I’m not a big fan of people who drive drunk, much less people who get two DUIs. Do I think the average private citizen should lose a job for a DUI where no one was injured? Usually not unless the job involves driving maybe. 

However, this is not a private citizen. I think a lot of people are forgetting that.

"Like I said in the other post we were talking on, I’m not supporting her, but people like her.  She is currently on deck, and someone will come after. 

Here’s my life experience, and why my perspective is different.   

An alcoholic killed my brother.  Good lawyer and a bright future got the young guy off without any punishment.   My parents overheard the doctor ask a nurse about my brother.  The nurse said DOA, and that’s how my parents learned their son was dead.  That’s traumatic. My mom couldn’t cope with loosing her only son, and later became an alcoholic.  I grew up with it, and she drove drunk with me in the car.  Got caught, my dad let her spend some time in jail (day or two).  When she got out, she said enough and the courts imposed a lot of restrictions and treatment.  She followed it all, and didn’t touch a drop for 20-years.  One day, she was curious, and had a sip.  She felt nothing, and wanted nothing to do with it.  What she had been trying to numb didn’t need numbing.  She had her rough spots, but she was a great mom.  She loved me, and she tried so hard to be everything everyone wanted.  She got to be herself eventually. 
The driver who killed my brother turned into an alcoholic too, ruined his marriage and left town.  I have no idea what happened to him.

That said: I do have to agree with you on this one. I was completely gob smacked to read from the editor that there were so many people supporting Dr. Mase.

It kind of seems like the editor is more concerned about being accused of racism and smearing the doctor, rather than being concerned about the fact this took so long to come to light.

Complete lack of investigatory competence, in my opinion.

I would love to get an honest count of the number of citizens who want her out of here for what she did, versus those who support her and think she should stay. I can guarantee that those who want her out will greatly outnumber those who think she should stay.

I have no idea why it took so long for this to come to light, and at the end of the day, it wasn’t even the press Democrat who uncovered, initially investigated this. It came from some random anonymous tipster?

*But on Saturday, Godley took his family “to enjoy an otherwise abandoned, unnamed beach,” the Press Democrat reported. Photos of the trip were posted to his Facebook page with the caption, “Road tripping up the coast. Beautiful drive and nice views. Family beach time together. Grateful for fresh air and the ocean.”*  
  
*Godley has since apologized for the lapse in judgment, telling the Press Democrat, “I own this.” But his violation of the county’s strict shelter-in-place guidelines has rankled some residents of the Northern California community, while igniting a debate about whether those on the front lines of the global pandemic deserve an occasional pass.""*

Original Comment: Text from portions of PD article:

“As the delta variant was quickly spreading across Sonoma County last summer, Dr. Sundari Mase — the county’s health officer who had led the local battle against COVID-19 — was convicted of misdemeanor reckless driving with alcohol involved after pleading no contest to the offense, according to court records reviewed by The Press Democrat.

The July 23, 2021, conviction stemmed from a Dec. 2, 2020, arrest in Alameda County on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol with a prior offense. Mase had previously been arrested in San Diego on suspicion of DUI on May 20, 2014, public documents show.

Details of the San Diego case were unavailable. A court official there said Friday the misdemeanor case had been dismissed and expunged in 2016. However, the 2020 case contains references to it.

At the time of her arrest 14 months ago, Sonoma County remained stuck in the most restrictive tier of the state’s reopening plan, preventing businesses and their customers from joining the resumption of public activity that was occurring in other parts of the Bay Area

Mase, 55, initially faced two separate counts related to the December 2020 arrest: a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol with a prior offense; and driving with a blood-alcohol level above .08 percent, the legal limit in California, with a prior offense.

She had a blood alcohol level of 0.14, according to court documents. Mase pleaded not guilty to both counts.

The Alameda County Superior Court records show Mase later pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of reckless driving with alcohol involved.

She was given a year’s probation, which ends July 23, 2022, and fined $530. Mase also was ordered to complete a six-month DUI course; not to drive unless licensed and insured; not to drive “with any measurable amount of alcohol” in her system; and not to refuse a chemical test if asked to do so by a peace officer.

Court records show Mase enrolled in the DUI course in August as ordered.

Late Friday, Mase issued an apology via email in response to Press Democrat questions about her conviction.

“On Dec. 2, 2020, I made a very serious mistake,” she wrote. “After socializing with a friend after work hours, I misjudged my sobriety and got behind the wheel of my car. On my way home, I was pulled over and arrested, ultimately resulting in a ‘wet reckless’ conviction…

In her statement, Mase said her actions were “a terrible lapse of judgment on my part, and I deeply regret that this occurred. I have apologized to my family and co-workers, and I want to extend my regrets to the community as well and ask for your forgiveness.”

Key county officials reached Friday afternoon said they were not aware of the matter….

According to a CHP officer’s summary contained in court documents, Mase was stopped in Oakland just after midnight on Dec. 2, 2020. CHP officers said they witnessed Mase driving erratically while westbound on Interstate 80 in Oakland.

They followed her as she transitioned to the eastbound lanes of Interstate 580 and observed her veering over lane lines several times.

Records show CHP officers said Mase “nearly collided with another vehicle” on Interstate 580, while changing lanes into the slow lane. Officers attempted an enforcement stop with red and blue lights and the car’s PA system, but Mase did not stop.

They said they had to instruct Mase several times to exit the freeway, according to the CHP summary.

Mase parked her car at Martin Luther King Way and 52nd Street in Oakland. The CHP officer said he approached Mase’s vehicle from the passenger side and told her the reason she was stopped.

The officer said he could “smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage” emitting from Mase’s car and her eyes were “red and watery,” the summary states.

CHP officers gave Mase several field sobriety tests and said she “did not complete the test as explained or demonstrated,” the court documents show…

Mase was placed under arrest at 12:10 a.m. Wednesday, Dec. 2, 2020, according to the CHP’s account.

About 15 hours later, at 3:30 p.m. Mase appeared in a COVID-19 community briefing, which at the time were frequently broadcast digitally via Zoom…

During the briefing, Mase spoke of the county’s latest COVID-19 statistics, discussed the status of the county’s fight against the virus, and talked about how local COVID-19 testing was ramping up.

She made no mention of the arrest…”",t2_ah1vq6qq,BearsBeetsBttlstarrG,0,1645282592.0,0,t1_hxkzow4,hxkzow4,True,BearsBeetsBttlstarrG,t3_swbrry,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonomacounty/comments/swbrry/dr_mase_dui_last_year_public_and_other_local/,Dr. Mase- DUI last year- public and other local leaders just now finding out about it!?,/r/sonomacounty/comments/swbrry/dr_mase_dui_last_year_public_and_other_local/hxkzow4/,14,r/sonomacounty,0,14

"The thing about masks is, if everyone did it responsibly they would actually work at driving cases way down. The reason they don’t work is because, say there’s a guy and he goes to the store, then the bank, then another store, he’s gotta wear a mask inside each place.

But as soon as he’s done he goes to his buddies house with like 8 other people, from three different households, where obviously masking and social distancing doesn’t happen. One of them has covid, will pass it on to them where they will go to their homes and pass it on to whoever they live with. Then all those people will go to more houses full of people, and restaurants full of people and you can see what happens after and why it spreads so easily.

I’m like you though, I’m over it. My family and I moved to South Carolina with no mandate but surprisingly if you go to any store most people are still masked. I told myself I’d stop wearing it once I got here, but I kind of feel bad about giving covid to some little old lady I’m standing in line with.

"IMO Pacific Market in Sebastopol or Santa Rosa makes some of the tastiest sandwiches around. 

Scroll down on the following page and...

[Check out the ""Specialty Sandwiches""](https://www.pacificmkt.com/_files/ugd/c5e0dc_12ce06e51136483e84ef886f5998d9eb.pdf)

They get their bread from an off-site bakery. The menu items are great (I had a wonderful #4 Florence Ave on Thursday), but the deli case often has off menu sandwiches, as well as the ""Mikey"" which is sort of their always available specialty sandwich.

I just noticed the two markets have slightly different ""Specialty Sandwich"" menus, but they seem to be the same combos with slightly different location-appropriate names.

examples:

\#14 The Mikey $9.99 sausalito turkey, pepper jackcheese, parmesan, bacon, tapatio, & pesto on grilled herb focaccia served hot  
\#4 Fourth St. $8.99 chicken, bacon, swiss, lettuce, coleslaw, pick- les, onions, & thousand island dressing served hot",t2_ej8uy35,KnowCali,0,1644108591.0,0,t1_hvrhfry,hvrhfry,True,gxcxn212,t3_sl1wgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonomacounty/comments/sl1wgw/best_sandwich_place_in_sonoma_countynapa_valley/,BEST sandwich place in Sonoma County/Napa Valley?,/r/sonomacounty/comments/sl1wgw/best_sandwich_place_in_sonoma_countynapa_valley/hvrhfry/,3,r/sonomacounty,0,3

"There is a tale of a lonely housewife who lived out by cazadero presumably in the mid-1800s, who would go out on hikes while her husband was away. It was many years ago that I heard this story (verified online, for whatever that’s worth), but as the story goes she would tell everyone who would listen to her that she knew where to find gold in the area. To people who would laugh at her or call her crazy, she would joyfully produce a little box, which contained a handful of nice sized gold flakes that she claims she found “on a ledge”. I was so intrigued that I searched through old databases for registered gold mines (there was actually one or two in the area believe it or not). I did some prospecting and panning and never found anything but the sand looks right and the Geology up Austin Creek, which through Cazadero, is a trip. Check out Austin Creek State park- about 7,000 acres of backcountry trails that few people utilize. Austin creek runs right through it! Also Google The Cedars- Sonoma County. Thank me later ;) better than gold, me thinks. Helps to have some general knowledge of Geology. Have fun and WATCH FOR RATTLESNAKES in Austin Creek SP in the summer. I’ve never seen so many in my life. Have fun with the hunt and also take the advice of whoever urged you to head to the foothills. You’re sure to hit pay-dirt.

The deeper you are into a city/suburbia, the less your chances of being threatened. I see a lot of suggestions for Petaluma and I think that’s probably the safest bet. 

West Petaluma will be a more fun and accepting than east Petaluma, but significantly more expensive. 

Rohnert park and Cotati are heavily influenced by the local college, which can either be good or bad depending on your perspective. 

Santa Rosa can either be gorgeous and nice, or dark, seedy and dangerous depending on the neighborhood.

Healdsburg and Windsor are both kinda country, kinda fancy. HBG is nicer, fancier and significantly more expensive. It also gets crowded on the weekends. Windsor is home to a lot of cops, firefighters, and nurses.

Sebastopol is wonderful, open, accepting, and very expensive.

Guerneville and forestville are cute and smaller, but you run into potential fire danger when it does finally burn there. Rare occurrence, but can be devastating.

This is just my opinion on the area, and while fire danger is a thing, as long as you’re not out living in an area surrounded by unmitigated heavy fuel loading, you’re probably pretty safe.

"West county has some amazing road cycling routes.  Levi Leipheimer's Gran Fondo attracts thousands of amateur and professional cyclists every year.  The UC Davis Cycling team comes to Sonoma County every January for training camp.  There are epic climbs, breathtaking views, and lots of backroads with very little car traffic.  If you want a place in the center of it all, I would vote Occidental or Guerneville.  

Santa Rosa also has options for long road/gravel rides in every compass direction.  My wife is a former pro mountain biker, and she routinely does 70-80 mile rides from our house.

I've lived in Southern California, and compared to those motorists, the drivers here are pretty reasonable.  The pavement, on the other hand, is some of the worst in the country.

Cyclists seem to love Annabel State Park in Santa Rosa (in terms of mountain biking) I'm not sure I'd suggest street biking anywhere in Sonoma County, the motorists are animals.

Restaurants/LGBTQ+ acceptance seems fairly level across the county\*: above average places in almost every city (though obviously below average as well). Because it is an urban/rural mixture there are obviously going to be conservatives about but they are a minority.  One proxy of politics is that nearly everybody in Petaluma follows mask mandates for example.

Overall, I think Petaluma might be the place to start looking.  Santa Rosa's down town is infamously dead, while Petaluma has something of a night life with things like live music.

"I did this some years back up in Windsor. I can't recall how many channels I got, but it was a surprising number given the distance from the towers in SF. Because of the distance signals are considered 'fringe' and you do need a good amp on your antenna + the antenna needs to be as high as possible. Mine was 30+ feet on our roof and on an 8' mast. 

This far out, signal was really susceptible to seasonal weather, especially summer fog as it rolled in down in the bay and messed with the signals coming off Sutro tower. 

Here's a great resource to help you decide which kind of antenna and what stations/signal you can expect to get.

"Golden Gate Transit used to be a good option. I commuted to SF using Route 76, which started on East side Petaluma and went directly to SF, including the Financial District.

They have suspended several routes during COVID, including 76. The only Petaluma option is 172 (recently renumbered from 72), which starts in Santa Rosa and goes to SF. I suspect this could result in more crowded busses than my experience. After Petaluma, it doesn't stop anywhere until the SF GG Bridge toll plaza, so the commute time is probably the same as the old 76.

In my experience, it took about 75 minutes to get to the Financial District on a typical day, leaving at about 7:30. Coming home could take 90-120 minutes, depending on when you left. The trade-off is that you don't have to drive. You can sleep or read, and I saw many people doing email or other laptop work. (Don't be one of those who gets on the phone. Those people suck.)

She goes by Dr. Nataliya. I used to work for her for four years. I would still be there had I not moved to Oregon. Myself and my family all went there. Straight forward, informative, excellent bedside manner. She’ll let you know what needs to be done, what’s priority (that’s the dentist job) and most of all won’t push you into anything! I mean who the heck deserves or even wants that. Staff is great and hygienist are both gentle and thorough. Office takes cash, Care Credit, excepts all PPO insurance but be sure and confirm which ones she’s still in network with (to avoid paying a bit more.) Best of luck and who knows maybe you’ll end up needing a routine cleaning (prophy) vs deep cleaning (SRP). Just ask if you can use xrays you’ve recently had taken. To avoid paying the cost of x-rays she’ll use your previous FMX (type of x-rays) if they’re less than 5yrs old and diagnostic. You can have them emailed over. To establish a patient of record, X-rays must be taken. Also BWX (bitewings) are normally paid for 1x yr or every 12mo.. just double triple check. But the ladies are happy to do their job and do some research for you if you ask them to prior to scheduling.

2) colder, so people are wanting to heat their homes.

3) higher fuel prices, so people are looking for alternative means to heat their homes.  Hence back to wood.

My biggest advice would be to find a great realtor that knows well the areas you are looking at. Talk to a few and see which one you ""vibe"" with. We got lucky with ours - he came highly recommended from my sister and her husband who bought a house a few months before we did. He was super knowledgeable and available, always happy to answers our questions no matter how stupid we thought they were lol he advised us through 2 offers and we were able to get the second one accepted! The same advice goes for lenders. Don't be afraid to shop around and find one that gives you the best offer. Our lender works often with our realtor, so they had great communication and worked efficiently to get offers together and sent out. 

If you can, chat with neighbors around the houses you visit to get a feel for the community! We hit the jackpot in the neighbor department. Everyone has been respectful, welcoming and just very neighborly. 


Other than that, enjoy the process! It's stressful but so exciting!",t2_esuvlpzh,crispychuurro,0,1638907411.0,0,t1_hnmr4hz,hnmr4hz,True,moopuppy1995,t3_ratb2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonomacounty/comments/ratb2d/advice_for_new_homebuyer/,Advice for New Homebuyer?,/r/sonomacounty/comments/ratb2d/advice_for_new_homebuyer/hnmr4hz/,3,r/sonomacounty,0,3
"Hi there. I’m a Realtor in Sonoma county (specifically Santa Rosa and Rohnert Park) and I’d be happy to look for charming properties for you two.
First off, congrats on saving for a downpayment! That’s a first huge step. The second step would be to talk to a lender and get pre-approved. If you don’t have a lender or haven’t been pre-approved let me know. I can send you names of a few wonderful lenders so you can get the ball rolling. 
Your next step is to contact a realtor! If you don’t already have one, I would be happy to help you! If you do, you’ll want to let them know more about the specifics you posted above. I know you’d love a charming home under 1800 sqft but how many bedrooms or baths do you desire? Is a backyard important to you? Do you want the property to be walking distance from something in particular? Etc… 
You’ll also want to let them know what you don’t want. Some people are not interested in making cosmetic changes to homes. You guys seem okay with making changes but is there something that would be a hard pass for you? 
Lastly once all of the above is finished that’s when we can start house hunting and writing offers! Woohoo!!! 
After that is when escrow starts (typical escrows are approx 30 days until closing day) this is when buyers have the chance to have home inspections and an appraisal. Do know that home inspection are an out of pocket expense for buyer, but they typically cost about $200-$500 depending on the type of inspection. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns! I’m happy to help. 
Cheers!

I imagine in the future they will have a pay station, but I think they are still sorting everything out. Keep in mind they are struggling after all the fire damage and being shut down for so long, and they get less allocation of state money than larger parks - they can definitely use the money. Sounds like there is a lot of work to be done before they can open the bigger trails still.",t2_23pogfk5,butterTwhat,0,1636902309.0,0,t1_hklept8,hklept8,True,leeann7,t3_qtem31,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonomacounty/comments/qtem31/armstrong_woods_is_so_beautiful/,Armstrong Woods is so beautiful,/r/sonomacounty/comments/qtem31/armstrong_woods_is_so_beautiful/hklept8/,1,r/sonomacounty,0,1

"Mauritson opens earliest at 10AM, Bella / 10 Acre Winery is amazing, Porter Creek, Tomas George, Enriquez Estate Winery, and Gary Farrell are usually on my visit list and for wine club pick ups.   

If you want to spend the money, Farmhouse Inn offers incredible meals, Dry Creek Kitchen is nice, but not the same value. 

Here’s a map of the area wineries that I have enjoyed Wine in Sonoma [Sonoma Wine Map](https://goo.gl/maps/ocyBoPitMWond4a77)",t2_evevl,Lucafoto,0,1636820829.0,0,t1_hkgz7k9,hkgz7k9,False,Kase1,t3_qs8518,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonomacounty/comments/qs8518/sonoma_coast_park_or_point_reyes/,Sonoma Coast Park or Point Reyes??,/r/sonomacounty/comments/qs8518/sonoma_coast_park_or_point_reyes/hkgz7k9/,1,r/sonomacounty,0,1
"Well one could easily spend multiple days on the coast of Sonoma (and Marin ) alone.   I'm going to squish into one impossible day. You should pick and choose and plan and NOT do some of this because no sane person could do all this in a day, even with a really fast car!  Some of this may not have cellphone service depending on provider, so study routes when you can.

First off weather.  January can be cold and rainy, or it can be crisp (warm in sun) with clear days. Occasionally cold and grey, but that's more rare.  Depending on weather you may want to choose different things below.  It won't be shorts weather, bring layers and some rain gear so you can sneer at the weather.

I'm assuming you are starting by coming across the golden gate bridge.  Get off at the Highway 1 exit and follow signs to Stinson Beach.  BUT before you go over the top of the mountain, turn Right at PanToll onto the ""panoramic highway. and continue up to the top of Mt Tamalpais. It's a short 15 minute walk to the very top from parking lot and the view is off the charts. (Ok, if not a clear day skip this ).

But don't dally.  Quick hop back in the car and head go back along panoramic and down to highway 1 (skipping muir wood (too busy!!!)) and skip stinson beach as well. (there are some amazing view along panoramic )   Depending on time of day you may want to stop in at Olema or Pt Reyes Station for refreshments.  Your next goal is ""the lighthouse"" at the end of Pt Reyes. This can super windy and foggy and cold, bring warm clothes. Some times of year this is an awesome place to view grey whales migrating (I think January is not one of those times ).  There are many steps here, a quad workout!

Alternate, consider going to Pierce Point Ranch (at the north end ) and find some Elk. Or Chimney Rock to see Elephant seals.  If you want few people and a decent walk, Abbotts Lagoon and beach are good.

On the way you will be going through the town of Inverness where you can find the most over pictured sunken boat the ""S.S. Point Reyes"". (google it )

But we haven't really hit Sonoma yet.  So get moving again. Back through Pt Reyes Station.

Take Highway 1 and head north along the eastern side of Tomales Bay.  Before too long you'll cross into Sonoma County.   finally!

A quick detour to the town of Freestone to visit WildFlower bakery is recommended. All this also can make a loop to the town of Bodega where there is a church famous because of ""the birds"".

A bit further and you'll be in Bodega Bay.   The tip of Bodega head is quite nice ocean viewing if you didn't do the lighthouse at pt reyes.  And seafood along the harbor ""Spud Point Carb Co"" is on the list.

Continue north on 1.  If you want a ""beach"" (nor cal style ) then Salmon Creek is nice.  And there are decent tide pools just north of there (check tide tables, this only works at tides lower than 0 and no big waves ).

Next thing is the town of Jenner (cafe aquatic is there is good ). You might go just a bit past there to look down on where the Russian river flows into the ocean . There are often harbor seals hauled out here.

Now you're going to head inland along the river.  This area started as logging towns, but soon switched to vacations towns in the late 1800s.  My favorite is Duncan's Mills, but many like Guerneville as well.

If you missed Muir wood, then you might hang a left at Guerneville and visit the redwoods at Armstrong Woods.

Since your ultimate destination is Healdsburg, you might want to get on ""west side road""  This is the area where Pinot Noir was introduced to California, and still make some of the best Pinot in California. The really good stuff is hidden away on ridges closer to the coast.

For wine, Dry Creek area is also great, perhaps as a separate day.  As is Alexander valley ( and if you feel like driving Anderson valley too ).",t2_wvhpw,manzanita2,0,1636781509.0,0,t1_hkfdkdj,hkfdkdj,True,Kase1,t3_qs8518,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonomacounty/comments/qs8518/sonoma_coast_park_or_point_reyes/,Sonoma Coast Park or Point Reyes??,/r/sonomacounty/comments/qs8518/sonoma_coast_park_or_point_reyes/hkfdkdj/,3,r/sonomacounty,0,3

"> In July 2020, someone hijacked a county Zoom forum on homelessness with a torrent of racial slurs and images of lynchings.

> Racism in Sonoma County has gotten so severe the county has had to take security precautions to protect its leaders of color, said Board of Supervisors Chair Lynda Hopkins.

Damn.

> “If we want to break down inequitable institutions we can’t just hire people to come in and leave them on their own,” he said. “We must support the work personally.”

Ummmm.... yeah? Do none of our politicians (supposed leaders) have no foresight? I mean, racism isn't exactly a new concept. This kind of ALWAYS happens when you do this with racists.
