"What a hot mess of a story. The property manager is probably someone who was unprofessional and sketchy like that all the time, not just with this tenant, so he has almost certainly abused his position before with others. The property owner had to know that this guy was a suit waiting to happen.

I pass by this property regularly and knowing that it is a rooming house explains why there always seemed to be layabout types milling around it shadily. It's a shame, too, since it's charming architecturally on the outside.

Seems like it would be more prudent to combine the rooming units together into larger flats and rent them out to normal people.

"That's not what I said. Try reading again. Common problem with both political extremes is that when you state a claim, they intentionally mischaracterize with a ""so you're saying X"" when X was indeed not said.

I would suggest that things are not as difficult as most people suggest, especially if you make good life decisions. I understand that's an unpopular assertion.

But if you're going to offer a program or perk, then it should be offered to everyone, not merely to those who breed. Breeding is a choice, not an innate characteristic. So this is a question of favoring parents over non-parents unfairly. And as I suggested in my comment, parents already tend to get a lot of special treatment.

"Here's what I've found after six years of working here and a year of living here:

Asian is overrrepresented in the Falls but nothing I've tried has stood out. I'll admit I don't quite like Chinese food to begin with, but Chen's and Harvey Moys are worth looking into. Avoid Nihao in the Falls Plaza strip mall. Japanese is represented by Sakura and Ninja, both more than adequate sushi/hibachi places. I recommend the bento boxes to get more bang for your buck, the sushi is a tad pricey for the quality. Evies is a Vietnamese place that always seems to be closed when I try to go, so I can't speak to their food quality.

Rosati's, Pepino's, and De Marini's are your picks for Italian. The former two I've only ever had pizza from, and from I remember it's passable. I think De Marini's is excellent though. I'm 50% Sicilian and picky about my Italian, and De Marini's doesn't disappoint.

For Mexican there's nothing but the taco truck that parks at the Mobil station on Appleton and Arthur, which is absolutely authentic, delicious, and affordable. I love those guys. Don't waste your time with Su Casa no matter what anyone on this thread says, it's horrible, Americanized bar food.

Fast food is represented by Kravers, Pops, and Dave's Hot Chicken. Dave's is 🔥. I'm not a sissy when it comes to heat and the reaper sandwich there kicked my ass. I recommend going Super Hot if you like spice, or medium if you don't. Kravers is solid, and Pop's is the closest you'll get to Kopps in the Falls.

Odyssey, Agora Cafe, and B-52 are your Greek places, the type that have everything on the menu. Agora is great for breakfast and is easily best of the three. B-52 is more miss than hit. Odyssey has plenty to choose from but not everything is done well. My rule of thumb for them is stick to the basics (burgers, gyros).

Ally's Bistro is one of my favorite sit-downs in the Falls. They're a non-chain Panera essentially, and they have a roasted red pepper and smoked gouda soup that's to die for.

The Hot House is a trendy and relatively new addition that I haven't tried out yet, but my buddy and coworker tried them and said they were just mid, and they gave his sister food poisoning lmao.

I love eating food and trying new food, so feel free to ask if you need more details chief 👍",t2_9plb0t9q,Sloppy_Steve-o,0,1648258958.0,0,t1_i255udq,i255udq,True,_themajesticwalrus_,t3_tnyoyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/tnyoyq/restaurants_in_menominee_falls_area/,Restaurants in Menominee Falls Area,/r/milwaukee/comments/tnyoyq/restaurants_in_menominee_falls_area/i255udq/,3,r/milwaukee,0,3

This is the exact reason why I try to figure ways out of moving forward with a case on certain charges if I can.. such as drug court, a DPA with probation, etc… Ignorant people like to call it “soft on crime” without realizing the very thing you said yourself: These people who have records (often for minor things but are still “branded”) get tired of trying to do the right thing when life keeps essentially kicking them. I mean why would someone even care about a little jail time / tickets / another charge if the punishment doesn’t mean they’ll lose anything meaningful on the outside (a good job, a nice car, a family, etc). Also as you said this train of thought fixes a lot more than just wild Milwaukee driving. It’s not often you see a someone having addiction issues, a Kia boy, a burglar, someone who assaults another person, etc. with a great job and a stable home life, and that is obviously because people who have these things / CAN look forward to these things do what they need to and keep their heads down and are also more hesitant to react poorly in certain situations. Furthermore, our recidivism rate would significantly drop as well if we addressed some of those root causes like better education, a more stable home through more efficient government programs helping with poverty, and imho biggest of all - addressing the issues people who have a record face when trying to find good paying and meaningful employment because at the end of the day all of these things make a difference… among many other things.

One last super quick metaphorical analogy that could be applied here: There was once a study which was rather cruel in nature, but it showed the difference HOPE has on a life. There were two sets of rats that were separated and then placed individually into small aquariums filled with water (really just empty fish tanks). The water was deep enough to where if the rats stopped treading water they would die. The first group, which had no human intervention, the rats ended up lasting on average (iirc) 15-30 mins before they gave up and drowned. Now you have the other group of rats, who just like group before them, were placed in these fish tanks with water too deep to simply stand up. The difference and the point to take note of here, is that when these rats started giving up and sinking, the researchers would grab them and place them back on dry land for a small recess which included a warm towel and snacks. They were then placed back in the water, where the process of “saving” the rats before they drown happened 5 or 6 times…but after that final rescue the researchers stepped back and stopped intervening. This group of rats went on treading water and fighting for almost  60 HOURS. The only difference between the two groups of rats here, was one group was given HOPE that they’d survive, which made the idea stick in their minds that if they kept fighting, then there was hope they would be saved again! In my opinion it shows something so basic, and so obvious yet people tend to forget, and that is with hope- any animal, including us, will keep fighting if the outlook on life is good enough (or in the case of the rats surviving). Point being is once enough barriers are placed in someone’s way to leading a happy, healthy and meaningful life… it doesn’t matter what bad actions they take because they’ve lost any hope of following the right path one needs to success because in their minds, they’ve tried it again and again but nothing changes - they can’t get a decent job which in turn leans to poor relationships and family life, poverty and not wanting to better themselves anymore (let alone doing good for the community) because what’s the point then? They have nothing so the risk of punishment and losing everything doesn’t effect them anywhere near the way it would with say a happily married and successful father…. Because obviously if you have nothing then what do you stand to lose?

Sorry that was so long and pretty off topic but that little story of hope is how I try to practice law and it guides most things I do, when I’m able to, as an ada. We as a community seem to be much quicker to see punishment done in retribution for something, instead of showing a little grace. ❤️✌🏻",t2_hs9n2sys,inVINcible8119,0,1648256905.0,0,t1_i251kcz,i251kcz,False,JW_2,t3_tnmeey,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/tnmeey/how_would_you_combat_reckless_driving/,How would YOU combat reckless driving?,/r/milwaukee/comments/tnmeey/how_would_you_combat_reckless_driving/i251kcz/,1,r/milwaukee,0,1

"I normally don’t wander into these subs on this account, but as it’s a huge problem I figured I would. Speed bumps have been shown to work on side streets. As for main streets its a lot harder… I know offices like mine (DA’s office) often tell police to issue warnings to someone driving erratically first before ticketing / impounding the car; the reason behind that is it often hurts families / communities more in the long run by taking away someone’s ability to get to work. Its an idiotic circle if you think about it: person can’t afford a tag at the moment but they need to get to work so they keep driving. Well when they get pulled over now they also have a ticket that can’t pay either. It tends to have a snowballing effect on a minor situation. I mention that because it’s often the same reasoning behind why someone doesn’t have a current license (suspended/revoked). It’s one of those situations, where thanks to instances like Derek Chauvin/George Floyd many police departments have stopped pulling people over for minor traffic violations to avoid situations of racial profiling (perceived or otherwise) and having something happen over an expired tag/no license/ no plates. Obviously the down side to not enforcing these types of vehicles is it seems to be those are the vehicles that often do break traffic laws, egregiously at times… so it’s a fine line to walk.

"Ah this argument again.

I love how all the people within walking distance of this mythical ""downtown stadium"" think it was the best idea since sliced bread.

Summerfest daily attendance averages out to about 40k per day, believe it or not the summerfest lots do not hold that many cars, most of it spills out to the surrounding neighborhoods. Think of the crazy traffic and parking nightmare that transpire on the east side every year during Summerfest, now realize that would happen 90 times per year. It would be a disaster.

The stadium is in the perfect place. It's smack in the middle of the metro area, it's got great parking, great access to highways to efficiently move the traffic, it's got great barriers between the nearby residential communities: it's like everything you would want in a stadium location.

Sorry it's not within walking distance for you; though I think you lower east-siders are just mad that you'll lose your parking spot if you have to drive to a game. :)",t2_k4x5jr,The__Toast,1,1648243905.0,0,t1_i2498dz,i2498dz,False,Bourbon_Planner,t3_tnl75p,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/tnl75p/why_dont_the_brewers_have_a_beer_district/,“Why Don’t the Brewers Have a ‘Beer District’?” Milwaukee Mag Feature Article by Adam Rogan,/r/milwaukee/comments/tnl75p/why_dont_the_brewers_have_a_beer_district/i2498dz/,0,r/milwaukee,0,0
"yeahhhh, livestock digestion sounds great in theory, but in practice, swine and cattle already have fairly efficient digestive systems, and poultry is too good of a fertilizer on its own.  This doesn't leave much in terms of caloric value for bacteria to convert to methane.  Also, anaerobic digestion produces low quality gas that either can only be used for heating or needs cleaning before it can burn.  

One ""innovative"" solution I've seen for that was a municipal waste water system I visited hooked their digester up to an old WW2 tractor engine.  Apparently those things can run off of hopes and dreams if you put enough of them in and don't care about efficiency.  They didn't get much power, but it was pretty cool that it worked.

&#x200B;

"3 kinds of people who drive recklessly

1. Young kids in stolen cars who think it's funny, cool, badass, clout etc. Fix that by showing them what a human body does when it's smashed between a car and the road. Help them imagine the physical pain by showing them the faces of death videos.

2. People in a dire hurry. Running late, about to get fired from work, etc. Lots of reasons to be in a hurry.

3. People who don't give a shit. The neighborhood doesn't care , their friends and family don't care , the cops don't care , they don't care.

M&I's lots an unlikely ballpark Bank, others occupy downtown stadium site  
By TOM DAYKIN  
If the proposed Brewers stadium were built downtown -- and that ""if"" appears as insurmountable as Cal Ripken Jr.'s consecutive-games streak -- which property owners would cash in?  
Marshall & Ilsley Corp., the bank holding company, is in the best position. M&I divisions own the two largest lots on the proposed downtown site, according to property records.  
That site is bordered by E. Juneau Ave., E. Ogden Ave., N. Water St. and N. Milwaukee St. Five Milwaukee aldermen this week said it should be an alternate in case problems arise with the location preferred by ballclub management: the County Stadium grounds.  
M&I owns parking lots at the downtown site that encompass 156,999 square feet. Michael Hatfield, M&I senior vice president, said nobody had talked to bank executives about the possibility of a stadium being built on the M&I property.  
Hatfield said the bank had owned the lots for several years, adding, ""I have no idea what the property is worth.""  
Answer: $1.3 million fair market value, according to assessment records.  
The aldermen estimate the entire site's acquisition and relocation costs at $10.8 million. There are about a dozen other property owners on the site, including the Milwaukee Redevelopment Authority.  
One property owner, who asked not to be identified, said there was a movement this fall to assemble the downtown properties for a stadium site. The property owner said that action was apparently taken in case the stadium financing package died in the Legislature, and a downtown site would have been needed to persuade Milwaukee legislators to support the deal.  
The property owner said he didn't know who was behind the campaign, which apparently died quietly after the stadium financing package won approval. The downtown backers, through an intermediary, had discussed paying the property owner a handsome option.  
None of this matters, of course, if Brewers President Bud Selig remains opposed to a downtown stadium.  
But the aldermen who are pushing the site say environmental cleanup costs at the County Stadium site could become excessive, making the downtown site a more attractive option. The aldermen want the city to spend $200,000 on environmental studies of both sites.  
Which raises another question: Is the downtown site clean?  
An environmental study of the Redevelopment Authority's lot has so far found no problems, according to the aldermen.  
But that doesn't answer questions about the rest of the site, which includes the former Gugler Lithographic Co. printing plant -- a possible trouble spot if it were razed to make way for new construction. The building, at 1339 N. Broadway, is now used by the Milwaukee Center for Independence.  
It's interesting to contemplate. But a downtown stadium isn't likely to happen.  
Then again, things change.

But the Brewers didn't want to give up the parking lot revenue by going downtown. It would have been approximately east of N. Water St. near E. Knapp Ave.--where much of the proposed site still remains vacant over 25 years later (while other portions have been developed for the Colonial-style office building that houses Hammes Co. and other tenants and the MSOE parking structure/soccer field).,t2_3t8laeuj,ThomasDaykin,0,1648231698.0,0,t1_i23fb31,i23fb31,True,Bourbon_Planner,t3_tnl75p,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/tnl75p/why_dont_the_brewers_have_a_beer_district/,“Why Don’t the Brewers Have a ‘Beer District’?” Milwaukee Mag Feature Article by Adam Rogan,/r/milwaukee/comments/tnl75p/why_dont_the_brewers_have_a_beer_district/i23fb31/,7,r/milwaukee,0,7

"First of all, thanks for your thoughtful and extensive response\[s\].  I super love it when people engage in good faith.

MPD almost certainly could reallocate their money in order to do more traffic enforcement, so I take your point that it is technically possible.  However, traffic enforcement ends up being bottom rung priority and those officers are often pulled away from their enforcement stations in order to respond to calls of higher priority.  During the special enforcement periods that you mentioned, those officers were not pulled out of ""normal"" use except for extreme circumstances.  One solution to consider is to make Traffic Enforcement a completely separate department from the rest of the police.

As you mentioned, the funding/tax issues that the city/county face from getting fucked over politically make that kind of investment tough.  Where do you cut things from other budgets, you know?

>Which fair, but I'm not saying or implying anything you're talking about so not sure why you're bringing that up to me.

I included those thoughts in my comment because they were related, not so much directed at you, but expounding on my point about the limitations of enforcement when the punishment has no value.  The state often comes up with punishments that are scary to people who have something to lose and totally fail to consider the point of view of those being handed the consequences.

My point about financial penalties vs community service is more about curative action.  If the problem is that people treat their communities terribly because they don't feel invested in them, telling them to fork over cash doesn't inspire investment.  Obviously, you can't force someone to care about anything, but having to spend time doing the practical work of investment might inspire that stakeholder mentality.",t2_nutd4,optimisma,0,1648229130.0,0,t1_i238r3u,i238r3u,False,JW_2,t3_tnmeey,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/tnmeey/how_would_you_combat_reckless_driving/,How would YOU combat reckless driving?,/r/milwaukee/comments/tnmeey/how_would_you_combat_reckless_driving/i238r3u/,3,r/milwaukee,0,3

">  The problem is that MPD simply does not have the budget to make those an ongoing concern, and they absolutely do not have the manpower

I honestly don't buy that. Yes, those resources need to come from somewhere, but to say they can't spare 15 people and cars from another area is kind of a stretch - at absolute worst I can't see things not being a wash if they took those cars and people off other duties and assigned them to dedicated traffic patrol. Sure, response times would suffer - they already suck though, and you're making one already bad problem a little worse to make a different extremely bad problem a bit better. 

> The only way to solve the budget and manpower issue is just straight up throwing more money at the department, BUT the city doesn't have more money to throw and there is no guarantee that the police would in any way spend that money the way the community would want it to be spent. 

I mean kinda. I am a fan of moving some things police do nowadays away from MPD and onto social services/etc, however that ultimately runs into the same problem of the state intentionally fucking over the city and county for political reasons. That's another thing that should be fixed, but is a long term solution. Ignoring short term stopgaps because longer-term solutions are better isn't any better of an idea than ignoring long-term solutions because they don't do anything to help today. 

>Anyway, a lot of the punitive ideas being thrown out aren't actually going to reform thought or behavior for those caught. If you don't have the cash to pay a ticket, you just ignore it- piling up tickets doesn't matter. People with assets to protect care about that. If the threat of 2 weeks in jail just means that you have 2 weeks away from your already shitty existence, it doesn't seem quite like the horror that those of us living cushy lives envision.

Which fair, but I'm not saying or implying anything you're talking about so not sure why you're bringing that up to me. My only point was ""many people drive crazy because they know there is a virtually 0% chance of any consequences for their actions. Some of those people will modify their behavior once it is apparent that they will occasionally be driving past police on traffic patrol"". Yes, some will not and some people will continue not giving a fuck. Which is part of what the long-term solutions are for. 

>SO, I'm on team ""make punitive actions curative."" Let's stop writing tickets that have financial implications, let's use community service as the repayment method. Drive like an asshole down Capitol? Lol, now you get to spend your Saturday picking up all the trash on the boulevard. Blow through a stoplight? You have 2 weeks of crossing guard duty by the school so you can get to know the kids you put in danger.

I mean, by your own earlier logic though, they just ignore it. Or if 20 hours of community service means 20 hours away from their otherwise shitty existence it doensn't seem like much of a punishment. Don't get me wrong, I agree on some of your underlying points regarding financial penalties and in a perfect world, all fines would be a percentage of income/assets instead of a regressive fixed amount. And non-financial punishments would be far more common and would be an available alternative to a fine. Just don't agree with your logic earlier dismissing financial penalties because it won't work on everyone, then using the same line of logic you were disputing in support of non-financial penalties.

Plus you know, you can't write tickets for people driving like an asshole down Capitol or blowing through stoplights without police in place to pull them over in which case we're back to my original point.

"I fully agree that enforcement works to a limited extent.  I won't even pretend that I didn't love the effect of those special enforcement zones.  The problem is that MPD simply does not have the budget to make those an ongoing concern, and they absolutely do not have the manpower.  The only way to solve the budget and manpower issue is just straight up throwing more money at the department, BUT the city doesn't have more money to throw and there is no guarantee that the police would in any way spend that money the way the community would want it to be spent.  I have a lot of thoughts on the predicament of police budgeting if you want to get into the weeds about it because it's fascinating.

Anyway, a lot of the punitive ideas being thrown out aren't actually going to reform thought or behavior for those caught.  If you don't have the cash to pay a ticket, you just ignore it- piling up tickets doesn't matter.  People with assets to protect care about that.  If the threat of 2 weeks in jail just means that you have 2 weeks away from your already shitty existence, it doesn't seem quite like the horror that those of us living cushy lives envision.

SO, I'm on team ""make punitive actions curative.""  Let's stop writing tickets that have financial implications, let's use community service as the repayment method.

"Citing “but the parents are bad” as a reason NOT to materially improve people’s lives is a cop out. Improving lives creates better parents. That’s just how it works. Reducing financial pressures would pay dividends, they’ll have more time to be spent with the kids—to raise their kids, they won’t be stressed 24/7 about paying healthcare bills and working a job for less and less each year due to inflation and stagnant wages. When you’re from an area that hasn’t struggled like some on the north side do, it’s hard to comprehend the effects that generations of poverty and societal neglect have on people.

"I agree that these are all things that need to be done, however long-term solutions are best paired with more immediate-term solutions.

I also believe that a large number of people that drive recklessly not because they don't care about the consequences, but because they rightfully believe there are not consequences. I've driven down Capitol drive from 76th st to mayfair 10 times a week for over a year without seeing a single car pulled over - there simply isn't traffic enforcement of any kind in many areas of the city, even in those that are particularly bad. Therefore, people (rightfully) believe that there isn't consequences for their actions. And the more crazy people drive out there, the more people see other people driving crazy and up their own crazy level.

Enforcement DOES work to some extent - There have been a couple times in the last 5 years or so when they actually set up rotating enforcement zones including on capitol, with 2-3 officers down the stretch I'm talking about. It took a couple days to take hold, but average speed on that stretch was probably 45 before, and about 40 after and instances of people doing the Milwaukee Slide basically stopped, as well as (previously common) instances of people going 50+. And this persisted for weeks after police stopped existing in the area. 

So, let's both work on the underlying causes as well as address the immediate needs. Reallocate resources where you need to in order to get say, 15 patrol cars rotating between different areas of the city in groups of 3 on a semi-random schedule, permanently.",t2_b1k5v,dkf295,0,1648222463.0,0,t1_i22rhs2,i22rhs2,False,JW_2,t3_tnmeey,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/tnmeey/how_would_you_combat_reckless_driving/,How would YOU combat reckless driving?,/r/milwaukee/comments/tnmeey/how_would_you_combat_reckless_driving/i22rhs2/,35,r/milwaukee,0,35

Invest in better public transportation. We need a public transit system that runs frequently and on time so that people don't need to drive. I lived in London for a little bit and public transit was my favorite thing by far. I never had to look at a schedule because I knew that the bus (or train) that I needed would come by in less than 5 minutes (and 5 minutes was a rare occasion). I went 3 months without having to step into a car (including taxis). Public transit needs to go everywhere so you can get to point a to point b without having to walk a mile to get to the next stop.

"In all seriousness, it's an incredibly complex issue that can only be fixed by addressing the root causes, and no one ever likes doing that.

I'm going to venture that people drive like maniacs when they don't care about the consequences.  Pulling people over, arresting them, issuing citations, and seizing their shitty cars doesn't prevent the behavior because they likely already face those consequences in the other parts of their lives and just don't give a fuck.  Who cares if the state takes your license when you would be cool driving without one, anyway?  What's the big deal if the police seize your beater when it only had like 4 months of utility left in it, anyway?  The cops can issue another ticket, but you can't pull blood out of a turnip.

So what do?  Incentivize responsibility by making the barrier to entry for personal success incredibly low.  When you have assets to protect, a life worth living, and feel like a community stakeholder, you treat those things like they have value.  It's a holistic approach that solves a lot more than shitty driving, but it's also hard and borderline impossible to get people of means on board.

Better jobs, better schools, better healthcare, better policing, better services.  Gotta tax people who make a lot and then spend that money on directly improving the lives of people who don't.  Force employers to treat their employees like the value-creators that they are.  Allow people to live lower-stress lives that they want to invest in.  Bring the community's cortisol levels down to a dull roar, y'know?

Or I guess we could clog up the court system with a shit ton of new people whose convictions will create an even higher barrier to entry for personal success, thus increasing the likelihood of repeat offense.

For me, the industrial office park bordered by Selig Dr., 35th Street, Canal St., and the railroad tracks is the biggest shame.

"> Sadly, after 66 years in downtown West Bend, The Exclusive Company is closing.
> 
>  To all of the wonderful people in West Bend we say thank you.  Without you there never would have been an Exclusive Company.  We have loved every minute of serving the West Bend community, and we sincerely appreciate your loyal support over the many years and decades.  Our very first store opened in West Bend in March of 1956.  Though we expanded to other cities throughout Wisconsin, West Bend will always be known as the “Home of The Exclusive Company”.
> The Exclusive Company’s last day of business in West Bend will be Tuesday, April 5th. 
> 
> **But life does go on…and we are extremely happy to announce that downtown West Bend will continue to have a locally owned record store.  Though we will be closing for the final time on April 5th, the following day, April 6th, the store will re-open in the same location as “Beat Goes On Records and More”.**
> 
> **The new owners, longtime West Bend residents Joe and Mary Zaremba will continue with Jessie as manager and the same friendly staff everyone is so familiar with.  Joe and Mary recognize the historical significance of The Exclusive Company in West Bend and will move forward with the same values, quality, and service that you are accustomed to. While we hope you will all fondly remember The Exclusive Company, and the extraordinary man (Mr G) who made it all happen, we know you will continue to enjoy and support your new hometown record store as the new owners carry on the 66 year tradition of a downtown record store in West Bend.

"I just saw one on Ticketmaster for 16 for a single ticket but will probably be gone by the time you see this and can only get 1.

I’d just suggest skimming Ticketmaster, I’ve got some amazing deals recently. Philly I went to for 30 a ticket (with service fees, so like 20 something a ticket). Charlotte Hornets I found for 12 a piece on ticket master (before fees, with fees was like 15-16). Atlanta Hawks 16. Miami Heat I was thinking about and those were in 20 range.
Weekday games you can find some cheap ones, and also if you are a spontaneous, spur of the moment person, it’s kind of fun to ticket watch and see what someone might sell their tickets for 3-4 hours before the game. I was half tempted to get the Wizards ticket for 16, but I already have plans tonight with my grandparents so no replica ring for me 😂",t2_4i3cpq02,Kingriles34,0,1648148889.0,0,t1_i1yud1c,i1yud1c,False,zdiddy987,t3_tmdu1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/tmdu1n/best_way_to_get_bucks_tickets/,Best way to get Bucks tickets?,/r/milwaukee/comments/tmdu1n/best_way_to_get_bucks_tickets/i1yud1c/,2,r/milwaukee,0,2

"Lower east side — close to UWM campus, so you’ll be around other younger people. Close to bars and restaurants on North Ave, also within walking distance of Brady St (Not a bad walk in warmer months). Close to the Oak Leaf trail, if you like to run/walk/bike,which pretty much will take you anywhere in Milwaukee County. Also, you can walk or bike to Lake Park, which is absolutely amazing. And you can walk/bike to the Lakefront. Pretty safe, however at night and being a female I’d walk with someone and try not to walk home hammered. 

Bay view — More of a “hipster” young person vibe. They have great bars and restaurants. Close to great parks (Grant Park and South Shore). Close to the Lakefront. Seems like there is always new things coming to Bayview and the surrounding area. Close to Walkers Point which is also a really cool part of MKE. Relatively safe, but again wouldn’t go walking around alone at night and drunk. 

I would suggest spending an afternoon in both locations. Grab a bite to eat, go to a bar/brewery, walk to one of the local parks, and take in the sights/smells. You can’t really go wrong with either and both neighborhoods have there respective quirks. I am sure you’ll end up hanging out in both neighborhoods regardless of where you live.
