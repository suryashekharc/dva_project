"It is not really scam, but I would not trust. We signed up for something like that 9-10 years about.

If you look on your Pepco bill, you will actually see two bills. One for the electricity you actually used (supply charges) and one for proving this electricity (delivery charges). So, basically, Pepco buy the electricity and sell it. Also, Pepco has infrastructure (wires, transformers ...) that they use to sell this electricity. The electricity market price changes so we sometimes may pay different price. Similar to gas/oil.

Back to these 3rd companies. They claim they can offer constant price per kWh and this price is not impacted to current market price. So, they promise you will pay less for ""supply charges"" because normally market price increases over the time and their price does not. They don't have another infrastructure, so this part of the bill will be the same.

10 years ago we sighed up for something like that and we actually saw some savings for the first 5-6 months, but then something changed. I don't really remember the entire situation, But something wrong was with the cost of the kWh and we canceled that and went back to Pepco.

There is probably something in their contract that you really have to understand.

No one should trust the BOE. This site was put up by citizens who are concerned about busing.   www.moconeighbors.com   I'll give you the short version though.  In Sept 2018 the BOE prioritized diversity as the #1 factor when drawing boundaries and then passed the policy just 11 days later without notifying the public.  This is not in dispute by anyone.   There's a lawsuit that's made its way 2 or 3 levels through the court process based on this and other illegal acts by the BOE.  The BOE's entire defense rests on their claim that they didn't legally need to notify anyone.  Even if THAT was true (it isn't) they were undeniably dishonest about the process.  If you watch the videos on the site you will hear a few BOE members discussing race-balancing the schools (which is illegal).  The only way to do that is through busing.

"Saying ""MC are about to go nuts because they're redistricting all schools over the summer"" is really, really far off (though certainly a pretty good example of the fairly prolific fear-mongering surrounding the issue). Some basic info is below.

&#x200B;

""Many seem to believe the WXY analysis will result in imminent boundary changes, like a redistricting effort recently completed in Howard County, where 5,400 students were shifted to new schools in an effort to alleviate crowding and break up concentrations of poverty.

For MCPS, though, the work — costing approximately $475,000 — is intended to be more of a data-gathering exercise to help guide decisions during future boundary studies, according to school district officials. Boundary studies are typically authorized when a new school is built or an existing school receives an addition and neighboring schools are crowded.

The consultants will not recommend any specific boundary changes. For example, they will not recommend that a group of students zoned for Walter Johnson High School be rezoned to Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School.

Instead, they will provide a synopsis of how MCPS schools are used, their socioeconomic composition and community members’ thoughts about the project. Data will be compared to similarly sized school districts across the country.""

&#x200B;

tl;dr: There is no imminent county-wide mass redistricting. In all likelihood, redistricting will continue to occur as new schools are built, e.g. Woodward HS opening in \~2025 will draw students from surrounding clusters, as will the new Downtown Crown HS to open roughly at the same time.",t2_2korcs,SSer1,0,1580625523.0,0,t1_fg8niux,fg8niux,False,applejackalll,t3_exap0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/RockvilleMD/comments/exap0g/typical_housing_in_rockville/,Typical housing in Rockville,/r/RockvilleMD/comments/exap0g/typical_housing_in_rockville/fg8niux/,3,r/RockvilleMD,0,3
"This is more or less correct.   MCPS was PLANNING to redistrict over the summer but parents found out about it and pushed back.  It'll still happen but it's likely to be a year or two away or be piece meal.  The most important part to know is that the boe changed the way they will draw school boundaries in the future by prioritizing diversity ahead of geography.  That's not to say that they won't honor geography   But if they ""need"" middle class Asian kids in a predominantly poor black school to balance out the demographics and that school happens to be farther away from the Asian neighborhood, those Asian kids are getting bused.  I would definitely think about renting for a year because I think there will be more certainty then.  If you're moving from really far away it will also allow you to learn about the area and spend some time in different neighborhoods.

"Gaithersburg and Germantown will be a good bet. Clarksburg is actually ALOT pricier than most ppl in MoCo (Montgomery County) realize. I moved here from San Antonio but had also previously lived here so I knew what to expect. Housing is very expensive. 

Negotiate your pay higher or look at other places that can afford to pay more. I actually am the COO at a large private practice in Rockville. What type of job are you applying for? I might be able to help give you some more specific suggestions.

In terms of high end restaurants, your best bet is to google that and figure out what will work for you guys. You MUST consider commute times. I live 15 miles from my office and it can take me 35-40 mins to get to work on the highway. Do not assume a place is an easy commute because it’s not that far. I assume your boyfriend might work odd hours bc it’s a restaurant in which case that’s not as significant, but still please consider it. Waze your apartment location options to your job prospects and look at the time of day and expected traffic. A lot of people here lose quality of life over commute times.

"For the most part, Potomac is residential (some townhouses but mostly single-family homes and almost no condos/apartment buildings) and has essentially three areas to it:

1. Rural Potomac - mostly forested or farm land with ""regular"" houses spread out as you might normally find in rural areas.
2. Posh Potomac - exclusive private schools, country clubs, multi-million dollar mansions, etc. Geographically, this area is in between the other two.
3. Rockville/Bethesda Potomac - typical sub-division neighborhoods that border Rockville and Bethesda. In fact, there are neighborhoods where the name Potomac is interchangeable with Rockville or Bethesda. 

Rockville, on the other hand, is much more sub-urban/city-like with office buildings, apartment buildings, shopping centers, etc. Rockville is actually two things, the City of Rockville (which isn't that large) and the mailing address ""Rockville"" which can extend into areas that are usually considered Potomac, Bethesda, Gaithersburg, Derwood, Aspen Hill, and Wheaton. In fact, I think it even goes close to areas that are Darnestown and Silver Spring. The City of Rockville has its own police, parks/recreation department, permitting services, etc. and, I'm fairly certain, it also comes with additional taxes.

Most of Potomac feeds to Winston Churchill HS but it also feeds to Thomas Wootton and Walt Whitman high schools. Some very small sections might even feed to Walter Johnson, Quince Orchard, and Poolesville high schools. Most of the City of Rockville feeds to Richard Montgomery and Rockville high schools. But the mailing address areas also feed to Thomas Wootton, Walter Johnson and Gaithersburg High Schools. Some sections also feed to the Downcounty Consortium (where students can apply to different programs at 5 different schools).

All of these schools are great, but if you care about rankings the supposedly more desirable ones are Walt Whitman, Walter Johnson, Winston Churchill, Thomas Wootton, and Poolesville. The second tier would be Richard Montgomery, Rockville, Quince Orchard, and Gaithersburg with the least desirable being the Downcounty Consortium... but really any of those schools is still going to be a great school.

If you're really worried about redistricting, try and buy in the zone and near one of those ""desirable"" schools, but even then you're not promised anything. Supposedly the redistricting is going to take into account more than just location and it's not like the lines are currently all that geographically intuitive anyways. For example, there's a neighborhood called Horizon Hill which is literally right next to Wootton but it feeds to Richard Montgomery. At least Richard Montgomery isn't that much farther away. One of the worst instances of these maps is a neighborhood called Kensington which is really close to Einstein High School and somewhat close to Wheaton High School (both of which are in the Downcounty Consortium schools). However, that neighborhood feeds to, the supposedly nicer, Walter Johnson high school which is definitely further away than either Einstein or Wheaton. It's so far away, I'm fairly certain the fastest way to make the trip from Kensington to Walter Johnson is by taking the highway (I-495 and I-270).",t2_lwx0,superjuan,0,1579019850.0,0,t1_fedtzdq,fedtzdq,True,[deleted],t3_eol9o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RockvilleMD/comments/eol9o1/potomac/,Potomac,/r/RockvilleMD/comments/eol9o1/potomac/fedtzdq/,29,r/RockvilleMD,0,29
"We lived in Rockville proper, right next to Beall Elementary. My younger brother went to Richard Montgomery for the last two years of high school and my sister started at Beall. Even if those aren't the best schools in the area, compared to Arizona schools, it was like Harvard. Potomac can offer equally or better schooling options, in fact, MoCo has some of the best schools in Maryland, along with  Anne Arundel and Howard. I really liked Rockville and hope to get a job there when I'm done in school. Potomac was known to be a bit snobby and definitely more suburban, but the area is beautiful and quiet. Rockville has way more traffic (355 S is a nightmare), but also more culture, dining, and shopping. That might help, especially if you're moving from Chicago and used to more commercial business.

"I had a young child when I lived in Potomac. I was in a fairly suburban area of Potomac (read: relative to Potomac, densely populated). I lived just off of Falls Road, actually about 5 minutes from Rockville City Hall. It was still Potomac, but in character, it was more Rockville. 

(NB: Be aware the actual City of Rockville often differs from what people commonly think of when they think of ""Rockville"". Beyond that, some of the older homes and residence in City of Rockville are very different from some of the more recent residences that have gone up in the last ~10 years.)

I liked living in Potomac when my son was younger because it was a more stereotypical white picket fence environment. The schools are excellent. (The kids can be a tad privileged, but that's expected.) I work in downtown DC. I made a short drive each day to the Metro and took the Red Line each day (door to door = ~55 minutes one way). 

After I got divorced, I moved to the City of Rockville. It was a smidge more urban. I'd characterize it as being in-between a true urban environment & a stereotypical suburb.

"100%. Montgomery county home prices are dictated by school district. In the case that you were in the Elitist W cluster of schools, you can expect those  single family homes to be over 600k.

But caveat emptor... the current school administration with their new boundary study may shake things up immensely.

I bought 100 dollars worth of gold a year ago and today the administration is telling me it’s worth only 60 dollars, where another guy who bought 20 dollars worth of copper the same time I did has their copper value increased to 50. That’s what’s happening but replace precious metals with homes. So if the boundary line changes do happen, a lot of people will be underwater with their mortgages.

Really no easy solution to this issue, parents want what’s best for their kids, thus the wealthier buy into the ‘superior’ school districts. The very next moment they are told that the money they spent was for naught. Yet, the lower performing schools in the district: Kennedy, Gaithersburg, Seneca valley, Watkins Mill, etc are lagging behind and will continue lagging begging until a change happens.

On the other hand, at some level there is a difference in values. Schools in the lower performing schools usually serve those families without much of an education, those of the lower socioeconomic class. They struggle to get by and may not truly appreciate the value of an education. Those parents who buy into the better school districts usually value education more and will push their kids. They will strive for more. Really though hard to say, I know first hand what a good education can produce.

"Crown Farm is one of the newest developments in the county, and some land was set aside for a new school. The county plans to build a new high school there in the coming decade to alleviate overcrowding in surrounding schools. Any changes to school boundaries always sets off fights with home owners because school boundaries drive home prices and people will be antsy about a new school with no track record yet.

"Potomac can be fairly different depending on what section you're talking about. I've lived in Potomac and Rockville, and the two responses you got here remind me of the parable of five blind men describing an elephant. 

""What's the difference between Rockville & Potomac?"" can be a fairly broad question. In some areas, there's not much difference at all. 

In others, Potomac can be a bit more sprawling and the homes there can be more decadent. (Which is not to say Rockville has busted homes.)

"Rockville (assuming you mean inside city limits) offers a bit more for residents in terms of services but otherwise comparable. Things like trash collection are just a little better. Streets get plowed sooner. City also has its own departments for things like parks and rec but you can still leverage county services. One thing I like is the regulations prevent people from building severely out of place in homes without the typical restrictions you would find with an HOA. There’s a community services division that polices for egregious stuff, but won’t come after you because you accidentally left your trash can out for more than 24 hours.

Also yes, schools in this area drive home prices but I’m 99% confident it’s all about to go through a Yahtzee shaker pretty bad soon. If not too soon, the trigger will be Crown Farm opening. So look at proximity to the cluster high school when shopping since if you are looking at a home that’s closer to a high school than the one you are going to today it’s likely to change. The reality is since you said you were looking at homes priced similar between the two areas, I’m sure the schools on the Rockville side you are looking at are comparable.",t2_b2yrc,FM_Bill,0,1579009887.0,0,t1_fedf81h,fedf81h,True,[deleted],t3_eol9o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RockvilleMD/comments/eol9o1/potomac/,Potomac,/r/RockvilleMD/comments/eol9o1/potomac/fedf81h/,7,r/RockvilleMD,0,7

"Amazed no one has suggested more Asian food to you! Rockville is one of the most ethnically diverse areas of Maryland and we have the restaurant variety to prove it. Here's my recommendations. 

**Teamania** Trendy Asian-European bakery. Has lots of cool flavored breads.

**Bambu cafe** for Vietnamese dessert drinks and surprisingly good Bahn mi. 

**Lighthouse Tofu** for tasty Soondubu and other Korean food.

**Bob's Shanghai** if you haven't had a good soup dumpling yet. Cash only

**La Brasa** for Latin American food.

**Iron Age** if you're feeling KBBQ. It's not the cheapest here, but not crazy expensive either. 

You like hot pot? We have hella hot pot. **K-Pot** (hot pot + kbbq), **Hot Pot City**, **Urban Hot Pot**, **Hot Pot Legend**, just to name a few.

**Sichuan Jin River** for authentic Sichuan. Cash only.

**Kin Imm Thai**, solid Thai. The curries and the beef Pad See Ew are amazing!

If you want ramen, go with either **Maki** or **Akira**.

If you want trendy contemporary American, literally anything in the shopping center **Pike & Rose**. All the sit-down restaurants there are designed to look trendy as hell.

The Asian food courts **The Spot** and **Pike Kitchen** might be worth checking out. Note that they lean more towards Taiwanese and Korean.

**Bonchon** is a chain, but is absolutely worth it if you haven't had Korean fried chicken before. Especially if you don't have Bonchon in your area.

"Rental market in Rockville isn’t super cut throat so you have a good shot at finding something without an agent, especially if you can make a quick trip out here a month or two ahead of time to see things yourself and get a feel for Rockville and the DC area in general.

Porchetta sandwich at Vignola (Rockville) or Gemelli’s (Gaithersburg) is pretty good.

Inferno Pizzeria Napoletana (Gaithersburg) or Frankly Pizza (Kensington) has pretty good pizza.

Cava **Mezze** (Rockville) is pretty good and close.

Julii (Bethesda) is cute and decent when we were there at first open, imagine it has gotten better.

Jose Andres’ Jaleo (Bethesda) is pretty good, but I like all his other places in DC more.

There is a Jewish deli called Max’s (Wheaton) that is very good for lunch. Really like El Pollo Rico within the same block for Peruvian chicken.

If you like bar food, Muscle Bar (Bethesda), Yard House (Gaithersburg), Old Town Pourhouse (Gaithersburg) or Dogfish Alehouse (Gaithersburg) might be options, but service and food can be inconsistent as it is a bar. There are also a bunch of breweries in Frederick if you want to head up that way.

"Best bet is to go to the crab houses in annapolis, crofton, kent island etc. But that’s an hour away without traffic, can take easily double that.

I don’t know of any GREAT crab cake places in Rockville proper. Costal flatts does a decent job, Nantucket Reef was pretty good, Cylde’s ...

My favorite place within 30min right now is up in Frederick called Ragin Reef. It’s small and gets packed so go early if you decide to try it out.

"Can you get a google maps link to the approximate location? Ill look at Flightradar24 to see if there was anything going on there.

Edit:

NVM, found it just watching the time lapse.

It was an AgustaWestland AW139, Registration N381MD. Looks like it's owned by [Maryland State Police](https://flightaware.com/resources/registration/N381MD). Took off from [Joint Base Andrews](https://goo.gl/maps/gabCr5WmGrN4aJit7) at 7:15 am UTC (2:15 am EST). Did a a good bit of [low altitude (\~200m) circling](https://gyazo.com/616380d5d0b5cc3252ad0003186e43a7) (as you mentioned) then was back at Andrews by 8:15 am UTC (3:15 am EST).

Can't find any specifics on why it was there, but given that its owned by state police, it was probably looking for somebody/something.

Thanks for giving me something to do btw.

"I am living in the complex. Working in Bethesda. I am not going out much.

The overall work trip is not bad. I take the 45 RideOn to Twinbrook station and the Red Line to Bethesda. I have seen a person, living in the complex, biking to Twinbrook. 

Uber if I come back late from work. It is cheap if you do it from Twinbrook. 

I will take longer to go to DC though. I do it once a while with my family. But again, I am not going out much. 



I live here because of the price and the in-apt laundry. Also good: ample parking spaces, decent staff, a small gym, lots of trees, walkable to Rock Creek Trail, and large-dog friendly. 

Not so good: trash some time piles up over the weekend, SMALL gym, once in a while dog craps, not hip by any mean, many families live here because of its close distance to the nearby schools.  

It is walkable in my experience, to the Lotte Market or other bus routes on Veirs Mills, harder to walk to the other end of Baltimore Road where Rockville Station is (not sure why you would want to walk there though).",t2_3aj17ik4,walalander,0,1576725062.0,0,t1_fbcj0rx,fbcj0rx,True,[deleted],t3_eckhfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/RockvilleMD/comments/eckhfg/opinions_on_the_forest_apts/,Opinions on The Forest Apts?,/r/RockvilleMD/comments/eckhfg/opinions_on_the_forest_apts/fbcj0rx/,7,r/RockvilleMD,0,7
"I live near there. 

It's generally residential. Not really walkable, though. For example, the street it's on, Baltimore Road, doesn't have sidewalks in stretches. So you'd want a car.

I commute to work in downtown DC every day via the metro. I can either walk about a mile to the station, or take a very short bus ride. So, for me, the work commute is do-able.

Where you are will be maybe an extra 3/4 mile away from the metro. I'm not sure if there's a bus you can take. You could walk, but it'd be a pita walk. A friend who used to live around there and commuted via metro every day used to bike it from his house to the metro station. (If you do that, get a bike locker. Bike theft is a problem.)

On the weekends, I've mostly given up trying to metro into the city. WMATA runs fewer trains on the weekends and/or they're doing construction. I mostly drive and generally stay in Rockville, Silver Spring, and Bethesda. 

You don't say how old you are or whether you're single, but I'm assuming you're late-20s/early-30s and single. And to be honest, for a person like you, I'd recommend looking at a building more toward Rockville Town Center or something. Maybe one of the apartments that are closer to Twinbrook Metro (I think The Alaire is pet friendly).",t2_eg88k2q,neuroticsmurf,0,1576720785.0,0,t1_fbccj40,fbccj40,True,[deleted],t3_eckhfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/RockvilleMD/comments/eckhfg/opinions_on_the_forest_apts/,Opinions on The Forest Apts?,/r/RockvilleMD/comments/eckhfg/opinions_on_the_forest_apts/fbccj40/,4,r/RockvilleMD,0,4

"While awesome, caveat about the MARC from someone from Rockville and now lives in NYC: the timetable is very centered around commuters, in fact there are ONLY inbound-to-DC trains from ~6a-9, and ONLY outbound-from-DC trains (departing from Union Station) from ~1530-1900, and only M-F

I agree it's an great/quicker alt. option to the Metro, (Union station to Rockville in ~25 min vs 45) but definitely not reliable outside of the limited commuter-based schedules

This limited scheduling is probably one of the reasons why even growing up here I had never really heard of / used MARC until returning to the region as an adult and trying to get home quickly during daylight hours 😀

"Lol okay cool. OP was asking for a direct comparison between the cities, and mentioned crime as a concern. 

Yes, some parts are better than others. This is the case with nearly every major city in the world. 

Rockville is slightly below the mean in terms of the crime rate: the likelihood of someone being a victim is 1 in 70. Whereas the same odds in Baltimore are a staggering 1 in 15 for any crime. 

The absolute worst part of Rockville wouldn’t make the average Baltimore resident feel wary, as they’ve likely experienced worse.

It's not like there are gang shootouts on every street corner.

As others have said, although the public transit system of Metro rail/Metro bus/Ride on bus is one of the more decent ones in the country the subway is nothing like NYC where you truly can live without a car. Baltimore also has a subway, but it isn't that great, at least it wasn't. Don't know about the bus system there.

Airbnb sometimes has people looking for long term roommates.

The strange price gauging of different companies. It sounds like whatever far away group that owns the property see it as a money grab, with no care about how its actions affect the local community. I’m sorry if that’s not slum lording idk what is. I am using in the sense of small business relationships. The town center poor quality and reputation is because of that.

"I don't know much about their other properties but I certainly wouldn't call RTS a slum.  It's just been a series of bad decisions that are killing that place.  That whole side of RTS (Gibbs Street) was doomed the day they made it a one way.  For the first year or so it was two-way and got a lot more traffic.  That gave it a busier feel and people went over there more often.  Now it feels like you're going exploring with nothing but assured disappointment waiting for you.

The parking is weird and stressful.  Many people are allergic to paying for parking.   2 hours free isn't enough time to eat and do an activity.

And I still don't get how Federal can afford to leave spaces empty for YEARS.  I think the spot where Mellow Mushroom was has been empty longer than it's been occupied.  And rather than pressure Federal to lower rents so that businesses could survive, the City of Rockville stupidly decided to use taxpayer money to subsidize high rents (through low interest loans to the retailers I believe).

"It really depends on your neighbors and if they report you. RCPD Neighborhood service officers are required to respond to all community complaints if you’re in the city limits, and off leash rules are pretty strictly enforced. It’s standard common sense rules, don’t take your dog off leash in town square or populated areas where people are more likely to report these issues, etc. 

Montgomery County is really big into controlling quality of life issues like off leash and Rockville is the county government center so it has to follow suit. You can apply with the police department for off leash permissions, or inquire with the Animal Services Secretary. There’s information on pet leashes located in section 3-23 of the rules and regulations PDF

"> Meanwhile, Modern Market has closed at Congressional. It seems to have been a victim of Montgomery County's anti-business policies and moribund economy, as its Bethesda location also closed, and Modern Markets outside the County remain open.


Ugh, what speculative nonsense.  It could have closed for a thousand reasons, including the food not being that great, and being in a shopping center already over saturated with fast casual places, many of which target the same customer base as Modern Market. Why not ask the owners for a comment about why they closed instead of taking cheap shots at the county for undefined “anti-business policies”.

The design of Ellington (the one that connects Crown to King) is going to be the cause of more pedestrian accidents. When you're coming down the road it's 2 lanes. But when you get to the intersection at Pour House it's a left turn lane and a half lane for going straight and a half lane for parking. It's so poorly designed! And then you have people crossing figuring out where to eat, looking at phones. Drivers get super confused about who goes next after a pedestrian crosses.

"An anecdotal tidbit when I moved here in 2005, the three 'W' schools are considered really good, best in the area etc (per local real estate agents). Walt Whitman, Thomas Wootton, and Winston Churchill High Schools. 

[Here's a recent list for you, BTW.](https://patch.com/maryland/columbia/maryland-schools-ranked-best-public-high-schools-list)

And the fights over the years in trying to redistrict one school I am familiar with (Thomas Wootton), have been epic in nature. People in North Potomac (actually part of Gaithersburg) are very close to Quince Orchard HS but are bused to Wootton, and continue fighting (and winning) the case for the boundaries to not change.

Thus the schools are very stable - and the borders are crazy.

True story, in my neighborhood with the same development (early 1970's housing stock) literally across the street from each other a friend bought 10 years ago, and she told me identical houses fed into two different elementary / middle and high schools. 

A $50K difference between the houses, just due to the different 'feeder schools' within Montgomery County.

"Nothing major, the usual apartment stuff you're bound to run into. My apartment was on a top floor because I hate hearing heavy walkers on top of me. Early on there was a weird high-pitched mystery noise that took a while to fix. Neither maintenance, management nor I could figure out the source. In fairness, the maintenance supervisor at the time didn't really seem to give a shit and failed to follow up with me. He eventually got fired or quit, not sure of the reasons. The guy that replaced him was better at his job, in my opinion. Anyway, I then noticed that I only heard it after gusts of wind. It turned out it was a rusted up turbine on the roof. Once I figured that out they were able to silence it. However, instead of replacing it they just prevented it from rotating, which I suspect prevented air from circulating in the walls and led to weird smells inside my apartment. 

Overall the apartments themselves are pretty nice in that they're large, nicely carpeted and padded, and have decent appliances. Management is very understanding about the difficulty involved in being a renter with a restricted-breed dog. Maintenance responds relatively quick.  They didn't try to screw me over on my security deposit.

Downsides would be some of the residents feel like they don't need to clean up after their animals and management doesn't clean up after them. I can't blame management on that one, they shouldn't have to clean up after negligent people. So just watch where you walk and get some kind of head lamp or something for nighttime potty trips, because you're going to step in shit at some point.

The school next door is kinda loud depending on the time of year and where your apt. is. The football/baseball/etc games and practices can be loud, but you can drown out the noise with your own. Sometimes kids will pass through or use the building parking lot, but I've never seen or heard of them doing anything crazy or disrespectful to the residents or their cars.

Oh, and towards the end I had a neighbor to the side of me that, a couple times a week, would let his Rotti out onto the porch around 3 or 4 in the morning and wouldn't put her back inside until around 10 am. The problem was that this dog barked at anything that passed by in the parking lot below and as a result, would wake me up and ruin my sleep. I made him aware of it and left a signed note on his car with my name and apartment number. We talked in person the next time I saw him and it seemed like he got the message. He did take offense to the note since I used a couple curses in it, however it was the middle of the night and my filter turned off. I apologized for the language but reiterated my point that what he was doing was not cool. Who the hell wants to be woken up by a barking dog that isn't even their own? So, even after talking with him a couple times about it, he kept doing it. I doubt it was out of spite, more like lack of consideration for others. If I hadn't been moving out in a couple months I would have gathered evidence and raised the issue with management. If you give them evidence of someone being an asshole, they're pretty good about trying to make things right so long as the offender's behavior is breaching the lease they signed.

Ultimately while there were annoying times living there, thems the breaks when you're a renter and have a restricted breed dog. If I could do it over again, I would have taken more time towards the end of year one and found another place that annoyed me less.

"If you're sticking to Rockville, you really can't go wrong in terms of safety and good community. Your price range is doable, but you'll probably have to stick to some of the older buildings in the area as the newer buildings usually start closer to $1900/month. Also, the newer building will sometimes charge extra for ""amenities"" and parking.

With that said, the Grosvenor area has some good highrises and garden apartments which should be in your price range. It's an ""older"" but quieter area since it's further from the main retail area of 355. However, it's actually closer to DC and 495 so it's going to be a few minutes closer to Silver Spring.

Further up 355 a place like Rollins Park apartments will probably work for your price range, but it's in a busier area and parking might be an issue. It's walking distance from shopping though, so that's a plus if you're into that. Also, check down Montrose and Twinbrook Parkway as there are garden apartments along those roads which should also work.

Even further up the pike, you're basically in the downtown area and parking will almost certainly be a problem, so I would probably stay away from that area.",t2_lwx0,superjuan,0,1567720702.0,0,t1_ez79mnq,ez79mnq,False,tdix14,t3_d06xus,https://www.reddit.com/r/RockvilleMD/comments/d06xus/looking_for_apartments/,Looking for apartments,/r/RockvilleMD/comments/d06xus/looking_for_apartments/ez79mnq/,1,r/RockvilleMD,0,1

"Here's some things that I would say

There's EarthTreks in Rockville, just behind the Marlo. It's a huge rock-climbing gym.  
If you like trampolines, there's Zava Zone off of Gude. It's half trampolines, half American Ninja Warrior style obstacle course. Yes, there are lots of kids and teens, but pay attention to their Instagram and they do Adult Nights all the time.

In Rockville town square there's a movie theater with the recliners and you can reserve your seats ahead of time. I also enjoy World of Beer for grabbing something to drink.

There are tons of parks for hiking. Blair Witch Project was filmed in Seneca Creek Park. If you're into Geocaching there are a billion caches around Gaithersburg, Germantown. Both in the woods and park n gos.

You can always head up 270 out past frederick to Harper's Ferry. The season is winding down now but there's ziplining, rafting, tubing, hiking, adventure courses, etc. Locally there is the Silver spring adventure park, and Go Ape.

"If you want to play indoors, there are several gyms that have courts - la fitness (Rio, gaithersburg, White flint), sport and health (Bethesda), and lifetime fitness (Rio). At LA fitness the courts can have a long wait during prime hours. IMO if you can afford lifetime do that. 

The sportsplex in Germantown has a huge complex of like 8 courts and you just need to buy a day pass that I think is like $5. But there’s not always good games going on, more like small groups playing or people working out with trainers. 

If you want to play outdoors the courts up by leisure world off rt 28 are great. The courts by hard times cafe in Rockville are usually pretty good too. 

There’s a Facebook group called “Germantown Ballers” where people post what outdoor courts they will be going to, it’s somewhat active. 

There are also groups that rent court time from the county and play among themselves. Once you meet some people at the other courts you may get invited into one. They are really affordable (usually less than $100 for 2x2hr sessions per week for several months).

"**Lake Needwood**

Lake Needwood is a 75-acre (300,000 m2) reservoir in Derwood, Maryland, USA. Located east of Rockville, in the eastern part of Montgomery County, it is situated on Rock Creek. The lake was created to provide flood control. It also protects the water quality of the creek by functioning as a retention basin to trap sediment from storm-water runoff.   

The lake is part of Rock Creek Regional Park.

"It sounds like you want a mid-sized law firm that specializes in business/commercial litigation.  Luckily, Montgomery County has a good number of those type of law firms (as well as being near the major ""downtown"" law firms in Baltimore and DC). Rockville is the county seat, and is where most of the local courts are. I'd suggest you start with:

&#x200B;

* [Paley Rothman](http://www.paleyrothman.com/) in Bethesda (strong business litigation, commercial disputes and banking divisions)
* [Lerch Early & Brewer](https://www.lerchearly.com/) in Bethesda (also strong commercial disputes, lending, and corporate divisions)
* [Stein Sperling](https://steinsperling.com/) in Rockville (and other Montgomery County locations) (long established firm with a respected commercial litigation team)
* [McCarthy Wilson](http://www.mcwilson.com/default.aspx) in Rockville (local law firm with a good deal of trial and hearing experience)

&#x200B;

I work in the legal field here in Montgomery County, so I'm trying not to pick favorites.  Could tell you more about some of the attorneys if one of these law firms interest you.  Any of these four should do well in assisting you with your claims, and they will give you good legal advice while avoiding just telling you what you want to hear (which always causes a person to throw away good money at nothing).",t2_3rjnddhg,MarylandParalegal,0,1562867249.0,0,t1_etj6obq,etj6obq,True,argus4ever,t3_cby5pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/RockvilleMD/comments/cby5pr/can_anyone_recommend_a_great_civil_litigation/,"Can anyone recommend a great civil litigation attorney based in or near Rockville, MD?",/r/RockvilleMD/comments/cby5pr/can_anyone_recommend_a_great_civil_litigation/etj6obq/,12,r/RockvilleMD,0,12

"Lived in Rockville/Gaithersburg from 1973-2000.

Our family used to go to the original mall on Friday nights, we'd walk around, and go to Roy Rogers for dinner and Howard Johnson's for ice cream. The original mall at some point had a movie theater, I saw a terrible black and white western there with my dad and brother.

The later incarnations of the mall were awful, never saw any shops and I only went there for the movie theater which was nearly unreachable because you had to walk up and down several flights of narrow stairs and go around multiple corners.

Before the Town Center concept there was an Irish themed restaurant that I went to once with my parents, nothing to write home about but it wasn't awful, just like the movie theater, almost impossible to get to.

"Mine is rather eclectic.

Cuban Corner in Derwood for their Cuban sandwiches, flan and vaca frita. Good coffee too.

Hunter's Inn in Potomac for their steak or shrimp tacos, nachos, and stiff pours at happy hour at the bar which is 4-6:30 pm every day.

The jumbo scallops or the liver at Normandie Farm in Potomac. Of course you must have a popover whenever you visit. I always prefer to eat in the bar and often stay for the live music Thursday through Sunday.

Quarry House Tavern in Silver Spring for burgers, as well as whiskey and beer. Also has a great juke box when it is working.

The roasted half chicken at Don Pollo is also good. My wife and I will share that for lunch sometimes.

The bbq at Mission BBQ is always consistent and good. Especially like the pulled pork, turkey, and the lean brisket from right under the fatty portion. It is called the ""middle.""

El Patio in Rockville for a lively crowd and good Argentine food.

Taco Bar at the Shell Station by Rio and Crown Farm is a little gem. Not fancy at all but the food is delicious and cheap. Their location in Olde Town Gaithersburg is also good.

Lastly, the Richie Center in Rockville has a few little gems tucked away in that shopping center, and I am not talking about the IHOP.
