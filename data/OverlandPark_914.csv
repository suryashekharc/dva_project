We are a smaller company all of our studies are done by email. I can assure you I do not leak anything out onto social media. The company I work for is called Inner Reality Group. Typically I post on facebook and have no problems.. However seems to be a very small amount of people from the state of Kansas on any of the Facebook groups for paid studies so I came here. I left my post vague on purpose since often times this is how reddit treats my posts regardless of how informative I am. It's fine if you don't want to take part in one of the studies I offer. Just trying to get the word out there. This one pays $140 by virtual prepaid card. Session is 120 minutes long.,t2_sobxs,Babyboos716,0,1648260444.0,0,t1_i258tir,i258tir,False,Babyboos716,t3_tng5s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overlandpark/comments/tng5s5/paid_study/,Paid study,/r/Overlandpark/comments/tng5s5/paid_study/i258tir/,1,r/Overlandpark,0,1

Doing super well! Employed full time and dashing on the side now. The DoorDash money wasn’t stable enough. When it got super cold at times I’d get a hotel but I been trying to save as much money as possible I thought I could get into an apartment as soon as I started working but that’s not the case so I posted this same thing on some swap and shop groups on Facebook and so many people reached out with rooms for rent and resources I think I found a good spot for me a guy around my age has a 2 bed apartment in Kansas City and his roommate just moved out and I’m moving in Wednesday when I get paid I think it will be a good fit since we’re around the same age and have similar interests from there I’m just going to penny pinch for awhile and save money for my own place been homeless pretty much since June of 2020 besides august 21 to November 21 so this is such a blessing for me.

"Good thing the department of transportation requires them to put stickers and their DOT number on the sides their vehicles. I see these trucks regularly remove their plates so they cannot be reported when your vehicle is hit by a rock. I don't have a good angle on the truck but my windshield was hit by a rock and multiple parked cars had rocks fall on them. I imagine those people otherwise don't know who caused the damage, which is the point of this company removing their plates.

The stickers on the side were DOT 379171.

If you live on 75th Street or have random damage to your vehicle, it was probably this company's trucks.

The hotline’s pilot began under direction of the Veterans Experience Office on June 1, 2017, and entered phase two on October 15, 2017.

White House VA Hotline:  1-855-948-2311.

Calls are answered by a live agent 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  The hotline is staffed by more than 60 agents who have had extensive training on VA programs and services.  Most of these agents are a Veteran, military family member, caregiver or a survivor.

The White House VA Hotline conducts immediate warm hand offs for at-crisis risk Veterans needing the services of the Veterans Crisis Line.

Trends identified by the hotline will be used to rapidly respond to systemic inefficiencies and empower VA employees to resolve Veteran concerns quickly.

Veterans should continue to use existing VA customer service hotlines:

In July the Kansas State Board of Education published a letter saying that critical race theory isn't and never has been part of the state’s educational standards.""

But there's nothing puzzling about dark money trying to get right wingers on local school boards.

"I appreciate you’re being honest. 

Vaccine mandates including fines will disproportionately effect the black and poorer populations, as we have already seen in states that have implemented them. Additionally, you will need the black population to get a valid ID en masse, which has already been a hot issue concerning voting. I personally believe this won’t present a huge logistical challenge, but it will politically. 

Additionally, I do not like the idea of having to show anything to, for instance, enter a shop or go see a movie. I’m fully vaccinated, and believe that everyone should be, but I will not be showing any documents to anyone. I will stand with all the “conspiracy theorists” on this regardless of their other views. I am definitely in the majority in this case. This is the first step towards tyranny and segregation, as history has shown. 

Moreover, in addition to all of those who will inevitably fake vaccine IDs, and those who have exemptions, we will never have a fully vaccinated population. It just isn’t practical. Theoretically, if everyone followed your vaccine mandate, we could get to “zero COVID.” Practically, however, it just isn’t feasible. COVID will be around indefinitely, which is just a matter of fact at this point. 

So I go back to my original question: if mandates aren’t practical, and fining people won’t stamp out this virus, what is the solution? In my eyes, there are only two: (1) complete segregation of those who are unvaccinated, which directly violates human rights and (2) simply respecting others’ right to choose what they think is best for themselves and their community; in this case, Overland Park.",t2_kn8t1,afitfox,0,1629817263.0,0,t1_ha636va,ha636va,False,AutoModerator,t3_pa26eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overlandpark/comments/pa26eq/overland_park_weekly_freeforall_casual/,"Overland Park Weekly Free-for-All & Casual Conversation - August 23, 2021",/r/Overlandpark/comments/pa26eq/overland_park_weekly_freeforall_casual/ha636va/,1,r/Overlandpark,0,1

* Farassati - anti chip seal, voted against toll lanes on 69.

"[Shooting at 89th and Metcalf leaves man in critical condition](https://shawneemissionpost.com/2021/07/27/overland-park-promontory-shooting-128834/)

A man in his 30s was critically injured after a shooting inside the parking garage of an upscale Overland Park apartment building Monday evening.

Officers were dispatched to the Promontory Apartments, 8961 Metcalf Avenue, at 8:48 p.m. after several 911 callers reported hearing gunfire.

Recorded radio traffic indicates officers arrived to find a man on the first floor of the parking garage with multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head.

The man was conscious and talked to the police before being transported to an area hospital by Johnson County Med-Act.

Police at the scene said the man was taken to Overland Park Regional Medical Center, and he is now in stable condition, according to an update provided by a police spokesperson on Tuesday morning.

The parking garage of the building is enclosed, and garage doors control access off of 89th Street and another set off Glenwood Street.

Police blocked access to the parking garage for a time. By 10 p.m., an officer could be seen allowing residents into the garage.

The shooting is still under investigation. No arrests have been made, and no suspect information has been released.

"I would agree with that statement, and they're all, unshockingly, ""luxury"" apartments. The few single family homes that ARE built aren't exactly starter homes either. So we build untold numbers of luxury apartments whose rental rates rival mortgage rates of the neighborhood which ends up raising your property taxes and pricing everyone out. Then everyone looks around and complains that there's no affordable housing. Not giving tax incentives to developers wanting to build these complexes, I think, is a good start to trying to even out pricing. Encouraging new units to be ""non luxury"" would be good too.

When I was born, we lived at 199th and Metcalf and there was NOTHING out there, now it's completely different and probably needed for the population boom as the ""edge of the wild"" moves farther south each year.

"My daughter has pretty severe celiac and we live in OP.  

One of our favorite go to places for Chinese is Fortune Work(the original..not the ""and sushi"" location).  They have a large dedicated section of gluten free dishes that are so good we just order as a family from that list. 

Grimaldi's pizza has a good gluten free pizza(but they are pricey). It's out in Prairie Fire.

Several of the sushi  places around the OP/JOCO area have gluten free options or the better ones may even use Tamari (the Japanese one) brand soy sauce which does not have gluten like most.  Some of the Hyee sushis are good and are just naturally gluten free. 

Most of the Thai places curries are gluten free.  We like Thai Place, on 87th going west just before old downtown OP. Then there is Lemongrass in downtown OP , next to The Other Place.  Also Hot Basil in OP out on 135th(I think) .   Those are 3 that we have tried.

There is a cool little trailer that is open only mornings and they sell out quick called DOP (Downtown Overland Park) Donuts.  Ever Saturday they have gluten free donuts.

"It's just so perversely ironic that the people willing to sue local government over the ""trauma"" of their civil liberties being squashed when required to wear masks for public safety reasons, are always the same people that attempt to brow beat other's into giving up their own right to protect themselves. These people claim whether or not to wear a mask should be a choice, unless you choose ""incorrectly"" to protect yourself because, ""it feeds into the sheeple mentality."" There is no threat to individual agency involved with propagating a norm of wearing a mask to prevent the transmission of germs. Far politer societies than ours have been doing it for years and the practice  is never a sociopolitical matter of concern in the public consciousness. We have so many problems in this life that are beyond our control: can we, please, stop making stupid shit up to get so upset about? If society was a girlfriend, you know all your friends would have told you to dump her toxic drama queen ass by now. For Christ's sake, can you imagine how many wrongs in this world we could have righted by now if we could just focus a 10th of people's online efforts to destroy strangers over trifle shit into more humanitarian channels?

"No, it's more because the irony is, I walk/run that very spot in OP all the time.  Like many times a week.  It's a great place to do so. The premise of the video is just wrong, that's all.

It's merely the maker of the video projecting what they feel is good/important about a city on to all cities/citizens.  That's why we downvote the video. It's wrong in several ways.

And don't be that guy that just says something and when people disagree just ""oh, you're just bitter we are pointing out how you are wrong"".  That's weak.

I'll add, I've lived/worked in many metro areas in cities in the US and overseas. I've had to commute in all of these places.  Without a doubt, THE most pleasant place I've lived and had to drive is Overland Park.  Not even close.

"I used to work at BVSW. They aren’t as strong in sports as the other schools, but it’s academically strong and the class sizes can not be beat. The school   Is only 10 years old and is the only school in JOCO that is under capacity as the Great Recession slowed down the projected growth in the area. They have room for about another 400 kids in that building and so the class sizes and everything else is amazing. It has three wonderful elementary schools and a great middle as well. BVW is great too, but packed to the brim, as are its feeders. BVSW always accepts transfers from other parts of the district because they have the space. The building was also built to be eco friendly using electricity saving light detection systems, it has a huge number of windows and skylights, and they expanded an existing marsh on the property to give native species more room to thrive.

As I said before, you wouldn’t have any issue getting kids into that part of the district from Leawood, and all of their schools are pretty close to most areas within the BVH and BVW attendance areas, but it’s not very close to most of the BVN or BVNW lines.

"Most of them are sadly now gone. There were 800 in the early 2000s, there are less than 100 now. They closed the OKC, Tulsa, Omaha, and Wichita stores years ago. STL just lost their last one with us, and Denver only has the one left, as does Phoenix.

In my opinion, Disney didn’t do enough with the stores when they bought them back. They had the same stuff you can get at Walmart and Target at twice the price.

This entire situation is likely the fault of the shelter. I used to volunteer at a local shelter and fostered animals for them. *ANY* time somebody was interested in a dog that even slightly resembled a pittie the shelter would triple check their city allowed the breed.

"Tornado season is mainly spring/early summer. I really wouldn't worry about it man. I know it's scary when the sirens go off, which you will definitely experience plenty because we get tornado warnings usually at least a few times a year. It's also pretty unlikely to be woken up in the middle of the night by sirens, tornados most often occur between 6-10pm due to the air temperatures required to form one, so you'll probably be awake already when it's happening. 

When they go off just turn on the news (there are ways to see it for free on your phone/TV if you don't have cable) and they're going to be having nonstop coverage on the situation and where specifically the greatest threat is. We had sirens and a tornado touchdown like 3-4 weeks ago and it ended up doing nothing but mess up some trees and damage a few peoples roofs. They have a relatively small path of destruction when compared to something like a hurricane, and the ones that are powerful enough to do serious damage are pretty rare around here in the metro. I've lived in the midwest my whole life and I've never seen one.

In conclusion, don't worry about them. When the sirens go off just turn on the news and try to keep calm.",t2_5bc9t,Pittcrew,0,1617165460.0,0,t1_gsvrz6r,gsvrz6r,False,[deleted],t3_mgx65y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overlandpark/comments/mgx65y/few_s_about_overland_park/,Few ?s about Overland Park,/r/Overlandpark/comments/mgx65y/few_s_about_overland_park/gsvrz6r/,2,r/Overlandpark,0,2
"I wouldn't say there's anything I hate about OP, it seems to fit well with what you're describing that you want.

The biggest shock for you coming from Vegas might be the weather, it'll get very cold with a decent amount of snow in the winter and hot/humid in the summer. It can also be very sporadic in the fall/spring (i.e. 70 one week and snowing the next). And obviously we can get pretty severe weather in the spring/summer, but like I said, very unlikely to get hit or even see a tornado for that matter. Definitely good to have a garage/cover for your car in case of hail which often occurs in severe thunderstorms. These are all things that you're going to experience to some degree pretty much anywhere in the midwest.

"I mean I've spent plenty of time in the woods both here and places that are much more rural.

Just an itchy little bump is all. Just put on some bug spray if you're hanging out outside in the summer especially around dusk and you'll be fine. Where are you coming from that doesn't have mosquitos, if you don't mind me asking?

"1. Statistically very unlikely to get directly hit by a tornado, especially one big enough to completely wipe away your house. Always go to the lowest, most centrally located room in your house. I live in a 2nd story apartment so for me it would be in the bath tub. Stay away from windows/doors. But again, it's very unlikely that you'd actually get hit.

2. There's a few decent bars, but most of the nightlife scene is going to be in kcmo (about 20-30mins away), whether it be Westport/Waldo/Power and Light/Crossroads/etc. There's oak park mall which is quite large and has lots of shops and whatnot. We have top golf/shooting ranges/axe throwing places. There's quite a bit to do in the kc metro and you can usually get anywhere in the metro in 45mins or less of driving.

3. Probably, there's plenty of ladies around here you'd just have to make some kind of effort to find/meet them :)

4. I've only had one encounter with the OPPD, they're probably about average. Mosquitos/ticks aren't going to be much of a problem unless you're in the woods or something. As far as crime goes, OP is a very safe area especially when compared to anywhere else in the metro.

5. South OP/Leawood are the ""nicest"" and most upscale parts of Joco. Next would probably Lenexa/Olathe/North OP/Shawnee/Mission. If you want to be in the most upscale area possible I'd say look for Leawood and parts of OP nearish Leawood. 

6. I'd say for the most part, people are generally pretty friendly here when compared to other places. But there's also assholes everywhere too.

The biggest Casinos around here are going to be Argosy, Casino KC, Harrah's, and the Ameristar. All of which are located a short drive away in KCMO/North KC.

"I personally don't like houses older than about 15 years or so, and given your budget, I would personally be looking south of 151st St. and east of Pflumm (try 159th by Quivira / Switzer) to get into BV schools.  

For $600k, you should be able to buy a <10yo (or even new) very large house and the schools in that area are going to be great. In terms of house size/value, I think you're going to get more value by going south than north - unless you happen to like the older styles of homes in Leawood / PV / Mission Hills, but you're probably priced out of Mission Hills at $600K - and I think that area of PV / Mission is Shawnee Mission school district, not Blue Valley (but not sure).

"Hey OP - a couple of questions.  Are you looking for a newer (<20yr) or older (>20yr) house?  What is your approx. budget.

BV school district is among the top schools in KC metro.  The district extends from Leawood across OP.  Newer houses are being built to the south of Leawood/OP, and would be most expensive around HW69 around 159th and east of there, and get cheaper as you go west towards Olathe.

Older areas like Prairie Village / Mission Hills / North leawood are going to feel a little more urban because they're closer to downtown KCMO, but the houses are going to be older, like 25-50 (older further north you go).  Once you get south of around 119th to 135th street, the houses are going to be <25yr old.

In terms of concern about the airport, the only place around Leawood/OP for airplanes would be the small airport at 151st and Pflumm.  The runway runs north/south, so living east/west of that flight path would be fine, and you're not going to see many airplanes anyway (I live in Olathe not that far from the flight path of this and rarely notice the plans).",t2_5otyw,cyberphlash,0,1614627489.0,0,t1_gpbzwfw,gpbzwfw,True,WilCoPaMa,t3_luxsa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overlandpark/comments/luxsa0/relocation_help_have_never_been_to_kansas/,Relocation Help!!!

"Moved here a year and a half ago after a stint in DC and also Buffalo. I found Leawood to be incredibly nice but not for my family. It is very affluent, which we are financially, but not socially. It depends on what you want but found Overland Park and parts of Olathe better fit my lifestyle and desired socialization for my children. I did not find as much diversity as I had hoped for and felt it was mostly about keeping up with others. Just my opinion and likely a generalization. I was a bit worried about bullying for my kids as we focus (pre-covid) on travel and experiences, not buying the fanciest cars, clothes or devices and part time jobs are key for my kids. Very beautiful, very safe, great schools though. Overland Park is great for BV schools, still very affluent but feels more down to earth as are south  and south east Olathe. Parts of north east Spring Hill (think 175 and Mur-Len  to Antioch) are also very nice. My kids have been very into soccer which is huge here it seems and swimming.

"The Nelson-Atkins museum offers many classes to the community. It's located in the Plaza district of Kansas City MO.  There also used to be Communiversity - classes offered to the community on all sorts of subjects. It's through UMKC.  The Culinary Center and the Olive Tree (both  in OPKS) offer tons of different classes, but availability might be limited due to the pandemic.  Crown Center has LEGO Land Discovery Center and a children's and adult theatre group that have a performance season. KC Rep - also through UMKC is a world renown theatre which was state of the art back in the 1980's.  It was one of the first theatres to have it's lighting controlled through a Unix platform.

Welcome! We moved here from California two months ago. Finally bought a home yesterday in the Polo Fields. We looked in Leawood but no luck finding what we were looking for. Home inventory is very low right now but it seems to be picking up lately. Hopefully you’ll have a lot of homes to choose from by the time you get here. Once you do find a home you want there will likely be several people bidding on it so you have to act fast and put in an appealing offer. Best of luck in your move.

"Hello! I have an interesting perspective as we moved to KCK (Southern Overland Park (""OP"", you'll come to learn as I have) at the end of the fall of last year. Originally from Cleveland, and we lived in San Francisco for a couple of years.

First off, this area is NICE. As a few others pointed out, KC is pretty underrated. We moved here pretty much blindly for my fiance's new job, and just researched online. I can only speak for the Kansas side suburbs, but everything feels pretty safe and quite nice. I am excited you are moving to Leawood, because next to my area in OP, Leawood is my next favorite! Also, as others have mentioned, it is an affluent suburb. There is a little shopping area (where you'll find the likes of a Lululemon, Apple store, Trader Joes (the only one in the area besides Ward Parkway across into Missouri), Sephora, etc etc!) There is also a really nice park/trail system I stumbled upon- Tomahawk Park. Lots of Teslas, BMWs, mercedes, range rovers, lexus, etc. The homes are beautiful. (We are in the market for a home and online, it seems the median going rate for leawood homes are like $600-800k). Lots of million dollar homes pop up online, too. We don't have children, but I hear the BV schools are some of the best. Furthermore, they have the highway systems really figured out here- there are a ton of them, and you aren't ever too far way from hopping on one. (One thing I have noticed is that the merging/entrance/exit lanes happen quite fast, and people moreso than not will NOT yield to the highway traffic!) There is one road in leawood, Nall, where the homes are just gorgeous.

We started off renting a home because it was much easier and safer for us to do so- we had a similar timeline as you, but the pandemic was much stricter back then, too). 

Do you know where you/your spouse will be working? I've noticed *a lot* of people newly moving into this area will be working in Corporate Woods (or at least have their office there if they are still working from home a lot). That's very close to Leawood.

Another thing I've noticed another person mention is that the horizontal roads are pretty much all numbered, counting down from the downtown area. In my past, the numbered roads were a metro/ ""not a safe suburb"" thing, so we were leery, but it's totally normal out here. The roads way way into the country/farmland are still numbered.

About airplanes- I haven't really thought of it, but I have \*barely\* seen an airplane since moving here (previously, we lived right in the pathway of SFO, which was pretty cool actually!- so I got very used to constant planes). The main airport for KC is up north, about 45min from us, so probably like 30-35 min from where you'll be living. All highway. A nice, cute little airport. There IS a little private airport you can see on googlemaps around the Olathe area (another city hub, like 15min West of OP/Leawood area) that we never really noticed until we were driving right past it over the weekend. So, no, no air traffic to worry about :) 

One thing I have noticed/read about in other threads on reddit is that there is a lot of ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" in these suburbs. (Which you wouldn't immediately think of when you think 'Kansas', but it is nice out here!) I'm in my late twenties, and have noticed the majority of school aged girls are in stores like Lululemon, have louis vuitton bags, etc. The teenager that lives next to us drives a BMV, and all his friends do, too, if not an audi. Apparently for kids, schools and classmate expectations aren't exactly how they were in the 90s and 00s, but just a word of slight caution! 

We wish you the best!! We are very happy here. The people are nice. I feel the area is a little pricier than you would immediately expect, but it is growing like a weed. According to locals, everything has boomed a lot, especially in the more southern suburbs, in the past two to three decades. LOTS of construction, homes, and buildings going up. Tons of new places moving into the area. 151st (horizontal) is a main drag with lots of restaurants, stores, etc. So is 135th- even moreso. Metcalf (vertical) is another one. All in all, Leawood is freaking gorgeous and I think your family will absolutely loveeeee it!

"The airport is about 30 minutes north, so you don't really have any air traffic. You get the occasional low flying military helicopters, but that is maybe once every couple weeks and not something you are going to avoid anywhere in the metro.

Leawood is super nice, you can't really go wrong anywhere in Leawood, but it is also huge, just like overland park, which can be equally nice in some areas. You can live up north, which are older houses, but the school district is Shawnee Mission east/south, which is a great school district as well. The further north you are, the closer to the city, so pay attention to the street numbers because they start counting up from the heart of downtown next to the river. If you have a commute to downtown, that is something to consider. If you are not commuting to downtown, then moving further south will get you a much more modern and often times larger home and put you in BV school district. Don't get me wrong about northern Leawood, some of the biggest houses and yards are in the northern part of Leawood and a majority of the older homes have been demolished and replaced with much more modern homes as the northern part is considered the more desirable place to live due to it being more central to the KC metro. If you do decide to go further south, be prepared to be used to large open areas with the occasional farm. There is less of that in the northern part of Leawood as it is more forest like. Definitely consider having a realtor show you around. Also, since you are coming from Seattle and considering Leawood, you might also consider Mission Hills, if being closer to the city in a REALLY nice area is appealing to you. Their school district is Shawnee Mission East, which is a great school.

To answer some of your other questions, all 3 BV schools are considered some of the best in the nation. There is a reason OP/Leawood has such a large amount of people moving there with kids.

KC is great for pre-teens, but it is all about what they like to do. I believe all of the schools now have maker spaces and classes if they like that.

"Short lease + garage space will likely come at a significant premium if you go with large apartment community. You might be better off leaving your items in storage and finding a traditional apartment for the short term. 

Zillow rentals have more untraditional offerings. I personally rent a few single family houses and only post the listings on Zillow. Sounds like that may be ideal for your situation. Short term lease would be a negotiation with the owner.
