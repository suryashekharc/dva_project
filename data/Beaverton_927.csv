"The biggest issue with creating dense walkable core zones with good public transit access is planning.  If a space wasn't designed with that kind of accessibility in mind, it can be next to impossible to get people on board with rearranging chunks of a city to make it work.  Partially because of the huge cost, but also partially because a lot of people really don't want to experiment with different kinds of human habitat.

You mention Cedar Hills, and it's kind of a good example of this.  A huge swath of the Cedar Hills core area is just parking lot.  Parking lots that stretch out how far you have to walk to get to places, and that are a massive hazard for pedestrians to walk through while drivers ignore stop signs and cross walks.  A potential way to fix this would be to replace the parking lots with a single larger parking structure, to have more frequent public transit access, or even just to have secure walking paths through the parking areas.  But every one of those things costs someone, somewhere, money.  And that can be really discouraging to property developers and owners who see the way things are going as 'good enough'.

It's disheartening, because I have enough of the picture to see what I'd *like* things to be, and I can see the roadblocks, but I have no idea how to bridge the gap or where to start.",t2_5p7g8,ArgusTheCat,0,1647683917.0,0,t1_i19j0qm,i19j0qm,True,Kite_Moonwall,t3_tcxwn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/beaverton/comments/tcxwn0/as_our_city_continues_to_develop_and_grow_is_it/,"As our city continues to develop and grow, is it going in the right direction?",/r/beaverton/comments/tcxwn0/as_our_city_continues_to_develop_and_grow_is_it/i19j0qm/,1,r/beaverton,0,1

I just want to say that the Farmington/Hall intersection is extremely dangerous and badly designed. I don't know who planned it but the cross walk is not immediately visible if you are in a SOUTH facing vehicle taking a left turn onto Farmington (going east).

"I can't help but acknowledge it was an 'SUV' of some sort. The trend towards larger cars in the US is worrisome and while we have all kinds of standards on vehicle safety for people in vehicles there isn't any concern about the pedestrians and the fact that these vehicles have terrible sightlines and can hide a short person in front of their grill. The vehicles simply aren't safe in our streets especially when considering the demographic of people that often drive them. But sadly global SUV sales hit a new record... https://www.iea.org/commentaries/global-suv-sales-set-another-record-in-2021-setting-back-efforts-to-reduce-emissions

People will drive a large vehicle to feel safe perpetuating the problem for others and making the small cars we SHOULD incentivize scary to be in. It's an arms race that makes us all less safe and just burns more gas along the way. The only way out of this trend I think is regulation in some form. In general we should try to cater towards pedestrians and reduce vehicles in our cities since we don't distinguish between smart cars or lifted mega trucks. Delivery vehicles is one thing but I know I wouldn't need a car and could ride an e-bike everywhere if the dangers to my life weren't there.",t2_k4q2xs9,27-82-41-124,1,1647385869.0,0,t1_i0tc2zm,i0tc2zm,True,Wipples,t3_tf1eam,https://www.reddit.com/r/beaverton/comments/tf1eam/pamplin_media_group_pedestrian_killed_in/,Pamplin Media Group - Pedestrian killed in hit-and-run in Central Beaverton on Tuesday (3/15 - 7am),/r/beaverton/comments/tf1eam/pamplin_media_group_pedestrian_killed_in/i0tc2zm/,0,r/beaverton,0,0

"I think we need to figure out how to adapt what we have and make good steps that can work somewhat with what we have to come to expect as Americans. To me that looks like:

Reducing the amount of roads and parkinglots that do not generate any wealth for the community but inevitably fall into dis-repair and have to be closed sometimes for 6months+ for upkeep. Also [we need to embrace traffic, not fight it](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2022/2/21/we-need-to-embrace-traffic-congestion-not-fight-it) by trying to just keep adding lanes, slip-lanes, huge intersections, 45mph+ roads that generate significant noise near dense housing. All these solutions are expensive, temporary, induce sprawl and make it less safe and desirable for those living in the city. There are so many ways cars cost us valuable space, even in the trend that single family homes should be setback 30-50feet from the road because of road noise, or the amount of space in parking-lots just dedicated to being able to backout in each row. Or the fact that people don't want a corner shop/grocery store in their neighborhood because of ""all the traffic that would create near the entrance"". 

We need to do more to ensure buses don't get stuck in traffic, they don't end up filthy and full of crazy people we don't feel safe around, etc. 

We need to help our small businesses by realizing that people walking and biking passed it are far more likely to stop in and engage with it then they would be if driving down a 50MPH road that is terrifying to turn in from. Especially if there is a nice plaza out front encouraging people to engage with the area. Parking lots either are too big or eventually fill up to create an upper limit for the amount of people a business can serve. Look at how 1 converted parking spot or closed off road can generate significant revenue in downtown for the added foot traffic, additional covered outdoor eating, etc.

Biking is a great way to get places < ~10miles in our cities, especially now that e-bikes have been developed and can go 20-28MPH. When you realize the average speed along most routes for cars can be <20MPH when considering all the stops they have to make, we could actually improve travel times for most residents in getting where they need to go if they were on bikes and didn't need to stop at intersections but used round-abouts soley for bikes or other crossings. Think how much more people would spend at local shops instead of ordering on amazon if they could ride their cargo e-bike there safely, and were significant richer in not having to even own a car at all.",t2_k4q2xs9,27-82-41-124,0,1647211268.0,0,t1_i0jq1lt,i0jq1lt,True,Kite_Moonwall,t3_tcxwn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/beaverton/comments/tcxwn0/as_our_city_continues_to_develop_and_grow_is_it/,"As our city continues to develop and grow, is it going in the right direction?",/r/beaverton/comments/tcxwn0/as_our_city_continues_to_develop_and_grow_is_it/i0jq1lt/,1,r/beaverton,0,1

"While cities and governments likely shouldn't be businesses it is important to be aware that much of how a city operates is around acquiring funds. Federal funds are dispersed in favor of new expansion and sprawl much more than they are to improve and invest in the existing urban boundary. This means the best way for a city to acquire new capital is to sprawl, but as time goes on the infrastructure needs maintenance and repair however the sprawl means that there is far too much infrastructure for the tax revenue that is generated by the amount of people it services. Rather than re-densify on the existing area the solution to this is what was the original problem: acquire new land and develop it like some kind of ponzi-scheme. This problem is evident by the fact that infrastructure bill for federal owned roads is only attempting to repair 26% of the roads currently in poor condition (over next 10 years) while also ignoring that new roads/bridges/etc are wearing out as well. 

TLDR: Cities already do operate like a business and federal incentives for sprawl and rules pertaining to zoning and minimum parking requirements make it a de-facto choice to do so. However the bill comes due eventually to upkeep what we have and it's gonna hurt in the long run.

"Welcome! It's a little too early to start hiking in most trails if you don't have the right shoes and gear because they are very muddy. But here are some suggestions:

L.L. Stub Stewart Park is about 30-40 minutes west and has some nice and quiet trails. In that same area, there is a paved trail called Banks-Vernonia trail with multiple access points.

Not too far the in city itself, Forest Park is a great treasure. I suggest that you park near the Zoo and hit the Wildwood trail. Follow the map to whichever direction you desire. 

Nested in the Tillamook Forest, there are many cool trails too. Many of them are accessible along HWY 6.  Also along HWY 26 (Sunset highway), there is a beautiful and challenging trail called Saddle Mountain. It's a difficult climb but very rewarding. Pick a clear and sunny day for this one.

Further east along the Columbia River Gorge there are lots of amazing trails on both the Oregon and Washington side. Especially around Hood River (the city). You can do a search and find all of them but my favorite one is Cayote Wall. Also watch for poison ivy plants and ticks in that area. Wearing pants instead of shorts is advised.

A little north in the Washington state, there is a 1-mile long lava cave that is just out of this world. It's called Ape Caves. Make sure to wear beefy hiking boots and take very bright flash lights.

Silver Falls Park is about 1.5 hour south and it's a magical place with gorgeous hiking trails and many waterfalls.

"Ok good. I was just giving a fair warning since you said you were moving from out of state. That could mean a LOT of things which might completely flip somebody else with less experience world completely upside down. 

As far as vacancies going that fast. Yes they do. I did the apartment game out here from 2010 to 2020. Even buying was nearly impossible. Houses and Condos out here are bought way above asking price and often within 24-48 hours. Those places will have like 6 offers all above asking price. 

Getting apartments on your schedule can be difficult. You may want to aim for just anywhere right now at month to month just to get moved. Then you have the flexibility and proximity you need to find the right place once you're here. Just don't unpack your stuff much until you find a longer term place. Try that Emerald Place I linked. It's good location and neighborhood. They have vacancies right now and it wasn't a terrible place to live at all.

"Call and specifically ask about a unit. A lot of these apartments will put pictures of newly remodeled ones up then rent you one that isn't remodeled yet. 

For instance look at these apartments. I lived in these before when they were like 800 a month. 

Look at the last picture all the way to the right, that's what you actually get inside. They will sh ow you nice pictures of stainless steel appliances and new countertops but most units will look like you stepped right back into 1989. Don't think you'll get anything semi luxurious out here just because of the price. We just have incredible demand and very limited supply when it comes to housing.

The spicy chicken is apparently pretty good but I’m really picky about specific seasonings and I won’t eat it, but our whole group likes it. The chadol is good too, if a bit meaty tasting. If you dip it in the sauce they give you it’s really good.

There were a combination of factors. The location wasn't great (tucked behind dutch bros) and the store was a little too small.

Both the Tualatin location and the NE Sandy location fell victim to that change. There were plans for a store in Tigard/King City, but I don't believe we've found a location yet.

"But here's the thing: when rates go up, prices will have to go down. It's all about monthly cash-flow. Rates going up will take a lot of buyers out of the market because they won't be able to afford the monthly payment at these prices + increased interest rate. Market stagnates. Prices won't fall immediately, but some sellers will become desperate to sell.  For an extreme example take a look at average selling price for houses in Oregon in the early 80s.

Walgreens offers free travel safe tests that I found gave results in less than 2 hours. They are generally booked out so no last minute tests. I started checking 2 weeks in advance of travel to get the appointment but it was conveniently located and rather quick.

A number of instant cares offer tests. Expect a slower response time and they are going to charge for a full doctor's appointment that your insurance may not accept and around $150 for the test as its travel related that isn't covered by insurance. Appointments are more available than Walgreens but same day isn't an assumption you should make.

I've also heard that the offers that beat ours out often have things like buyer's rejecting an inspection and allowing the seller to live rent-free for weeks after closing. The place we're currently making an offer on has a seller who wants to live in the place for 60 days. We're offering a daily rent amount, but our agent says the fact that we're not offering it for free is the weakest part of our offer.

The parking is absolute trash. They’re all compact spots and everyone is terrible at parking.. it’s like they try to park over the line. I’ve had to get into my car by the passenger side multiple times. I now park across the street where the townhomes are. They added “parking permits” but that does nothing for the size of the spots. They advertised an elevator the entire leasing process until we got there and our building didn’t have one and we’re on the 4th floor. They didn’t respond when we inquired about it. The 2 bedrooms/2 bathrooms are tiny for the price and the homeless sleep in the garages which we knew about so those two things are on us. The utilities are usually $125 (water/trash/sewer) Maintenance takes a couple of days.

I was paying rent, so the HOA was included in my rent and paid by the landlord but I believe they were extremely high.... in the $500/month range for a one bedroom ( this included water, trash, heating and cooling. )

Its a great location and has recently become even more desirable with the completion of all the new construction.   I think may of the places for sale are people looking to get out after living there for a number of years.

"Evil Landlord here: call PGE and verify the address on your account first thing Monday (they're closed weekends). If the address PGE has is correct, ask the landlord for a copy of the invoice the electricity billback is from. My company does electricity billbacks ONLY if we received a bill for your apartment, which should only happen for vacants. If you didn't set up PGE before move-in, this bill back could also be something the landlord paid after you moved in but before you took over the billing for that address. It's unlikely to be common areas, but I would read your lease and double check. 

For sewer, most places it's not based on individual usage, but on property usage. I would recommend reading your lease. It is quite high here though. My wife and I pay about that for sewer from our 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom.

"The shortest version I can give is that the majority of complaints are based in generational and class differences, with maybe one complaint being legitimately valid (loud car; but it still meets all legal requirements as far as I know--deputies have been out 2-3 times in the last 2 weeks). While I am sympathetic to frustrations about noise, the neighbors agitating the most (my house is in a cul-de-sac) also don't work. The rest of it boils down to, ""They have a lot of cars parked at your house,"" (one of the tenants works on cars as a hobby), and, ""Can you tell them to move the trash can off the curb?"" Again, no evidence has been ponied up that the renters are doing anything that violates the lease. Renters have always been courteous and responsive to my inquiries and directives; we've seen the house in person and in photos, so we know it's not in a major state of disrepair or anything. The neighbors are outright refusing to engage in any direct communication with the renters, and instead are waging an all-out passive-aggressive war at this point, trying to pull me in to micromanage. 

 Frankly, I think it's fucking ridiculous; the house isn't in an HOA (I have no taste for those), and if my neighbors had shit in their yard I didn't like, *I wouldn't say anything because I know how to mind my own business.* I think they're all upset that we extended our time out of the house longer than initially planned, a decision I made in favor up career and financial prospects, not just because I felt like doing it on a whim. 

I've been a renter far longer than I've ever been a homeowner; shit, I am currently renting right now while I am not occupying my own house. I'm working in southern Oregon for now but ultimately we're planning to return to the Beaverton house for good in the next 18 months. My husband and I have consulted with friends and family about these complaints (including my BIL who is a JD although no longer practicing), and it has all boiled down to, ""This shouldn't be your problem.""

"There's a Latin guy at the 24 Hour Fitness in Beaverton off of Cedar Hills that I had an intro session with. I wish to crap that I remembered his name, but it's been two years. It was the best PT session I ever had. He correctly assessed my fitness level, pushed me just to the point of discomfort, helped me recover super quickly when I pushed myself too hard, and I felt like I had survived three rounds with Ngannou.

I'm cheap as F, but I remember thinking that his rates were super reasonable. If I didn't have to cancel my sub, I'd be able to tell you if he shaved this morning.

Straight shooter, too. Within couple minutes of the session(which he respectfully didn't waste a second of), I realized that I didn't have to demo another trainer and told him that he could save the pitch for the next client, I was his newest client. He took the hint, and beat the brakes off of me. I limped home, but I felt like a million bucks.

You'll find yourself trading between distance away and condition of the house. Then it's just a matter of checking each day what's new on the market and jumping immediately on anything that fits your criteria.,t2_5f0wl,phblj,0,1643599256.0,0,t1_huy3jy6,huy3jy6,True,Hoisin-Sauce,t3_sgjii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/beaverton/comments/sgjii6/house_hunting/,House Hunting,/r/beaverton/comments/sgjii6/house_hunting/huy3jy6/,5,r/beaverton,0,5
"Just sold our townhouse to Opendoor, bought a three bedroom with 1/4 acre backyard in Hillsboro for 525. Teresa Adams was our buyer’s agent. We had no bidding war with this house.

I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for having a question. If you don't have someone you're working with I'd be more than happy to help you find things in your range. There isn't a plethora of stuff on the market at your budget but I do see them come up often still.,t2_9lxb7,T05ha,0,1643586591.0,0,t1_hux85hq,hux85hq,True,Hoisin-Sauce,t3_sgjii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/beaverton/comments/sgjii6/house_hunting/,House Hunting,/r/beaverton/comments/sgjii6/house_hunting/hux85hq/,4,r/beaverton,0,4

I recommend you do a bit of research on Zillow (or any other real estate listing service) to get a better idea of what to expect for your budget. Any single family home that won't require a major remodeling will take you to a biding war these days. I think a 500K to 550K budget is more realistic unless you're willing to go with a townhouse.,t2_6a2rd,sahand_n9,0,1643580517.0,0,t1_huwrva3,huwrva3,True,Hoisin-Sauce,t3_sgjii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/beaverton/comments/sgjii6/house_hunting/,House Hunting,/r/beaverton/comments/sgjii6/house_hunting/huwrva3/,39,r/beaverton,0,39
