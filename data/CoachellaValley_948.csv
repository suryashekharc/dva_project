">The top watchdog for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has identified more than 40 alleged members of gang-like groups of deputies that operate out of two sheriff’s stations.  
>  
>In a letter dated Monday, Inspector General Max Huntsman said his office has compiled a partial list that includes 11 deputies who allegedly belong to the Banditos, which operate out of the East L.A. sheriff’s station, and 30 alleged Executioners from the Compton sheriff’s station.  
>  
>He wrote that the list is based on information gleaned from investigations conducted by the Sheriff’s Department. Huntsman did not name the deputies and said his office has identified additional possible members from other sources.  
>  
>“LASD has never thoroughly investigated allegations of gang corruption, and this case is no exception,” Huntsman told The Times.  
>  
>In a statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday, the Sheriff’s Department said Huntsman’s letter “failed to provide any actual evidence or new information” and noted that the agency has provided the inspector general with “all legally obtainable information requested.”  
>  
>“This is another irresponsible attempt from Mr. Huntsman to discredit the organization, through omission and misrepresentation,” the department said. “The timing of this letter suggests Mr. Huntsman is using his public office and resources to campaign against the sheriff leading up to the June primaries.”  
>  
>The inspector general’s new figures add to a growing body of information about the secretive groups, which have existed in the Sheriff’s Department for decades. Members typically get matching tattoos and go by names such as the Grim Reapers and Jump Out Boys.  
>  
>What has previously been known about the groups has often been stitched together from allegations and testimony in lawsuits.  
>  
>In a retaliation lawsuit filed by a sheriff’s lieutenant, a deputy associated with the Executioners testified last month that he had participated in deciding who could get a tattoo and had attended seven so-called inking parties.  
>  
>County lawyers instructed the deputy not to answer questions about whether he has the Executioners’ tattoo, which is a skull with a rifle and a military-style helmet, surrounded by flames.  
>  
>The Sheriff’s Department has long faced allegations that the groups run roughshod over several stations, controlling commanders and glorifying aggressive policing tactics.  
>  
>Huntsman told The Times that about a third of the 41 deputies on his list admitted that they had tattoos or belonged to the groups; the rest were identified by other sworn personnel in statements to sheriff’s investigators.  
>  
>In his letter, Huntsman requests that the Sheriff’s Department cooperate with his investigation into the groups by providing investigative files and other documents.  
>  
>“The Sheriff’s Department may not refuse to produce the records requested below by unilaterally declaring that no deputy sheriff is a member of a ‘law enforcement gang,’” Huntsman wrote, adding that the Banditos and Executioners may fall within the state’s definition of such a gang.  
>  
>Sheriff Alex Villanueva has downplayed the issue, saying problems associated with the groups are often the result of drunken deputies getting into fights and taking issue with those who refer to them as “deputy gangs.” Last month, Villanueva sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Board of Supervisors, demanding that they and others stop using the phrase.  
>  
>But he has also taken credit for addressing the problem by instituting a policy that prohibits deputies from joining groups that promote behavior that violates the rights of others.  
>  
>In response to questions from The Times earlier this month, Villanueva said the Sheriff’s Department’s investigation into the Compton Executioners led to two terminations and 13 transfers out of the station.  
>  
>He said he did not know how many deputies were identified as having tattoos and said the name “Executioners” was coined by an attorney.  
>  
>“It was never used on the department at all. No one had any knowledge of that name,” Villanueva said.",t2_17wm9a1h,SpockData,0,1648059754.0,0,t1_i1tsp1i,i1tsp1i,True,Givlytig,t3_tkkphd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoachellaValley/comments/tkkphd/its_riverside_too/,It's Riverside too,/r/CoachellaValley/comments/tkkphd/its_riverside_too/i1tsp1i/,2,r/CoachellaValley,0,2

"Yeah, the romanticism that was taking the train from LA (or San Diego) to Palm Springs during WW II for the USO club seems to have taken a huge hit with the advent of cars offering more on demand and point to point travel than trains did.   

I've gone to the Palm Spring train station a number of times looking for inspiration for photography and I can't think of any time where I have seen another person there, or even a parked car. There are plenty of CCTV cameras, but they seem fixed on door in to the building more than on remote severance of the station and area.   

Freight trains go by but the benches when I've been there have been covered with small dunes of sand the planters have dead plants and oddly no real trash that I recall (perhaps blown away from the wind). There isn't even any good shelter if the wind were to pick up.   

I love the train but if I was going to do Palm Springs I'd pre-arrange an Uber/Lytf to meet me there and expect (guessing) a $20 or so ride in to anyplace you might end up staying at hotel wise.",t2_gz3cb,invalidreddit,0,1647311291.0,0,t1_i0p7wg6,i0p7wg6,False,Remarkable_Ad_3025,t3_tdgego,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoachellaValley/comments/tdgego/train_from_la_to_palm_springs_how_much_if_so/,train from la to palm springs ? how much if so visiting for my first time,/r/CoachellaValley/comments/tdgego/train_from_la_to_palm_springs_how_much_if_so/i0p7wg6/,1,r/CoachellaValley,0,1

using the Nukemap simulator shows that this area isn’t much of a direct percussive hit priority - it’s the fallout / plume we have to be aware of, 30-60 min later (as OP indicated).

"To all those responding with creepy and gross, you are not the people I'm trying to get to know. I'm looking for people with like mindedness not coming here to shame me and a group of people that we all know exist, you are all being a bunch of bigots.
What's the difference between your behavior and that of a gay basher, a racist, or being discriminatory? Why do women, and men get implants? To feel better about themselves and to show off, mind blowing isn't it, one of the many reasons.  Ewww, it's gross to want to babe watch or go hang out a nude club wtheck? It's creepy....lol says the group that are most likely into body shaming as well. Grow up children why are you so accepting of the gays and alphabet soup of genders yet being openly heterosexual with my heterosexual behaviors is a no no.
 I love the female body,  I'm a huge fan btw, I had a beautiful wife that did it for me and now I'm back in the scene, I don't drink,  I don't smoke,  I don't want to hang out at the nude pools all day, all I want to do is socialize, can you not compliment someone's physique anymore? I couldn't because I was married but yeesh people,  your scaring me on how times change, and also the people group you all are, this isn't an accepting community,  you guys are closet bigots and I'm sure in more areas than the one y'all displayed here. 
When I was single 12 years ago the Hyatt, Jw, Renaissance, especially the Miramonte were amazing places to go to babe watch, and show off the latest trends in swimwear, now microkini's, sunglasses, watches, and shaded headwear, not that any of you obviously know anything about that, and... surgeries! Butt, breast, lipo, collagen injections, cellulite removal etc.! What's up with you babe watching bashers! All that stuff exists for MY TYPE OF PEOPLE, and if we really live in an accepting community why is this not absurd as well? Perving out is different, and no means no,  but you guys are going to be the group to outlaw a compliment to a woman and chalk it off as harassment.
You heterosexual bashers are the real weirdos, sad thing is you probably don't know who you have to become to be accepted in your shallow group, no strong self identity with you bunch. You in the Jones of your own group! 
Any way, for those of you still reading this and the person recommending the hike club I think that is a wonderful suggestion and I recently met a fellow into cycling at the gym, and this also makes me think of yoga. Thanks to you all with a real suggestion of what things to do here in the coachella valley not in Los Angeles.

"This is so true. The valley is most definitely more boring for younger crowds than other places, but as with everything, you can find things to enjoy if you just look for them. When I was younger I didn't make an effort to look for things to enjoy here in the valley and complained about the lack of entertainment. However, after visiting different cities, states & countries I can say that my favorite place to live is here in the valley. I even love the summers despite how hot they get, after experiencing 30 summers here, it's got a charm to it that I haven't found elsewhere.   


As far as tips for moving here from elsewhere goes - my best advice for OP is on things to prepare for.   
The summers are extremely hot, whatever home you buy you must make sure it has a working AC or you have the funds to install a working AC, otherwise as a person that hasn't spent summers here before, you'll find yourself hating life here during the summers.   
Late fall and winter nights get very cold, especially the closer you get to the mountains where snow falls, for example the San Jacinto mountains. Have appropriate clothing & blankets for those cold nights, heaters are nice too.  
There are some areas that get reaaaaaaally windy.  I don't want to use words to try to exaggerate it so I'll just say that it's something that you absolutely must do your homework on when looking at the location of your home & the surrounding areas. Those winds are strong; enough so that they can knock big palm trees down when they come through.   


And finally, as you say you're hoping to start a family soon - From my own experience, I would suggest you plan the birth of your child as much as you can. Take into consideration the seasons here in the valley & plan accordingly to your circumstances and experience here.  


All the best to you.",t2_ef0wtn10,JVwx,0,1646468578.0,0,t1_hzfidpf,hzfidpf,False,[deleted],t3_t6tkf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoachellaValley/comments/t6tkf7/moving_from_la_soon/,Moving from LA soon!,/r/CoachellaValley/comments/t6tkf7/moving_from_la_soon/hzfidpf/,2,r/CoachellaValley,0,2
"I moved from LA to Palm Desert around two years ago and am leaving soon. Granted there was a covid lockdown and I work from home but I have never been more isolated, bored and frustrated. The restaurants, bars and live music compared to any city I’ve been to suck. There’s nothing to do if you are not retired. There’s nothing within walking distance so you have to drive to do anything. The summer is miserably hot. Palm Springs has some culture but it’s still a small retirement oriented community.

"The valley's not a young man's game. True there are a lot of older people which is why the valley is tailored for older people. As someone who has lived here for over 30 years (since i was 5) I will agree with you that there is nothing really to do here for a younger crowd. At least that's how it was when I was part of the you get crowd. However, this place gets nicer to love as you get older. You start appreciating the nice things in life as you get older and you'll enjoy it much better. FYI, house prices are rocketing because everyone is moving out here so it must be for a reason right? I doubt it's for the nightlife.

Edit: also, not true that PS has the most going on in the valley. The residents seem to be against growing or expanding so anything new in the valley is either in palm desert, la quinta area.

"Out of all the cities in the valley DHS is the #1 city to avoid. 

I moved from Orange County in 2018 (I'm 32 female) and started in Palm Springs and then moved more East towards La Quinta at the end of 2020. I prefer the Palm Desert/La Quinta/Indian Wells area over Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Indio, and Coachella. It's a day and night difference between east side/west side of the valley. The people are different, the drivers are different (literally everyone drives like shit regardless of where you are though), and the vibe. 

I really like living out here. You're central to a lot of cities like SD, LA, OC, LV, and Arizona, which is nice. It's not as populated as OC or LA (although I feel like we're on track for that with all the building they're doing out here), which is even better (except when the snowbirds come out during winter aka Canadians). Once you've been here long enough you'll realize it's small. Everyone pretty much knows everyone and I love that. Obviously it's more of an older community at the moment, but everyone is nice that I've met out here. 

I think you guys will warm up pretty quickly to the area. Which reminds me, it gets hot AF out here in the Summer so just BE PREPARED.

"I did this. Biggest gripe is healthcare. Almost every healthcare experience I've had has been a service mill (no doctor to talk to - just PA or nurses), or some kinda borderline malpractice situation. I'm pretty young and healthy not picky about doctors at all. Expect a similar level of decline in skill for most high-skill services. Second is the obvious food situation. I'm Asian and kind of a food snob. XD Third is just the general lack of things to do and a general feeling of wastefulness of time. Going from full grind in the Bay Area to this place was a hard adjustment. If you require constant inspiration in life then it'll be tough. As a fairly young entrepreneur I found it hard to stay motivated. Also, you basically cannot go outside in the summer. Another small thing that doesn't get mentioned much is the effect the atmosphere and the sun has on your skin. It hits it pretty hard even if you wear sunscreen all the time.

I think if you agree with the general idea above about grief, everyone is at their own stage right now from beginning to end. I'm sorry to say, I pretty much left demanding or trying to force change back in the Anger and Bargaining stages.

">Development never stops and there won't be anything left in the future if this reckless attitude towards water continues. 

I feel like you're pointing out larger problems we should have focused on beyond how we decide we want to use our water. I'll start with education because my gut feeling is more people in the valley would be against *any* form of water sport/entertainment development than for it, but they aren't even aware how they could prevent it. Or maybe that's just apathy, I don't know. 

I'm sure there's a whole list of other things that would have prevented four surf parks from being in the works here right now, but even if you zoom all the way back to the idea of population control, it probably wouldn't have been enough. Personally, I think we're probably far beyond fixing the major issues like climate closing in on us that are leading to collapse, so most of the time I'm less and less particularly concerned with relatively small stuff that's not gonna really move the needle. All we can do is slow the inevitable just a fraction. 

To me, the minute the first white devil stepped foot into valley (or the continent for that matter) and decided called it home, it was all over. It was simply a matter of time before he destroyed it all, and unfortunately most of us now have a front seat to the last act of this horror show.

Water on the surface here will be evaporated at high rates and often will not precipitate out due to the temperatures not dropping below the necessary dew point, thus there is no natural recharge to the water table. Hence, recharging the aquifer with Colorado River water.

"I don't disagree with you in that generally speaking, any water waste is awful. But it's interesting the singling out of surf parks thats going on when there's so much blatently wasteful businesses, developments, and other sources I've never seen people spend a single breath on. Not the huge marijuana grow operations, or the Splash City water park in Palm Springs, or again, literally every goddamn golf course littering the entire valley. Why is a project that apparently will use the same amount of water as a few dozen homes so triggering--because it has the the word ""surf"" in it? 

I definitely suggest even people looking forward to the parks to go to the meetings and push back hard as hell on the developers to justify building them, and force them to come up with and spend the money on being as environmentally conscious as possible. Protest them if necessary. If building them is a foregone conclusion, maybe they could be made to scale them back, or use better technology that lessened evaporaration rate or something. 

In addition though, I think the entire valley should spend much more time and resources on enforcing non-residential water waste as a whole, no matter the source. 

I don't think people making 250 miles round trip excursions to the ocean from the desert is a good alternative environmentally to surf parks, especially considering climate change is partially what's causing the drought in the first place. Maybe unless you they all happened to drive electric car or something, lol, but that's another environmental problem by itself. 

And I appreciate the argument made in that Desert Sun letter, but I'm not quite buying all the points she's trying to force onto these projects, least of which is her math. And she kinda lost me on the absurd notion that a couple water parks are going to change the humidity profile of the entire desert, haha. ""What about the extra humidity these projects will add in the summer? No more “dry heat.” Does she really think there won't be any more dry heat because of some big pools? 

Her idea about golf courses ""can use non-potable water, and the watered grass adds oxygen to the atmosphere"" is somewhat interesting though, and I honestly don't know enough about how their systems work to completely understand how valid her point is. Is she suggesting that golf course water could never be diverted and turned into drinking water and therefore they aren't wasting it?

"I like the people here, including the Canadians who descend on the area in winters pre-COVID.  I like most of the locals too.  Although a rainy day is enjoyable, having only a few really rainy days a years is just fine by me.  

The area is just beautiful with the mountains close all around, especially in the winter with the snow capped peaks.  The palm trees make living here feel like being in a Dr. Seuss illustration. 

Lack of snow and freezing temperatures is a definite plus in my book.  I enjoy looking at the snow from a distance and listening to my friends complain about it during the winter months.

I live in a less windy area and really enjoy the occasional windstorm, although they leave a mess to clean up. 

(I spent years living in the Bay Area and know exactly what you're leaving.) 

Downside:  The health care in Coachella Valley is pretty crappy IMO, and more so in the past few years.  Specialists are especially bad and more than a few drive hours to see doctors in L.A. at the excellent medical centers there.  

Besides that the only thing I really don't like about living in the CV is the extreme summer heat.  Anything above maybe 105 is pretty miserable, especially in the sun.  I consider it a reasonable trade off for the other months of the year, especially if you're able to escape it for a few weeks. 

In reality it just means we're trapped mostly indoors a different time of the year than my friends further east.  They enjoy hearing me complain about the heat in the summer, maybe more than I enjoy hearing them bitch about the snow. 

I hope you enjoy it here as much as I do.",t2_11sydj,raptorbluez,0,1643420541.0,0,t1_hunxy15,hunxy15,True,Overall_Rise_6370,t3_sf4xly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoachellaValley/comments/sf4xly/relocating_from_nor_calbay_area_to_coachella_v/,Relocating from Nor Cal/Bay Area to Coachella V alley,/r/CoachellaValley/comments/sf4xly/relocating_from_nor_calbay_area_to_coachella_v/hunxy15/,4,r/CoachellaValley,0,4
"Grew up in Mendocino. A lot of the misgivings I have here are just due to the nature of living in a larger town. Traffic, less community, that sort of thing. I really miss the climate at home. It's borderline unlivable here for atleast a third of the year. Another weird thing I've had trouble with is medical care. It's really difficult to get ahold of doc offices and what not. No one returns phone calls. It's also been a real struggle to find good work for me.

However, there is a lot more spunk to the people that do live here. People are more colorful on average, I think. And it may be hot as hell in the summer but at least we never have to turn on the heater. Do keep an eye on your car though.

"Grew up in the bay, lived in Boise and San Diego before moving permanently to the valley. Disliked the heat the first year but you get used to it. The lack of Asian markets is a bummer but the abundance of Mexican markets is awesome. There are still plenty of Asian restaurants, especially closer to La Quinta. 

The absolute non existence of good public transit is my other biggest complaint, and that’s even living near a bus stop. Owning a car is a must. But the lack of traffic year round makes up for the lack of public transit. Also, as some one who flies a lot for work. I really like PSP airport. I love the architecture and outdoor activities everywhere. The valley is a whole lot less crowded. My biggest tip is not making the typical comment to other valley residents “EVERYTHING IS SO CHEAP AND AFFORDABLE OUT HERE!!!” My Bay Area friends that visit annoy locals with that, but it was the same in Boise, SD, and anywhere else besides NYC and Hong Kong lol.",t2_knopi,AVGASismyGatorade,0,1643416479.0,0,t1_hunp012,hunp012,True,Overall_Rise_6370,t3_sf4xly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoachellaValley/comments/sf4xly/relocating_from_nor_calbay_area_to_coachella_v/,Relocating from Nor Cal/Bay Area to Coachella V alley,/r/CoachellaValley/comments/sf4xly/relocating_from_nor_calbay_area_to_coachella_v/hunp012/,10,r/CoachellaValley,0,10

"I agree that people have no idea what goes on on the valley, nor do they want to know. I got banned from the PS sub for making people aware there is actually crime in their ""resort town"". You sound like you definitely know the crime spots waay more than I would ever want to, lol. 

Personally I find the history or crime in the valley fascinating as hell from the old school gangsters hanging out in DHS and Palm Springs back in the day  to the contrast between it being a sleepy retirement/resort area yet having young gangbangers, drug cartels, and human trafficking passing through here all the time, as well as some spooky tribal and government shit that's gone down. 

There's something about the idea of a tourist and/or rich person just absolutely cluelessly and carelessly doing their thing in ""paradise"" and some of the worst predators are lurking 2 or 3 blocks away that intrigues me for some reason. I realize its not unique to the desert, but having first been that clueless tourist for a long time before actually moving here, then seeing the other side of it was an eye opener. 

There's a local business guy that wrote a book on Palm Springs crime stories a while back that was pretty interesting. Can't remember the name offhand, and the actual writing wasn't that great, but the idea itself and some of the stories were excellent. 

I don't want to call this place a ""shit hole"" because the beauty and sacred nature of the land itself has always spoken to me, and I appreciate being able to enjoy what the outdoors part of it offers, which to me is priceless.

"There are some hardy sould who commute by bus and even by bicycle here in the desert.  They do so pretty much out of necessity.  No one in their right mind would do so by choice during the summer months.  In addition to that, the bus is sort of limited in coverage area.  For example, if you live somewhere on Monterey ave. you will be walking from almost everywhere to Fred Waring or 111 to catch the bus.  And Monterey ave. runs from basically 1000  Palms to almost the Pacific Ocean.    Even just to where Monterey and 111 becomes Highway 74 and 111, to the foothills is several miles.  And there are a LOT of communities on that stretch of road.   They either drive cars or golf carts.  There are a couple of taxi companies but they are not cheap.

"Don’t recommend relying on the bus system, as someone who has rode those buses for years at different times in my youth. Always smell like piss, homeless & drugged out people on them who will try to talk to you or start fights with others if they’re not nodding off. Not to mention long wait times & the schedule is never clear like half the time a bus won’t show up when it’s supposed to & the drivers will take 15 minute breaks every few routes even when it’s not on the schedule to sometimes, causing you to be late. Plus the desert is laid out with cities mostly side to side, so if you’re in Rancho Mirage but want to get to Palm Springs, you’re looking at an hour to an hour & a half bus ride with two to three transfers to diff buses.

"Wow! This is super insightful. I am trying to do this on the cheap, but I won't go as far as building anything on it yet. My current plan is to secure the location, hook up a water meter, fence the property off, grade it, plant some mature trees, and plants, and work on making the place be pleasant as it can be. 

After all this is done I'll focus on renting the place out for special events and recreation to help me save for the next developments.

"I was given a price of 10,000 to 12,000 for a standard 1"" meter from DWA. The water service is already at the street, otherwise it would cost more. The biggest concern was the proximity of the existing fire hydrants to my land. Since fire sprinklers are now required on all new construction, the property needed to be within a certain amount of feet to a fire hydrant, otherwise they will require a larger meter opening, and from my understanding, the 2"" meter essentially doubles the price to 20,000-24,000. 

The planning department is the one who initiates everything, so call them first and makes some friends over there. My experience with them has been extremely pleasant... these people WANT to help you build, and I can't say enough good things about how helpful they were. 

I was told that the first step is to submit construction drawings, and no permits will be issued until that has happened. This is my experience with Riverside county; if you are within City Limits, you will likely have more restrictions on top of that. The construction drawings have to be to a certain standard as well, and I believe they can charge you for anything that requires extra time to figure out.

I'm guessing that you are trying to do this in stages, on the cheap? If so, think about buying, off the shelf house plans from a place like: https://www.floorplans.com and have an engineer adjust the plans to be more sight specific, and submit those. It will clear the way for a water permit, but keep in mind, that if you don't start construction within a year, your building permit will expire. 

After looking at several options myself, I'm leaning towards a construction loan, and letting a builder do it all for me. I found an architect/engineer/builder in PS that will take my plans and give me a house for around $300,000, for a 1,500 sq ft, 2 master bedroom, 2.5 bath house. Problem with going that way is we will have to do it on the contractor's timeline, so likely over a year to start, and another year to build. I hope some of this helps!",t2_ddal8ki0,tree24hugger,0,1642448174.0,0,t1_ht2rypc,ht2rypc,True,CAFritoBandito,t3_s68q7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoachellaValley/comments/s68q7s/property_development_questions/,Property Development Questions,/r/CoachellaValley/comments/s68q7s/property_development_questions/ht2rypc/,2,r/CoachellaValley,0,2
">GOP Rep. Ken Calvert’s campaign once sent pink-colored mailers asking whether his gay Democratic challenger would be “a congressman for Riverside … or San Francisco?”

>Almost 30 years later, Calvert, who also voted to ban same-sex marriage, wants to represent Palm Springs, one of America’s most LGBTQ-friendly cities. 

And

>In an emailed statement, Calvert said he “simply reject(s) any notion that I’ve attacked LGBTQ people.”

What a typical GQP move - saying voters should ignore their own eyes and ears because he says so.

This ass has no place representing Palm Springs or anywhere else with substantial LGTBQ populations.

"I honestly couldn't get it out of my head, it's so sad from many different perspectives, and again it also seems cinematic, almost as if I've seen it before somewhere. I ran the story through my mind last night as it were a short film showing the incident individually five times from the perspective first of the burro, the Toyota driver who hit it, the girl who stopped to help and was killed, the drunk driver who killed her, and even the first responder who came up on the aftermath of that horrible scene. 

If you imagine what happened from each of their separate perspectives, it doesn't make it any less tragic, but the story becomes much more real instead of just a headline about a drunk driver killing someone trying to save a burro. The fact that it happened late at night on a dark desert road is kinda what made me originally think of David Lynch, but the story for me now doesn't actually have any sort of twisted or distorted elements to it when I think what each one involved went through, what each of their experiences might have been, even what led each of them to that exact spot at that exact time. 

The burro just walking through the desert on a quiet night, maybe hears another burro on the other side of the and heads in that direction to cross but doesn't see the head lights from the Toyota moving toward it... 

The poor driver in the Toyota just heading home as usual and suddenly sees something jump in front of her car having no idea what it is, smashes into it, pulls her car over to the side, it's not dead but probably making all kinds of screaming noises, then witnesses another driver who stopped to help suddenly get hit by a car that comes out of nowhere at full speed and both cars smash into hers. Think about that aftermath from her perspective out in the middle of nowhere. Three smashed up, smoking cars, a half dead burro, and two other drivers who most likely appeared dead.

">I think the “not touristy” aspect is the allure.

Yeah, no. There would be 0 demand. The part where you're seeing about populations swelling in the winter is mostly snowbirds, meaning canadians and midwesterners who *own* houses here already and come down for the winter. Nobody is going to rent for 5 months in borrego lmfao. Just doesn't happen. 

Like I said, if you want an easy to maintain airbnb property go to los angeles or san diego. Coachella Valley as a whole is *extremely* hostile to abb's and other desert communities likely would be too. If you're planning on spending a million on a rental property there's far better places to do it that are going to be a far smaller pain in the ass.

"They're going up for a couple reasons.

1. Remote working has made it so people who work in LA and make 100k a year for a basic desk job can now move to cheaper locations 

2. COVID related supply chain issues have caused the cost of building new homes to skyrocket, this has caused rent to follow suit as the supply/demand gets evermore off balance.

Know that doesn't really help you, but things will come down a little and stabilize, experts are estimating late this year we should see it. Only advice I really could offer is

A: look for higher paying jobs that allow remote working (jobs based in big cities like LA or San Diego) you'd probably still have to commute to once or twice a week it would be worth it.

B: if your field isnt one where you can work remotely (which I feel you, I definitely cannot), consider moving outside of the valley to mecca, Salton city, north shore, etc... For a few years till things stabilize.

"You want a safe area that is nice to grow a family? I recommend North Indio. Good schools over on that side of the freeway with an area much like downtown laquinta and expanding. Honestly, don't go to Coachella. There are so many other more affordable and nicer locations. Honestly if I were to rank the areas in the valley from best to worst to raise a family:

Indian Wells

Palm Desert

North Indio

Rancho Mirage

La Quinta

Bermuda Dunes

Thousand Palms

Palm Springs

Cathedral City

Indio

Desert Hot Springs

Coachella

That said, there are better and worse places in each of these locations. A few of these are also close ties with each other. It mostly comes down to what it is you want for your family, where you job is, and what kind of community are you looking for? Do you want to be able to walk around safely at night? Do you want to be able to be near shopping? Entertainment? Friends?

Most of these answers are going to be near palm desert. The heart of the desert. There is realatively little to do in the area of Coachella.

That being said, my daughter chose to buy a home in east Palm Desert just because it’s more centrally located.  More to do for young families.

"Pretty much every city in the valley has areas/neighborhoods that are safer than others, but speaking in ""general"" Coachella isn't known for being safe-- mainly due to gangs and the overall poverty level. I would rank it probably as bad as Desert Hot Springs and maybe a bit worse than Palm Springs in terms of crime. I don't know if their particular gangs are necessarily more violent, but there are just more numbers of them. I'm pretty sure it has the highest unemployment level anywhere in the valley.

I actually can't think of a single thing to do in Coachella, that's to say there's nothing I would make it a point to go there for. And when I have to go there, I don't linger--get in, get out. Luckily, La Quinta isn't too far away since there's way more to do. 

I have no idea what the school system is there or what private schools are nearby, but I would definitely research if you're gonna have kids. Also, I'm sure you can get way, way more housing for your money compared to almost anywhere, but how much are property taxes, how much will they be increasing, and what will property values do? 

Just to be clear, I'm not trying to dump on the *people* in Coachella, because to be honest I've met some of the absolute nicest people in the entire valley there by far. Humble, hard working, family oriented, fun, not pretentious. I can't say that for a lot, or even most, areas around here.

"The city of Coachella has a bad rep in the CV. However, I personally love Coachella compared to other nearby areas. 

The major demographic are working-class families, and the city has grown exponentially in the past five years. I have a feeling that buying a home in Coachella is a worthwhile investment because housing prices in the area are rising quickly. 

I think other areas, like Palm Springs, are much more dangerous and easy for your kids to get into trouble when they get older. It's like any area; if you look for trouble you can find it, but if you keep to yourself, you'll be fine.

Edit: as you can see in other comments, some of the stigma against Coachella is because a majority of families are recent immigrants to the US and a lot of them work in the fields.

But on the flip side I can help you find a breeder within 3hrs drive depending on what breed you want. Be aware that you’ll be paying 50$ instead of 18$ considering you get a guarantee on it being breed ethically and taken care of until they are of age to be given to you.

The fact that they're basically only a mile or so from a Sam's and Costco might keep them on their toes though. Actually, I just see now they're only beating Sam's by a penny today. The fact that they don't require membership, are open 24/7, no lines, and easier to get in and out put them well ahead to me. 

The service manager at a dealership I bought a car from several years ago told me to stay clear of Costco gas, I wish I could remember why. I just know I had my car in for some reason and the first thing he asked me was if I'd been using Costco gas. I had, and he said something about he saw a lot of people who used them had similar problems and he basically was adamant about not using their gas, so I've always just kind of avoided them, at least in my newer cars.

"No idea what ""Marine base"" your talking about because the closest one is in 29 Palms.  The last thing the military needs is to be diefied, especially in a community and city that has people that do way more for thier community.  

A mural like the one you talk about would just be another example of military appreciation being a mile wide and an inch deep.  If you want to legitimately support veterans, go volunteer at the local VFW, or donate to a veteran service org.  There are people is Congressman Ruiz' office that do more for veterans in a day than a stupid mural would do for veterans in a century.

"OP's username checks out for this investigation. 

From your link: 

""a respite for and marketed to State Departments, foreign dignitaries, diplomats, Fortune 500 executives and their boards, ultra high net worth individuals and their families and celebrities.""

That explains the 24 foot wall, turrets, armed security, dogs, and yes, maybe even the moat, lol. 

If you're already in the State Department, ultra high net worth, or celebrity, or are willing to become one (or fake it very very well) to find out what's going on, then getting to the bottom of it will be a lot easier :)

Otherwise, I think those unemployed balloon pilots probably know more than most. Easy to track down through the dozens of lawsuits records. 

I get a religious vibe only because it sounds a bit like Scientology's playbook up in their Hemet compound, although a bit more essentric. I guess nothing can be ruled out nowadays, even Epstein-type idea as u/SandstormShaman said. Or probably more likely, it could just be a wealthy family and maybe they built it to attract and associate with all those elites they are apparently marketing to. 

I will venture to guess 90 percent of them fly into Thermal Airport because it's perfect for accommodating private jets for those who want to keep a low profile in the East valley. If you were determined you could probably piece together what planes are coming in there on the regular and from where and figure out who they're carrying.
