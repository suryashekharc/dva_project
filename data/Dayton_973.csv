"Well this probably won't be any actual help ..because I don't know for sure .. but I thought most properties just went to the curb were it ends. And the street is thus public property/city property.  
     And anyone could park a vehicle on it as long as there was nothing else posted stating something different ..  but could be any number of cars in all fairness someone parking that dies not have a property close by or in the area at all.

So it's kinda like a first come first served basis ..just as much as you have a right to park anywhere on the street as you do. The same right goes to any and everyone else to do the same...

But again I don't know for sure ...just what I thought or assumed to be that way my life of 46 years ...could be totally wrong !!

"I'm quite a bit late to this but love living downtown so I have to chime in.  I am in my early thirties and have lived downtown for 4 years, downtown proper for 3.  I'm in south park now, but lived 100 N Jefferson, pre-remodel.  Prices to live downtown proper have definitely gone up.  I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find something under $800 for downtown proper.  Average is probably $1K, if not higher.  I will say that it is a lot of fun, especially if you like to go out.  There are so many breweries, bars, and restaurants that have been added.  There's also ax throwing at twosocial along with arcade games.  Oregon is always a good time, especially with them starting DORA, shutting down the street and allowing people to drink outside on it.  I'm really hoping the festivals pick up again this year.  There feels like there is something at Riverscape every weekend in the summer.  Dragon's games are cheap and are a blast.  I miss looking out my window and seeing the street was crowded with cars, then walking around to investigate and discovering a festival at riverscape, an event at the convention center, a free concert at Levitt, etc.  Highly suggest it.

"Nick Adam at Union Savings Bank is familiar with multiple downpayment assistance programs. I've used one on both houses I've bought.

Some have max income requirements, or requirements for how long you need to stay there (otherwise you pay it back), etc, but some don't. The downside is that you need to use an FHA loan and will probably have PMI (I think?) on your monthly payment, so it'll be a higher payment than conventional.

"They don't return the money because they spend it running your legal, credit and rental history through a consistent single third party giving every applicant to that landlord equal chances of past history being discovered.

It protects the landlords from discrimination allegations when they turn away undesirable tenants.  Being stuck in a lease where the landlord has no discretion on your potential neighbors is no good, living in an apartment where the landlord can't afford basic maintenance because they have too few regularly paying tenants is no good neither is it good to live somewhere that spends all the upkeep money dealing with discrimination allegations.

Trying to enforce fairness through bureaucracy is never free and that cost is always passed to the consumer.

Trying to use a background check designed for one purpose as a substitute for another is usually unacceptable on principal.  It doesn't answer the right questions 

Trying to use a correct type of check from another source isn't the kind of blind fairness most landlords need to keep themselves out of the way of discrimination allegations.

"Trash is costing the citizens of Ohio over $4,000,000 in taxes every year to clean up.

March and April is when the majority of trash is picked up, for us here in the Miami Valley the cost was $462,957 in 2020.

Moral of the story we either spend our money employing hundreds/thousands of people to pick up our area OR we find a better system of ridding our trash.

Do we not have enough trash cans in the city itself? 

Perhaps it starts with the individual and then on to education within the primary schools. Adults are harder to teach, but we could come together on this as a city and turn it around.

"These ""rules and procedures"" were not approved until after the first non-endorsed Democratic candidate came onto the commission in 2018 and then they didn't try to update until the second non-endorsed candidate in 2022. Needless to say it's suspicious. But more importantly if the public is now demanding week after week that these rules be removed due to undemocratic process and certain commissioners do not allow it to happen...we have a clear answer on what they prioritize and don't mind wavering on (democracy)

Before 2018 there was not an openly discussed problem of wasteful items. The manufactured concern seems to lie with having non-endorsed candidates who answer to the public more so the party. Commissioners are non-partisan positions so it's frustrating to watch party politics waste all this administrative time revising and shifting the agenda when they could have removed it at least a week ago if they simply drafted a resolution to repeal it after the March 2nd meeting. 

Also please keep in mind the commission does have charter rules and sunshine laws to follow so it's not like they don't have anything to help guide meetings and decisions around the meetings. They operated for decades without theses rules & procedures and most certainly they can operate decades more without it and ensure that citizens can elect five equally empowered and responsible legislators.

"It's absolutely not a waste of time to develop legislation that the public has buy-in on. Legislation regarding housing or infrastructure would address concerns that the public has expressed often about. The public also NEEDS to see what commissioners vote for and against so they can make informed decisions on who the choose to vote for or not. Also their opinions should be moved by the public not just back door conversations. Per sunshine laws no more than two commissioners are supposed to discuss interests regarding the public so they need to be having all these conversations in a public forum. If a commissioner disagrees they need to state why or let his vote openly for the public to judge.

The notion that the city does not have resources for legislation to be discussed is not accurate narrative. The City of Dayton has just gotten a lot of money due to the pandemic. And while they are suffering employee shortages they also have not stressed creatively to keep and recruit talent to the city.

If you have any further information on what Ohio cities do, please share. So far we do know they don't have a requirement for two commissioners to co-sign.

Overall this is a transparency and democracy issue because the commissioners should be moved by the citizens and public input and we the public can't have that if these conversations don't come to a public forum.",t2_k6po8kgx,gemhemtwo,0,1647623793.0,0,t1_i16d9fd,i16d9fd,False,gemhemtwo,t3_tgl0yl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dayton/comments/tgl0yl/letter_petition_repeal_the_city_of_dayton_city/,"Letter Petition: Repeal the ""City of Dayton City Commission Rules of Procedure and Order""",/r/dayton/comments/tgl0yl/letter_petition_repeal_the_city_of_dayton_city/i16d9fd/,1,r/dayton,0,1

Having the legal department spend time drafting things or the Commission spend time discussing it when the response of 3/5 of the body is effectively ""lol - No"" out of the gate is a complete waste of time.

Many other Ohio cities do not have this rule because they don't need it, almost every larger sized legislative body has some minimal requirement to get a topic on the docket because otherwise you just get bogged down in listening to things you know the majority of the body is going to vote down.
