"Those are the basics and I already know those things. Which I stay on a A1A right on Atlantic. Which on the beach I don't know where the locals go and I know that there's tourists and I see a lot of them around on the beach. So I need names of the specific places where locals go, because I don't want to go to a place that's just going to be full of only tourists (which I see that many places are like this).

Also I already know about those plazas, game time and everything that you mentioned, those are some of the vague things that I already know about the area in general. Which I heard that the plaza on LPGA may be getting a movie theater there as well. They said that they were in talks with a major chain (but won't say what chain) to put a theater there in that plaza, which they're still seems like there's plenty of space and things still getting built over there (which I'm keeping my fingers crossed that If a movie theater comes that It has IMAX).

The only thing I dislike about Daytona, (which may be minor) is the fact that there is no IMAX movie theater in Daytona and or any of the surrounding areas. Which I came from an area where I had an IMAX and Dobly vision movie theater approximately 7 minutes away from me. I say this because I'm a huge movie buff and I love to collect blu-rays, 4K UHD blu-rays and also go to the theater and watch a lot of movies, so I really don't want to drive 1 hour away to the closest IMAX at Altamonte Mall. I mean not to get into this, but if I were to go see the new Batman movie it's 3 hours and so this would be would be a 5-hour event because I need 2 hours to drive (1 hour to the theater and 1 hour back) on top of watching a movie. Which honestly this is a huge turn off for me and wouldn't make me not want to see the movie until it becomes available on a streaming service etc (which I'm definitely not going to see this at Cobb theater in standard quality lol).",t2_7s8pxji,Bigj0123,0,1648127829.0,0,t1_i1xdiks,i1xdiks,False,Bigj0123,t3_tm73ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaytonaBeach/comments/tm73ww/new_to_the_area_and_need_some_advice/,New to the area and need some advice?,/r/DaytonaBeach/comments/tm73ww/new_to_the_area_and_need_some_advice/i1xdiks/,1,r/DaytonaBeach,0,1

"Daytona Beach is a tourist spot. Keep that in mind. With nascar/race events, motorcycle events 2x a year, jeep week, and spring break to name a few. If you aren't used to living near a vacation destination I would stay away from Daytona Beach itself. Areas outside of Daytona along the coast from the North: Ormond to Flager/Palm Coast and to the South: South Daytona to Edgewater. Also keep in mind hurricanes. Make sure to check flood zones, this will also impact homeowner's insurance rates. The closer you are to the intercostal/ocean storm surge will impact those areas. Research hurricane preparedness. I would say Port Orange has been a major destination for growing families; some of the best schools are located there and so Port Orange has been booming with new housing and the amount of restaurants/strip malls/shopping areas have been steadily growing as well. There has been a lot of growth around Daytona in the 13 years I've lived here so far, and it's not stopping.

"If you go down past Daytona Beach on atlantic ave, there is Ponce Inlet. Before that at some point there is a great spot 4280 S Atlantic Ave, Port Orange, FL 32127. This should bring you to a spot where there is free parking on the side of Atlantic and it is WAY less busy than Daytona. You may only see a few people rather then 10s of hundreds. It is way more peaceful, less bums and possible drunk violent people. Definitely more family friendly, my family and I go down here instead of the main beach and we're locals. Honestly I would also not go down to the beach at dark either if that was one of your plans.

There’s a pier there (sunglow pier) for some added scenery you can walk out on (has a restaurant but you don’t need to patronize it to walk out on the pier) Can walk right through the restaurant and onto the fishing pier section without any cost

"I started at ERAU in fall 91. That next spring was my first bike week. 

At the time, freshmen weren't allowed cars, but motorcycles were OK. A friend and I rode all over during all of the biker events. 

Worst traffic awareness I've ever seen.  I personally saw a guy on a chopper lose balance and get run over by a van. 

After awhile, we'd drive to the HD dealership (which was kind of on beach and main at the time) and park ASAP. 

Lots of showboating. Lots of fights. Too much drinking. Too many ""DOT"" approved Tupperware helmets combined with no riding gear.

"It used to be daily until sunset, but that was before all the issues. More recently it seemed to be open or closed week to week. I haven't checked closely in the last year, but I think more people can and are going now. It is why I don't think it was worth it before. It was closed at one point for a couple of months while they did some fixes, but of course no refunds or credit for all the time lost.

My understanding is the group that purchased the golf course wants/wanted to dump the pool since it isn't a moneymaker and needs so many repairs. I believe they were even willing to give it back to the HOA, but because the current owners let it fall into such disrepair it would be a burden/debt for the HOA to take on. Pretty much no one wants to touch it.

Overall, it seems the golf course owners kind of fucked the community. They didn't keep it up and running, now they want people to spend an excessive amount for membership to continue to fix all the issues. The alternative plan is dump it on the HOA so they have to increase dues to fix the pool (health/safety concern) whether people are members or not (since membership alone doesn't cover everything).

I believe guest passes are/were $10.

Edit: Oh and the newer owners are kind of dicks. Just remembered I walked up to the gate about 4 months ago to see what, if any, improvements had been done. A women in a black Mercedes asked what my business was being on the ramp leading up to the pool (gate was closed so I did not go in). I told her I was just looking at the changes. She told me it was private property and I needed to leave. I explained I was a resident and had stopped by while getting the mail (obvious since I walked in sandals to the mailboxes), she rolled her eyes and sped off. Golf course workers identified who she was.

"Yeah, to be a little more clear. The slide was built into the hill. Like you had to take stairs up to the top. Then you slide down the concrete slide built into the hill on foam mats. It wasn't like a cheap metal slide or anything small. It was impressive for the time.

Cabana had cheap burgers and hotdogs, and like 50 cent sodas so you could spend a few hours there having fun. Then I would say 80% of the children grew up and moved away. Now it's primarily older family members, so the pool has a chair to lift people in and out of the water. The good news is, a lot of younger families have seemed to be moving in, or coming back having grown up there. Curious to see what the community looks like in 10 years.

"Affordable Auto Pros on the corner of Ridgewood and Beville. I found these guys one day when I was about to leave trip across a couple states and realized I had a headlight out in a car that needs some tools to access the headlight housing which I did not have handy.

I stopped at 2 other shops in the area and the cheapest quote was $80 for the job but luckily neither had a mechanic available to do it immediately. I drove down the road, saw Affordable and pulled up. I explained my dilemma and they told me to pop the hood. Two employees came over and went to work on it right away getting the bulb replaced. I asked them what I owed and they told me nothing, they were happy to help. They also then went around and checked all my other lights. I made sure to tip them well.

I’ve been back for a few other services since from routine maintenance to a little bit more in depth like belt replacements and always the service is quick friendly and reasonably priced. They never try to upsell me or get me to have work done that isn’t needed.I would highly recommend this shop",t2_5767xymy,iLikeRandomDMs,0,1646365853.0,0,t1_hz9vgcs,hz9vgcs,True,PsychologicalRough60,t3_t5o44t,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaytonaBeach/comments/t5o44t/honest_mechanics_for_basic_services/,Honest mechanics for basic services?,/r/DaytonaBeach/comments/t5o44t/honest_mechanics_for_basic_services/hz9vgcs/,3,r/DaytonaBeach,0,3

In daytona, honestly, you’ll have better luck if you’re open to all age groups as friends.  Older people tend to be better friends anyways because they are good conversationalists, they are more creative with activities to do, and if they’re retired they have plenty of free time.

"trying to give you the best information:

* like any city, there are good and bad parts.
* renting rather than buying will give you an idea of what parts you like and what parts you don't.
* like many other warmer-weather areas, the ""work from anywhere"" trend combined with low interest rates has caused an influx of full-time residents and pushed both rental and house prices up.  This has, in turn, made life more expensive for a lot of people who have been here for a while.
* Daytona Beach itself is a ""medium"" sized city; we don't have a major sports team and no real sky scraper buildings. By comparison, Tampa and Orlando look huge.
* the average income around Daytona has historically been relatively depressed because the main industry around here is tourism and entertainment. As more people with higher incomes move here, that dynamic may change.
* there is no big state university in Daytona (though there is BCU, an HBCU, Embry Riddle, an aeronautics-focused university and Daytona State College, a former community college that was recently promoted to being a teaching-only state college).  The lack of the big state U (IMO) limits some of the economic growth opportunities in these parts.
* **(warning, wildly speculative statement follows!)** if you drive the entire east coast of Florida, from Key West to Jacksonville, Daytona is probably the place with some of the most opportunities in terms of lower priced housing nearest to the beach. I bought a nice house for a ridiculously low price in 2011 and, IMO, the prices near the beach are still pretty attractive, especially if you compare them to the Ft. Lauderdale or Miami areas.
* I'm originally from NJ. There is very little that could ever convince me to move back to that area. I'm sick of the cold, the traffic, the jughandles and the taxes.
* there are ""good"" events that come through that bring in a lot of out-of-town people (I count Bike Week and Race Week among these); there are also ""bad"" events that just bring in the a\_\_holes.

"The variety of responses in this thread is interesting. As someone who has spent time in Daytona and is looking at buying a small place near the beach, I'm interested in each commenter's perspective.

The bullet points below are what I believe to be true. Please tell me where you think I'm wrong!

\-It seems like the natives are less satisfied with and complimentary of Daytona than the transplants. (Not saying either side is right or wrong; the diversity of opinions is what this thread is for. Though the comments about Daytona being filled with bad people are certainly a bit of a concern.)

\-The non-tourism components of the local economy aren't great. I would be very curious to isolate feedback between residents with remote jobs vs. residents who work in tourist-facing/service industry jobs vs. residents who are limited to the remaining local job market.

\-As far as beach towns go, Daytona is very cheap. For someone who is looking to live right next to the ocean, to buy a house in walking distance to the beach, you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere cheaper in the U.S. If you don't value the beach aspect, then you might be able to get more bang for your buck elsewhere.

\-For a city of its size, Daytona has a very favorable airport situation. If you're willing to connect in Charlotte/Atlanta, you can reach most destinations from the local airport (where you can arrive 45 minutes before departure since security is a breeze). If you want a cheap direct flight almost anywhere, you have that option just over an hour away at MCO. To have those two choices is actually a bit of a luxury.

\-Compared to larger metropolitan areas, Daytona is a small city with less to ""do."" If you're someone who would prefer to be in an area with 1M+ people, Orlando, Jacksonville, or numerous other city centers are going to be more satisfactory.

"As someone who worked in the hospitality industry for years, you can make good money during event weeks, but will otherwise do just ok. Idk what you're making now, but if you're able to live in NYC on it, it's a hell of a lot more than you'll make here. Your rent is probably gonna be pushing 2k/month and a bartender can reasonably expect to make 30-40k/yr. I have not been in hospitality for about 8 years, though income has been stagnant for at least as long.

Other people have already mentioned the lack of things to do, but I will emphasize it, there is absolutely NOTHING to do around here. Every time we want to do something, the first question isnt what do you want to do, it's ""Orlando or Jacksonville?"".

"I moved from Milwaukee about 4 years ago. Yes i know that Milwaukee is not New York but its closer to each other than Daytona is.
The biggest thing for me is its a small city. It is nothing like city life. Which yes is nice on vacation but certain things you get use to...anything and everything open late, something always to do.. are not present here. Im in the ormond area and after about 8 pm its fast food only. 
For me the big thing was cost of living is more than Milwaukee (im sure its less than new york), but wages are way less! Volusia county is one of the lowest paying counties in florida, so dont expect to make anywhere near you made.  
Everything isnt all negative, yes weather is always nice and the beach is always nice! I do find myself going to Orlando a lot though, which is about an hour away.

Also Williamson Blvd South all the way north to LPGA Blvd had many nice new apartments. Daytona is pure trash, so is Holly Hill and Southern Ormond area.

"It’s not even really that there’s a ton of crime in daytona—I’ve lived alone as a single woman in daytona for close to a decade—the quality of people are just…….trashy.  Things are not taken care of, lots of functioning addicts, families of seven living in a two bedroom house, squatters, slumlords, people looking to take advantage of their elderly neighbors, lots of “Florida men” doing Florida man shit.
