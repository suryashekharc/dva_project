Others have mentioned this, but it’s not really a “college town”, it’s a town that happens to have a college. A lot of the students come from the Chicago suburbs, and seem to go back constantly. Maybe because of that the town didn’t really have much of what I’m used to in college towns (certainly not all of the fun festivals and traditions that Ithaca has, like porchfest, streets alive, grassroots, chili/apple/Ithaca-fest, etc.).

"College town also gets pretty bad especially on weekends. And having the most central part of downtown where we all gotta drive through to go anywhere be congested so frequently and with roads in need of constant repair it’s just a bit of a nuisance. Add the “Disneyland traffic” 4 times a year, and roads destroyed by winter and semis on cheaply built roads and your bound to get complaints. I lived in California and went to LA a lot and nothing compares to that level of traffic, but for as small as Ithaca is, there’s a lot of people on the road and not a lot of road for them to drive on. I’m a delivery driver year round so I spend a lot of time out there and while it’s certainly not *terrible*, it doesn’t compare to places in the Midwest where cities were built around rounds and not the other way around. I think Cortland is a great example of we could follow, their roads are very nice and spacious despite having less people on them. Unfortunately Ithaca just doesn’t have a lot of room to expand the roads without closing businesses, so we’re just kinda stuck with things as the city continues to grow and expand.",t2_32partq2,_xxxtemptation_,0,1648181645.0,0,t1_i20xrkb,i20xrkb,False,names12345678901234,t3_tm527k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tm527k/ithaca_vs_champaign_illinois/,"Ithaca vs. Champaign, Illinois?",/r/ithaca/comments/tm527k/ithaca_vs_champaign_illinois/i20xrkb/,2,r/ithaca,0,2

I think Ithaca/Tompkins County is best suited for people who like the outdoors and like learning. That is what most of the community activities around here are geared towards.

"Thanks for the long post. I guess the main reason for China's racism is more on broad-scope socio- economic discriminations, whereas in textbooks/news little is mentioned about the historic exploitation of ethnic minorities' properties/lands etc (for the sake of the party's credibility). Not only elder-generations, but more often people in 40s/50s, openly discriminate people who hailed from the rural areas, don't speak proper mandarin - the inherent reasons I'd say is ""economic foundation lays the base for the superstructure"" in Marxist education is one, another is the wide-spread notion of social-darwinism. People pay little attention to the traumas of any minority groups as a consequence, and those who wanna help or speak out are typically silenced, which makes the voice in favor of social-darwinism louder. (professors wanna speak for immigrant workers from ethnic minority background are censored) Also, Han ethnicity is the super super majority in China, and conformity is nurtured since pre-school, so people don't treat the ethnic-based exploitations very seriously, which is very sad. Though the younger generations are getting better in understanding inclusive, deliberative democracy there, the majority still holds social darwinist thoughts, and I was personally openly discriminated on socio-economic grounds when I was a student at Cornell.      When a nation blinds so many and then forces the rest conscious ones to buy the propoganda, I don't see any change coming soon.

Unfortunately Ithaca is like 300 years older than Santa Barbara and adding a lane to any of the roads is basically out of the question because we no longer have the room.

Definitely Ithaca has more interesting geography to look at than Illinois, but if you can’t take your eyes off the road to look at it because of how congested the roads are with reckless college students it can be very frustrating in a town of this size. I’ve been a full time delivery driver in Ithaca for the last 3 years and honestly if I’m not on an empty back road here a lot of the joy of driving is lost trying to make sure you don’t end up in an accident or pothole that hasn’t been repaired in years",t2_32partq2,_xxxtemptation_,0,1648143547.0,0,t1_i1ygpln,i1ygpln,False,names12345678901234,t3_tm527k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tm527k/ithaca_vs_champaign_illinois/,"Ithaca vs. Champaign, Illinois?",/r/ithaca/comments/tm527k/ithaca_vs_champaign_illinois/i1ygpln/,3,r/ithaca,0,3
"No, there are not legit Nazis in Champaign (I say this as a Jewish person who attended UIUC about 5 years ago). ""Illinois Nazis"" refers to a tiny group in the Chicago area. Unfortunately there are some Nazis in every major city in the US, just because of the sheer number of people. The Illinois Nazis are just more well-known because they organized and sued Skokie (a Chicago suburb with a large Jewish population) to allow them to hold a rally there... back in the '70s. They were subsequently immortalized in the Blues Brothers.

"I grew up in and have lived in several midwestern states, mostly in college towns between 10,000-70,000 people. While I never lived in Champaign, I have visited a lot to see friends/attend conferences/go to the gay bar when the place I was living didn't have one/etc. I found it to be a perfectly acceptable place: it is bigger than most of the other places I lived and had lots to see & do with enough social opportunities for me (admittedly more introverted than not). 

That said, a lot of the social life revolves around the the university (i.e. tailgating for big sporting events, touring broadway shows at the UIUC theater, etc.), and it has the town/gown divide that so many college towns experience. As someone said already, Urbana-Champaign is bigger -- both in population and geographical size -- than Ithaca. There is certainly life there beyond the campus.

I mostly shrug at the alleged conservative-ness of the midwest, you'll have that across the entire US. In my experience there are thriving counter-cultural scenes everywhere, you just have to find them. It depends on what you are looking for. 

Finally, the ""great outdoors"" is definitely different there, but I don't necessarily think of that as a bad thing. Again, it all depends on what you like. The waterfalls and hiking here are great, but I do also get nostalgic for the big, gridded corn & soybean fields.

You kinda answered your own question. People like the big city feel without actually being in a big city.  

I don’t understand why anyone would move to a big city where the only mountains are sky scrapers and the trees are decorative. When I’ve seen flat places it legitimately freaks me out - miles and miles of houses, gross. 

The fact that ANY place as smal as NYC can house MILLIONS of people is terrifying.

"So only Chicago is ""blue"" the rest of the state is VERY conservative and most midwestern states are. If you are in anyway upset by the mask guidelines here, or think Ithaca doesn't do enough against COVID - I am here to tell you what is done here is SO MUCH MORE than rural midwestern states do. In much of southern IL and in MO (I'm from STL, but have lived all over the state) there was no mask mandate except at the universities and in government buildings and only for a few months. I worked as a server while in grad school and would get straight up harassed by some tables for wearing a mask during the summer of 2020. I remember moving here and being in awe that so many people cared and followed the COVID rules. I just tell you this as a question to ask locals if it is something that matters to you.

Personally, I find the stretch North of Springfield IL to Chicago to be immensely boring. It's flat and rural, and reminds me of Kansas. But you are a few hours away from some pretty spots (a few hours = a short distance for middle USA). The cost of living can't be beat though. I paid 900/mo in rent for an entire house with a giant fenced yard. I pay 1,100/mo here for a tiny apartment on the top floor of a building. Even with housing going up everywhere, IL housing is still more achievable than here, and they have beautifully preserved historical houses as well.

It's fucking sickening. I am in the same position and apartments that I literally looked at last year that are fucking studios were 750 and are now 850. Studios are sometimes misleadingly called 1 bedrooms to justify listing $1500 for a 200 sq ft apt. And guess what they are all making the choice to. All of these scumbags could at least keep the rent consistent but nah making money is more important than people being able to afford to live. So now I'm forced to look for a roommate which is it's own shitshow... rant over... dm if you're looking to room with someone for roughly 600 - 750 per person,t2_ak8om,Literallyhitler101,0,1648083186.0,0,t1_i1vew8h,i1vew8h,True,Memento_Viveri,t3_tiz0z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tiz0z7/ithaca_home_rental_and_home_sale_market_both_seem/,Ithaca home rental and home sale market both seem crazy.

"Hi sorry just saw this. Personally I think white folks over the course of history have done some of the most abhorrent acts of racism of any race. 

However, I would readily argue that in modern times, America has come a long way and is much less racist place on average than China. Certainly there’s a lot of baked in systemic issues that didn’t get resolved during the civil rights era, and we definitely have some backward minded individuals scattered through out. But compared to the widely held and openly practiced beliefs held by a majority of the population in China, especially older generations in less urban areas, the United States seems like a cake walk. 

The best way I can describe it is people in America are racist but know it’s wrong, whereas in China some of the awful stereotypes we did away with in the 60s and 70s are still considered truth. This is partly how they get away with the genocides of entire ethnic groups for the last 2 decades with almost no real backlash from the population. 

Obviously the structure of their government which the population doesn’t get a lot of say over is another important factor, but I think you’d be surprised how little awareness a lot of these students have about diversity when compared to a Chinese person who actually lives US. They’re not beyond learning, but Chinas entire society has been extremely isolationist and is only just now beginning to diversify so they have a lot of catching up to do to bring them on par with the US. 

This is part of the reason I think it’s really important for Cornell to have a larger conversation with their students about what happened when they walked out. They may truly just be ignorant, but it’s extremely important their behavior isn’t ignored because what their country is doing is fundamentally immoral and there is no reasonable defense to excuse it. This sort of unfettered nationalism by foreigners, especially ones with access to billions of dollars of intellectual property from one of our top universities (which their government routinely recruits students and professors to steal) shouldn’t be taken lightly. I have a lot of respect for China as a nation and as a people, but I can’t fathom a reason why a top tier university would blow this off as an act of reasonable protest. It’s the most blatant example of hate speech I’ve come across since the Charlottesville march, and the scariest part is that they’re defending something that’s ongoing and happening as we speak, instead of over a monument of something that happened during a time not a single person today was alive for.",t2_32partq2,_xxxtemptation_,0,1648073324.0,0,t1_i1urv42,i1urv42,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_tg7ds4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tg7ds4/cornell_students_from_china_jeer_walk_out_on/,"Cornell students from China jeer, walk out on Uyghur student who asked lawmaker about Uyghur genocide",/r/ithaca/comments/tg7ds4/cornell_students_from_china_jeer_walk_out_on/i1urv42/,1,r/ithaca,0,1

"Main thing is to keep your eye out. There’s lots of events that are always going on. So many are even annual, I forget so many until I see the reminder ad for it. 

If you’re willing to travel a little bit, Watkins Glen can be fun to explore. When you’re done exploring,  Inner Peace Floats (like hydrotherapy) can be amazing if you want to kinda relax. Speaking of: Deeply Devoted in Ithaca is right on State St, and amazing right after finals.

I don’t usually recommend Candor, but around this time of year, we have the Daffodil Festival. It’s only 17 minutes away on 96B There are a bunch of vendors (over 100), a beer or wine tent usually, performers, food, and I think there’s a shuttle that takes you to the local family’s HUGE field of Daffodils, and back to the festival. That’s on April 30. 

Boat Show usually has food and stuff.  (Cliff St). I think it’s happening throughout the month 

I’m sure you know about the farmers market. Soon enough we will be back to summer market at Steamboat Landing! 

If you like art, Gallery Night is always fun— April 1st.

This one is expensive but— Balloon Tours are amazing, and I’ve been here for like 10 years. Haha! 

There are multiple antique stores in Ithaca alone that are super fun if you like that sort of thing. The one in Owego is two levels. 

I know you’re at Cornell, so I’m def. assuming you’ve visited the A.D. White Library? One of my favorites. So much history, and just gorgeous. I used to spend way too much time there. If you like history, Cornell has a great Witchcraft Collection, speaking of their libraries. 

The local towns can definitely be fun to get lost in. Some are very eccentric.

"*DO NOT* go to Aspen Dental, despite the fact that they are one of the few providers who take insurance. **story below 

Marina Manunts at Northeast up by the mall does not directly take cornell insurance, but they are absolutely fantastic and its worth asking them whether they can do an out of network reimbursement or something.  They'll be upfront about all costs.  

Tip: If you only ever need cleaning, cornells insurance won't save you money.  I did the math and for me, paying out of pocket was actually cheaper.  

** tl;dr: they waste your time and double bill you for it. I had heard a few reviews about them refusing to do teeth cleaning at the first appointment, so when I called about a cleaning, I asked and they assured me that as long as there were no problems they'd do the cleaning that day.  I sat waiting in the chair for OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF to see a dentist.  They had a TV with movies set up to keep you entertained so clearly this was normal for them.  Dentist finally comes in, spends 5 minutes looking my teeth,  says I'm healthy and good to go for cleaning.  That's when the staff tell me I will need to book another appointment for the cleaning... with another copay, of course.

"In town, Mimi’s, Found, and Significant Elements are my fave second hand stops for furniture and household items. I found Mimi’s more reasonably priced before they moved, but, life. At Found, if you simply ask, they will give you 10% off. Based on my experience, they encourage it. Even if you aren’t in the market for households items, just looking at everything is an enjoyable way to kill some time, especially at Found and SE.

If you haven’t done Watkins Glen State Park, it is beautiful, and walking through the village afterwards can be fun. Havana Glen is also nearby (though probably a drive) and a short, easy hike. And usually very empty. If you take the longer way home through Hector and Trumansburg, you could hit Two Goats for a beer and a roast beef sandwich, or Lucky Hare for a beer and lunch from Babe’s. Both have nice porches and great views. 

The Corning Museum of Glass is worth a visit. If you want to make your own glass, book ahead. May be fun to watch a couple of the episodes of the show, Blown Away prior, so you can have a better idea of the intricacies of their work, if you go their live demonstrations. Corning Market St. is cute with shops and restaurants. For a more budget friendly meal, you can get a slice at Aniello’s. For a more special meal, I recommend Hand and Foot.

Further drives, that may require more planning: 
Letchworth Park - maybe combine with a trip to Rochester (garbage plates, fun breweries).
Bike a portion of the Erie Canal - fairly easy, safe, and beautiful.
Herkimer Diamond Mine - if you go up and over maybe stop by Utica and visit Florentine bakery, share a tomato pie with friends, try riggies, or Utica greens. If you go over and up, hit Oneonta for a cold cheese slice (purportedly where it was invented) and maybe Ommegang. Cooperstown is also very quaint, or it was, haven’t been in a while.

If you aren’t from NY and don’t see yourself in the Northeast post grad, I would try to schedule a short trip to Niagara Falls (maybe even Toronto) and or Montreal (we went through Burlington and stayed a night there). This was really important to a lot of my CA/international friends who didn’t see themselves ever coming back for that kind of trip. We had a blast.

"> Space is very limited

Right, which is why increasing housing stock (especially through high-density housing) is the most effective solution. 

>We already have higher rents, comparing to adjacent communities, and the quality of a significant number of our rental properties are middling or worse.

Implementing rent control would make rents even higher, and make the quality even worse.

>IDK if rent control or rent stabilization is the right solution or not.

It emphatically is not, as decades of research and real world examples have conclusively proven. 

>We've had new apartment complexes and new buildings added and rents do not go down, overall.

Because we are still way behind. It's like antibiotics. If you need ten days of pills and you take three days worth and stop, you don't get better. 

>so long as landlords believe they can get $X in rents for an apartment, there is little incentive to build an apartment that would rent for < $X. This market lacks elasticity.

When you build enough new units, even higher priced units, the cost of older units goes down.

>This doesn't even address the housing availability, let alone pricing.

"I say that demand is unbounded because we have 2 higher ed universities that are also the biggest employers, and the students are often _able_ to pay higher rents -- whether with their own money, or with loans / grants / stipends -- a short-term commitment of 2-3 years isn't unreasonable, but there is no end to this. Space is very limited, Cornell uses up a lot of it, and our occupancy rate is, as of a few years ago, over 90% (I want to say it's around 95%). Many people are doubled or tripled up. 

We _already have_ higher rents, comparing to adjacent communities, and the quality of a significant number of our rental properties are middling or worse. 

When you look at rental listings, many of them list the rent price as the ""per-room"" rent price, despite listing the dwelling in its full-size. So a 3BR / 1.5BA apartment or townhome might be listed at ""$800 monthly"" in the heading, but in actuality it is $2400 monthly. This matters when you have young children who are old enough to need their own bedrooms but not old enough to work.

Ithaca's housing market is a bit anomalous and I wouldn't be surprised if we have outlier behaviors here. 

IDK if rent control or rent stabilization is the right solution or not. We've had new apartment complexes and new buildings added and rents do not go down, overall. There are insufficient units available. Many people are displaced outside of Ithaca, even if they work here, due to rents. It is a _problem_. Long ago, I went to a DIA meeting downtown and asked someone (Gary? I forget; it was several years ago) about this, and basically the issue is that, so long as landlords believe they can get $X in rents for an apartment, there is little incentive to build an apartment that would rent for < $X. This market lacks elasticity.

Many Ithacan landlords don't maintain their properties very well. eg. the Pizza Aroma building is condemned because the landlord, though advised _well_ in advance, declined to do the repairs necessary to keep the building habitable, so the business + tenants that were living there are now displaced.

This doesn't even address the housing availability, let alone pricing. Folks just want to buy houses to _live in_, but they have to compete with no-inspection, paying-in-cash buyers who turn it into a rental or AirBnB.",t2_716zr,armahillo,0,1647891230.0,0,t1_i1ki27t,i1ki27t,False,Memento_Viveri,t3_tiz0z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tiz0z7/ithaca_home_rental_and_home_sale_market_both_seem/,Ithaca home rental and home sale market both seem crazy.

Call in a noise complaint. You might be lucky to be in the city. I live in the Town of Lansing and they don't care about noise complaints at all. :( The city might be more likely to respond. I'm also sorry about the lack of sympathetic responses here. I have ADD (my main symptom being extreme distractibility) and asking me to ignore noise is like asking someone to ignore being punched in the arm repeatedly. But there are lots of reasons why people don't want to be assaulted by noise and that needs to be respected.,t2_caegv9za,ithacated,1,1647663577.0,0,t1_i18tre6,i18tre6,True,[deleted],t3_thgreo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/thgreo/loud_music_in_fall_creek/,Loud music in Fall Creek,/r/ithaca/comments/thgreo/loud_music_in_fall_creek/i18tre6/,0,r/ithaca,0,0

"Disclaimer: I am a China national and Han ethnicity. I live in Ithaca but don't affiliate with Cornell.

Just trying to explaining what is background where the students coming from with my prospective. Most of your guys probably don't know what happened in 2009 at Urumqi. Civilian Han people was indiscriminately attacked and killed by rioters on the street they lived in their daily life. People believed that the riot was driven by extremists trying to divide the country. After that day, the surveillance has been increased. The detention camp is real. People are force to be taken there to ""learn"" stuff (I would say it's a jail indeed) if you said something bad about the government or practiced religion despite your ethnicity. It is one of the examples that CCP extends their power into people's daily life and violates basic human rights in recent years. Chinese people knows there is a camp. They somewhat support it and think it can prevent similar tragedy in 2009 happening again.  But they don't believe on genocide. They think the genocide is a propaganda from western to divide China. And Uyghurs who talked about seeing genocide in the media are seen as relates to the extremist behind the 2009 riot and try to divide China.  For Chinese people, the unity of the national territory is really the bottom line because we have learned our humiliating history of losing territory before PRC. 

My view may also be brainwashed. But i really hate to see politicians divide and hurt people to achieve whatever goals.  Han and Uyghur people used to be friends and neighbors, but with the extremists committed riot and what CCP does recently, there are invisible barrier psychologically and things just can't go back.",t2_2nz7fllz,MudWarriors,0,1647544592.0,0,t1_i121non,i121non,True,Geek-Haven888,t3_tg7ds4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tg7ds4/cornell_students_from_china_jeer_walk_out_on/,"Cornell students from China jeer, walk out on Uyghur student who asked lawmaker about Uyghur genocide",/r/ithaca/comments/tg7ds4/cornell_students_from_china_jeer_walk_out_on/i121non/,30,r/ithaca,0,30

"The WORST dentist I have ever been to. went for years as a kid and have had;

The wrong fillings put in.

Fillings drilled out to be re-filled because they claimed they never actually did it.

Had chunks of healthy teeth broken off during aggressive and careless cleanings,

Injected with SIX doses of novacaine total as a child (3 in each side) because they didn't want to wait for it to kick in. I ended up having to lay with my face down as to not choke on spit because my whole face was numb for hours.

Waited a year and a half for a mouth guard after it was already made.

And many many occasions of malpractice that have lead to further complications from minor procedures that have kept me coming back expecting to be treated like a person, rather than a dollar sign.

I cannot recommend against this place strongly enough but I am unfortunately in a very similar predicament as OP and can't find a different place to take insurance. I talked to a dentist downtown (can't remember which one from the amount I have called) and got told I need to pay $450+ for a cleaning before I can be looked at and treated for the fairly severe holes I have in my gums, which I'm sure will cost me more than I can afford.",t2_98pqvvgf,Ashamed_Astronaut664,0,1647536141.0,0,t1_i11fkzt,i11fkzt,False,TunaCroutons,t3_tgdh4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tgdh4g/emergency_treatment_for_dental_abscess_does/,Emergency treatment for dental abscess - does ANYONE accept Medicaid?,/r/ithaca/comments/tgdh4g/emergency_treatment_for_dental_abscess_does/i11fkzt/,3,r/ithaca,0,3

"The missing context from this (pretty surface-level) article: These students were part the Master of Public Administration degree, and that group of people is at least partially preparing for work in public life in China. They're certainly not generalizable to all PRC students at Cornell. Similarly, the administration of *this specific program* might be swayed by questions about money (it is a tuition-charging advanced degree that costs almost $40K a year in tuition), where other programs (for example Ph. D. programs, where the university pays the student, or the undergraduate program, where there's an almost infinite supply of candidates that can pay) are less motivated by finances.

Everybody in the media pictures Cornell as one thing, when it's actually a big conglomeration of littler things, sometimes extremely specific ones.

🚨 PIZZA AROMA IS LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME 💔 

As some of you may have heard, we found out back in September that our building was going to be condemned unless the necessary work was done. We were told that the work was only going to be on the outside, and that it wouldn’t affect our business. Up until this week, we’ve received no communication or updates on when the work would begin/end.

Having no control over the eyesore that covers the outside of the building, we decided to remodel the inside. After waiting 6 months for the construction to start and fixing up the inside, we were just notified we have less than 3 months to vacate the property. 

It’s very disappointing that in our 25th year on Cayuga & Green St. we would be dragged through months of impeded business due to the construction - only to be told that we have to leave on short notice. We are actively looking for a new location, so if you have any suggestions please send us a message. 

After enduring the pandemic as a small business, we don’t know what the future will hold. Make sure to get your Pizza Aroma while we’re still here!

They’re taking free stuff and selling it for what’s considered average used value, 50% of new. This money benefits their own organization not the public.

"Lol avoid 96 through trumansburg that whole week.  Traffic is a nightmare.

You used to be able to see reggae headliners from Jamaica that would totally justify their price.  I could go see Koffee at Pier 7 in NYC for less than a day pass to grassroots.

If you're new to the area maybe check it out but it's nothing like what it used to be aside from making 96 traffic deadlock for about a mile in each direction from the fair grounds.

"Highly recommend Hazelnut Kitchen, Creekside Cafe, and New York Pizzeria. 

Shursave is the closest standard grocery store but they have pretty limited hours right now due to lack of staff. In Ithaca, Wegmans has the best selection and a solid produce/meat section. Tops (practically next door to Wegmans) has high prices but great sales. Trader Joe's is Trader Joe's.

I could write a novel about my favorite summertime things. Brownie's Produce Market is great for local-ish meats, cheeses, and produce. Americana Vineyards and Indian Creek Farm (u-pick) are a lot of fun. Taughannock is the most popular park in the area: the Gorge Trail and overlook are popular for good reason, but North Point is typically less crowded and a fantastic place to picnic/hang out. There is usually a summer concert series there as well. Treman Marine Park is a great public park and last year Hangar Theater did a few outdoor shows there.",t2_bm5qkjik,bombasticfox,0,1646875084.0,0,t1_i01smte,i01smte,True,11Petrichor,t3_ta66u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/ta66u0/moving_to_ithaca_this_week_any_suggestions/,"Moving to Ithaca this week, any suggestions?",/r/ithaca/comments/ta66u0/moving_to_ithaca_this_week_any_suggestions/i01smte/,5,r/ithaca,0,5
