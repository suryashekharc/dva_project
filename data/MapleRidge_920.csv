"I would pick Sooke over Nanaimo! It is much quieter, community-driven, lots of trails and hidden beaches. My aunt and uncle have lived there since the 80's for the outdoor life and never left. You are about 45ish minutes from a city with all the amenities. If you want to be in the super quiet part I'd check out Otter Point :) 

Nanaimo is a lot buiser because of the ferry terminals and a lot more city-like. I haven't spent a bunch of time there but if you are looking for the island vibe, I'd go with somewhere else. 

If you are open to going a bit up island, the Comox Valley is a growing community and beautiful. Lots and lots of green outdoor spaces, mostly small/local businesses, lots of community events.

Pitt always seems to have a better reputation but when we lived there we had our home broken into once and my sons bike stolen. On the bad side of things….

"There is a crime map on the city of Maple Ridge website to look up so you can see what kind of crime is in the area. Typical stuff though, don't leave anything in your cars, be careful about what you leave outside (like bikes), assault type crimes are low.

Trains, you can hear them but there's a no-horn bylaw for most of Maple Ridge. However, you will be able to hear the horns from across the river. Train noise is a fact of life if you move where there is train transport, they are loud and the sound carries many km. Be aware that area is *not far * from the tracks or major arterial routes so it will definitely come with a variety of noises (planes, trains, and automobiles) so you may want to visit the area at multiple times of day/night and have a meal and read a book both in and out of your car before you buy. If train noise really affects you then looking in Silver Valley might be more suitable for you. 

Traffic can be totally horrendous because of the lack of infrastructure upgrades. 1h is probably average for most days but there's a lot of places that can go haywire. Your wife could take the west coast express if she works downtown, it is a luxury ride compared to the Skytrain. There's also the ""rapid"" bus, but you driving her is probably the best option.

"We moved here 13 years ago to raise a family and have zero regrets with our decision to settle in Maple Ridge.   

The only negative is how busy it has become in such a short period of time; but coming from Squamish  you'll be familiar with that.  

As others have pointed out, the biggest perk is access  to incredible nature.  Hiking, running, kayaking, cycling, mountain biking, off roading....on and on... is all in our backyard.  

Maple Ridge seems to still hold on to a small-town vibe with people still having the time to be friendly and have a chat.  

My family has never had any personal experience with crime of any kind since we moved here.  (knocks on wood)

Good luck with your decision.

"I moved here in 2017. Overall I really like it. My neighbourhood is extremely safe. There’s definitely homelessness and property crime, mostly around downtown, but it’s safe. One thing you don’t see here is gang shootings, but that’s because this town belongs to the bikers, and honestly I think most people are a-ok with that. 

If you buy a house here, property taxes are fairly high, despite the fact the city doesn’t supply some basic services like garbage pickup. That was a big surprise when I moved here, and somehow people here have convinced themselves that’s a good thing. 

City council is owned by developers, and you can see it by the rapid infill without adequate infrastructure. Traffic during rush hour can be brutal. There’s new townhouses popping up everywhere they can clear land. If you have a job in Vancouver to commute to, be prepared for 1.5 hrs each way. I work from home or I’d never move here, tbh. 

Also one thing a lot of people don’t realize is MR is very conservative. Our MP who has been repeatedly re-elected is a hardcore conservative who voted against, among many things, *banning* conversion therapy. And people here celebrated that. You will see maga hats, confederate flags and convoy idiots here. For a leftie moving here from east van that was probably the biggest culture shock. 

Now, the great thing about here is the proximity to nature. If you like to hike or fish, or off-road, or go boating, this place is fantastic. I’m an avid fly fisherman, and that’s one of the main reasons I moved here. That and it was one of the most affordable options still in the greater Vancouver area. Overall I’d say come out here and check it out.

"Like most cities of a similar size, it depends on where you are. The crime is substantially centered around the town core are. If you are further out in the burbs it's as safe as any place. Relatively few violent crimes; mostly property crimes to support drug addictions.

The upside is the proximity to outdoor oriented activities. Hiking, biking, equestrian, etc.

If you live in one of the out lying areas like Whonnock or Thornhill you will find a very strong sense of community and helpful friendly neighbors.

I've lived in Maple Ridge for 30+ years and I have seen it change from a sleepy little town to a busy metropolitan area.

I was born here now Im old here.  The town is developement crazy, the town council is thinly veiled developer sponsored. So we are behind in services and are crowded. Plus weve never had an industrial tax base so no jobs, high property taxes and a deaf city council. 

We have a growing street person population, hence small petty crime is rampant and we have a large low income population so we have dollar stores walmart etc everywhere.

The pluses I am aware of, proximity to many other cities, mountainy parks, many rivers, great library, good fishing, foraging hiking biking alouette lake stave lake and 100, ooo sushi places and starting to erupt with chicken and pizza places.

"Fair comment. However, ""rate of infection"" refers to per 100k rather than overall figures comparing unvaccinated to vaccinated, as evidenced by data from the WHO, CDC & others, therefore when Dr Henry acknowledges vaccinated people being infected at a higher rate, it's not speaking to the high number of vaccinated people here. As that pertains to Isreal, well... Again, on their 4th jab, and rates of infection among the highest in the world to parallel their rate of vaccination being equally as high. Here's a WHO link to the interactive dashboard if you wish to confirm: https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/il

"There are higher rates of infection for those vaccinated than for those that are not vaccinated because there are more people who have been vaccinated in this country than not vaccinated. That's pretty simple math.

"I dunno what you mean by ""clearly"" but that's not the connection I made, not at all, and I don't think it's the connection the individual in that photo was trying to make either.

Isreal has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, maybe the highest idk for sure, and the only vaccine they use is Pfizer. I believe they were the second country (after China) to introduce vaccine passports. They are in the process of administering the 4th booster to their populace. They have led the way in most of the measures many western governments (including our own) have used & age using to fight covid

In spite of this, they also have among the highest covid infection rates in the world. Our own Dr Bonnie Henry has admitted higher rates of infection by those vaccinated than not, increasing with the number of boosters one has received.

I think this has left a lot of people with questions as to the efficacy of the vaccine, particularly in light of how many people have lost their jobs, been segregated, mocked and labeled racist, misogynist, told how to think and that their views were unacceptable, and that just by the Prime Minister - without even mentioning how broader society treats those same people.

"Maple Ridge is great. We were between Maple Ridge and Squamish as well. Like many of the communities in the area, it is having trouble keeping up with growth. I wanted to tackle a few of your individual points:

Doctors: It's tough to find a practice that is accepting single patients, let alone a family. We live in Maple Ridge and our doctors are in Vancouver and Port Coquitlam. 

Specialists: we have a few specialists out here and in the surrounding areas. It depends on what you're looking for. 

Shopping: means Coquitlam Center. Our mall is terrible. We have quaint small shops. One does not move to Maple Ridge for the mall.

Outdoor: Trails are great, but they're getting crowded. We have Golden Ears and the UBC Research Forest (no dogs allowed). You need a park pass for Golden Ears during the warmer months. It's crowded and uncomfortable at times. 

Silver Valley: It's great, but not self-sustaining. You need to go to downtown Maple Ridge for ammenties/shopping/groceries, etc. There are few schools in the area, meaning that if you have children it can be a hassle to get into a school nearby.

Housing: Our housing prices are nuts right now. The official community plan calls for multi-family properties.

Growth: From the official community plan: ""To meet the population projection of approximately 109,000 people by 2031, Maple Ridge will require an additional 6,250 to 7,500 dwelling units, depending on dwelling type mix and average household size... Affordability, location, and availability of ground-oriented and apartment style units will be major factors in attracting new residents and young families to Maple Ridge, and providing greater choice for the changing needs of current residents.""  We're losing greenspace. Where multi-family homes are being developed it is stressed the current infrastructure. Parking for example or increased traffic on quiet residential streets.

With all that being said... I wouldn't move - yet. It's a good community to raise a family, but if you're moving here for the small community feel you might be disappointed. It's becoming a big city, but without the big city entertainment and amenities.",t2_7lqfor16,codehammerhead,0,1643309864.0,0,t1_huh4rgh,huh4rgh,False,caper7504,t3_sdipx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MapleRidge/comments/sdipx6/life_in_maple_ridge_from_squamish/,Life in Maple Ridge from Squamish,/r/MapleRidge/comments/sdipx6/life_in_maple_ridge_from_squamish/huh4rgh/,3,r/MapleRidge,0,3

"Moved out to Maple Ridge about 14 years ago. Love it!  So many trails and lakes within 15 mins and a fairly painless commute on the WCE to the city.   The housing market here is insane right now though. We just put a  house on the market and since we started looking into comparables that have sold, it has gone up $200k. Our agent said she just put an offer in with a client for $300k over asking and they still didn’t get it. It ended up going for 490k over asking.  The problem is there is no inventory.

Your situation was similar to mine and I don't think you'll be disappointed.  We moved to Maple Ridge 15 years ago under similar motivations and circumstances and we truly love it here.  The nature is very diverse and it feels just outside of the greater Vancouver area to have it's own standalone vibe.   Check out the incredible network of dykes throughout Maple Ridge / Pitt Meadows and the kayaking in this area is some of the best you could ask for.

On top of that management wasn't the best. And broken things were rarely fixed. This led to worse reviews and less demand. I quit before it closed however. I tried not shortcut while making chicken.

Big O tires - they do more than just tires though. They saved me from having to buy 4 brand new winter tires when I drove over some nails. KalTire and Canadian Tire wouldn't attempt to repair it. I was to leave for work in a couple days and have a 4 wheel drive and wasn't able to find a single to match the 3 that were fine. I was looking at 1500-2000 for a new set. Guy at Big O said to just let him try to fix it...that was 3 years ago and I'm still driving on it. It cost me $35.

Anytime there is farming/gardening without electric fencing and motion lights people are asking for bears.

There's a few bears that don't hibernate but afaik they go up a bit more into the hills once they've reached fatted up stage. But some don't reach the level needed or there's too much around to get into, then incidents happen.

"I moved to Pitt Meadows in 2011, at age 40-something.  My husband & I had been out of the real estate market for decades, throwing away money on rent. We chose Pitt Meadows for one reason: it was affordable.  We bought a two-bedroom apartment in a low rise building in ""downtown"" Pitt Meadows (kitty corner to the library), and lived there for eight years. 

If you like to get outdoors (walking, cycling, hiking, kayaking) it's a great area. Commuting into the city on the West Coast Express is one of the most beautiful commutes in the country. You will be very reliant on your car for shopping, as there aren't many walk-to-shop opportunities. There are only a handful of restaurants (at all), and maybe 3 - 4 you'll want to patronize regularly.  There's a new microbrewery (Foamer's Folly) that's popular. 

I would be a little bit concerned about you, as a single guy, being able to find a lot of social connections in Pitt Meadows.  It's a community dominated by families and retirees. There aren't a lot of casual social spaces. I think I might have been lonely living there by myself. I hope you get more responses from people in your target age group, but I loved my years in Pitt Meadows.  Social limitations aside, I'd say it's a great community in which to get started in the real estate market.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"We just had a new elementary school open 2 years ago in Albion. The idea of another elementary school is always floating around as even with this new school, maple ridge is at or over capacity in all the schools.

There are some.really good programs out here though including Montessori and outdoor school. There is also meadowridge if you're considering private school.

As for daycare, it really depends on what sort you would like to use. For big centres, there will most likely be waiting lists. There are lots of stay at home moms looking to take on another child to help bolster their income.

"There is a reason the test route is withheld. It’s no different than getting the answers for a school test beforehand. They do need to determine many things about your driving skills before they release you on our city streets.

However, I highly recommend going to test in Port Coquitlam. The wait time to get tested can be a little longer. Depends if you want to spend more money or more time. (It does take less time than having to rebook for your second test.)

None of the teens I know passed in M.Ridge but did when they took the test elsewhere. My daughter didn’t pass here in M.Ridge. Apparently she had several issues on the road test. In PoCo she passed the first test.

Mind you this was six years ago, maybe things have improved since then. Maybe they decided the money grab was too obvious. No young person we know passed without taking the test twice, sometimes three or four times. Someone suggested she should test elsewhere. 

According to her the test route was so much better than here in Maple Ridge, with less trick questions and situations. She wasn’t familiar with (and much more worried) the PoCo roads at the time but she said it was an easy route. Even the instructor was nice!

"I escaped several times. It definitely has all the problems you mentioned, and bigotry and homophobia on top of that big time, due to the strong politically conservative population out there. Did you know Maple Ridge has more horses per capita than Texas does? That might help frame the picture for you, somehow. 

Trucks. Horses. Smokers and ""Road Beer"" drinkers. Roughnecks, auto workers, mill workers, and longshoreman rule the town and make the most money, so boys with little ambition gravitate to those professions and never leave town. When I left in my late teens there was still a really bad Oxycontin sales problem and some of my friends got into trouble down the road. Girls define themselves by what logger they managed to snag, and SAHM was the top job aspiration for most of the ladies I graduated with. It's not that opportunity was low there, just everyone's ambition sucked, and they bullied anyone with a spark of greatness into the same doldrums they were in. 

That said, it is the NATURE that makes Maple Ridge incredible. If people are unwelcoming, that's why: no need to be welcoming to strangers if there's loads of space for you to never see anyone. Pick a trail and go. We have ELEVEN LAKES. The Golden Ears mountains are on our back porch. We have Pitt Lake, one of only two tidal lakes in the world. We have Bears, Mountain Lions, Bobcats, and huge owls and herons. It's a nature lovers paradise. You can drink from alouette river. The air is some of The cleanest in the whole Fraser Valley. There's a humidity pocket in the summer that brings MR up to 35 degrees some years and it's like Kelowna.

Anywho, if you do move there, just make your own circle as quick as you can and stick to it like everyone else does and IMO you'll be very happy.

"Most people would say it's recommended but I've been driving on these roads the last 24 yrs and never once put snow tires on. I've also had my road star for the last 15yrs and I use to commute to and from North Vancouver and ski at all the local mountains. I do own a truck and a set of chains but rarely need either for the mountains here.

The other guys made some good points but depending on how comfortable you are behind the wheel, I wouldn't sweat it if your not looking to shell out a bunch of money on tires that you may only need a couple weeks out of the year. Especially if you're not commuting far or super early when it would be colder with possible ice.

The price is super cheap, although you have to purchase your router whereas with telus or shaw you usually rent the router and any issues are replaced for free.

I would reccomend TekSavvy to anyone in the lower mainland; the outright cost of purchasing a modem is steep, but the long term cost is insanely cheap.

"Maple Ridge is like a donut... A big beautiful delicious donut. A big circle of nature and trails and kind and inviting neighborhoods, a handful of decent eats and some nice clean stores. But the middle is just a hole.

For the record I'm born, raised, and now raising my family in Maple Ridge. 

Now donut jokes aside, why is the middle a hole? Because very little has changed in my 34 years in this town. But that's not to say things can't get better. The problem with town center is it's stagnant. Year over year buildings, stores, and public spaces in the town core fall further into disrepair. The one exception being the municipal Hall / ACT/ and leisure center which makeup a large complex that has seen major renovations over the past decade. But aside from that you'd drive through Maple Ridge and assume you'd been transported back to the late 80s. And there's reasons for this: the city provides very little in terms of support / funding / initiatives to encourage redevelopment/renovations. The small ma/pa shops that the city fights so hard to protect by blocking out any big businesses don't have the money or the means typically to update or fix their crumbling delapitated buildings. And because big business or any development that may push out a ma/pa shop is continually denied the town core will never change. 

Now I have nothing against these small ma/pa shops, I think they have their place and many are truly charming little gems when you meet the staff/owners and see what they have to offer. However, the rest (most) are relics of a time long past and offer very little or nothing in terms of curb appeal, selection, affordability, or even basic customer service. Why the city fights so hard to preserve many of these businesses is beyond me. 

The other, and arguably the single biggest issue plaguing Maple Ridge is the homeless. And not because they simply exist, and not because of the associated crime (our city is no worse than any other and our crime stats as they relate to the homeless are essentially on par for our city/homeless population size), but because this city as a whole has such a horrid, and embarassing red neck elitist mentality towards the homeless. The NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) movement in this town is deplorable. And while the city continues to push away big business and development which also subsequently pushes away job opportunities, and simultaneously refuses and fights tooth and nail to install any supporting centers or supporting housing, our homeless population grows and people wonder why?? 

People in Maple Ridge (and the bulk of Metro Vancouver to be honest) have this weird mentality that every homeless person or drug addict is a psycho who will attack them like a rabid dog if they get too close. And now I'm speaking not only as a lifelong resident but as a first responder as well. This mentality is crippling this town. The vast majority of these people are perfectly friendly or at the very least will just ignore you and carry about their business. They might step towards you with a cup, or ask for change but they're not knife-wielding psychos. Your chance of getting attacked by a homeless or ""street person"" is just as high as getting attacked by any other human being. How many times have you heard of someone being attacked by a ""street person"" on the news compared to all the senseless violence in schools, the abducted women, domestic violence, etc. The irrational fear of our towns less fortunate is just bewildering. And unfortunately we continue to elect people like Mike Morden who are champions of the NIMBY cause. 

Traffic is the 2nd largest problem in Maple Ridge. Our slogan on our sign should read ""welcome to Maple Ridge, once you're in you can't get out"". Our municipalities approach to traffic management and infrastructure is laughable. And while the city continues to deny big business, it has no problem allowing residential developments to be crammed into every available nook and cranny, expanding into our once beautiful green spaces, interfering with our waterways (just look at what they're planning/allowing up along the alouette river). Our population is BOOMING with no road infrastructure to keep up. Our town is a big congested mess. I work in Vancouver and I can regularly get from Grandview and Boundary to the Pitt River Bridge in rush hour faster than I can get from the Pitt River Bridge to my home in uptown Maple Ridge near Lougheed /228 area. It's gross. 

But let's switch things up and argue the positives here, because hey ultimately I still live here and chose to raise my family here, and not for a lack of options.

Pitt Lake and Alouette Lake are very reasonable close drives. You can be at either in under a half hour. Beautiful lakes with many spin off trails, waterfalls, lookouts and other geographical features. 

The dyke system spanning from the Pitt Bridge well into Maple Ridge east of 216th offers dozens and dozens off different paths to enjoy the mountains, waterways and sprawling farm land.

Most residential neighborhoods outside the town core are well kept, clean, inviting, there are many many parks and playgrounds. Many with really cool bike tracks for the kids. There are several golf courses.

And Food! Now I'll be upfront, there's really not much in Maple Ridge foodwise that you can't find elsewhere, but that doesn't mean it's not great and a lot are definitely worth the drive. 

Maple ridge has seen a pub revolution in the last decade. Most of pubs used to be deplorable places that were old and dirty and filled with an unsavoury crowd. But now places like Shooters, Townhall, the Blacksheep, the Witch, the Billy Minor all have undergone Reno's and neighborhood revitalization and they are amazing places to eat with a great atmosphere. 

There's the usual fair, Whitespot, Red Robin, Boston Pizza, Browns, all consistent and reliable.

And then there's the Honorable mentions, places like Hopcotts and Chicko Chicke, DT Vietnamese, and the Akasaka House (yes Pitt Meadows, but close by if your out here), Big Feast, the Billy Minor Pizzeria, Umibe Sushi, GM Indian, Woking Dragon, Ban Chok Dee (Thai), Golden Ears Cheese Crafter, Chameleon, Gratia and Capri bakeries, Brownies Chicken, and a personal favorite, the Iron Butcher (formerly A&K sausage). 

There is lots to love in this town if you're willing to just try. It really all boils down to attitude. This town generally has a bad attitude.. or at least unfortunately those with the bad attitude seem to voice their opinion louder and have their way more frequently... But if you come into this town open minded with a good attitude then you know what friend.. there's gunna be a lot here for you.

"I moved here from east Hastings, so I’ve got a different perspective than many on this sub. Anyone who thinks this city is ‘crime ridden’ or unsafe has obviously never been to an actually dangerous place. (Honestly even the DTES isn’t unsafe, if you stay out of the alleys at night) Yes, there are issues with homelessness, just like every city. With the exponential growth in the lower mainland a lot of small cities are dealing with the shock of visible poverty, but most of what you read on here is a whole lot of overreacting by folks who’ve had the good fortune to never witness real homelessness and crime. 

I moved out here to get away from the craziness of downtown. For me it was the proximity to good fishing spots, and being able to afford a place with a small yard for my dog. There is a ton of access to nature out here, although even that is getting crowded too - I won’t go into golden ears on a summer weekend, it’s a total gong show. Fortunately lots of other places to discover. 

Things you’ll notice coming here from the city - there really isn’t much for arts and culture, and restaurant options are pretty limited, but a few local gems. There isn’t really a night life (I see that as a bonus). Shopping options also quite limited, you’ll find yourself in Pitt Meadows or Coquitlam for a lot of that. You will need a car, transit out here isn’t great. Be prepared to encounter some real redneck types on par with the best the valley has to offer. Jacked up trucks with confederate flag bumper stickers and the attitude and intelligence to go with it. The bikers also run this town, which for me isn’t a bad thing, you’ll notice MR largely not impacted by the lower mainland gang conflicts. Oh and no residential garbage pickup, that one still baffles me - some people here actually proud of the fact our municipal government doesn’t provide basic services and even voted against it. 

Other good things. Friendly people! I know all my neighbors here and we look out for each other. You really do get more of that small town attitude (good and bad). There are also some great mom and pop type businesses still, and some real ways to support local but you got to make the effort and try and avoid the pull of big box stores. Good farmers markets and other local produce / meat options sourced locally also.

"No advice on the routes and actually the route doesn’t matter.
Here is my advice from a dad who just helped his kid pass the first time.
Shoulder check like your life depends on it.
Scan the intersection before proceeding.
Watch your speed and watch for playgrounds and school zones 
Come to a full stop!
Corner carefully and smoothly 
Shoulder check!

Practice hand signals

Well I would suggest not listening to this comment as it’s not a cesspool. I lived in Pitt Meadows for 10 years….had my place broken into and my bike stolen. I have now lived in Maple Ridge for the past 3 years and have had no problems or issues at all. I am within walking distance from downtown and love it. Never have I felt unsafe.

Currently live on 208th further down from the house for sale. Agree with what amo8 said. A few issues with homeless going through garbage or using the greenbelt as a path. Last week some propane tanks were apparently stolen from a neighbors yard but other than that nothing in the 7 years I’ve been there. Several homeless do live in the greenbelt behind value village and you will see police there quite often.
