"Winnipeg Free Press Article: Tom Brodbeck 

Premier Heather Stefanson has not made a good first impression on Manitobans.

Whether it was her rejection of science last month in a surprise announcement to lift all pandemic public health measures by March 15, her refusal to condemn the so-called ""freedom convoy"" occupiers or last week’s decision to congratulate her son’s hockey team when asked about the death of a COVID-19 patient Krystal Mousseau, the Tory leader has not impressed voters.

According to a new Free Press/Probe Research Inc. survey, the Progressive Conservative party under Stefanson is almost as unpopular as it was under premier Brian Pallister, who resigned last year after Tory support hit rock bottom.

According to the recent poll, only 34 per cent of Manitobans would vote for, or are leaning towards, the PC party. That’s well-below the NDP’s 44 per cent support provincewide. It’s not much better than the Tories’ 29 per cent showing under Pallister before he resigned Sept 1.

The PC party got a bump in the polls when Tory house leader and cabinet minister Kelvin Goertzen took over as premier on an interim basis for two months.

However, the numbers have since declined under Stefanson, especially in Winnipeg, where support has fallen to 23 per cent — the same level it was (22 per cent) in Pallister’s final days.

At that level, the Tories would likely lose most of their Winnipeg seats in the next election (no later than Oct. 3 2023) and be relegated to the opposition benches. The Tories have strong support in southern Manitoba outside the capital. However, if they don’t have parity with the NDP — or something close to it — in Winnipeg, they don’t usually have enough seats to form government.

When Stefanson took over in November, she had the advantage of a modest momentum shift. Goertzen was seen as a steady hand in the premier’s office and the bump in the polls for the Tories reflected that; those gains soon evaporated.

Stefanson’s first mistake was how quickly she ignored public health data when deciding when and how fast to lift COVID-19 restrictions.

It was seen as reckless. Her inability to defend those decisions intelligently (giggling when asked a serious question at a news conference didn’t help) and her admission last month government was placing too much emphasis on public health advice revealed a shocking level of incompetence.

Under Stefanson, government has also made virtually no progress on reducing wait times for surgeries and diagnostic testing, which grew to record levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force struck by Stefanson in December hasn’t provided the public with an update since January. Meanwhile, the backlogs continue to grow.

Under Stefanson, Manitobans have also been left in the dark on overall hospital operations.

No one from Shared Health, which oversees hospitals, has provided the public with a detailed update on bed utilization, ER wait times or staffing issues in almost three months — at least not at news conferences where officials can be questioned. Other than limited information from the province’s incident command spokesman David Matear (via Zoom-based news conferences), the public has been given little insight into the status of Manitoba’s health-care recovery plan.

Meanwhile, the province announced this week it will be further reducing the scope of information it releases about COVID-19 patients in hospital.

It’s hard to tell who’s in charge of Manitoba’s health-care system these days and what’s being done to fix it. That’s concerning, especially with 359 COVID-19 patients still in hospital, as of Friday.

All of this has reflected poorly on Stefanson, who, at times, doesn’t even look like she wants the job. She doesn’t exude confidence and continues to show poor judgement (including her failure to make a timely apology for her inappropriate response to questions about Mousseau, who died in May 2021 during an attempt to airlift her out of province for COVID-19 care).

The Tories have about a year-and-a-half to turn this around before the next provincial election. It’s not a lot of time. It doesn’t help when the new leader stumbles as often as Stefanson has.

You never get a second chance at a good first impression.

Area managers push the store managers for sales. These guys over see the locations in MB. The store mangers salary is based off hourly and commission. As are the area managers.

Ever since mpi gave them the ability to sell tires on the mpi program they have been over selling tires and even more so over priced tires. I would say nearly 100 percent of tire sales are mpi program. 

Every tire set gets that salesmen, not Technician, 25 bucks. So there is the incentive. It adds up say you try 10 times In a day and land 1 or 2 that's 50 bucks extra to your base salary.

So the area managers essentially push for tires sales ever since, mostly because they over price the tires as well. Grossly over priced.

"Okay. So what’s the solution? Do we keep this facility open so these people have jobs?

Corrections officers need to be transferred to other corrections facilities. And corrections facilities are only in specific places. And if they don’t want to do that? Then unfortunately, they are out of a job.

I get 100% that this sucks. The job is hard enough as it is. And I certainly wouldn’t want to move either. So I’m not saying that I don’t get these things. I’m just saying that sometimes a situation just is what it is and if this facility is no longer needed, then, unfortunately, the jobs that it provided are also gone.

Because we see so many shitty job cuts by greedy governments or greedy corporations, we are conditioned to think that all cuts are horrible. But a correctional facility literally becoming obsolete is a legit reason to cut jobs.

"Choosing a new leader hasn’t revived support for Manitoba’s ailing Progressive Conservative government. The latest Probe Research survey conducted for the Free Press shows the gap has widened between Tories and the NDP, who have pulled even further ahead in Winnipeg.

""I would say that this is a catastrophic poll for the PCs,"" said longtime political analyst Christopher Adams. ""The PCs are are pretty well at rock-bottom in the polls right now.""

Provincial support for the NDP is 44 per cent — a two per cent increase from December’s survey. PC party members elected Heather Stefanson to replace unpopular premier Brian Pallister in October, and have seen support drop to 34 per cent from 37 per cent.

Gender hasn’t appeared to help garner Stefanson — Manitoba’s first female premier — support from women. In Winnipeg, the PCs have just 16 per cent support, compared to the NDP, which has the backing of by 50 per cent of women. Among the Tories’ rural base, 21 per cent of women support the PCs, compared to 42 per cent favouring the NDP.

Lifting pandemic restrictions hasn’t lifted support for the governing Tories, either. The Probe Research survey was carried out March 9-21, after the province eliminated the proof-of-vaccination requirement to enter many indoor public places on March 1 and on March 15 ended the indoor mask mandate.

And being a Winnipegger hasn’t helped the new premier. Support for the PCs fell four points to 23 per cent in the vote-rich city. The NDP gained two points and has the support of 52 per cent of decided or leaning voters.

The 29 per cent spread between the two parties in Winnipeg is stunning, Adams said.

""I’ve been watching the conservatives in Manitoba for a few decades and I’ve never seen them down at 23 per cent,"" the University of Manitoba political studies adjunct professor said. ""That’s unprecedented.""

The number wasn’t that low at the height of NDP popularity in the 2000s, when Gary Doer was premier and the Tories languished in the political wilderness, he said.

In southwest Winnipeg, the traditionally third-place Liberals (20 per cent) did slightly better than the PCs’ 17 per cent with support for the NDP at 38 per cent. Provincewide, the Liberals got a bump — up three per cent, roughly the poll’s margin of error — to 18 per cent support.
The southwest corner of the city includes the former Tory stronghold of Fort Whyte. In Tuesday’s byelection there to fill the seat formerly held by Pallister, PC candidate Obby Khan barely won in a nail-biter.

Sixteen per cent of those polled said they were undecided. Seven per cent said they’d prefer a party not represented in the legislature, including two per cent who’d vote for a Green party candidate — a two per cent drop for the Greens.
Older voters traditionally preferred the PCs over the NDP, but that support has slipped. The two parties are virtually tied in support among voters age 55 and over (37 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively).

The governing Tories have been in decline since December 2020, when the NDP moved ahead of Pallister’s party for the first time since the 2019 election.
Provincial support for the party bottomed out in June, when the Probe/Free Press survey showed it plummeted to 29 per cent from 35 per cent three months earlier, while the NDP gained five points to 47 per cent support. That gap narrowed in the next two polls conducted in September and December with the New Democrats 10 points ahead of the PCs in the latest poll.

Probe Research president and founder Scott MacKay said that at the PCs low point in June, Pallister had become so ""toxic"" that it appeared the combative leader would ""drag the party down"" without a chance of winning another election.

""Replacing him with almost anyone (it seemed) would be a good thing and maybe put them back on a good footing again, but that really didn’t happen,"" MacKay said Friday. “It seems that there’s sort of a steady stream of bad news for (the premier)… fumbles or problems that she’s having with her leadership and her statements. There’s time for these things to change, but it sure doesn’t look good for them right now.""

Adams said Khan’s byelection win was a ""bright spot"" for the PCs ""in their winter of discontent."" The charismatic ex-Blue Bomber and entrepreneur is new to politics and will become Manitoba’s first Muslim MLA. The premier referred to Khan as ""the face of the party"" after his narrow win on election night.

""Many might be seeing him as a leader in waiting — someone who would hit the reset button,"" Adams said.

Whoever leads the PCs will have to carry the government’s baggage — including intensive-care unit patients being sent out of province and the growing backlog of surgical and diagnostic procedures — he said, adding if the party wants to retain power in the next general election expected by Oct.3 2023, it’ll have to rebuild.

""They’ve got to convince the average, middle-class voter that the party can handle the health crisis that’s happening,"" he said.

And the Tories will have to overcome dissatisfaction with province’s handling of COVID-19 restrictions, the so-called ""freedom convoy"" in Manitoba that blocked the border and occupied Memorial Park, along with Stefanson’s ""issues of communications,"" Adams said.

He said he’s starting to see a PC strategy emerge.

""They’re going to position Wab Kinew in the next election as the guy that they advise women voters not to support,"" Adams said, referring to a Free Press report this week on widely respected Municipal Affairs Minister Eileen Clarke vouching for the premier’s kindness while going after the NDP leader for repeatedly grilling Stefanson in the house with tough questions about the death of critical-care patient Krystal Mousseau.
""Wab Kinew is being positioned as the misogynist leader of the opposition who won’t let go of this issue,"" while the premier is ""bearing the brunt of the opposition’s repeated questions,"" Adams said.

The poll was conducted with a random and representative sample of 1,000 adults living in Manitoba. One can say with 95 per cent certainty that the results are within (plus or minus) 3.1 percentage points of what they would have been if the entire adult population of Manitoba had been surveyed.

They didn’t boycott because servers didn’t get breaks or concrete end times. They boycotted it because the chief of operations and a management staff were creepy and made servers uncomfortable. Other things like treating staff like crap were just the cherry on top. I worked for them for almost ten years and I stuck around because the cash was awesome and my coworkers were my best friends.

"Once again people are getting wound up about something they didn't read properly or just like to bitch. 
Most of this is ""water"", you know the stuff that occurs when snow melts in the spring. Compared to most of the runoff coming from farmers fields, nature and livestock operations, it's damn near Bottled Water quality. 
People talk about Two Billion like it's pocket change and it doesn't come from Government, it comes from us, the taxpayers.
Most importantly, nature with a little help from modern technology and land management is by far the most cost effective and arguably echo friendly approach. 
Protect and expand the marshes in the Red River Delta, stop allowing farmers to ""tile"" their land and associated enhanced runoff practices. Finally, accept that Governments only like big flashy construction projects that they can order without concern for the financial liabilities down the road.

Being an employee myself, I will be the first to say Stella’s is not perfect. I do not think that they embody the values of the environmentally conscious feel good company that they portray themselves to be. That being said, I think Stella’s continues to be criticized for things that are common within the industry such as not giving servers breaks, not giving employees concrete end times, and of course not allowing unionization to occur. 

Personally, I’ve never heard of a restaurant that consistently gives their servers scheduled breaks and provides concrete end times. I also am not aware of a unionized restaurant in Winnipeg. 

I’m not saying these things shouldn’t become the standard in the industry.

"All I would say is really open your mind to seeing the hypocrisy in their theology and teaching and you will likely see it.  Tithing when used responsibly to support the community and missions is one thing, using it to enhance one’s personal wealth or build bigger fancier buildings is another.  There’s nothing wrong with having a facility that can accommodate your congregation, but when it’s done for show, you have to start wondering.  What tends to happen is “the ministry” only happens in the building and not out in the community as it should.  Yes pastors and staff deserve to get paid, but these are leaders of faith so to have your church buy you big houses and Harley’s etc just shows poor leadership and a lack of humility.  I’m not saying people in ministry shouldn’t have nice things but it’s the way it’s flaunted that is troubling.  The head pastor literally shows those things off as symbols of how well the church and he are doing, a sign of blessing as they see it. 

I’ve known many people who have been hurt by that church’s prosperity gospel theology over the years.  It’s caused many to walk away from their faith completely which is always sad.  Blessing in scripture has nothing to do with material things of this world, it’s always about the spiritual.  Suffering can be a blessing if it draws you nearer to God, the Bible is literally full of stories that illustrate this.  Springs, and prosperity gospel in general puts God in a box and creates a mountain of guilt for people if their life doesn’t look shiny and blessed.  Heaven forbid you get cancer or can barely afford to pay your bills.  I know of an instance where an immigrant couple who was struggling to feed their family were asked to give more to the church in order to be able to join a special small group.  Springs even argued with the couple’s employer when they questioned the church’s request for these people to give even more from their meagre wage.  I also know a person who was told by leaders that their father’s cancer had spread because he had unresolved sin in his life and they needed to pray with more faith.  Ironically at that time the father had never been closer to God than in the years leading up to his cancer diagnosis so….

Point being, it’s easy to pack people into pews with fancy buildings.  It’s even easier when you teach God is an equation or program, that if you just know how to work it, it will pop out blessing after blessing like a vending machine.  Formulaic teaching like this is just nicely packaged dogma.  Spiritual fruit is how the Bible tells us to assess spiritual health.  Springs would point to all the people they have attending as that fruit but to that I would say entertaining and telling people what they want to hear will always fill stadiums.  It’s what happens in the community, the undercurrent of faith as it flows through our neighbourhoods and city that is what matters.  The stuff that isn’t for show but comes from hearts that are truly being transformed.  Their stance with Covid was just another example of their ego and hubris.  Rather than humbly getting out into the community and finding tangible ways to help those in need, or even just protecting the community at large, they were fighting to congregate together without masks.  The early Church and Christianity spread rapidly in the first 400 years because Christians were known to run in to cities during pandemics and serve the people everyone was trying to get away from.  It’s why the concept of hospitals is attributed to the early Church.  They didn’t hunker down in buildings together and complain about the government and pretend God would protect them with some special blessing.  They risked their lives and comfort to serve others. 

It’s not to say God can’t work through that place or even the programs they run, He’s not restricted by a building, person, program, or denomination so there’s hope.  If you want to be properly fed spiritually though, I’d recommend looking elsewhere.  Or at least be mindful of the teaching you are taking in when attending there. It’s not my place to judge another person’s soul but their actions and record in this community are worth questioning.  Thinking critically about your church community is good no matter where you attend.  Sounds like you no longer attend, which seems a growing trend.  I think if more church communities were truly healthy many of us would be more motivated to be a part of a faith community.",t2_1fprrwyj,Graiello,0,1648245564.0,0,t1_i24d1n5,i24d1n5,False,hcocob,t3_tncktz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tncktz/which_storebusiness_is_almost_definitely_a_front/,Which store/business is almost definitely a front for something illegal?,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tncktz/which_storebusiness_is_almost_definitely_a_front/i24d1n5/,4,r/Winnipeg,0,4

"I get they’re frustrated. If any get laid off, and aren’t given jobs at other facilities, just remember to sell your soft skills if you don’t plan on pursuing higher education. For the record I’m not a CO, but I’ve applied in the past and have researched the job. In order to work as a JC/CO you need to bring the following skills, you only refine them in corrections:

Written communication skills (incident report writing)

Verbal communication skills (from communicating with staff, coworkers, inmates, the public)

Interpersonal skills (from communicating with inmates)

Stress-management skills (from the messed up things you see in an institution)

Teamwork skills (from the need to communicate with your coworkers, take the lead when needed, allow another coworker who can better handle a situation to interject)

Ability to adapt to change (correctional environments constantly change and some days can be a nightmare)

Problem solving skills (inmates complain about their roommates, resolution to this requires problem solving)

Commit to continuous learning 

working with diverse populations(inmates come from various backgrounds, so do your coworkers and the public)

Working with indigenous peoples (unfortunately indigenous people are over represented in prisons)

As for skills you gain pertaining to being a JC:

Case Management skills (part of being a CO/JC involves case work)

Ability to work with youth

Ability to work with vulnerable persons/at risk youth

Ability to receive, analyze, and critique information provided to you (say someone calls the institution asking if an inmate is there, you don’t give them the info right away, you collect info of the caller, relationship, etc; inmate is found in an unauthorized area and tells you the superintendent let them in, and it’s 8pm and you know the superintendent isn’t in).

Ability to interpret and apply policies, and legislation (every time you have to enforce an inmate breach of policy, see them committing criminal acts in the facility)

Not sure how to word it but you gain skills from dealing with the courts (anytime a lawyer tries to gaslight you for example) and just dealing with the courts in general.
There’s many soft skills that I’m not including, even the correctional managers and such gain more soft skills pertaining to their position.",t2_3n4chvwx,MS55BW26GR1419,0,1648244458.0,0,t1_i24aijo,i24aijo,True,AdPrevious1079,t3_tnk1ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tnk1ol/angry_staff_learn_portage_youth_jail_closing_via/,Angry staff learn Portage youth jail closing via social media More than 100 workers face career upheaval,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tnk1ol/angry_staff_learn_portage_youth_jail_closing_via/i24aijo/,2,r/Winnipeg,0,2

"Context: Eileen Clarke condemned NDP opposition leader Wab Kinew for continuing to ask Premier Stephenson about the family of an indigenous mother who died during a patient transfer due to improperly trained transfer staff.

Clarke accused Kinew of ""exerting his power and control over a woman"" (directly alluding to the NDP leader's troubled history) by asking the premier of the province if she called the family to apologize for brushing off the death to talk about her kid's hockey game. 

If you ask me, Clarke's remarks were partisan and personal attacks that would probably lead to disciplinary action if the genders were swapped. I don't expect any better from the PCs anyways...

"I respect the fact you are frustrated about sewage getting dumped into the river, but this whole situation is.mich more complicated than you understand, as people have been pointing out to you. As someone who works in the water and wastewater industry let me enlighten you. 

First of all water and wastewater regulations are provincially mandated. So you can't take your problem to the feds because it's not in their wheelhouse.

Secondly there have been upgrades being completed to the wastewater system for the last 15 years in Winnipeg. They started with upgrades to the West End sewage treatment plant, have continued with upgrades to the South End sewage treatment plant and will be continuing with upgrades to the North End treatment plant very shortly. There have also been upgrades done to many sewage lift stations in Winnipeg, including a full centralized monitoring upgrade that was completed around 5 years ago.

Finally there is the breaking of the combined sewer water system. This work has already started in at least Scotia Heights with the creation of stormwater lift stations and the creation of the main stormwater trunk line along Semple. Contractors are currently working on pushing the line further into West Kildonan and Garden City.

All of these projects need two things. First they are all very expensive and require tripartite funding to deal with them. Secondly there are logistical issues of constructing everything, which requires specific planning and enough construction crews to deal with. So even if there was a will to fix the system in the next year, or even 5 years, there isn't a practical way to actually deal with it.

So while it is an issue to have sewage dumped to the river, it is just a reality you will need to live with until the work can get done.",t2_aoio3,campain85,0,1648243414.0,0,t1_i24833z,i24833z,True,Tobagardens,t3_tns54f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tns54f/sewage_into_the_assiniboine/,Sewage into the Assiniboine,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tns54f/sewage_into_the_assiniboine/i24833z/,13,r/Winnipeg,0,13

"Just my opinion, it's more about the time you drive than the place. When I was learning, I'd wake up real early and drive. If I stalled, I wouldn't have to worry about blocking traffic. I'd also focus a lot on areas that have you stop on an incline to practice getting out of 1st in that scenario. Have some good tunes going and enjoy the ride!

My breakthrough moment driving stick was the day I researched how the clutch and transmission actually worked. From then on, I could visualize what the car was doing with each action instead of only relying on muscle memory. The difference in driving performance was like night and day. This approach might not work for everyone.

"Wow. I don't want to argue that the Dear Winnipeg blogs aren't interesting for discussion but this most recent blog post should demonstrate to everyone how little the authors understand. I think I understand where they're trying to go with this but they missed the mark as others say.

I find it interesting that some of those who say they missed the mark only like the blogs that align with their values. It needs to go beyond this. Opinions and values are one thing but there has to be real data to back it up and I can tell you, that has yet to happen on this blog or anywhere in this City.",t2_mnpu482,AnonymousCitizen204,0,1648235056.0,0,t1_i23nqfj,i23nqfj,True,upofadown,t3_tn9iwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tn9iwk/no_we_dont_need_more_density/,"No, We Don’t Need More Density",/r/Winnipeg/comments/tn9iwk/no_we_dont_need_more_density/i23nqfj/,1,r/Winnipeg,0,1
