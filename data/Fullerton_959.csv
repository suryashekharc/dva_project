Downtown Fullerton bar owner gets entertainment hours curbed, loses libel suit
JP23 Urban Kitchen in downtown Fullerton. 
JP23 Urban Kitchen in downtown Fullerton. Owner Jacob Poozhikala had his live entertainment hours limited by the city while losing a libel suit this week that followed anti-rape culture protests outside his business.(Gabriel San Román )

BY GABRIEL SAN ROMÁNSTAFF WRITER 
FEB. 3, 2022 2:59 PM PT

Last summer, JP23 Urban Kitchen and Bar in downtown Fullerton became the site of protests against rape culture after a young woman claimed she was drugged at the popular nightclub before being raped at a nearby parking garage.

More women came forward with stories of their own, on social media and out in front of JP23. The protests became a weekly event as tensions remained high.

Nightclub owner Jacob Poozhikala filed several lawsuits in the aftermath.

He took Fullerton and its police department to court for alleged due process and equal protection violations over an attempt to renew an entertainment permit. He also filed libel and slander suits against the alleged rape victim and two people who supported her, including Luis Huang, an Orange County resident who emailed Fullerton City Council members about the protests.

But Poozhikala’s problems with the city began before that.

According to court documents, the JP23 proprietor applied in October 2020 to have an entertainment permit renewed for the venue so that it could continue hosting DJs and dancing every night from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. The coronavirus pandemic and changing business restrictions delayed the process before Fullerton Police Chief Bob Dunn took a closer look at the nightclub.

He called for a remedy meeting on Aug. 27, 2021, over the permit renewal.

Dunn cited a high volume of service calls around the venue between September 2020 and July 2021. According to Fullerton P.D. statistics, the calls resulted in 44 criminal offense reports and 50 arrests within that time frame.

The calls centered on a host of complaints including assaults, overcrowding, drug possession and even an attempted murder.

The police chief’s Aug. 17, 2021, letter to Poozhikala also noted that JP23 exceeded capacity limits during a fire marshal check earlier that summer when 333 patrons were counted indoors, a violation Dunn found “especially troubling” given the owner’s prior conviction for misdemeanor overcrowding.

Lighting, queuing and opaque window coverings at the business rounded out the rest of Dunn’s list of concerns. He even addressed the “spiking” and sexual assault allegation that prompted protests.

At the height of tensions, JP23 posted surveillance footage showing the alleged victim at the nightclub on the night in question. The video appeared to sway the public opinion of some against the alleged victim while further inflaming accusations by her supporters that the nightclub perpetuated “victim blaming” rape culture.

The bar eventually deleted the video, but not before Dunn gave a closer look.

He characterized the women in the video as “obviously intoxicated,” a state, he wrote, that the bar “contributed to through the over service of alcohol, which according to reports includes at least one ‘fishbowl’ drink,” intended for six patrons but often imbibed by fewer.

Dunn even considered limiting the bar to single-drink service only.

During the remedy meeting, Poozhikala noted how he made changes made to his security program, removed opaque film from JP23’s windows and stopped the bar from serving “fishbowl” drinks among other changes, including training staff to adopt a code word for suspected drink-spiking incidents.

Dunn commended Poozhikala’s candor but noted his belief that late live entertainment hours at JP23 contributed to the calls for service outlined in his letter.

In September, he temporarily renewed the venue’s permit under the conditions that live entertainment end by 10 p.m. Sunday through Wednesday and by 11 p.m. Thursday through Saturday.

Poozhikala had 30 days from the date of the Aug. 27 remedy meeting to demonstrate compliance before further review. He sent a letter to Dunn claiming that since he couldn’t appeal the chief’s decision, it constituted a due process violation.

On Sept. 24, Dunn responded with a letter to Jennifer Harris, an attorney representing Poozhikala, informing her he had decided to revoke the temporary permit.

“The remedy meeting procedure was merely an optional procedure to use to try and resolve issues which has proven to be unsuccessful,” Dunn wrote. “We have chosen to abandon it at this point.”

Poozhikala exercised his right to appeal and have a hearing before City Council; he also sued Fullerton and its police department in December.

In court documents, the complaint on Poozhikala’s behalf claimed that any relevant investigation into his business practices should have been focused on the year prior to his October 2020 permit renewal request, not after.

“The Fullerton Municipal Code utilized to ‘revoke’ JP23’s permit is invalid and unconstitutional,” the suit further argued.

Fullerton’s interim city manager declined to comment on the suit and its claims.

In December, Fullerton City Council held a hearing over the permit unrelated to any litigation.

Poozhikala testified that almost half of his revenue came from patrons that arrived to JP23 between 9 and 10 p.m. Dunn told council members that he believed the nightclub’s live entertainment hours should be curbed at midnight on weekends and 11 p.m. on weekdays.

The council found Dunn’s suggestion reasonable and deemed Poozhikala’s testimony to be an “unproven concern for loss of business.”

In January, four council members voted to issue an entertainment permit to JP23 with the live entertainment limitations Dunn suggested; Mayor Pro Tem Bruce Whitaker abstained from the closed session vote.

The formal recommendations were adopted this week at council.

“JP23 will be seeking further review from the Superior Court of the City Council decision,” said Harris. “The lawsuit alleging constitutional issues regarding the Fullerton Municipal Code is still ongoing.”

Lawsuit against Huang dismissed
While Poozhikala claimed Fullerton stifled his free speech rights in one case, a separate libel lawsuit he filed against Huang was dismissed this week by Orange County Superior Court Judge Gregory H. Lewis.

Huang sent an Oct. 26 email addressed to Fullerton City Council members about the JP23 protests. It was also addressed to Pete Hardin, a candidate for Orange County district attorney, and a local blogger. Huang referenced a Fullerton Observer article on the protests and invited council members to speak with alleged victims.

The correspondence somehow made its way back to Poozhikala, who then filed a libel and slander suit against Huang. Harris offered no comment as to how her client came into possession of the email.

“I have to say, I was pretty shocked,” Jeff Lewis, an attorney representing Huang unrelated to the judge, said of the suit. “California law is pretty clear that you can communicate with lawmakers without fear of civil liability.”

The suit, which was filed in November, claimed the correspondence caused damage to Poozhikala’s reputation and harmed his business.

“In Huang’s email, he states that there are allegations of more than 40 sexual assault survivors, who have shared their traumatic story of being roofied and raped by the owner of JP23 and the security guards at JP23’s Fullerton and Long Beach locations,” the complaint read. “The entire email is false.”

Huang’s attorney made a motion to strike the suit under the state’s anti-SLAPP law.

Judge Lewis found that the email constituted “protected speech” in a tentative ruling before formally dismissing the suit on Monday.

“We are pleased that the Superior Court recognized this lawsuit for what it was — an improper attempt to silence a voice through expensive litigation,” said Jeff Lewis. “I hope that the plaintiffs here will focus their time and money on making their establishments as safe as they can rather than pursue further frivolous lawsuits.”

Harris stated to TimesOC that Poozhikala will appeal Judge Lewis’ decision.

"I got it… switched from Spectrum to FiberCity after 15 years… it’s super fast, but it feels like you’re dealing with a bunch of rookies. 

The install process was a pain. They would schedule a install date and time and they would not show up. It took them four visits to complete my installation. When I tried to talk someone, it was impossible. The  number they provided me with was a cellphone for a person in Florida and when I called it sounded very disorganized and almost shady. The call center they use for tech support handles various companies. I had to deal with the contractors themselves. Nobody at Fiber City would deal with escalating my issues, I had to call the cellphones for the contractors assigned to my order. It was almost laughable. 

FiberCity uses different contractors for each phase of the install. (City fiber, fiber to your home, billing, tech support, etc.)  To this day, Fiber City shows up as Gigabit Now on the bill. 

The install techs were very sloppy. They zigzagged the fiber when taking it from the street to my house. In order to run the fiber they have to dig a trench through your lawn. The sod died and because it was zig zagged my Lawn loooked awful.  The guys had to access my crawl space and it’s very dusty down there… they left a mess, they didn’t clean or cover anything, they didn’t even close the attic access. 

Of course they powered the equipment on and it was very fast. I went from 250mbps to 1gbps at a great price. 

I might switch back to Spectrum when my year promotion is up. Connectivity is good, it hardly goes out, but neither did Spectrum. 

I was expecting more of a personal experience when it came to dealing with customer service, but it felt a lot more disorganized than Spectrum and you know their reputation.",t2_40t694sh,Bichobichir,0,1642566592.0,0,t1_ht9zp30,ht9zp30,True,srwaxalot,t3_s79ay4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fullerton/comments/s79ay4/fiber_internet/,Fiber internet,/r/Fullerton/comments/s79ay4/fiber_internet/ht9zp30/,1,r/Fullerton,0,1

"As a female I’ve taken them all, Amtrak, Metrolink and LA Metro Rails all during late night and early morning hours and I’ve always felt the most safe on an Amtrak and Metrolink because there are conductors walking around the train cars. LA metro light rails have nobody really patrolling each car so you might witness sketchy behavior like pointless arguments and stinky homeless people in soiled attire but they have security cameras everywhere and an emergency button to contact the train engineer.

What I will advise is during the late night, don’t stare at anyone, have anything expensive or important attached to you at all times because there will always be pick pockets looking for opportunities. Don’t get involved in confrontations or butt into anyone else’s confrontations unless it’s one of those situations where you need to bring in the conductor or have the train stop at the next station for police intervention. 

Usually train trips are uneventful and people are tired and sleeping during the late night runs.

"If food is involved at a place to start, Heroes is a good spot. Fun atmosphere and the Nachos are great to share and the beers are big. Bootleggers now has food and the Pickled monk has pour your own beers and decent food as well. Roscoes has huge sandwiches, drinks, and sometimes live music earlier in the evening. These are all good places to meet up and reconnect with the homies before the alcohol catches up with you. Honorable mentions are Stubriks, the Bowery, and Fullerton Brew Co (formerly known as stadium tavern).

As your night progresses, Matador, Revolucion (big Latin vibes), Hopscotch and Bourbon Street are the loud and fun places to be. Matador, Revolucion, and Bourbon are more dancing and clubbing oriented. Hopscotch can be sometimes as well, but it's not really dedicated to being a club. Excellent cocktails though. I have had many fun nights there.

My advisory is that while JP 23 will look like a shining light on a hill in the middle of the night for all the drunkards looking for fun to flock to, it ain't worth it. Too crowded, too expensive, attracts a lot of unsavory people (the date rapey kind) and a lot of my friends have had it with that place.

Big shoutout to the Continental Room for always having live music or a DJ on the weekends supporting local artists, decently priced drinks, and a cool atmosphere. Kind of small though. There's dancing here too!

If you want a classy, sexy, pricey, and tasty option, go to The Cellar. Phenomenal cocktails and great food. It's small and kind of quiet though, much better for dates than big get togethers. Thought I would throw it in the list just in case that's more your speed. Good place to start early for that special birthday drink. 

Other than that Happy Birthday, have fun, and good luck. I would avoid the parking structure closest to the train station and the bus station. It ALWAYS smells like piss.

I personally am not a fan of all the fireworks leading up to and after the 4th. It’s fun on the 4th but southern California has a love affair with them where it’s obvious that “Safe and sane” is a ridiculous notion. The FPD isn’t going to be able to change the culture of SoCal regarding the absurd amount of fireworks that people let off this time of year. We could pass all the laws we want but no police department is equipped to handle such things.

> The City of Fullerton has backed away from a lawsuit against residents and local bloggers Joshua Ferguson and David Curlee for publishing police misconduct records, with the city now having to pay their legal fees and damages.

> The blog Ferguson and Curlee write for, Friends for Fullerton&#039;s Future, caught the city&#039;s attention back in June 2019 when it began posting documents from an internal police department investigation detailing how former City Manager Joe Felz got a ride home from Fullerton police officers after drinking and wrecking his car election night 2016.

> Leading up to the settlement, two different Orange County Superior Court Judges - Thomas Delaney and James Crandall - twice blocked the blog from publishing secret city hall documents.

If you’re shopping for clip-ons and shoes I remember buying some from jenson USA they are in corona and they had pretty reasonable prices for clip ons and shoes were not bad either.

Nice bike. Yes if you ride a long ways or on the road a good long ride is to go down malvern to beach then head south to artesia then go west toward the river bed which will be past valley view and there is a paved river bed trail. Just don’t go there too late since there are plenty of transients along that route. I used to drive down to the park in Yorba Linda off the 91 and imperial hwy and ride the river bed trail all the way to the beach it’s about a 60mile round trip ride but I’d you want to do about 20 miles that trail will take you to angel stadium and plenty of people ride that trail too just a good way to ride and not have to worry about cars or traffic lights.,t2_5ahgb,hugeness101,0,1610668104.0,0,t1_gjacitd,gjacitd,False,RebornBull,t3_kxg3j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fullerton/comments/kxg3j4/beginner_cyclist_looking_for_friends/,Beginner Cyclist ; Looking for friends!,/r/Fullerton/comments/kxg3j4/beginner_cyclist_looking_for_friends/gjacitd/,1,r/Fullerton,0,1

"there are a ton of trails for running all around Fullerton.   


I frequent the Rosecrans trail often since it's near my house. A lot of the trails seem interconnected though, so sometimes I'll just run and see where it takes me. Check out my GPS and work my way back to where I started.  


I've also seen a track behind Parks Elementary school. I've run on it on the weekends before. It's easy to just walk in, but probably wouldn't allow it during school hours.

Sunny Hills High has a track, but I've never been there before

Fullerton college has a couple of tracks, but unsure of availability

Clark Park isn't really a trail or a track, but I run there from time to time.  
If you can snag a street parking spot you won't have to pay for parking. Has a lake and pretty flat for running

And then make your way to over to Laguna Lake and do some laps around there. Or just simply do some laps around Laguna Lake

"UPDATE: WE FOUND THE OWNERS.  Thanks everyone.

Hey guys, I found a lost dog in a parking lot on Beach Blvd and Rosecrans Ave near Clark Park last night.  I was wondering if anyone knows someone missing a dog like this one.

"Fullerton in general is a pretty safe area, so is nearby Brea. Anaheim and Buena Park are not known for being as safe. However, sometimes it really just depends on the exact area.

As far as the 8 month lease, you're more likely to find that from a private owner (condo) than an apartment complex. Some other ideas:

* There are homeowners who will rent rooms in their house for extra income and that will be around $800.
* [University House](https://uhfullerton.com) near Cal State Fullerton rents furnished apartments by the room, e.g. $1000 for a single bedroom in a 2-4 bedroom apartment. I don't know how flexible they are with the lease term. 
* Subletting or taking over someone's lease.
* Airbnb has monthly rates for rooms. 

I know it seems risky but waiting until 2-3 weeks before moving to start looking is typical. I know it's super annoying if you like to have things planned in advance. Hopefully you can come to CA first to look at places in person instead of agreeing to anything sick unseen.

You didn't mention whether you'll have a car; if not, proximity to your office or a bus line that takes you there will be important to consider.

You may also want to ask the company you will be working for if they have any resources for finding housing, especially if hiring temporary out-of-state employees is typical for them.

"Any where within a 20 minute drive of fullerton, plan on rent being at minimum $1200 for a studio, $2000 for a 2 bedroom if you wanted to do a roommate.

"Take aways:
Fullerton has the highest incidence of homelessness in OC, but our city officials aren't exactly stoked to offer incentive for people to join this program because ""they're afraid it'll attract homelessness""

The restrictions are real rigid for eligibility. People are surprised that they only utilized a fraction of the parking spaces.  Baseline requirement is being able to prove residence in Fullerton via Drivers License or utility bill, or a kid enrolled in school in Fullerton. Even if that requirement is met, the applicant needs to have updated vehicle registration. I dunno about y'all, but my registration for my 13 year old car is over $100.
