"No one adopts ""quite a bit"" in this country.  No one.  

That is, in fact, part of the problem.  

You are wanting to quote ""statistics"" such as ""quite a bit.""  That isn't really a quantifiable answer.

Christians are more than 2x likely to adopt vs non-Christians.  Not that we can't delve into how and why that statistic is majorly skewed, but the problem is, 2x against what number?  2x vs 1 is 2.  Right?  And I think it can be agreed upon that 2 is not a high number.  So we can look at percentages, maybe?  5%?

That is the percentage of Christians that successfully adopt in the US.  5% is not a high percentage by any stretch.

We're not even starting to touch all of the underlying issues with not only adoptions and the requirements, but the legal challenges, the costs involved, who is running the adoption agencies and how they choose adoptive parents, how laws unfairly effect certain demographics and force children into the foster system... well, I could go on for paragraphs but I guess I won't.

This isn't an issue with just one cause and one effect.  This whole topic is extremely complicated and goes back to all the underlying issues we have in this country on numerous levels.

So back to your original statement and my answer to it.

""Who adopts the most?""

The answer, directly, is white, Christian men.  Statistically.

"My favorite trail is Loop B followed by Loop A. I've seen less foot traffic on these compared to Loop C & D, but there's usually a mountain biker or two.

Loop C & D are great though too. They are a bit more challenging than A & B, but not too bad.  Also worth mentioning is the Whispering Pine trail located at the front of the park by the gatehouse. It is a short, easy trail, but takes you by some of the original features of the park.

Regarding camping, there really are no secluded sites and the weekend reservations are usually booked-up in advanced. If you are looking for less people, non-holiday weekdays are the best.  For tent camping, there four areas to camp. My favorites are Red Oak followed by Dogwood Ridge.

"I think it was 2019, my my buddy lived over on by the airport on 64, on three separate occasions three gas stations close to it somebody was murdered, one of which I think was an attempted robbery.

There was another time where three people were shot in the face after answering their door. I don't remember seeing if they caught the guy but I think the assumption was it was drug related. 

And pretty sure it was about 10 years ago now, there was a guy murdered in the parking lot of the plumbing supply place just north of White House on 110. And then shortly thereafter that there were people driving around hanging guns out their car window.

"I would recommend the Residence Inn/Fairfield Inn on W. Heritage. My parents have stayed at both hotels and are nice. They are quite new and clean and have breakfast included. They are on the south side of town so reasonably safe and at the center of most things to do in Tyler. 

Regarding food, Tyler is tough. For a city this size, the restaurant options are limited (if you want to stay away from chain restaurants) and get very busy starting at 5:30. With all of that said and depending on your budget, my suggestions are The Grove (pricey for Tyler but beautiful setting), Mercado (standard Tex Mex), Wasabi (pan Asian), Local BBQ (new restaurant but pretty good), FD’s/ Twelve (owned by the same restaurant group - standard American).

">They haven't had a true plan for FTTH rollout for consumer products in Tyler. 

I think this is the only statement we really need to address here.  

 It doesn't really matter how much fiber they are running around town if they aren't providing the service to people.  Even if there is fiber running to every neighborhood in the Tyler area, it doesn't matter if they don't offer any of the services that fiber brings.

I used to live right next to Target on Broadway and the fastest DSL speed was... 1.5 down.  I received emails for about 2 years telling me fiber was coming, and they were going to start offering high speed internet, along with door knockers and mail inserts.  It never happened.  Even on AT&T's fiber map right now, there is nothing indicating that Tyler has fiber services of any kind.

Now, I think it would be great to have more competition in the market for internet in Tyler.  I hope AT&T gets fast, reliable services to homes and it will cause much better, cheaper, competitive prices for consumers.

My point was that these kinds of things were said in the past and then it was completely forgotten, so I wouldn't be very optimistic about the chances of this becoming a reality until it is actually available and we see AT&T making an actual effort.  All it takes is one unfortunate position change at the executive level and all of this can be shot down once again.",t2_h1vfy,jpaek1,0,1647021187.0,0,t1_i09mlcl,i09mlcl,False,ccagan,t3_tb8d4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/tylertx/comments/tb8d4n/att_announces_tyler_and_longview_fttx_expansion/,AT&T Announces Tyler and Longview FTTx Expansion,/r/tylertx/comments/tb8d4n/att_announces_tyler_and_longview_fttx_expansion/i09mlcl/,1,r/tylertx,0,1
"They haven't had a true plan for FTTH rollout for consumer products in Tyler. They had a minor upgrade years ago to provide certain areas with their Uverse based internet, which gave speeds up to 18Mbps. Tyler has never been a focus market for Consumer based internet since the DSL days. AT&T struggled under Randall Stephenson. The current management is 100 focused on fiber and Cellular. That is a fact. The proof is in the quick upgrades to its Fiber product to provide 2 - and 5Gbps options and proving large Fiber buildouts. Look at their long-term plan of 30 Million+ Homes passed by fiber. 

Fiber being mostly ran across most of Tyler is already a thing. ATT did a lot of work running fiber to enhance its wireless capabilities, and it will allow them to provide more businesses with a more superior connection. The Fiber plans are going no where. Saying ATT has done nothing with Fiber is a skewed point of view due to them never truly publicly saying they will provide.

"You priced it with the wrong person, I can do that at $450 all day long!

All joking aside it’s going to almost feel like a technologically modern city with the eventual choice of LEC/Cable/Overbuilder options.

I just got back from a big telecom industry conference in Puerto Vallarta and we had this group excursion snorkeling. On our way back from the boat there was a sign on a pay phone advertising 100Mbps fiber for just under $22 USD

And there we were, 100 or so of us who do nothing but sell enterprise data products and we’re scratching our heads. 

This group doesn’t do residential products except in large MDU settings, but we’re just in awe that a service like 100Mbps GPON @ $22 is so easily attainable in so many parts of the world, and look at what we’re all stuck with at home!

A few guys commented on how long it took Verizon/Frontier FIOS to push speeds to 1G, and how Frontier and Zipply and even the rural electric co-ops are pushing XGS-PON to multi-gig speeds at reasonable prices. Now ATT pushing multi-gig just adds to that fervor.

"I'm not sure which part you are saying is incorrect?  That they did nothing with the fiber in Tyler?  I guess that depends on what you call nothing.  Running it down one corridor in town and then only providing limited availability isn't really doing anything in my book, but maybe we have different definitions.

They've definitely given up on running fiber to homes in the previous years.  They got geared up for it, started, then had massive upper management changes and they shifted nearly 100% from fiber to focus on wireless.  Ground services became the red-headed stepchild because wireless is far more profitable.

We deal with people that do permitting and engineering in the industry and everyone saw the workload for fiber completely drop in nearly all markets for AT&T until somewhat recently.

I went there expecting I'd be able to use google pay, because the website said they accepted it, turns out the Tyler one is stuck in ""the stone age""(as one of the cashiers put it) and the food was just premade chicken tenders that weren't even good. Comfortable seats though, but everything else sucked.

>Hollywood

...Do people actually *go* there? Every time I've gone near there the parking lot is empty, save for employee vehicles. How the hell are they even still open? 

> Times Square

It's essentially the same theater it was when it was just Times Square Cinema, they spent their entire renovation budget on adding the lower half, the seats suck, the foods decent, but the movie experience sucks. The theater is such an afterthought, it hasn't been updated since it opened, save for the one next to the party room, which is tiny. They didn't even bother adding trays to the seats, since they suddenly served food.

"""the culture is white and conservative which the reddit leftists hate,"" is the most appropriate description of Tyler culture I've ever read.

You got it wrong though, we don't hate the good old boy culture, we hate the fact that you dismiss our opinions as ""leftist"" without listening to them. 

I hunt, fish, know how to fix an engine, and love this country. Id also rather have a gay dude, a black woman, and a gender-fluid furry giving input on something than three good old boys. Like, I got the good old boy angle covered, yall gotta show me what I'm missing.

"Its not necessarily hiking, but look into the legacy trail system that runs through tyler. It starts at a few different spots, but the whole things runs from gresham all the way up to the loop. There is even a small section that crosses under grande/broadway ( its a little sketchy though ). The whole thing is like 7 and a half miles long one way.

&#x200B;

Here's a map that shows the legacy trail system.

If you follow grande to the east it will actually cross under broadway, then you can walk the rose rudman trail all the way to the loop. Map here:

"It seems that the powers that be have decided to read the writing on the wall and have announced FTTx builds in the following markets which already have existing FTTx or in-progress FTTx overbuild providers.  


Abilene (Vexus, now Metronet)  
Amarillo (Vexus, now Metronet)  
Bryan-College Station (Metronet)  
Lubbock (Vexus, now Metronet)  
San Angelo (Frontier)  
Tyler (Vexus, now Metronet)  


This is exciting news. At this time it's really only feasible to ever see 3 terrestrial providers in any market. The incumbent local exchange carrier (phone company), incumbent cable provider, and one overbuilder. As I've said on here several times, multiple non-LEC, non-cable overbuilders do not complete head to head in a single market. When they posture such, it just results in an acquisition. It's a ton of overhead for the municipality dealing with the ROW and construction permitting and there's only so much market share to go around.  


Keep an eye on [www.mybluepeak.com](https://www.mybluepeak.com) they may make a play into smaller pop Texas cities as they have in Oklahoma, having announced Pawhuska just this last week with a population of only 3,500.  


For those of you outside of the city limits in Smith and Cherokee counties, CCEC has gone live with their prospective service zones for their FTTx overbuild!  


[https://connect.cceca.net/front\_end/zones](https://connect.cceca.net/front_end/zones)

If you're interested they are collecting prospective sign-ups.  


Jacksonville and Whitehouse may see some FTTx love from Frontier, but there's been no announcements and no chatter from the folks I deal with nationally with Frontier.  


Bullard does have Fiber+ available from Lumen (formerly CenturyLink). This is a business grade product and it's REALLY spotty to get for list price as Lumen is quick to add construction costs to the contract.

If you're not registered to vote, then you cannot vote in this primary.

Smith County is a heavily Republican county, which means that this primary election is the de facto election. Unless you're voting for a democratic candidate who is running unopposed, you are just throwing your vote away if you vote in the Democrat primary (practically speaking, and I mean no offense to any registered democrats here). So I would urge you to consider voting in the Republican primary and choose the best candidate that you feel. Then you can vote however you would like in the general election.

"First off this subreddit is overrun by leftists. Particularly young ones which give a particularly negative view of a small conservative city thats actually greay place to live. I relocated with my wife and son to tyler from South FL last year. The biggest pros for me are cost of living, still a city but not really if you're use to something like Seattle. People in general are nice, folks are pretty religious here. Tyler is quite conservative. Coming from WA It's going to be a very different culture. And you might dislike it. My only gripe is the food is pretty meh but that's about it. Everything else im happy to travel and live in a quiet area. Tyler's economy is also quite healthy. Absolutely happy we left the hellscape of South FL and love living out here. Most of the things people are complaining tyler lacking is why we live here.

"Tyler is, no surprise, in Texas. That means Texas-style politics. I just moved here in August from Virginia, but I've lived in Texas \*most\* of my life, so it wasn't a big culture shock.  But here are some key differences outside of politics.

* So, most places have a 'regional' food. In Virginia, it was kebabs/Indian. Every street corner seemed to have some kind of kebab shop. Here, that's going to be Mexican food.
* Tyler is 'small town'. I'm in the southern part of the city, and downtown is only 4 miles away.  That said, Broadway Ave can feel like rush hour in any big town you've been in (except maybe Houston, where I've sat for a half-hour to get through one light before).
* Speaking of Broadway Ave. It's the main road running N/S through town. It's hard to avoid to get anywhere. And almost everything you want to do of import is off Broadway.
* Even though Tyler is 'small town', there are a lot of choices for food and shopping here, which is quite nice. There's a lot of good non-Mexican restaurants, including a couple of good sushi joints. And Door Dash runs pretty smoothly most times.
* Rents are cheaper here than some places, but because of the housing crunch, they weren't as cheap as I'd hoped. Housing is up here, much like everywhere, but you can still get 3 bedroom houses in the 300K range.
* Be prepared to drive 2-3 hours to get to anywhere substantial in the DFW Metroplex. Thats the biggest downside for me. I have a lot of things I like to do over in DFW, and it's a huge slog to get there.
* Probably best to contact NTTA and get a toll pass. Getting out of Tyler (and around DFW) is a PITA without one.
* I haven't spent a lot of time up in the northern part of Tyler (where the crime maps say most crime is concentrated), but where I'm at feels pretty safe. And downtown in the evening felt worlds safer than downtown DFW or Houston.
* Lotta bubbas have their masculinity wrapped up in their cars. Lotta revving, fast driving off the lights, and that kind of thing. Moreso than up north. I drive a fast-looking car (because the one I bought happened to have the 'sport kit' trim) so maybe I experience that some more than others might.
* A lot more people seem to think my life wasn't complete without hearing whatever their choice of music that day happened to be whenever I'm driving around town.
* Mask wearing is hit-or-miss (if you care about that sort of thing). Sometimes, I can go into a store and everyone is masked. Other times, no one is. Nobody's given me shit about wearing mine when I wear it.
* Speaking of masks, if you join NextDoor to meet people, expect to see near-weekly political bullshit concerning masks, the vaccine, etc.

"Overall, nice area to be in if you don't want to be in a major city.  Tyler is ""big"" for this area but nothing like Dallas or its suburbs really.  Gig internet is nice (where available).  Plenty of outdoorsy stuff to do.  People are overall friendly in my experience, though I mostly keep to myself these days in the age of the Rona.  About 1.5 hours to Shreveport/Bossier City for gambling in Louisiana.  Job market is pretty decent, minus technology.  All the major stores are in Tyler for the most part - Best Buy, Target, Walmart, Academy, etc.

Cons?  Dallas is the closest major city/airport at 1.5ish hours away.  As is pro sports, big name artists/concerts, typical big city type stuff to do.  Traffic during peak hours in Tyler (and on certain streets) is a nightmare and rage-inducing.  Restaurant options are better than they used to be, however even something as simple as Chinese takeout leaves you with little to no options depending on what part of town you are in.

Neutral:  Know that Tyler is very religious, very conservative, and overall on the older side of age categories.

If you are looking for city life in a metropolis, this ain't it.  If you want quieter living in a semi-big town with lots (but not all) of modern conveniences, then this would be more your jam.",t2_h1vfy,jpaek1,0,1644433937.0,0,t1_hw9glls,hw9glls,True,BiscuitHead25,t3_sokdxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/tylertx/comments/sokdxb/moving_to_tx/,Moving to TX,/r/tylertx/comments/sokdxb/moving_to_tx/hw9glls/,18,r/tylertx,0,18

- fill the damn bathtub. You can use all that water to flush the toilet. But make sure your bathtub stopper actually holds the water in... there's some real crappy stoppers out there.

- Charge allll your devices tonight, and if possible buy a $30 power bank.  The one I have can charge an iPad or Galaxy Tab A 2 or 3 times over, and a cell phone 5 times.  They're amazing.

- And if you do go to the supermarket... *canned meals* like hearty soups, tuna, and spam is what you want, stuff you can open up anytime and fills you up.

"Kinda depends on what you want:

Mexican food: Definitely Javis if you want to spend some money (get the fajitas and “the dilemma” if you want a drink) 

American food: I used to work at Aspen Creek and I know that the kitchen is properly cleaned every night and they have great food IMO. POW wow shrimp for an appetizer, burger or chicken fried steak for entree, and either fried cheesecake or bread pudding for dessert. 

Chinese Buffet: Yammi. A lot better than the other options I’ve had. 

Seafood: Shell Shack. Very expensive, but worth the splurge once a year. Get the VIP to try everything and with kitchen sink flavor. Calamari for an appetizer if you want. 

Breakfast: The Diner. Not anything special but it’s a local.

"You are being way too generalized in your statements and still don't have a concise point you are trying to raise.  Honestly, it feels like you are trying to troll at this point.

Firstly, the vast majority of books being banned from school libraries are NOT part of the curriculum.  They are not being taught any more than any other book sitting in a library for checkout.

Secondly, being secular has nothing to do with the comparison I was making because said books are vastly not part of the curriculum and that was not what I was comparing.  The comparison was things - as you state yourself - being ""sexualized or fictional violent content"" to kids.  The bible has both of these things in it and is available for checkout in libraries despite not being part of the curriculum.

The issue isn't what is being taught.  The issue is people thinking they can control what kids read by banning anything they personally find offensive, and that this is a good practice.  I'm not saying kids should be reading rated R or graphic material at age 8, however I also find it completely hypocritical that these same people will let their kids watch violent, graphic content on Netflix every night.

My 8 yr old nephew - who isn't even allowed to watch PG13 movies at home - was talking about Squid Games because nearly ALL of his classmates saw it.  And this is in a really nice school district in a really nice school in Sugar Land.

Public education in large is secular... I dont think your comparison is valid at all. The stance you folks are up in arms about is the state simply saying it's not the school districts job to introduce this type of material and puts it on the family where in my opinion should be.

"I've read excerpts as a currently-enrolled university student, but no I have never read the entirety of the book. I suppose I would ask which books deemed required reading you would object to? 

In Maus' case, I think the argument against it being used as an educational tool is pretty thin, children ought to learn of the Holocaust at some point and the graphic novel does a great job of illustrating a Jewish perspective regardless of its use of profanity.

Yet she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses. Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed your young breasts.” (Ezekiel 23:18-21)*

I wrote this piece myself, and it is NOT an explicitly unbiased piece of journalism. I was asked to share my notes on the Public Libary Board meeting which occurred yesterday by some other users, and so I chose to provide some additional context and my own, personal thoughts at the end. One is more than free to disagree, and I respect that there will inevitably be some degree of disagreement on any given topic.

I chose to write it out in this format in part because, as far as I am aware, the Tyler Loop and Telegraph haven't published anything specific on this yet. I wish there was an article, and if there is one please feel free to link it. I think it's important to maintain a separation of some kind between news piece and opinion, and mine is definitely an opinion.",t2_2ffw4nup,YazzleMcRazzleDazzle,0,1643344252.0,0,t1_hujhphz,hujhphz,True,YazzleMcRazzleDazzle,t3_sei4qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/tylertx/comments/sei4qy/the_push_for_book_bans_comes_to_tyler/,"""The Push for Book Bans Comes to Tyler""",/r/tylertx/comments/sei4qy/the_push_for_book_bans_comes_to_tyler/hujhphz/,18,r/tylertx,0,18

"my brief report:  Meeting was mostly fine.  I was in the back room in a corner chair so could only hear (not see).  I was expecting a lot of calls of ""ban books!"" but commenters were mixed and most that were opposed were opposed to 1-2 books specifically at the moment and calling out for these to be removed from children's sections, not removed entirely.

Personally, I was put off by a majority of those commenting because each ended up giving credentials (mostly academic) before speaking, trying to make themselves sound like they were some kind of expert on the topic at hand.  Granted, some had worked in the library or education before, however in the grand scheme it doesn't matter if you have a PHD or work at the auto repair shop.  It is more about the reasons behind wanting books banned or removed imo.

There's some common grounds to work with at least.  No actual resolution was brought up in the meeting, but I don't think that was the goal either.  People said their piece after Professor Crawford of UNT gave her presentation (I hope I am remembering her name correctly!) and I assume the proper persons in charge at the library will discussion any possible solutions and/or actions.",t2_h1vfy,jpaek1,0,1643301870.0,0,t1_hugi6rn,hugi6rn,False,_DOA_,t3_sdgtuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tylertx/comments/sdgtuu/reminder_tyler_library_board_meeting_is_today_at/,"Reminder: Tyler Library Board meeting is today at 4:30 pM, at 212 S.
