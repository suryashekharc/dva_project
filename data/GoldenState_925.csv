"> this is think is a fair demand - but that is just my opinion.

I'd agree with you except that all the other parts of the supply chain have 24 hour operation, warehouses, truckers, etc.

Also, the longshoremen have resisted automation that would allow them to keep their hours but increase productivity. They are choking the flow of goods. Not the only strain on the system right now, but the only one that could be solved by someone just agreeing to allow another shift of workers.

"The overnight thing is not a safety issue, it's a union doesn't want to have it's members working overnight because it's a quality of life issue for them.

There is definitely a forced scarcity by the union in this case, as there's no shortage of people who want those jobs. A third shift would also likely mean the end of overtime, as it's not necessary to keep first shift longer anymore, so it's a power/money move by the longshoremen. 

Other things that I touched on are also factors, but it's hard to know how much.

AB5 limits who can drive in California, and while it's not clear if it's going to stick in terms of applying to owner-operators, transportation companies may already be dropping them as contractors, and they (owner-operators) may be avoiding California contracts, but you'd need studies to see what the numbers look like.

Additional, the state and ports have strict rules on truck emissions, so there's trucks that are physically capable of hauling goods that can't operate at the ports or in the state (either or depending on model years, etc) because they don't meet the most recent air quality standards.

People will say this doesn't affect the situation because the trucks working the ports are mostly in compliance,  but nobody knows how many trucks not currently serving the ports but that could/would if not for that barrier.

"Which is weird on the overnight work unless there is a very real safety concern?  Because you would think that more union members would be a good thing for a union.

"ok please stay with me on while I ramble through my comments because I am very interested in this topic of labor shortages and just everything since the pandemic and it's affects. And I would like to hear your thoughts and if you can expand on the port aspects more for me. Because every industry is going through some big issues and this is one that no one thinks about until they cant get their new X they ordered in September until April of the next year. And I think the pandemic has made it worse but I think it was going to happen anyways.

So I read that 2.4 million women dropped out of the labor force basically (child care difficulties/virtual schooling and with them generally being the lower wage earners it was the obvious choice in some households - lowest wage stays home.

[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/14/u-s-labor-market-inches-back-from-the-covid-19-shock-but-recovery-is-far-from-complete/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/14/u-s-labor-market-inches-back-from-the-covid-19-shock-but-recovery-is-far-from-complete/)

Then I read that 28.6 million people aged 56 to 74 retired last year

[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/09/the-pace-of-boomer-retirements-has-accelerated-in-the-past-year/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/09/the-pace-of-boomer-retirements-has-accelerated-in-the-past-year/)

So right there that is 30 million people who were working who left their positions - basically open for another person to take if the position was kept as a job to fill.

Then you add in deaths for working people - no idea what those numbers are; people who are not entering work force right now (teens - lots of people aren't letting their teens work because of conditions in work places with adults acting badly to service workers right now - more so than they normally do - or if it isn't that way at least the perception is there that they are so it is a deterrent either way and lower migration due to tighter controls i.e. lockdowns , restricted travel and so forth and I don't see how anyone could be surprised there is a shortage of labor in all fields. I mean the baby boomer retirements are starting now and wow - 28.6 million is a lot. In just the USA. What it is like in other countries I do not know, but I am going to look and see what I can find out.

I have no idea what the numbers will be for the next wave of boomers retiring but there are 162 million Americans in the combined Gen X, baby boomer, and older cohorts and 71.6 of that 162 million are baby boomers. The rest of the US population are millennials or younger (40 and under).  In 15 years the Gen X's can start retiring - haha - we don't have any money, so maybe the numbers wont quite 50/50 working v retired.  But it will be close.

This doesn't seem that sustainable.  I don't think changing the port hours to 24/7 is going solve much- it will help but ...idk.  I am thinking Automation, A.I and Robots are looking more and more like they need to happen sooner.

It seems like the pandemic is hiding the real issues and it is really just the reality of our demographics coming to fruition and we should have seen this coming.

I have no doubt that the issues you are describing are only make a bad situation worse.

We are having huge permanent and increasing reductions in the labor force along with our society being poorly managed and here we are, total crap show about 50 to 60 years in the making it seems.

"If they're concerned about tidal push of saltwater going upstream this is very easily mitigated with additional infrastructure close to the watershed restricting that movement, including additional storage pools to allow a build up of water. There's very simple solutions to this problem where we would stop pouring so much water into the ocean. This article said that the problem would be salt water, and instead of considering that some more specific infrastructure would prohibit saltwater buildup it pivoted to talking about fish. They did this despite them posting a picture right after of some of the already built infrastructure that helps mitigate this.

So my takeaway from this article is that they believe that we should continue down the same path as we are even though we are losing water. That there's no responsibility to be had with the management of water and infrastructure here, and instead we should try to encourage decreasing water use which is pretty ineffective, and especially moot because there's plenty of water that could have been built up in prior years.",t2_kupm0yd,yudun,0,1631988949.0,0,t1_hdcyn5a,hdcyn5a,True,saltybruise,t3_pqaiqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Golden_State/comments/pqaiqj/who_is_to_blame_for_californias_drought_uc_davis/,Who is to Blame for California's Drought? | UC Davis Magazine,/r/Golden_State/comments/pqaiqj/who_is_to_blame_for_californias_drought_uc_davis/hdcyn5a/,1,r/Golden_State,0,1

1. Raise the signature limit by a lot.  I'd say 10% of the current population.  Hell, it requires less than 1 mil signatures to get a constitutional initiative on the ballot! 

2. All ballot initiatives need to get 2/3rd of the vote to be implemented.  The ballot system should not be a shadow legislature.

Ballot initiatives should be mostly a tool using questions such as ""should we legalize marijuana use?"".  Yes, the 2/3rd is a huge bar to cross.

"If you would like to educate yourself on this subject I recommend [Fire on the Mountain: Rethinking Forest Management in the Sierra Nevada](https://lhc.ca.gov/sites/lhc.ca.gov/files/Reports/242/Report242.pdf). I read this in 2020, the takeaways I remember are:

* California has gotten rid of so many saw mills, that even if we started mechanical thinning of the forests en masse we couldn't process the resources in-state.
* Local Air Quality organizations (CARB + local authorities) will shut down pre-planned prescribed burns to opt for air quality over forest management. It can be very hard to plan controlled burns and then execute them for this reason.
* The issue is (clearly) one which affects the entire state, but funds are not being allocated appropriately to address this as a state-wide issue. The cost lands on the shoulders of jurisdictions which can't afford to take on the full cost without state-support, not to mention the land which is owned by the federal government and which the state needs more support to manage.
* It is remarkably more expensive for firefighters to respond to an uncontrolled burn than a controlled burn (something like 1.5x).
* The recommended action going forward is for the state to begin educating it's citizens about the issue and the path forward in a way similar to drought awareness campaigns so that we can get collective buy in to spend the money to manage the forests so we're dealing with fewer uncontrolled burns.

"Most of us have all the empathy in the world for those who we call the homeless – those who lost their homes to foreclosure, disasters, layoffs, or runaway medical expenses. Many have jobs, but can’t muster thousands of dollars of cash for a security deposit. They are people who want to get back on their feet, but can’t because of runaway housing prices. The guy who showers in his gym and sleeps his car while working a 9-5. We want to bend over backwards and do all we can to help these people get out of their cars and tents and back into a home.

We however are fed up with vagrants, which are a completely different problem than the homeless. Vagrants actively seek to live outside the rules and confines of society to use drugs and alcohol. Many have mental illnesses that they are self-medicating – a treatment they choose over going into the system and using resources to stabilize and reintegrate. We are fed up with those who CHOOSE homelessness, even when offered services to help them get back on their feet. When the city or county clears our camps, they bring social workers to help enroll vagrants in services designed to get them in their feet. A great majority refuse, and move on to their next location. It is vagrants that we are done with and that we have no solution for, not the homeless.

"So there is some history to unpack here.

The south west of the San Joaquin Valley, which you drove through, has amazingly fertile soil, but almost no rainfall. All the water must be moved there from somewhere else. All the rivers in the southern sierra mountains converge into the San Joaquin River and run out in to the Pacific in San Francisco Bay.  All of them are dammed up, and water is let out on a schedule to generate power, and to irrigate fields and provide drinking water. In the past every drop of water was held up and used, but this caused environmental problems. If the rivers are dry, fish cant swim up and spawn leading to drops in biodiversity. Also the SJ and Sacramento River delta is basically at sea level, without some positive pressure from flowing water, salt water from the ocean will backfill up the river and kill native fish and plants.

Sane people and environmental activists have argued to restore the flow of these rivers in order to mitigate the environmental destruction caused by the water projects. Now some water is allowed to run out to sea and wildlife is returning. Farmers got less water out of this deal and are whining about ""wasting"" water by letting it run out to sea and not put to use. As if the only use for water is irrigating their crops.

"It looks like they're aiming to present a false dichotomy that California's approach to child welfare simultaneously punishes poor working class adults while also depriving children of their deserved support. They show their hand pretty early in the article:

""Half of Stacy Estes’ pay disappears every month before it hits his bank account. Each check is about $500 lighter than it should be, intercepted in the name of child support — which he wouldn’t have a problem with, if it were going to his kids.

Instead, only $225 goes to his children. The rest is garnished to repay government debt he began accruing more than two decades ago when he first got behind on child support payments.""

&#x200B;

Its right there in the phrasing. This dude has been a deadbeat dad for over two decades, during which time his kids were being taken care of through said welfare programs. In other words, we were all taxed to pay for this dude's kids. Which I'm fine with, children should be taken care of regardless of how shitty their parents are.

But that second paragraph revels the bias in how they frame the issue. Its ""government debt"" sure, but that's OUR money that was used for HIS kids for 20 freaking years. The whole thing is framed as California screwing this guy to get as much tax revenue as possible, and multiple times in the article they frame welfare policy as if its some other entity that caused a debt. That's not the case at all, this dude bailed on his kids for 20 years and we had to pay for it through welfare. The ""government debt"" was directly caused by his failure to provide for his children, not some nebulous welfare policy.

I'm all for limited government. But I'm ok paying taxes to take care of the next generation if their parents fail to do so. But when the state finally catches the deadbeat dad that skirked his responsibility for 20 years? They aren't taking money from his kids, the first one has been an adult for 2 years at this point. Yeah, go get our damn money back.

"Yes, because if they are not then it's just a normal 17 year old who ""sat down and then jumped up as if to run away."" after, as far as the cop knows, stabbing somebody. (NOTE: He didn't get up as if to run away, he got up and did run away, it's on video, not sure how the AP missed that.)

You grab that person, and you try to restrain them. If they start sticking their hand in your face, or grabbing at your shirt or whatever the guy is doing, you might get punched once as occurred here.

Alternatively, the cop could let the guy run away, and somebody who just stabbed somebody would get away if there had been a stabbing, or he can let the guy put his hands in his face, take his pen as a weapon, disable his body cam, or stab the cop if he let him just keep waiving his hand around.

I also in the comment prior tried to clarify my point to you, but you still seem to think I'm trying to defend the article when what I was trying to do was show you that the way you approached the numbers to start wasn't a good argument because it was apples to oranges while the percentages were apples to apples.

[https://www.pushkin.fm/episode/a-good-walk-spoiled/](https://www.pushkin.fm/episode/a-good-walk-spoiled/)

It's more convincing than I thought it would be. Basically the premise is that the economic value of that much open space is SO much higher than what it generates as a golf course that society is getting screwed by the small number of people who actually play. (# of golfers has been falling steadily since a peak in 2006, although there was a small blip due to COVID, as with all outdoor activities). Meanwhile, private courses were largely built 50-100 years ago, so esp. in CA, with Prop 13, they pay near zero property tax.

Even so, I wouldn't be in favor of eliminating public courses.

"Using so much water to keep a large green green all year round in Southern California isn't really super appropriate. Obviously a lot of what we do with our water in southern California isn't super appropriate either. I hadn't heard about changes in course design to incorporate local flora and increase biodiversity, do you have any idea on the numbers of species being habitated by such projects? My initial assumption is that it provides home for significantly less species than the acreage and water use would suggest. 

I'm glad golf was able to provide a beneficial sport experience for you when growing up. I also have asthma, it wasn't so bad, but I had a few close calls at night games for baseball and rugby where if I didn't have my inhaler I would have been in a real pickle. So obviously it's a good thing to have accessible sports, but at the same time I think something like disc golf is a lot more appropriate in Southern California.

"> I have one large pizza and you have two large pizzas. You've eaten 22% of your pizza and I've eaten 21% of my pizza. Therefore, by your math, the we have eaten the same amount of pizza and at the same rate.

This ignores that your team has one person and my team has two people, which is the analogy to Texas and California having different populations.

> To get a truly accurate comparison of the two states we actually need data that wasn't in the article (or at least not in the section quoted). We would need to know, as a minimum, how much vaccine each state has had its disposal (and when), the real 'start' date for each state, and how much staff each state has allocated.

Sweet, now you're beginning to understand why your absolute totals number is worthless... and you know why you need to know all those things you listed? So you can figure out the rate of vaccination, which will be a percentage, something like say, since Vaccines beame available in December, California has Vaccinated 22% of it's Latino population, and Texas 21%...

> I believe the vaccination topic is far closer to the eating pizza metaphor than the high school metaphor. There is a defined number of people who need to be vaccinated just as there is a defined number of pizzas to be eaten.

Okay, but again, it's not one person per side in the pizza eating, because of all those variables you just listed.

> I'm saying the way the article presented it was just plain wrong and misleading.

It's not though, they are using the same method that the government uses to measure success rates of things (such as graduation rates) when the populations being measured differ.

Let's look at it another way...

0.144% of the black population of America is in federal person right now, compared to only 0.037% of the white population of America.

This suggests that we might need to explore why blacks are more than four times as likely to be in prison, such as racism, yes?

But if I use absolute numbers, like you're trying to do, then there's really only 58,490 black people in federal prison, but a whopping 87,386 white people so that's 28,896 MORE white people in prison than black people, so clearly we should explore why that is, right?

Only it's obvious why there's more white people than black people in prison, because the US white population is 234,370,202 while the black population is only 40,610,815... which is why we need to use percentages (ie: rates) to really compare whether or not these populations are being treated fairly.

California has 160% the Latino population of Texas, and so must be expected to have 160% the number of vaccinations if everybody is moving at the same rate. Which they appear to be, despite our claims of being better at it.

What you could try to argue, if you really want to try to spin this as an attack, is point out not that we have more Latinos, because the article accounts for that by using percentages, but point out that based on the numbers you listed previously, our Latino population is only 40% of the state, while in Texas it's 58%, meaning they'd really have to be at 30% Latino population vaccinated to be going at the same rate we are.",t2_xnpzd,GuruNemesis,0,1619128912.0,0,t1_gvhwjcs,gvhwjcs,False,[deleted],t3_mwbla1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Golden_State/comments/mwbla1/garbage_comparison_of_ca_and_tx_is_garbage/,Garbage comparison of CA and TX is garbage...,/r/Golden_State/comments/mwbla1/garbage_comparison_of_ca_and_tx_is_garbage/gvhwjcs/,-1,r/Golden_State,0,-1

You call it a hit piece, but then do a bunch of math to conclude that we're not tied because we have more people and have thus vaccinated more people, but that's not how comparisons are meant to work.

California has ~150k Homeless people, and Texas has ~25k while Alaska has ~2k so man, that's a big difference, California must be WAY worse than both of those states yeah?

Well that's 0.375% of the population of California, 0.1% of the population of Texas, but 0.273% of the population of Alaska, which means Texas is doing a better job than Alaska, who is honestly not too far off from California (and nobody is shipping their homeless to Alaska).

Another campus was a square, but smaller, and the athletic fields and facilities were all in one area, making the academic facilities a smaller and contiguous footprint.

"They way campus police explained it to me was this:

Right of way is about a tie breaker. Think of a four way stop, first car that arrives goes first, but if there is a tie the car to your right has the right of way.

So the same applies to pedestrian crossings. If the pedestrian is in the crosswalk, they are in the roadway before you and have right of way. If you pull up to the stop sign and they get to the curb at the same time, they go.

What people translate that to, however, is car stops at the stop sign, an a constant line of pedestrians a hundred yards long (ie: no where near the crosswalk/curb when the car arrives) just get to keep walking. This is not legally the case.

After being stuck for a double digit number of minutes at a particular crosswalk, I asked the campus police why it didn't have a signal, etc, which is where they filled me in on this.

If you are walking and you get to a curb/crosswalk and a car is already there stopped, even if there are already people in the crosswalk, the car was there first and has right of way over you, who arrived later.

I asked why it wasn't enforced then, and they said the school didn't want them ticketing pedestrians, they suggested I just keep inching forward until people make way.

I decided to stop gambling with my time and just took another route that was consistently longer in time and mileage but never surprised me with a 12 minute wait.",t2_h4zsm,AlanPogue,0,1618618983.0,0,t1_gusczd8,gusczd8,False,[deleted],t3_msa9yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Golden_State/comments/msa9yh/new_california_bill_to_decriminalize_jaywalking/,New California Bill to Decriminalize Jaywalking,/r/Golden_State/comments/msa9yh/new_california_bill_to_decriminalize_jaywalking/gusczd8/,5,r/Golden_State,0,5

"Well what I was thinking about is that the building code uses formulas for a lot of stuff around sizing stairs, means of egress, etc, and the inputs change pretty significantly with intended usage.

In this case, though, you are totally right. ""Means of egress"" are sized based on max occupancy, which is given as ""minimum square feet per person"" (so, smaller number is more dense). General offices are 150 sqft/person, ""general residential"" is 200sqft/person. So the formulas that set #of staircases per floor, etc would be more restrictive for the office building than a residential one.

"The Salesforce tower isn't going to be converted to housing anytime soon. 

It's one of the newest high rise commercial towers and the name is misleading. The top half of the building is law and finance, both very conservative industries that are planning to go 100% back to the office as soon as possible.

Aside from that, office buildings are very good at being offices. They're terrible at being residences. The plumbing, electrical and HVAC we all need to be completely redone. Without light wells there's an undesirable lack of natural light in the the center of the building so the layouts will be awkward. The existing curtain walls turn the building into a green house so it will likely need to be replaced. 

On top of that, throughout the pandemic office rents are still higher than residential by square footage. The commercial and residential real estate markets are fairly segregated. Boston Properties, the owner of tower, deals exclusively in Class A commercial real estate. I highly doubt they're very eager to spend billions of dollars to convert their buildings to apartments and make less money.

"I'd guess that a lot of this. Anecdotal, but I'm in Riverside County and people who have the vaccine, in the process of getting it, want it but aren't in the tiers yet, are afraid to get it due to allergic reactions, and refuse to get it based on whatever reasons is pretty even across the board.

I do think the county is falling down on getting the information out there.

Beginning March 15, vaccination will be made available to those with certain health conditions, disabilities, illness, living spaces, or work environments that put them at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness.

Individuals with these conditions are strongly encouraged to seek vaccination with a primary health care provider or system, or in an alternate clinical setting. Check first with your usual health care provider.

**Health conditions**

At that time, healthcare providers may use their clinical judgement to vaccinate individuals aged 16-64 who are deemed to be at the very highest risk to get very sick from COVID-19 because they have the following severe health conditions

* Cancer, current with weakened immune system
* Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 or above
* Chronic pulmonary disease, oxygen dependent
* Down syndrome
* Solid organ transplant, leading to a weakened immune system
* Pregnancy
* Sickle cell disease
* Heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies (but not hypertension)

Not trying to attack Basic Income, but this has been the effect of the dividend.

“A 2019 study found ""a 14% increase in substance-abuse incidents the day after the [Alaska Permanent Fund] payment and a 10% increase over the following four weeks. This is partially offset by a 8% decrease in property crime, with no changes in violent crimes. On an annual basis, however, changes in criminal activity from the payment are small.

"Hilarious.  You still really can't give one example of someone being helped by it, or how it's positive, let alone how it's the government's role to force this change.  You really apparently can't.

>  how does it hurt you if the toys are no longer segregated?

OK: it is an illegal imposition on the first amendment setting a precedent for government to intervene in affairs in which it has no business.  When there is a need for such imposition in order to redress discrimination, the law allows leeway.  This entails no reduction of discrimination on a legal level (there was none to start with in labeling toys by gender), and will lessen many people's opinions of the trans-rights movement.

If this were a private initative by the trans community to pressure toy stores, that would be an entirely different issue.  If they can convince the toy stores that this is the right thing to do, either morally or on a business level, that's fine.  That's how our society works.  The government being involved not only sets a dangerous precedent, it will poison the issue for people who might otherwise be accepting of it, and give ammunition to those already opposed to it.

It hurts the entire nation to pick fights when there is not gain in any meaningful sense.  It undermines the Constitution.  That's how it damages me.

I am not threatened.  This is a horrible idea and it is also illegal.  IT serves literally no positive purpose and *will* piss off people inclined to be against trans-rights.  More important;y it will tend to give people in the middle on the issue a view of trans activists as radical.

This is so fundamentally outside of modern human activity (that we separate certain activites by gender).  Acting like this is some crazy form of enforced segragation is ridiculous.

With what we know about covid (for a while) now, it seems inconsistent to allow indoor retail shopping and not allow indoor church services with similar restrictions.

Implement capacity restrictions, have masking and distancing requirements, restrict the ability to serve snacks and coffee, have temperatures/symptoms checked at the door, encourage and enable churches to support their congregation in getting regularly tested and then vaccinated when available, etc.

That's unlikely, given the many current labeling requirements, both state and federal. 

But that does suggest a different law for the California legislators, who seem to have a lot of spare time on their hands: require stores to separate ""carcinogenic"" items from ""non-carcinogenic"".  Based on the results of Prop 65, I'm guessing the ""non-carcinogenic"" side might be rather sparse.

"Not quite. The recall ballot will be comprised of two questions. The first question is a yes or no as to whether or not Newsom should be recalled. A majority is necessary here for it to pass and for the second question to matter. On the second question, it is about who should be the replacement, with a plurality winning this question. The person being recalled cannot be on the second question, if I remember correctly, so naturally we need an alternative. But I don’t think I would put up too many candidates, otherwise you could certainly split the vote and a Republican could win because of these rules.

I feel like we should entertain the idea of a primary challenge for Newsom, but even as someone who isn’t his biggest fan, trying to get rid of him right now seems like not the best path forward.

The bill was dead on the vine until her friend Jesse Smollet ""suffered an attempted lynching"" and then boom, her law passes and now lynching is super illegal.

"“Mandatory minimums” are a federal thing, not a state thing. They do exist in the state to a very minimal degree, like with second and third DUIs. But these are jail terms, not prison sentences. Nearly every “mandatory” sentence in the state is subject to the judicial discretion of the sentencing judge and subject to a dismissal in the furtherance of justice. 

Further, has anyone stopped to think that crime is at a 50 year all time low because of the sentencing laws that were passed in reaction to the crime spike in the 70s and 80s?

The penal code is reactive. The crime that is being punished is not occurring because of the reactive punishment.

"Good points!

I’m uncomfortable being indoors, at any distance (even if I’m alone I worry about previous occupants) - for even a minute unless I have a respirator.

Yet outdoors, I posit if there were any real risk, we’d see “recreation” infecting more than two per one thousand when tracing non-congregate infections (per LDH data in my parent comment). 

This virus kicks ass at infecting people yet I think we’re VERY lucky it sucks outdoors. 

Now, I’ve approached outdoor eating areas only to leave to find better spaced options (and I’ve rejected being seated at tables that aren’t getting enough airflow). I’m suspicious of short distances between different herds.

As critical as it is not to kill our medical staff with workload and overload our ICUs, I think we have to be very careful issuing death sentences to the restaurant industry. 

My idea would have been to spend almost as much as we spent on Warp Speed and fund a similar respirator (N95) effort. I believe requiring respirators in indoor scenarios, or demanding curbside pickup, would make a huge difference. For example, could Safeway add a surcharge for indoor shopping to encourage and fund curbside pickup? Also, there’s such a glut of KN95s that entrepreneurs overseas are ending up broke after investing in manufacturing equipment before prices dropped to a fraction of their former levels - how in the world is it still uncommon for the average shopper to be wearing much more than a small piece of cloth? You can argue about cloth, but respirators really work!

"*(No opinion is offered below, only factual info - call me out if you believe this is incorrect)*

The *Homo sapien* is a social beast. There are three hundred million of us in the country. Risk aversity exists on a spectrum, and just like with economics, people substitute (e.g. if diseased triggered a die off causing cow milk prices to triple, grocery stores would sell more oat milk - a fact that bears out).

When outdoor dining is permitted, the highly risk averse stay home. When outdoor dining is prohibited, the highly risk averse stay home. 

When outdoor dining is permitted, the highly risk tolerant party indoors. When outdoor dining is prohibited, the highly risk tolerant party indoors.

But those who are only somewhat risk averse? Some of those people will choose outdoor dining if available, but revert to indoor dining with friends at home if it is unavailable. 

This is factual in the aggregate. What I do **not** know is how many people are in these different camps? Is outdoor dining saving more people from falling back to indoor dining at home, or pulling more people from staying home alone?

And it’s unbelievable to me we have so little contact tracing data. Even if only 1% of people answer the phone and are willing to talk, we should still know more about outdoor dining than we do.
