"Just [my two cents](https://imgur.com/a/4iarHDi) from a guy that lived/graduated there 15-20 years ago.  This is how I see ""potential residential crime"" and if I was to move back, the green areas are where I would look. Almost any points South of 555 are ok, Anything N/NE/E of campus around HW49 would be OK. Some pockets of the ""sketchy labeled"" areas are OK, (Center/Right Orange Box) but would generally avoid if I could. If you head toward Brookland, Bono, Valley View, they are good areas to the NE/W/SW of town..... if you don't mind a 20-25 minute drive to campus. Just avoid anything around Johnson AVE until you get West of Caraway (Wolf Creek apartment area).

"It was my first offense. I am out of school. I definitely agree that it's just a place they throw problematic children. I've heard a lot of people say they're worried I'm traumatized, but no really, this isn't about me. I'm not traumatized. The system is broken here, that's all it reads to me. I feel a little guilt for not having spoken about it sooner. I feel uneasy for the way that people are being treated there. And I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this is a textbook example of ""s*** is broke.""

I also agree that it's likely children bringing family or personal problems to school that gets them in success. For me, it was personal problems. I'm not an alcoholic but again, (suspiciously you bring up too many valid points) it's sometimes indicative of a deeper issue. For me that was true. I think if anybody talked to me about *why* I was drinking at school, it could have made sense. I'm fortunate I've got a loving family. If I were like these kids -- growing up in a damn bad neighborhood, or having abusive parents, or having negligent parents for that matter -- I would have probably ended up in long-term success -- the prison for kids -- and been further educated in drug smuggling and fighting.

"What school were you going to? Was it your first offense? Are you out of school now?

Really, schools like Success are places to put ""problem"" children no one else wants to deal with. What gets me is many of these children need comprehensive psychoeducational evaluations (for learning disabilities) and they never end up getting them; mostly because their parents don't know they can ask for that testing and it cannot be refused.

Then there's also home life problems that students bring to school. Generational trauma comes out in behaviors, especially in kids. If the parents wont get help the kids are F-d. 

Success is a way to keep the money in the community (SAA covers many districts if you look it up) instead of these kid being sent to facilities like Millcreek, Methodist, etc. (All of these are behavioral health treatment centers with embedded schools for long term patients.)

So, I'm not surprised. I'm a case manager/advocate now and if you were on my caseload earlier, I would have pushed for you to go to rehab and then get bi-weekly therapy while in school, and 1 family session per week outside of school hours. IMO, drinking is not bad by itself but a sign that something else needs attention. When you eventually have kids, remember there are case managers/advocates out there whose job it is to help you.

IF you so feel inclined you can report what you experienced to the Arkansas Dept of Education and/or get in touch with the attorney general of the state. 

Sorry this happened to you.

"My guess without knowing is that it changed ownership and quality went to shit. There is too
much competition in jonesboro to tolerate that. Hell, even in Batesville we have a great Italian place. 

In the mean, make sure and tell someone who is paid to care that the food was crap, or leave a bad social media review. If they give a crap in the least, they will comp you or make an effort to fix it. If not, you know what you need to know. 

If you are ever in batesville, come to tavalo. We are blessed with some real descent options as far as food goes once you get past the chain stores.

I remember when it used to be fazoli then lazari. Then OG came to town. It is probably better than both now, as fazoli is the McDonald’s version of Italian. Don’t make any excuses for their food.

"Jonesboro can’t support it. It’s either that or tornadoes smash them. If Jonesboro could support such places that were not a bank, a doctors office, or a church, someone would have already opened or rebuilt a new one. Jonesboro just lacks culture. If you are not a bank, a gas station, or a church, then you are some sort of medical office. Props to all the chain restaurants and anonymous clothing stores that add some variety. 

Edit: mad love for the college who provides most of the culture and entertainment. Without them, jonesboro would just be more of a capitalist paradise than it is. How would I fix it if I was them? Tough answer. I would start by looking at all of the surrounding areas and see if they have anything we didn’t.

"I'm a naturalist, so any forested area puts my mind at ease, as long as the area isn't taken over by invasives that is. I found the sectioned off ATV area of Craighead Forest Park to be quite interesting compared to the rest. In spring there are certain plant species that can, so far, only be found in this section of the park. And a number of the trees there appear older for some reason. I don't have a lot of information on the parks earlier history or what was there beforehand, but I suspect the area holds remnants of what Crowley's Ridge used to look like before mass settlement took place.

"Former medic here myself, and while I'm not antivax as a whole, I feel the current Covid one has too many variables that shouldn't be forced or mandated. NEA has a deadline of around the end of September and St Bernards Oct 1st, unless those have been redacted recently. 

As far as being unable to get vaccines and not being right for the medical field, that's asinine. And I'm not referring to just doctors, nurses, techs, but your support staff like janitors and kitchen staff and mantiance. My wife for example is high risk pregnancy and numerous nurses who said they were willing to receive the vax after having there child, which were due after the deadline, have been told to either get it or walk and chose to walk. 

They're already short staff for burnout, but if even a small fraction walk off over this, I hate to be the one who said told you so.

"Vaccine mandates are up to the discretion of the company. That's capitalism for you. If someone has every other vaccine but can't get the covid one because religion, I call BS. I am not saying that is happening, but if so, that is a no-go. 

I do not feel (as a former medic) that anyone who is anti-vax belongs in the medical field. If I had my choice, I would not want any unvaccinated person working on me and mine. 

People that can't get vaccines at all because of some medical history should not be a nurse or a doctor. That is an unneeded risk. To me, not being able to get the flu vaccine is a little different. 

I am also not buying the religion belief either. If people want to claim that, which they can, they should probably look in another field to work in. My views may not be popular and may even be cold hearted, but that is how I feel.

Downtown is expensive but nice IF you don’t mind noise, traffic, parking. Convenient for food and not hard to get around.

Best choice for location is the Landing at Greensboro. Expensive but safe and convenient.

We have two state parks (Walcott and Lake Frierson) and a city park (Craighead Forest) here. Hiking isn’t going to be strenuous but it will get you outdoors. An hour or so drive will get you near really pretty places to hike, though.

"do you bring this same energy to the adults that ask young children about their boyfriends and girlfriends, or all the baby clothes that say things like “stud” and “sorry boys, daddy says no dating”? because i guarantee the people complaining about this don’t. they’re probably the same ones who do this crap. to say that the concern here is simply exposing kids to mature themes is not only giving these people too much credit, it is also implying that you see any non-straight relationship as purely sexual, which, you guessed it, is a homophobic take. 

no one is actually asking kids to identify their sexuality, i’ll agree that wording choice was odd. there are adults, hell, there are elders, that are still figuring it out. the goal is to tell kids that straight isn’t default, and that there are people of every orientation under the sun, and they are just as deserving of respect and celebration as straight people. the goal is to raise a generation less hostile than the ones we’ve come from.

"I currently live there and do NOT recommend them.  Besides the poor response to maintenance requests, the apartments are on a downward trend, the owner sold the place off after making some improvements and the new people just want to make money and it shows.  They're about to raise the rent across the board by another $50 to take advantage of the housing crisis, making a 2 bedroom apt here $730/mo.  NOT WORTH IT.  There are much, much better places in JBR than Williamsburg.

We also lost all our courtesy officers, new tenants trash the place, can't throw trash in the dumpsters, always trash on the ground now.

"I live near there, but in a relatively safer area.  Anything around College Corner, especially just North and to the East and West are bad.  Lots of violent crime, stabbings, shootings, etc.  Best to avoid the North-side of Jonesboro by ASU as well as the East Nettleton area.  Basically avoid these areas in Jonesboro (most crimes, most locations police get called to): https://imgur.com/1kYrRkr

Anything between Red Wolf Blvd/Stadium and the NEA Baptist hospital is good though (that area is known as Hilltop).  It's a growing part of town, lots of good restaurants.

Anything south of ASU is also good.  The south side of Jonesboro is where the better apartments are located.

As a side note, I would also avoid anything owned/managed by Sulcer Rentals too.  At least if you expect maintenance request to get fulfilled promptly and to get your security deposit back.  Williamsburg Apartments added a gate and a gym, but they're in the process of jacking up the rent by another $50, making these apartments a rip off.  The apartments are quickly going downhill as well.  They are not worth $730 for a 2 bedroom apt.

"I lived in CC for the first year and a bit in Jonesboro. Eventually I couldn't stand it and broke the lease. 

The issue isn't crime so much as general crummyness. They didn't tell me I was on the second floor, so I showed up with a hand truck expecting to move in in a day, and it took 2-3 days, costing me more time renting the moving truck. It took them 3 weeks to give me a mailbox key. One of my windows cracked during the tornado, and they just never bothered to fix it despite multiple requests. The outlets were outdated, and were so loose that plugs would just fall out. Floors were warped. Had mice and roaches. Students would stand outside my window at night and make calls. The stairs are clearly unsafe and have portions rusted out. They occasionally tack weld some new sheet metal, but the whole thing needs to be replaced. The covid safety was essentially non-existent with the office staff refusing to wear masks, and sending people unmasked into the apartment. Pool was small and dirty. Laundry machines had about a 50% chance of working any given time you went down to use them (but there's laundry across the street). Neighbors would argue loudly and I could hear them through the wall. 

It's a cheaper side of town with a lot of lower income apartments, and some manufactured homes around. 

On the plus side it's close to campus is you can walk if you're associated with the school.

You find homophobic people everywhere. Even up north in places like Minnesota, where one of my parents currently live. The difference here in arkansas is that the state itself does not care. They don't try to promote being gay like you would see up north.

"> I don’t understand why it’s hard to get great BBQ in Jonesboro. 35 years ago there were several really good places and then splat just average.

The best (Circle J) closed down, I think due to the owner retiring. Shadynook BBQ off Southwest Drive is probably the best remaining, though H2Que in the ASU football stadium is pretty good too.

"The vibe is casual compared with some other medical schools, but is quickly becoming the norm nationwide (no dress code for lecture, no mandatory lecture, can stream online instead of going in person). NYIT is on campus but is in just one building, so in a way it feels separate. Most students study in the NYIT building because it’s quieter than the undergrad campuses and only venture to the undergrad student union (next door) for Starbucks or food or to the gym. 

You can participate in ASU research and some do. There’s also medical Spanish and a MBA program NYIT offers if you’re looking for more on top of a DO agree.

"It depends what you're comparing it to. All med schools want to teach ""professionalism"" but what that constitutes varies. Some schools have a very strict dress code (lecom for example), and Nyitcom-Arkansas is less formal than that. If your username came to light it would probably get you in trouble.

Students are stressed out, but that's universal for all medical students. Students aren't encouraged to believe they're in competition with one another and the majority are passing their courses.

Faculty are generally patient and student focused.

Graduate programs Are in general a very different beast from med school. Nyitcom-Arkansas just launched a MS program to lead students into the DO program. A state has PhD and MS programs. 

There are some opportunities for research, but fewer than a large MD school.

A PhD is longer, generally paid, a bit easier to get into and more difficult to graduate from. The quality of the experience usually depends on the PI and project.

"I am connected to the school, so take my opinion with that caveat. 

Among medical schools outside of the top 10-20 or so, the name isn't going to impact a physician's career much. Within the wide middle of medical schools it's really up to the student learn the material and pass boards. Every student in the country has access to the same textbooks, similar quality lectures, and group sessions. 

What really matters in that range is finding a school that is comfortable, fits the student's needs and expectations for medical school, and will provide them with all appropriate resources.

If you are an undergrad go to AState hit the targets and get guaranteed admission while also applying to UAMS or any other school. 

UAMS is cheaper and tied into the state network of doctors.

2. Yes. A couple of Thai places (Sai Thai for example), one Indian (Curry Leaf), a new Greek restaurant (Pella Cafe). Pella Cafe is great. The BBQ is mediocre. I enjoy Mabry Smokehouse, but you are best to go to Memphis for quality BBQ (also shopping at this point with the mall not being rebuilt).
3. I don't feel qualified to answer this
4. The drive to Memphis is about an hour, but with I-40 out of the question you probably are going to face delays.
5. The Chamber of Commerce in my experience is a big WASP-y circle jerk. If you are so inclined there are things like the local Gamer's Haven and Gamer's Guild. But outside of that...Churches.
6. There is a low cost of living here but on the flip side there is not a lot of culture that you think the University would bring and I would say its boring. The main sources of entertainment are restaurants (and a lot of them aren't that good).

"1. Snow here is different than anyplace else. It is normally more ice than actual snow. Probably an average of 3-5 days a year. 
2. We have a very wide variety of restaurants. We are fat and eating out is the main entertainment... that churches and banks
3. Real estate... you get what you pay for. With kids Jonesboro has the widest variety of classes, Brookland has the best elementary, nettleton is in competition with Jonesboro, valley view is only as good as you can pay. Westside is like the rural small town school. Each are good depending on your children’s needs and goals. Each area has its own ghetto and decent neighborhoods. A real estate agent can help you out

5. If you want to be involved in the community there are lots of opportunities.

"1. We don't usually get much snow. This year was not normal. We might get snow once or twice a year, but it's usually more a dusting or it melts off in a day or two. We sometimes get ice storms, though.

2. We have a couple of Thai places, one Indian, several other Asian places, lots of Mexican, a Greek food truck, and a few others. I think the BBQ is good. It's not KC or Texas style, more Memphis or Delta. Demo's is good, but there are a few small BBQ shacks on the edge of town that are really good. 

3. Right now, the market is booming. Things are selling really fast and prices are pretty high. New construction is even higher due to cost of lumber. There is a lot of building going on. As for good neighborhoods, it depends on your price range. There are good neighborhoods all over town. I would recommend renting for a little while until you get a feel for town and where you might want to live. 

4. Memphis is worth it. We go several times a year. Right now it's going to be a pain because one of the bridges is closed, so that's going to add a lot of driving time.

"I don’t understand why it’s hard to get great BBQ in Jonesboro. 35 years ago there were several really good places and then splat just average.  

100% had no desire to go back when I left AState except for coming to football and basketball when it wasn’t a mess. Talking to younger people it sounds like it’s a better community for the 22-35 year old demographic than it was when I graduated. 

AState and StBernards were the dominant employers back in the 80’s and in turn generated some serious resentment, very odd dynamic. 

Having seen the flooding that happens on Red Wolf Blvd amazes me city failed to successfully sell improvement tax twice. 

On the upside, the renovation of downtown still amazes me. When I worked at the courthouse in the 80’s practically nothing was open now going great and ought to be the role model for many cities.

"1. Technically, it snows here almost every year.  How often do we see significant accumulations like in February of this year, I'd wager every 5-7 years, if that often.

2.  We are starting to see more diverse options.  We have a couple of Thai places (Sai Thai and Mai Pai) an Indian place (Curry Leaf), and ramen (Ichiya).  The BBQ here, in my opinion, isn't great but good and if you're looking for Texas style (beef) it's going to be lacking.  Everyone here raves about Demo's and I don't think Que is bad.  There are a few other, smaller places around too.

3.  It's booming like the rest of the nation. I'd avoid anything boxed in by Johnson, Caraway, Magnolia, and Culberhouse.  I'd also avoid anything boxed in by Red Wolf (Stadium), Nettleton, and Apache (Access).  Just my opinion here but it really depends on what kind of space you're looking for.

4.  Memphis is *usually* a short trip, an hour to get there but more to navigate to your destination most likely.  I say usually because you may have heard about the major bridge closure connecting Tennessee (Memphis) to Arkansas (West Memphis).  This has caused significant delays from what I've read but I cannot personally confirm.

5.  I think there are those opportunities for certain things but it feels like this town is run by a good ole boys system, just personal opinion again there.

6.  I think the best thing is the cost of living is relatively cheap.  You can't really beat it.  The negative thing in my opinion is the church scene has too much influence on things.

7.  That's kind of hard to say.  Due to its proximity to Memphis I would say it is like a suburb of a larger metro area.

If you have any other questions, just ask.

Sadly the music scene here is recovering. It had been largely dead until downtown has seen some growth. More and more local musicians are lining gigs up.
