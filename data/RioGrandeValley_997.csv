"I wasn't defending racism, I'm simply giving you a perspective on the topic from  actual Native people which you clearly couldn't handle. If you don't want to accept reality, I can't help you. You don't get to lecture me on this topic. You simply refuse to understand that ""Redskin"" teams have been a point of pride for many of the people this topic concerns, and the only acceptable path forward if we are to change the name is to make sure it is a name that celebrates Native heritage, not to completely erase it like they did with the Washington Football team. It isn't complicated.

As for my other points on coercive Latinismo, I don't really need you to approve of my own experience, the experiences of my friends, my family, nor the experiences of the generations behind me throughout South Texas.

"***Let me start by saying that amongst the crowd of bigots there are always loving people of all kinds.*** For generations, people of Native heritage across South Texas have faced a culture that denies us of our roots. For generations, many have faced a culture that wished to coerce us into a homogenous identity within Latinismo. For generations, many were shamed for our Native ethnic features i.e., brown skin, eye shape, all while being made to feel that acknowledging our Native heritage was wrong. This was a part of a longstanding culture of **Native erasure, paper genocide, and other forms of ethnocide** in our region. So, for me, as well as other people of Native descent, as a rare Native ""representation"", teams like the **Redskins** have come to be seen as **points of pride**. Believe it or not. (No, I am not defending racism, I am simply stating a shared perspective of many Natives.) Of course, I absolutely understand why some Natives disagree. But to hear of people who should have no say on the topic trying to ban Native imagery almost feels like just another in the long line of attempts at **native erasure**. With that said I completely understand calls for a name change by other Natives, and I could only hope the replacement name seeks to be a better celebration of Native heritage rather than ridding the area of Native imagery altogether as the Washinton Football Team did.

Calling the Valley ""racially homogenous"" completely ignores all of our unique histories, and not only is it incredibly insulting to everyone, but you are actually in a way contributing to Native erasure, paper genocide, and other forms of ethnocide by doing so.

Here is my other post on this to further inform you on my perspective.

**Let me start by saying that amongst the crowd of bigots there are always loving people of all kinds.** For generations, people of Native heritage across South Texas have faced a culture that denies us of our roots. For generations, we have faced a culture that wished to coerce us into a homogenous identity within Latinismo. For generations we were shamed for our non-European ethnic features, all while being made to feel that acknowledging our Native heritage was wrong. This was a part of a longstanding culture of **Native erasure, paper genocide, and other forms of ethnocide** in our region. So, for me, as well as other people of Native descent in every city across the Valley, as a rare Native representation, we have come to see teams like the **Redskins** as rare **points of pride**.  Of course, I absolutely understand the concern. But to hear of people trying to ban it almost feels like just another in the long line of attempts at **native erasure**. If the name really bothers people, I only hope the replacement name seeks to be a better celebration of Native heritage rather than ridding the area of Native imagery altogether.

"You mightve heard of this one if youre from the midvalley.

One of my friends broke into school at night and broke into the police officers office and stole the police car keys, drove away and picked up my other friends.

They then decided to go prank another friend by driving to his house and turning the lights on him but as they were on the way there another cop passed by and by accident the guy who stole the car turned the siren on the other cop.

It then led to a small chase a couple of blocks till they got to a crop field which they rsn thru for a mile or so till they lost the cops, they had dogs out for them but they just hid on a ditch. My other friend and his brother then called their mom and she picked them up.

The friend who stole the cop car kept going and he then somehow ended up back at the school, he then stole a golf cart the security guards would use and he drove back home with it. I just remembered him posting that on snapchat driving a golfcart on a road without any context. At that time no one knew what happened till a couple of days later.

When asked why he did it, he said he was bored lol.

Couple of years later im pretty sure the main guy still has a record but the other 2 friends were able to get it expunged as they were able to prove with cameras that they didnt break in. That was after the main guy snitched them out, the two other guys weren suspects cs they couldnt be identified.",t2_1366w9,vics12,0,1648078634.0,0,t1_i1v4l7f,i1v4l7f,True,InfinitePiece9505,t3_tlfe31,https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tlfe31/craziest_high_school_stories/,Craziest High School Stories,/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tlfe31/craziest_high_school_stories/i1v4l7f/,16,r/RioGrandeValley,0,16

"As a high schooler who'se lived here all his life.  The valley is very safe.  The media has overhyped it and as for the ""border crisis,"" I have yet to see any signs of there being one.  The schools here are decent but could be better.  If you really want your children to be academically challenged, you'll have to do some research and really inform yourself about the schools in the area.  However, I would say most schools in the valley are relatively good and enough to get your kids far in life.  
The food here is amazing, the cost of living is pretty good, home prices are reasonable, job aspects could be better, but the valley is growing fast.

"Glad you're in a much better spot my guy! This is going to be long but hopefully yourself and others can relate and hopefully this inspires other weird latinos out there that feel a little lost or hopeless as a later generation latino.

I'm around your age and last year the idea of getting therapy hit me pretty hard when i would reflect back on conversations with people or how i would react to certain things. When I felt pretty removed from the emotions at the time I would reflect and I realized I talked/reacted in a way about some extended family, my parents, and my ideas of self.  They more often than not had serious sub-tones of resentment.

The shpeel of my upbringing for context:

* Born in the valley, moved at 1, raised essentially as a suburban white boy(not to be mean), moved back at 8, experienced huge culture shock in public schools because of totally different experiences usually because i had some hobbies that required a decent level of affluence(different video games+consoles from what others played, access to decent computer and internet for pc games, etc.)... Decent level of outcast but i managed, and being a bit chunky didn't work in my favor. Means i was pretty insecure about my body and wore jackets in hot ass weather to cover up too.
* Early years, parent1 was random with their emotions and would either be super mean and a buzzkill or would not say anything but obviously be upset that it brought everyone's mood down. On top of that they were mostly absent from us time or my events because of work. They eventually made a u-turn in life around when i start entering highschool and became more patient and a better loving person but it was hard to accept since i essentially learned to fear them.
* Went through middle school and up to some of highschool being a pretty resentful and elitist jerk. (Peak self-hate, buzzkill mode)
* Entering highschool i realize i don't have a strong connection with catholicism and then eventually just became an atheist because I was able to become so much more accepting and loving of others and myself. Decide i've had enough with going to church and acting catholic, I tell my parents, surprisingly parent1 was totally understanding, parent2 isn't happy and claims that my feelings are not genuine and then from then on begins a passive-aggressive campaign to either get me involved in little rituals or only address me and my concerns in the frame of god instead of the frame of listening-and-talking WITH and not just TO your child. So now i'm having trouble trusting my dad and mom entering highschool :)

SUMMARY FROM THEN TO NOW - I get on my own campaign of slow but good self-improvement and now I'm here. Way more confident, i'm not shredded and have some chub on me but I actually like my body because i still think i look good a little beefy and we're still working on that fighters bod. I've adopted a style of dressing that definitely feels me and less closed-off. Gave less of a fuck about the thoughts of parents, family, and traditional hispanic/latino beliefs so got the piercings I've wanted since i was little, beginning on my dorky and edgy tatt sleeves journey, and I put on nail-polish presenting how i've always wanted. I'm way more charismatic now, i'm still introverted but i've learned to enjoy being out there and confident. Enough to dance as hard as i can and hype people or my more introverted friends up at parties/clubs by dancing even when they're too shy so they get more confidence to. Lastly, I feel like i've gotten better at talking WITH people, letting them feel they're in a comfortable environment where they're not gonna be unintentionally misunderstood or made fun of and instead having more genuine fruitful conversation.

WHY THERAPY THEN? FULL CIRCLE - I think people are only so well equipped to be able to handle certain aspects of their lives, so maybe i've made great leeway for the most part but I know there's so much more healing i can do by getting that help from good equipment, which would be therapy. I feel everyone could use some therapy, and you'll probably agree our family would need it way more than us lol.Life can get better if you want to make the change, getting help is never wrong friends :)

"Going to the pulgas on the weekend is fun, you can get some yummy munchies and super cheap clothes and fruit and plants and just anything you could think to buy. Just bring hats and water, it’s hot. 

Also McAllen has a giant library with a huge kid’s section, and there’s loads of programs at the community centers, I used to teach an after school art class at Lark Community Center, it was so fun.

There’s IMAS (international museum of art and science) in McAllen and the Museum of South Texas History in Edinburg, and both of those are really fun to visit with the kids- especially go to the history museum in Edinburg if you wanna learn more about the valley. 

There’s the beach just an hour away as has been mentioned. If you’re going out there check out the birding center and the sea turtle sanctuary at the island, those are also great activities for the kids and you get to see the beautiful animals here.

Quinta Mazatlan in McAllen is a very accessible nature trail in the city and they have fun events throughout the years for the whole family. 

In north Edinburg on the outskirts there is a salt lake called Sal de Rey, it’s a short hike that leads to like a mudflat that has tons of salt and beautiful hoof prints and paw prints of dear and nilgai and bobcats. I love going there, it’s very historic, just bring lots of water and hats and bug spray.

There’s the Wesmer drive in movies, about a twenty/thirty minute drive away, it’s cute, they usually play cheap movies that just came out and you drive right up and tune into the audio on your car radio. They usually play a double feature of a kids movie first and then an adult one, and they have snack stands and bathrooms.

Edinburg and McAllen do lots of events, there’s movies in the parks (check the city website for locations and dates) and there’s the annual UFO convention in Edinburg lol! Edinburg also throws an annual Oktoberfest, and just random city events you have to look up online. McAllen convention center has lots going on too, and lately I’ve been in love with their yearly Día de Muertos outdoor concerts.

"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott launched Operation Lone Star to ramp up security along the Texas-Mexico border in March 2021, citing insufficient policies from the federal government. He announced that the state would deploy resources from the Department of Public Safety and the National Guard. The Texas Legislature dedicated nearly $2 billion toward the effort. But the operation has been mired in controversy; National Guard troops have called it a disaster, and migrants arrested on state trespassing charges have gotten caught in confused legal proceedings, their lawyers citing due-process violations.

"Not originally from the valley either. 

It’s generally safer (statistically) than DFW, Austin, Houston etc. You can look up the crime statistics if you want, but no worries here. 

Random driving observation. People drive slower here, really push the yellow to red light limit, and don’t tend to fully slow down in school zones. Traffic isn’t bad. It might seem bad if you live here, but if you are from large cities like Houston or Dallas, it’s like a light traffic day. 

I’ve found that wait times and appointments are horrendous for any health services like doctors appointments, including pediatricians. 

Public schools are pretty decent. You can look up district and school report cards on TEA’s website. Compare them to the area you live in now. 

Plenty to do. The island is a little over an hour away. Easy to do day trips to the beach. Brownsville has a decent children’s play museum and zoo. Lots of playgrounds, although I wish they had better up keep. 

Lots of things feel dated down here, although still nice.

I agree to some degree. It is very very safe in my opinion however I think the crime element comes from criminals crossing and going north.

">As a native who grew up on the rez, I don’t like the name. But we have so many other pressuring issues that come before.

Well, the OP said there was a ""mounting pressure"" against using native American imagery.. and I just don't see it. Even you accept is not the most important issue facing NA communities.. and I think the Wall Street pool reflects that,

To be honest the issue is foreign to me, I'm of Mexican origin and the only similar incident I can think of is when white people tried to ""cancel"" Speedy Gonzales.. almost every latino loves Speedy.

So, that makes me question the legitimacy of the ""mounting pressure"", is it really something that Native Americans consider a problem?

"You can boil my examples down to ""personal choice"", but then that's just a straw man argument, because you're conveniently disregarding the impact poverty has on the kinds of choices people get to make. Poor people don't have a lot of choices available to them. If it's between using your food stamps to purchase fresh produce or junk food to feed your family for the month, and you know that you can buy more junk food with food stamps than you can fresh produce, there isn't a choice to be made really. When you're working two jobs as a single mom, you don't have time to cook healthy meals everyday. So if you can use food stamps to buy fast food (and you can, and you should be thinking about how capitalism makes that happen), you can also save time, because poor people have no time. A poor person needs to make their time and money stretch to survive.

Think about why some people try to be wealthy in first place: access to choices. It's easy to criticize people's choices from a position of privilege and when you forget that some people don't have access to good choices that privilege brings.",t2_cusp1,nefastvs,0,1647879069.0,0,t1_i1jn1pa,i1jn1pa,False,Dan-68,t3_tffik8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tffik8/the_city_ranked_highest_in_the_country_for/,The city ranked highest in the country for obesity is in the RGV.,/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tffik8/the_city_ranked_highest_in_the_country_for/i1jn1pa/,2,r/RioGrandeValley,0,2

"Yeah I remember the student and her mom as well. I remember waiting for the incident to be reported during the evening news for several days and nothing ever came on. Not even an article. Which is weird because those type of cases usually receive a lot of attention. 

I ran into a former teacher years ago and we talked about the incident. And yeah, they said that it was obvious to them that the school was trying their best to not bring negative attention since they were still starting out. There was another incident a few years ago involving a female teacher and it was widely reported.

So it didn’t seem like they were hiding it at least at that point.. it could be this was after it got out? Who knows..

"IDEA school officials came to an agreement with the parent of an underaged student who was sexually involved with a teacher. The students were told to not talk about the incident. Obviously the word got around and the general belief was that IDEA was trying to protect their reputation since they were the new ""hot"" charter school in the region.

Well, the teacher did get arrested. However, the local media never reported the incident (something that would have been big news if it happened at a regular school district). Plus some former teachers have also reported that they were warned about the consequences of speaking about the incident to the media. This occurred back in 2009.

There is a mexican horror movie called Cemetery of Terror from 1985 that was filmed half in Mexico and half in Brownsville. The final scene has an ambulance in it that clearly reads City of Brownsville. The Director Ruben Galindo also directed another film called [Con El Odio En La Piel ](https://youtu.be/6bYkwqfo1aE) that you can watch on YouTube.

"The thing is that they ARE arrested, but their fellow judges that run the real politics let them go with a slap on the hand.

You can arrest people like Judges like Homer Jasso and Nora Longoria, but they will be given light sentences or low bail.

Ricardo Rodriguez, Terry Palacios, and Judge Renee Betancourt are all related. When one steps down, the other takes their place and so on like Ricardo Rodriguez stepped down thinking no one would run against Terry Palacios but Nereida Singleterry is giving them a run for their money and opening up the discussion of investigating nepotism in Hidalgo County.

That's why arresting Monica Patterson from the Palacios family was a huge deal, and her case was even better because a lot of judges had to recuse themselves. They were all connected to the hospice she was running.

As to families, they can run town but no one really knows what they look like because they work behind the scenes.

I think the ones they let go off are the people that work for the city like commissioners and city managers because your job is in true jeopardy there. City managers are really good at having power trips and squeezing even the police/fire chiefs or anyone else from their jobs.

"real talk, a lot of my family would benefit from therapy. Some of them are so egotistical trying to prove their manliness because of how they were brought up. Others have nothing but broken relationships because they are lashing out due to childhood trauma. Some can't forgive. Or they just don't want to understand another point of view because they are so focused on what they think. There's just so much brokenness these days and almost no one would be open to talking about their feelings. They think it is weak, weird, or that you're crazy. But real strength and confidence comes from being secure enough to be honest about all of these things. More power to you and i wish you the best.

I Don’t live there anymore but when I do go to visit it’s kinda fun. Gets old fast though. I do find myself being ghetto and saying ghetto shit and using valley slang where I live now because it’s funny to me and I miss it. It’s not an everyday thing.

"Frankly, the refusal to leave. As someone who has moved around, I am a firm believer everyone should leave for at least a little while. Valley culture is very conceited and ignorant of the rest of the United States. 

You wouldn't think it, but valley people are some of the most racist and conservative that I've met, even when compared to white-dense populations.  This at its root is homogeny of people and culture. 

The valley is predominantly behind on music, fashion, food, progressive politics, and other cultural faucets. Obviously this is a generalization, but people are afraid of anything out of the ordinary. I believe and hope this will phase out with younger generations.

In short, the two things that deter me from living back in the valley are the climate and the valley mentality.",t2_fnoso,Tempest1677,0,1647660860.0,0,t1_i18ox7c,i18ox7c,True,[deleted],t3_thd1rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/thd1rw/trashy_valley_traits/,Trashy Valley traits 😜,/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/thd1rw/trashy_valley_traits/i18ox7c/,34,r/RioGrandeValley,0,34
