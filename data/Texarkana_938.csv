Not that it matters, because Walmart has a whole set of issues that will make you not shop over there. Plus, $15 an hour isn't all that livable these days with prices being so high. But it's more hourly than what I made as a welder or a EMT paramedic locally.

I can go on, but I see why this town is only good for retirement and nothing else.

"This town is weird. They put a lot of money into revitalizing the downtown area and then don’t do anything to Stateline (like repave it or fix the sidewalks so people can actually walk or drive downtown safely). Stateline is sad y’all. When the few fast food chain restaurants are the nicest looking buildings in the place…I honestly think people just don’t care at all. They don’t care how their homes look and they don’t care how the city looks, and visitors aren’t coming and helping the economy so there’s no money and why should  the major chains come to a place where people have nothing to spend? It’s a vicious cycle. And I’ll add to your list. What happened to the Panda Express that was supposed to be built and before that the Panera Bread? Can’t even get basic chains here.

"u/palekillerwhale That's a shame, considering the population growth in this area. I don't see how single parents can handle this town's pay. I mean, anything below $16 an hour ain't shit, unless they have family or friends to help watch the kids. This town has too many low-paying jobs, paying below $12 an hour, and that's just a sad economy. It's like if you can't handle Cooper's hard labor, it's like you can't find anything close to what they pay. Not even dealerships make anything without commission.

The middle of a season is usually the slowest for TV shows but I really had no problem with it. Arcane has sooo much to offer. When rewatching it you still find new things that compels you even more. So much thought and delicacy was put into it. The way it was written makes you feel emotions with ease. I teared up multiple times during the show.  This is my opinion you may have different thoughts. I never got into Adventure Time or Steven Universe I was one of those kids that thought I'm not a kid and I don't need to watch it. I also still don't watch them because of being judge by family members that I'm watching a kids show. For death note however I liked it but didn't. It felt slow at times and just hard to watch.

"So, some interesting points. 

Generally speaking, if you intend to rent I would rent on the Texas side. If you intend to buy, I would buy on the Arkansas side. 

Property taxes are much, much lower in the Arkansas side. I own a 1300 square foot home on .25 acre lot with a 950 square foot detached shop and pay about 600 bucks a year in property taxes. My parents, however, live on the Texas side. Their home is appraised at the same value as mine and they pay around 6K in property taxes. If you work in Arkansas, and live in the city limits of either of the two cities you will be exempt from Arkansas State Income Tax. 

When shopping, keep in mind that sales tax in Texas is about 8 cents on the dollar, compared to about 12 cents on the dollar in Arkansas. Also, Texas does not have a grocery tax. 

The cost of living here is generally lower that what you will find in Little Rock and Dallas. 

There are some really nice neighbor hoods on both sides of town. Police, Fire, and EMS services are very good also. 

When looking for a place to stay, be sure to look around the neighbor hood at night, during a typical work day, and on weekends to get a feel for how things are going. 

I'm from here, grew up on the Arkansas side and choose to come back here after I got out of the military.

">[On its UCR website, the FBI says Uniform Crime Reporting statistics used to compile rankings of individual jurisdictions are “…incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents.” This disclaimer should be on every page of the NeighborhoodScout.com website, for every crime-related ranking they have.](https://www.myarklamiss.com/news/local-news/mayo-most-dangerous-list-used-flawed-data/)

I get the sentiment, but NeighborhoodScout is not a great source just based on how they portray their data, and the lack of sourcing their data. It's very misleading and doesn't give you a full scope of individual city situations. The [Dallas violent crime rate](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/tx/dallas/crime) on their site has many more reported crimes, with more people per 1,000 residents, and a much higher violent crime comparison than Texarkana. But since they have so many more people, Texarkana falls below Dallas on their ""Crime Index"" scale comparatively. 

Also, where'd you get the info that the city didn't report anything in 2019? I see information [here](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/texas.xls), and just looking at the static data - San Juan, Duncanville, and Lufkin are three cities with higher violent crime numbers than Texarkana, within roughly the same population numbers.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

We actually made the most of it. All of the ppl in the neighborhood sledded down the big hill. It was so communal. My daycare teacher, Mrs. Jones was Hispanic, always had the best block parties.

I miss that. It's not like that in Lexington SC. We are going from country to gentrified.

Ah.. money is why we can’t take down a statue. It’s funny how money will always be the reason why we can’t do things but whenever ideas like “let’s build a wall across Texas” comes up you don’t hear shit from the same people wanting to keep statues that represent a treasonous nation fighting against America for the love of enslaving other humans. You can water it down all you want to but there is no denying that is why the war was fought. That is why Abraham’s Lincoln name wasn’t on the ballot in the southern state and that is why each confederate state left the union. It’s time we take down statues of hate no matter what the cost.,t2_i51vc92,I_MILK_KITTENS_MILK,0,1594754295.0,0,t1_fy2evzt,fy2evzt,True,Texarkanausa,t3_hqucae,https://www.reddit.com/r/texarkana/comments/hqucae/still_time_for_compromise_and_unity/,Still time for compromise and unity,/r/texarkana/comments/hqucae/still_time_for_compromise_and_unity/fy2evzt/,2,r/texarkana,0,2
"This is a very nicely written article, but I don’t think this is the hill to die on.

But if you walked into a church and it was filled with statues of Satan and flags for Satan, you’d begin to wonder what they’re worshipping.” 

Also, the fact is that a majority of the African American population of Texarkana has stated that they’re uncomfortable with this statue.

"Well, it's statistically high for the population. It's something that's interested me for a while. Majority of the crime is property crime it looks like. The rate actually looks better since last I saw. Says here there is a annual **1,256** property crime (Burglary, breaking and entering, ect)  compared to  **200** violent crimes. Perhaps it's just my luck, but I've seen a lot of crime in downtown, I used to take long walks with my friends at night and just talk. Hell we'd even take the alleys. We've accidentally interrupted a drug deal at the playground down town, grown men hiding in there as we walked by. And there where some shootings nearby us while we where eating on state line once. I'd consider down town around Hotel Grim or the prison nearby. Despite being called ""Blatantly wrong"" I know I've seen a homeless guy sling his  bike through a abandoned buildings window to break in.

"Agree 100%. Born and raised, moved away, joined the military, traveled the world, moved back to TXK. It's like any other city; you have your parts to stay out of, and even the bad parts are okay if you're just minding your own business.

The problem is larger cities usually have balance; crime, and attraction. Texarkana only has crime, theres nothing to do, and the restaraunts are garbage.

The other part to it is Texarkana is not a large land mass, Pleasant grove is a 7 minute drive from Taglehood.",t2_nqrqt,FoxTrot903,0,1588215671.0,0,t1_fp0s2vx,fp0s2vx,False,[deleted],t3_ga59wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/texarkana/comments/ga59wl/moving_to_texarkana/,Moving to Texarkana,/r/texarkana/comments/ga59wl/moving_to_texarkana/fp0s2vx/,2,r/texarkana,0,2

"Why move to Texarkana? 


Also I was born and raised here, In my opinion Texas side is more dangerous than Arkansas side. Don't get me wrong, Arkansas side can be pretty rough too, especially around college hill area and some apartment complexes. 

Just stay away from drugs, and dont carry too much cash if you carry any at all. If you live on the Arkansas side just know this. Arkansas side you can legally carry a gun on your person without a license. That means open or concealed carry, they're both legal without a license in Arkansas. On Texas side you have to unstrap because it's not legal in Texas without a license. 

You'll be fine as long as you don't hang out with the wrong crowd, if you feel nervous in a situation you should probably get the hell out of there.

State line can be pretty rough and some say that the Arkansas side is worse than the Texas side. I live in a nearby town and have for my whole life, and I've lived in Marshall Texas briefly. From what I know, the crime rate is really high because the cartel runs straight through Texarkana on it's way north from Mexico, but It's just what I hear l.

"This is pretty accurate for me. I spent 2 years in Texarkana for work before relocating, Texarkana is what you will make of it. There isn't much to do socially and beside work colleagues/customers I found it hard to find groups of friends because most people are TXK lifers and run with the same groups they've run with since grade school. . If you have family and want to settle down or are a very introverted person I wouldn't mind being in Texarkana one bit. If you're young and don't have a group I wouldn't give it a resounding endorsement but I wouldn't say it's a dealbreaker either. YMMV.  


PG is a super safe and nice part of town. I lived off Texas Blvd and College and never felt unsafe but Texarkana has some strange pockets with nice residential development and then .5 mile down the road it gets a little dicey. We never really felt unsafe but we had some sporadic odd encounters on our street that I haven't had living anywhere else. Again, YMMV.  


The thing I've told people about TXK is that it's close to a lot of places you want to go to. Shreveport 1 hour, Little Rock 2 hours, Dallas 3 hours, all easy trips to make. If you're into outdoorsy stuff, there's plenty of options within an hour (Hochatown/Broken Bow/plenty of other stuff in range).   


TXK has the lowest cost of living of anywhere I've ever been, and that's a selling point in itself.
