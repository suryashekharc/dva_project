"So I realize this is 3 weeks old,  but I thought I'd address a few things. 

Winterizing your house is basically just shutting off your exterior pipes(shut off valves are usually in the basement) so they don't freeze. You can do things like place a film over your windows to help with heating costs,  but that's really it.  The car,  you don't really do anything other than use windshield wiper fluid designed for the winter(lower freezing point so it doesn't turn into slush).  


The Great Lakes are definitely odd if you aren't used to them.  Just think of them like an ocean.

I know several people have mentioned Beloit, which is actually where I work, but I decided on Janesville because there’s much more shopping/stuff to do than Beloit (if you want a Target for example, there isn’t one in Beloit).

We also have a cute little downtown area that has a lot of little events throughout the year. I went to their recent shop local event and it was really nice to explore!

Edit: when we first considered this move I was only looking at apartments. Just looked at some of the houses and I can’t believe my eyes. These houses would be double or triple in my area.

"Depending on your race, you may consider Beloit to live in versus Janesville. Housing is significantly cheaper for equivalent sizes and yards. A $150,000 house in Janesville is only $100,000 in Beloit. The detriment is that Beloit had a heavier black population which still suffers from the large wage gap due to two ghettos that were zoned early in it's life. This means the public schools have a lot more issues than Janesville. The gun crime there is rampant as well. However if you don't decide to live directly in them, you will still have more diverse schools than you would in Janesville.

Personally I'm a fan of Janesville more than Beloit due to less violent crime. The schools in Janesville do not suffer the same detriments that Beloit had as well. Particularly if you believe your kids may end up being special needs. Which my gf's has. As for my soon to be son, we shall see.

Beloit does have the oldest running college in the state though and the downtown is getting gentrified. Some people love or hate it. To me I really just see it as a huge wealth gap from the richers like Diane Hendricks and other people who siphoned off the hard work of others to boost an otherwise dying town culturally being influenced from Rockford.",t2_9ldk5,blanketswithsmallpox,0,1636862837.0,0,t1_hkjn478,hkjn478,True,LimpsMcGee,t3_qt7k3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/qt7k3q/tell_me_about_janesville/,Tell me about Janesville,/r/Janesville/comments/qt7k3q/tell_me_about_janesville/hkjn478/,3,r/Janesville,0,3

">Are there things to do?

Depends what you are interested in, in general I would say yes, there are frequent community events, they're pretty easy to find on Facebook, and also the Janesville cvb website does a pretty good job of keeping things on the calendar. I've also found events from the local paper (Janesville gazette), they have a section about live music and trivia nights and such and where they are going on. There are many parks, several very nice playgrounds for kids, some of them have tennis courts, one has pickleball courts, there are a couple with volleyball courts, and a couple frisbee golf courses, there's also some splash pads for kids at a couple parks too. There are of course bars, pretty standard faire for around here. There are two local breweries, and some wineries around the area. There are a few places worth visiting at least once, but probably aren't things you would do more than once or twice a year like the Rotary botanical gardens and the Tallman house. There are also some self guided tours you can do to find all the art murals Downtown for instance that can be kinda fun. The downtown area is evolving and has seen improvement the last few years, during the summer there are nights on festival once a month which is like a night market, pretty cool, the farmers market is in the same area and is worth going to. There are some neat local shops, not a ton that is especially standout, but some decent restaurant variety, some boutiques, an art gallery, a stained glass store that does classes, and a nice library. There are some local sports to attend too, Janesville Jets is a NAHL Hockey team, and the Rock Aqua Jays are an extremely talented water ski show team, you can see them practicing during the summer in traxler park. There are some great bike paths through town, as the ice age trail goes right through the city. There's also a performing arts center, they have comedy nights pretty often, and sometimes musicals or other performances.

>Community activities?

Yep, mostly kid friendly, it's a good place to raise a family in general

>Do stores stay open past 10 pm?

Mostly just bars

>Is it easy to get an Uber?

No idea, never ordered one here. There is a bus system, for a small city it's actually not bad at all, almost anywhere in the city you are there is a bus stop not terribly far away, most stops see a bus every half hour, but the buses don't run super late and not at all on Sundays.

>Delivery for things other than pizza?

Chinese I think, otherwise anything through door dash type services

>Is it easy to find a doctor?

Yep, there are two major hospital systems in town, with Mercy having multiple locations

>Is racism much of an issue?

I've never seen any blatant racism personally, people are generally nice. I am white, so I can't speak for the experience of minorities, it is a majority white city, but there are many minorities in the city.

>Are there tech jobs available?

Most tech jobs are going to be in Madison (30 minutes away), but Janesville's not devoid of tech jobs, there are corporate offices for retailers here, Blain's, Grainger, Woodman's, I'm fairly certain all of these have some tech jobs, but it's not going to be world changing tech, just standard web development type work.

>What are your favorite things about Janesville?

I talked a lot about my favorite things under the things to do section, I really do like this community, it's not too big that it's overwhelming to navigate or noisy or dangerous, and it's not too small that there isn't anything to do, there's always something going on. I like that it's a good community to raise a family in.

>What do you like the least? 

Lately it's been the lack of a real retro video game store, why I need to drive a half hour to a small town in the middle of nowhere to find a good retro game store is disappointing, I'm still holding out hope for a new one to open up here.

A lot of people here I feel like exaggerate when they say there's nothing to do, if you know where to look there's always something to do, it's just whether or not it interests you. Another exaggeration is all the food options are chains, don't get me wrong, there are a ton of chains here, but there are local restaurants too, mostly downtown, though not exclusively.",t2_4kfin68b,lacaras21,0,1636855935.0,0,t1_hkj8grt,hkj8grt,True,LimpsMcGee,t3_qt7k3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/qt7k3q/tell_me_about_janesville/,Tell me about Janesville,/r/Janesville/comments/qt7k3q/tell_me_about_janesville/hkj8grt/,4,r/Janesville,0,4

"Just my 2 cents as someone who drives for work and has to travel through that area frequently:

Right now, that intersection is a fuckin mess and not finished. Until it is actually done, it's going to be kinda confusing. I don't like how they're touting it on social media like it's 99% done when it's def not. The lane lines are unclear as you enter and exit the intersection, the signage is set for the finished product and not the current state, and all the orange barrels and cones don't make it feel like a smooth clear travel path.

That said, once the construction is actually completed, I expect it to feel very similar to the DDI on the southside. The door to that one is very well signed and smooth with little room for confusion. DDIs have been well studied and I think it'll work really well for that intersection and cut down on back-ups for the traffic traveling off 26 southbound on to the interstate. 

For now, just slow down, be patient, pay attention, and avoid the area if possible.

"I should add more.

There are a number of things that affect traffic safety  and either reduce or increase the number and/or severity of crashes and other incidents. One of these factors is predictability. The ability of drivers to anticipate the actions of other drivers and the environment in which they are travelling so they can react appropriately to situations that occur is a key factor in traffic safety. The more predictable a situation, the more time drivers have to react appropriately.  Speed plays into this as does the general severity of any unpredictable action or situation that might arise.

The less predictable a situation or action is the more crashes it can generate. If the situations that occur because of unpredictable actions carry severe consequences, these are generally worse than situations with lower consequences.

Two examples of this: A driver ahead of you on the highway that doesn't maintain a constant speed and varies their speed at random +/- 7mph. This is an unpredictable situation that carres a relatively low consequence. Your frustration level grows as you sit behind them, as does the line of drivers behind you, but until someone does something reckless to pass them the severity of potential consequences is fairly low. The other example is a wrong-way driver on the interstate. This is a highly unpredictable action with severe consequences.

In the latter, the interstate system has engineering controls to try and prevent wrong-way drivers. In the former, nobody really enforces maintaining a predictably constant speed on the highway because of the relatively low consequence to the action.

Predictability at intersections carries a high consequence depending on the speed and traffic flow. 4-way intersections controlled by traffic lights are very predictable, however the consequences for a driver proceeding against a red light can be catastrophic with a T-bone crash or worse. Therefore it is understandable that they want to put forth engineering controls to try and mitigate those consequences. 

Some of those engineering controls are the roundabout and the aforementioned diverging diamond. They are engineered to reduce the amount of traffic crossing traffic lanes in front of oncoming cars in order to reduce the severity of unpredictable driving behavior. It's fairly well known that roundabouts may reduce crash severity but can increase crash frequency. They can cause more crashes but the crashes that occur are less severe.

[An AZ State University study that says there are fewer crashes overall at single-lane roundabouts but a 60% increase in overall crash rates at two-lane roundabouts although the severity of the crashes are less](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-traffic/2017/07/12/roundabouts-traffic-circle-arizona-roads-helpful-or-horrible/469688001/)

Roundabouts are less predictable. Lower predictability causes more crashes. 

Diverging Diamond intersections have far less data backing them up. The thought is that they reduce opposing drivers crossing traffic lanes and therefore reduce crash severity but I challenge that. They make every car cross an opposing lane and they are far less predictable than a regular four-way controlled intersection. I would imagine they cost a great deal more to build and maintain as well.

In the case of 26 and I-90 this is an especially convoluted design that I imagine gave some poor civil engineer a headache. It's like a serpentine. It's awful. I hope this isn't the final iteration and that construction is ongoing.

In my world I do a lot of on-the-spot risk vs. benefit calculations. I have to quickly decide if the risk of doing something is worth the potential benefits of doing that something vs not doing that something or doing something else with its own Risk/Benefit calculation. It's complex. In the case of this intersection my gut and my professional experience tells me that the risk and the cost was not worth the benefits sought by the DOT and I wish they had just left it simple.",t2_92hzhzun,CaptainsYacht,0,1630555065.0,0,t1_hb9x5sp,hb9x5sp,True,CaptainsYacht,t3_pg7cb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/pg7cb7/so_the_intersection_of_hwy_26_and_i90/,So the intersection of Hwy 26 and I-90...,/r/Janesville/comments/pg7cb7/so_the_intersection_of_hwy_26_and_i90/hb9x5sp/,1,r/Janesville,0,1

"Um... we're planning on going there today as a matter of fact. Usually I just google ""Movies Janesville"" or ""Movies Beloit"" or ""Movies Sun Prairie"" as those are the three theaters we frequent.

We go to Sunny P for the big ones my son really wants to see. The new Star Wars flicks? Sunny P. Incredibles 2? Sunny P. We were last in Janesville for Jungle Cruise and will be going there for Free Guy today.

I know the name of the theater in Sun Prairie because you have to specify it. I know it's the ""Marcus Palace Theater"" because of their branding before and after shows and inside the building.

I really don't pay attention to the branding of the Janesville theater because I don't need to put much mental energy into it. It's the local theater in Janesville and we go because it is local, close, and comfortable enough. The fact is that I would rather support a more local small business in any case... but the theater in SP is spectacular and is worth the (huge) expense for the bigger flicks.

I like the Janesville theater. I want it to stay open so I support it with my ticket and concession dollars.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"VAT taxes. Every time I see this, I immediately think of VAT taxes.

Making these types of specialty items that don’t really benefit from volume or scaling are the types of jobs that only marginally make more money being produced in Mexico. 

Every other first world country has a vat and most third world. 166 out of 199 UN recognized countries do. 

When one country has a VAT and one does not, and you sell to yourself, you get the option of screwing around with money and taxes. This is why businesses that really don’t save any money going to another country still go to another country, it makes things easier to hide corporate profits so that they can remain untaxed So that they can be used to leverage more companies and grow bigger while transferring their profits to some holding company via loans. 

The only way to really fix this in the US is to introduce a VAT. Because it’s so easy to leave the US for relatively no penalty any other major reforms like increasing the power of worker cooperatives like Europe does will never gain any traction.

"Kip M. Lecher has been using the appeal of an ice cream shop to groom and molest his teenage male employees. People have been experiencing this since the 1980’s. The first person I heard of coming forward was in 1994 - 2 male employees admitted to the cops that they were molested by Kip. The police said nothing could be done because “no anal” was involved, which was not true for the laws of 1994. 
In 2003, 8 male employees came forward. Kip was charged for one account of 2nd degree sexual assault - there was never a trial because he plead GUILTY. He had a GREAT plea deal - 4 months Rock County Jail WITH HUBER  - he literally was allowed to leave jail to go work and serve minors at Frostie Freeze. He then had 5 years probation where he could not hire minors - which all ended in 2009. 
There’s no way this man should be allowed to own this business. He used income from frostie freeze to buy boys things such as shoes, clothes, etc. My family member was a victim of him in the 90’s, from the ages of 13-15. Kip set up a bank account for my uncle where he deposited all of his checks, but gave my uncle cash whenever he wanted. 
He crossed state lines with him to IL, countless times and sexually assaulted him there - which is a federal crime. 
He would purposely keep my uncle and only my uncle to close the store with him, where he managed to moleste him inside FF. He would then invite him over to his house and get him drunk to molest him some more.

If anyone thinks he did enough “time” then I feel sorry for the way your brain works. It is known of AT LEAST 10 boys come forward, and he had to do a pathetic 4 months in jail where he was allowed to leave for 12 hours a day. 
The whole thing seems fishy to me and this man does not deserve to walk this earth",t2_bj2b3kjx,AndersonKM08,0,1618383827.0,0,t1_gugo14p,gugo14p,True,KillerKitten995,t3_mbtraa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/mbtraa/anyone_else_like_frostie_freeze/,Anyone else like Frostie Freeze?,/r/Janesville/comments/mbtraa/anyone_else_like_frostie_freeze/gugo14p/,1,r/Janesville,0,1

I would 100% agree that he should’ve served more time. But that doesn’t mean that we should not let somebody who served time rejoin society if they rehabilitate. Because if we’re not gonna let them do that than anybody who does anything against society just needs to have capital punishment for every crime.

"I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, pedo, ick. 

On the other hand he did his 'time', is presumably living up to the terms of his conviction and does not employ minors, and is on the sexual offender list for life which also carries some hefty inconveniences. He was convicted 18 years ago. His sentence was 5 years, and he met that requirement, and he's been on the list and has had to abide by those rules which include increased monitoring without incident. It's very very hard to ever be a business owner without ever having contact with kids. It's hard to find a job with his violation. He can't even really go to church without being around kids, he can't go to a doctor appointment these days without being within range of a pediatrician sharing the same clinic. 

I am not saying we need to be lenient on these people in any way shape or form. But making them wards of the state for life is not going to help anyone either. There is a difference between someone who coerces a 15 yr old kid into sex and someone who snatches children off the streets. I'm not saying you should ever trust him supervising a child, just like he's barred from doing, but his history is far removed from an act of violence as well. 

So let the public be aware, monitor him, let him live his life with the restrictions laid out. By that reckoning I can't really support what these people are doing. It's hard for people to change and learn from their mistakes, but punishing those who do learn as well as those who don't makes it oh so more likely that they just say ""fuck it, I'll end up back in there anyway"" and end up with a bigger mess on society's hands in the long run.",t2_39cm9,criscokkat,0,1616617208.0,0,t1_gs39swm,gs39swm,False,KillerKitten995,t3_mbtraa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/mbtraa/anyone_else_like_frostie_freeze/,Anyone else like Frostie Freeze?,/r/Janesville/comments/mbtraa/anyone_else_like_frostie_freeze/gs39swm/,5,r/Janesville,0,5

"It's fine. Close enough to Madison that a run to Dotty's for a burger isn't completely ridiculous, but far enough to not to be considered a suburb. It's often touted as being equidistant to both MAD and RFD, and an hour(ish) from MKE, but honestly there's zero reason to ever go to Rockford.   


I'd say the biggest issue with Janesville is that, because we had GM for so long, we never really tried too hard to attract any kind of economy or tourism. We didn't have to 'work for it' because GM provided lots and lots of cash.   


So, while other communities, (e.g. Beloit) have worked hard to create 'destination' downtown areas, to make the city attractive to investment, we didn't. And the efforts now to 'revitalize' the downtown just seem kind of too little too late.   


They're trying to do a lot of the things everyone else does to be attract companies (now), with bike lanes, etc. but many natives just find them annoying; don't assume the bike lane will be safe for, you know, biking.   


The sign on the highway says City of Parks, and half a century ago, yeah, we were probably above average with park density and quality. Again, this is one of those things where we coasted and other cities have passed us to provide better public spaces. Parks are still good though, if most of them are really just open fields with a little playground equipment. But most people are within a couple blocks at most from one. From my house, there's a neighborhood one a block away, a major one (Palmer) about 3 blocks away, and 2 other neighborhood parks within 5 blocks. So, accessible.   


Most neighborhoods have sidewalks on at least one side. The city tried mandating 100% coverage a few years ago, but a couple neighborhoods are still grandfathered in to old 'no sidewalks' agreements. I think the city is over 90% now, though.   


The Strip isn't unique at all, most cities have something like it, it's the main retail corridor that is popular with teens for cruising. Totally avoidable. But it is very popular with the monster truck crown (many of which are actually from Milton, a few miles up the road).  


In general, I'd say that Janesville is like, oh, the East Towne neighborhood of Madison. Lots of chain restaurants, a few independents that never seem to get past the 'barely getting by' phase, some nice neighborhoods, some shitty ones, nothing to really 'do', but also generally safe enough. An unremarkable but good microbrewery, a couple food trucks, one 'foodie' joint, etc. 

Beloit is 15 minutes away and has some nice restaurants downtown to hit. Not sure I'd recommend living there, though, but that's probably just because I'm biased (long standing Janesville/Beloit rivalry. Also a Craig/Parker/Milton rivalry you should be aware of).   


There are lots of unskilled labor jobs, mostly in the mid-teen hourly range ($12-$18 seems common). No real high tech opportunities to speak of, but the commute to MAD/RFD is about a podcast each way. Not the worst. Traffic on 90 *suuuuucks*, but is a *little* better with 3 lanes now.  


The school system was decent, I haven't had kids in it for a minute, so I'm not sure if that's changed. There's a 2 year UW campus here (now part of UW Whitewater), but 'campus' is pretty generous. There's no student life, it's a couple buildings and a parking lot. It's almost outside the city, deep in a residential sprawl on the far south/west side.  


There's maybe been a recent uptick in 'car shopping' (kids on bikes checking car doors and grabbing what they find in unlocked cars), but I really don't think you'll find a city that doesn't have that, and honestly the 'uptick' is just probably just because everyone has a Ring now, and shares the videos.   


Otherwise, pretty safe. No real gang activity or anything like that. A few recent robberies, but they were from out of town and caught quickly.   


Historically, while there's always been a mix, the East side is a little wealthier than the South or West sides (""East"" tends to cover North, as well). Roatamer Road, Withering Hills, Indian Reservation are the 'good' neighborhoods. They've been trying for decades to get the West and South corridors to grow, with almost no success.   


That said, property prices in the south and west are much lower, and there are basic services, though those are drying up pretty quickly: the South corridor is a food desert after losing its Piggly Wiggly, the West still has a nice Sentry. The East side isn't great (currently), but that may be changing soon, with rumors of a 'super Quick Trip' going into a recently closed grocery location (former Sentry on Milwaukee St.) The main grocery stores are all concentrated in the North, however, just off the Strip, with a Woodman's and Festival within a stone's throw of each other. Target and Walmart/Sams also are on that same central corridor, as is Schnucks, though it's at the other end and more central than the other North/East options.  


Culturally not super diverse, less so than surrounding communities (Beloit, Madison, Milwaukee, Rockford, Kenosha are *all* significantly more diverse than Janesville, other smaller towns like Milton, Evansville, Edgerton, Clinton, etc. all less so or about the same).   


Politically, used to be a very blue town due to a strong union presence. After GM left, it took a hard right turn. I'd call it purple now. I wouldn't wear a MAGA hat *or* a Bernie Bro shirt to most  bars around town, but you're not going to get punched for it, either (and honestly, that's just America right now).

Police officials in Janesville tell 27 News the body found Sunday was an adult who was badly-decomposed.

Police say they have not determined how the person died or if there is any foul play involved.

Police are working with the medical examiner to determine the identity and cause of death.

""We have a feeling we may know who the person is, based on prior reports of missing people,"" said Sgt. Dean Sukus. ""But we can't make that determination until the medical examiner's office and the medical examiner have done an autopsy.""

The autopsy should be completed in two to three days.

"I’m never active of Reddit but this was important to me to address. 

Janesville is very lowkey racist. They hide it amazingly well. A lot of them still look down on Beloit, due to a history of Beloit having a larger population of minorities. I used to work in Janesville, whenever I said I lived in Beloit there was always things people had to say. The high school is nasty, oh it’s a really poor area, or they ask about where I live. I say my street name and people immediately fall back like oh, you live in the ghetto! I grew up in a much worse off area than Beloit in Texas and people act like Beloit is Milwaukee in Janesville. Worse when you encounter people from Milton and Edgerton. 

It’s racism mixed heavily with classism, but again, it’s lowkey and I think a lot of it is just learned behavior. It’s no worse than any suburban area. I think it’s an issue it should be addressed more and more, but definitely a warning if you’re cautious about it.",t2_3ebk6t0r,nothingtosee99024,0,1593047981.0,0,t1_fvwtquo,fvwtquo,True,[deleted],t3_hb0odp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/hb0odp/minorities_of_janesville_do_you_feel_safe_in_this/,"Minorities of Janesville, do you feel safe in this city?",/r/Janesville/comments/hb0odp/minorities_of_janesville_do_you_feel_safe_in_this/fvwtquo/,5,r/Janesville,0,5

"I'm native American and white, but look like the minority of your choice depending on how I decide to dress or how tan I am. I most often get mistaken for Mexican unless people are local and know what a native dude looks like.

I've lived in Beloit as a child and Janesville as teen and adult. I've never experienced any in your face racism. Just the usual questions around what race I am since Janesville is predominantly white.  Something like 95% last I remember. I don't give two shits about that and enjoy talking about it as well, but I know it bugs some people. Talking about ethnicity is big in the midwest. This includes between white folk as we have heavy German and Scandinavian ancestry here. Hmong are more up north though so asians are non existent beyond Beloit College really.

It's white suburbia though. No KKK shit you'll see up front or even behind closed doors 99.9% of the time. You will see people talk shit about black people here and there, and there is a bit of light old boys not really racist but don't know any better speech/mannerisms lingering though. Part of that is because most of the crime happens in the 'ghettos' which is predominantly where the black people live. That culture also ends up at the high schools as well, so you'll often hear it as the ghetto black clique vs everyone else. Plenty of white trash doing the same stuff though so it's mostly poverty/culture related. The fourth ward is where you want to stay clear of personally. I haven't heard or had a good land lord down there though through anyone I know.

Since you work in Beloit, there's good spots east and south of GM, the apartments on Racine, or houses near Edison with easy access to Beloit.

"Depends what you're looking for and where you commute to for work (if you work in town, anywhere can be great, depending on what you like!). For convenience, the North side is better because the shopping is there and the freeway entrances and Madison commuters tend to be on that side. Given the food delivery (EatStreet is the best) and grocery options (Instacart and individual stores, too) that didn't exist before, you could live anywhere and do grocery pick up or delivery and not feel as inconvenienced by going to the North side to shop.

If you work closer to Rockford, the South Side would be more appealing but it's a food desert.

People will say to avoid Downtown or the Fourth Ward or Look West (closer to the hospital) neighborhoods, but that's also where the diversity is, so it's more a question of vetting landlords to make sure you don't have a slumlord. We bought our house downtown on the library side of the river and I am regularly over by St. Patrick's (the 4th Ward) and I don't feel unsafe, but closer to 5 points (the gas station that doesn't sell gas anymore...you will see it if you look on that side of 4th Ward) there are more absentee landlords and it's not really all that convenient anyway. 

If you look up apartments online most will be near the freeway or North side, but the places with history and charm are downtown on both sides of the river and I think they do sign-in-the-yard more than internet advertising.

If you're a cat person, many places require soft paws or declawing or did when we last rented so Janesville is in the stone age on cat abuse, but there are landlords not like that. Park City Apartments near Marshall Middle School had an owner who didn't require declawing when we lived there.

"I am white, but worked in diversity programs and have a few observations that might get you started. I hope some of this is helpful.

To start, the KKK thing was a Geraldo thing, many years ago, and the counter-protest was significant and drowned it out. Your co-worker probably hasn't lived in Janesville. If you Google Geraldo and Janesville you might get an idea of what happened, but that is history.

The divide between rich and poor is significant and the school district is not doing a great job in terms of diversity and really isn't trying hard to accept this but there is a great diversity council ( https://www.datrockco.org/) and progress is happening. The police chief has an open dialogue with Black and Latinx residents and the police force is not militarized. 

The crime is mostly people opening unlocked cars and taking things. It's equal opportunity.  There are areas with what I call transaction-based crime where people who have a grievance regarding quality of items purchased may resort to self-help. There are gang connections. However, there were more (reported?) race-based incidents at UW-Whitewater than generally seen in Janesville, for a gauge. 

I would reach out to the Diversity Action Team for more specifics  if you don't get a good answer here.",t2_g2fjj,Carrisford,0,1592431716.0,0,t1_fv64pw4,fv64pw4,True,[deleted],t3_hb0odp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/hb0odp/minorities_of_janesville_do_you_feel_safe_in_this/,"Minorities of Janesville, do you feel safe in this city?",/r/Janesville/comments/hb0odp/minorities_of_janesville_do_you_feel_safe_in_this/fv64pw4/,8,r/Janesville,0,8

>I grew up in Janesville. Moved to the city in 3rd grade and left after my sophomore year (my parents still lived in the city until last year so I frequented it a lot). I lived there through the closing of GM. I think that Janesville is kinda shitty. I remember when people would shit on Beloit for being almost dead until Ms. Hendricks stepped in. But Janesville is pretty much dying. Everything is on the north side of town going towards Milton. At this rate Milton and the northside of Janesville might as well become their own town. They are making a soild attempt at making downtown happen again but without the backing of say someone who is the second richest female self made billionaire, its pretty hard. There is nothing to do in the city. I know a majority of the people I went to high school with left as soon as they could and haven't looked back. They can't even be bothered to put another Starbucks somewhere else in town.

"There is a reason they call it “Chainsville.”  That’s most of what there is to eat. If you’re looking for something local, I’d suggest Italian House, Mac’s Pizza Shack (when looking for pizza), or Milwaukee Grill.  Gray Brewing Co. and Rock County Brewing Co. are decent for craft beer.  I know there are a few more restaurants, but you’ll have to explore.

If you want to get out for some exercise, there are tons of parks and bike trails in Janesville, including my personal favorite, the Glacial River Trail that spans between here and Fort Atkinson. 

For entertainment, my wife and I usually drive up to Madison. There’s just more up there, and it isn’t a terrible drive. It’ll be much better when they finish construction on I-90 in 30 years.  Check out State Street, Williamson Street, Hilldale Mall, or many of the craft breweries. Our favorite restaurants are Waypoint Public House, The Great Dane, Weary Traveler, Glass Nickel Pizza, Old Fashioned, and Lucille’s just to name a few (there are so many).

"Again, no one is suggesting they not pay rent. I feel like I shouldn’t have to repeat that, but since you clearly are having a hard time, I should probably say it one more time, NO ONE IS SUGGESTING THEY NOT PAY RENT! 

From doing some research (I’m not sure if you’re familiar with the concept as you seem quite practiced in throwing your opinions into matters you admittedly know very little about), it actually appears as though throughout their time in the location, the restaurant owners invested a lot of time and money improving the very old space to make it a functioning restaurant. With all the improvements the restaurant owners did, the building owner wants to cash in on the functioning restaurant space at the expense of the family business that did all the improvements. 
Now I can’t speak on the interpersonal relationship between the restaurant and the building owner, but I’m gonna do that crazy thing where I use my actual knowledge of the situation and the people involved to say that the family who runs the restaurant is reported by just about everyone who knows them as being incredibly good, honest people, which makes me feel it is unlikely that they are horrible tenants, and their restaurant is always busy, so it would surprise me if they were not paying their rent. Additionally, they stated that they considered raising the prices of their menu items in order to make up for the increase in rent, but decided against it because they didn’t think the increase in prices was fair to their loyal customers. 

I have no idea what they require for a restaurant space, and I assume they will eventually find a new location, because as you said, they make good food and their customers will follow them wherever they go, but they will be closed for some time while they figure it out, and there is no guarantee they will remain in town. 

You’re missing the point of the outrage and dismay in your knee jerk reaction to blindly support capitalism over basic human values.

">  what we are suggesting is that it’s shitty for the building owner to raise their rent to an amount the business can no longer afford,

Why should the owner leave money on the table? Obviously he thinks the spot is worth more now than it was five years ago. 

> what we’re talking about is human decency, and responsibility for the community being beat out by greed.

Yeah he should just let them have the spot for free. Then Burnie Sanders could come and cook there too and they could just give away the food for free. 

I'm suggesting here something doesn't add up with this story. 

If he raised the rates a fair amount shut up and pay it. That's the cost of doing business in the hippest area of the city. 

If he skyrocketed it in an attempt to push them out, then they must be evoking the ire of the landlord somehow, because no property owner is going to want to push out a good tenant that pays their rent on time and doesn't cause problems. That's the exact thing you are looking for in a renter. 

And even if the guy is being unreasonable and is trying to push them out to maybe give the sweet spot to one of his friends - just get another spot.

"A few of us went to high school together and have been playing together in various projects for awhile, our 1st guitar player met our bassist at college and I met our 3rd guitar player at a show in chicago. I can’t speak on everyone elses favorite subgenre’s but mine is probably metalcore or grindcore. We take a lot of influence from bands like Daughters (early stuff), Vein, Norma Jean, Sanction, Shattered Realm, SeeYouSpaceCowboy, Tower of Rome, From A Second Story Window, stuff like that. I would best describe our sound as metallic hardcore with some grind and post hardcore elements as well. As far as inspiration goes, this band probably wouldn’t exist without bands like Suicide Silence, SeeYouSpaceCowboy, Of Mice & Men, Bring Me The Horizon, Jesus Piece or Full of Hell. All of those bands and their vocalists kinda made me want to sing in a metal band for the rest of my life.

"I'm 29 and grew up in Rock County (Beloit and Janesville both), but I've always been a homebody so this information may be of limited value, but I'll try. 

I suppose it depends on what you like. For example, are you much of a sports fan? Depending on how far you are willing to go, there are several options within two hours or less: the [Beloit Snappers](https://www.milb.com/beloit) Class A baseball team, [Rockford IL](http://www.icehogs.com/home/) and [Milwaukee](http://www.milwaukeeadmirals.com/) each have ice hockey teams in the second tier league, [MKE also has the Wave indoor soccer team](https://www.milwaukeewave.com/), the /r/Brewers , and the /r/MkeBucks . Madison has /r/ForwardMadisonFC . If you look past professional, there's the [Madison Mallards](https://northwoodsleague.com/madison-mallards/), and the various UW sports, as well as UW Whitewater is close by and they are usually a good Division III school.

I don't go out to bars much, but my favorite bar when I do go out in Janesville is [The Looking Glass](https://www.theglassdowntown.com/). They usually have a good selection of micro brews on tap. The Italian House is an all right restaurant. Sam's Italian Restaurant makes amazing pizza, though their customer service is horrendous (if their pizza wasn't so damn good, I'd never give them money). Definitely carry out rather than dine in.

Janesville has a decent transit system (decent for such a small city) if you don't want to/can't drive or want to cut down on driving, including the [BJE--Beloit-Janesville Express](http://www.ci.janesville.wi.us/government/departments-divisions/neighborhood-and-community-services/bus-transit-jts/beloit-janesville-express-bje)--route, a joint JTS-BTS route that goes between Janesville and Beloit. The library, [Hedberg Public Library](https://hedbergpubliclibrary.org/), is a good sized library, has lots of programs throughout the year, and is connected to the other six public libraries in Rock County and those in Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha counties (disclaimer: I used to work at two other Rock Co. libraries, though never at Hedberg, so I am a biased librarian).

As ""Wisconsin's Park Place"", there's a shitload of public parks across Janesville. I guess [there is stuff](http://www.ci.janesville.wi.us/government/departments-divisions/public-works/parks-division/park-locations-and-amenities) to do at many of them, again with many sports-related things. There's a [local hobby and games store](http://www.kryptonitekollectibles.net/). In high school, I used to play tabletop strategy games there. I can't say what there is there now for gaming groups, but such stores always have a community of card/board/tabletop games. The [Janesville Performing Arts Center, JPAC](https://www.janesvillepac.org/jpac/), exists for local theater, as do the two high schools. [Gray Brewing Co](http://www.graybrewing.com/). and [Rock County Brewing Co](https://www.rockcounty.beer/). are two area breweries that have some good beers (many bars and restaurants carry their beers, of course, as well as grocery/liquor stores).

Well, that's enough hyperlinks for one post. I hope something here is of interest to you. Being that JVL is my home town and I am a librarian (i.e. knowing things and finding things are kinda what I am paid to do), I will try to answer any followups you have.",t2_ixfiy,KanzlerAndreas,0,1559197755.0,0,t1_epfl45q,epfl45q,True,TresPollos,t3_buphrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/buphrj/starting_my_career_in_janesville_and_will_be_here/,Starting my career in Janesville and will be here a year and need advice on the area,/r/Janesville/comments/buphrj/starting_my_career_in_janesville_and_will_be_here/epfl45q/,12,r/Janesville,0,12

"It's always dangerous to assume that City leadership knows what they're doing, but in this particular case the water feature isn't without merit.  Yes, you're going to have some downtime with it out of season, but the same goes for a lot of things in Wisconsin.  Also, most things that pull people downtown happen in the summer (or at least non-winter) months anyways.  The whole town square project is really about driving more people downtown during those peak months anyways, so anything that acts as an extra destination/attraction/focal point in the long run is a benefit.

"I'm in my late 20s and might not have interests most people in their 20s-30s share, but here's my $0.02:

The Beloit Snappers are in nearby Beloit (like 15 miles south of Janesville, on the stateline), a Class A affiliate of the Oakland A's (originally founded as the Brewers' Class A team, as the Beloit Brewers), are fun if you like baseball. Other nearby sports include: Brewers, Bucks, Admirals (2nd tier hockey) and Wave (indoor soccer) all in Milwaukee (maybe an hour to hour and a half travel time), and Forward Madison FC (outdoor soccer) starting in Madison later this year.

I second what someone already said about Jim's Pizza being great, though if you're on the north side, Sam's might be better, location-wise. Their customer service has always been terrible, but damn, I love their pizza (do carryout when possible).

The seven libraries in Rock County are pretty awesome, with lots of reoccurring and one or two time only programs and events, in addition to some 400-500k or so items available for checkout when all seven libraries are counted together, and even more now that the county system has joined a consortium with two other systems *shameless plug, having worked at 2 of the county's libraries and am clearly not biased*.

"I'll copy my comment from someone asking for date ideas previously. I hope you enjoy the area, I'm a fan myself.

""Food:

Jim's Pizza - inside seating, greasy, best rated pizza in town.

Asian Bistro - Currently best rated overall. Expensive side. Awesome thai iced tea. Pan-asian.

Fun:

Mid City minigolf - Just came back after a hiatus. Enjoyable weather. Can see how they handle frustration.

Rockport Pool/Lion's Beach - If you want to enjoy swimming or kayak a little.

Rotary Garden - Right by Lion's beach. Good for a short walk and enjoy horticulture.

Lustig Park - Disc golf if you're the geeky/stoner type that wants to enjoy outdoors.

People dog on movies but nothing wrong with one either. Just make sure you have coffee or a short snack after to discuss."" 

To add, movies are $5 Tuesday movies to boot. Not sure where you're coming in from but it's a common theme lately I've noticed. If you're looking for more active stuff, your best bet is just to plan a day trip to Madison or Milwaukee for more urban entertainment. Nature is everywhere though.

"Well that's just not true at all.

The Janesville-Beloit area is currently rated #8 for the hottest housing market in the entirety of the US. This shows a patented rebound both due to increased ability for the surrounding market to take part of what would've been GM's iron hold with high paying wages. It's the classic, more jobs, shittier wages. But that ends up picking up the market to a large degree. And let's face it. $13-17/hr isn't chump change when minimum wage is still $7.25 in an At-Will and now Union busting state.

https://www.realtor.com/research/reports/hottest-markets/

Not only that but Beloit getting their shit together and renovating much of their downtown and surrounding areas is benefiting the Janesville area as well.

Now if only Rockford could get it's shit together and not be the 16th worst city in the US.

"I've lived here for 5 years now, moved here from else where in the Midwest. I've grown to love this town, warts and all. 

That said, your description is spot on.

There isn't much to do in town besides drink and walk around. There's a pile of great bars and some beautiful trails, but what if you're not into that? Anything else interesting takes you out of town. The winter is the worst because then you can't even walk around much.

The people in this town can be welcoming, but over all very isolated. If you're not ""in"" with their group, you're ignored. The mom groups are uninteresting. There's no clubs or group that I know of that don't revolve around drinking or outdoor activities. The people around here tend to be a little racist, too.

But I do love the beauty of this town. The downtown area is very charming. Housing prices are relatively cheap (even though they're rising) and the neighborhoods are pretty safe. The schools are decent, and the staff seem to care about their kids.

"Food: 

Jim's Pizza - inside seating, greasy, best rated pizza in town. 

Asian Bistro - Currently best rated overall. Expensive side. Awesome thai iced tea. Pan-asian.

Fun: 

Mid City minigolf - Just came back after a hiatus. Enjoyable weather. Can see how they handle frustration.

Rockport Pool/Lion's Beach - If you want to enjoy swimming or kayak a little.

Rotary Garden - Right by Lion's beach. Good for a short walk and enjoy horticulture.

Lustig Park - Disc golf if you're the geeky/stoner type that wants to enjoy outdoors.

People dog on movies but nothing wrong with one either.

"Seconding Lion's Beach. The water is quite warm after the hot week. If you're a good swimmer and have a floaty or tube. There's actually a sand bar you can swim too between the Beach and Rotary Gardens where the older adults can hang out. It's a decent swim though so take flotation. I've literally had to save my friend from drowning when he tried to follow me out to it and only made it half way. There are -no- lifeguards on duty. There's usually people playing Volleyball at the main beach as well.

Rotary Gardens right nearby is pretty enough for a quick stroll and looking at flowers/fauna. Plenty of biking/walking on the ice age trail.

If you're into sports, the [Janesville Jets](http://www.janesvillejets.com/) get a pretty decent turnout during season. Plenty of people down at Dawson Field for baseball/softball leagues. Lustig and the newer Riverside Park disc golf courses if you're more relaxed. BlackHawk Golf course for regular golf. Minigolf/driving range at MidCity next to the airport.

The Bar Scene downtown is usually active every night if you're a lush but plenty of other good bars with cheap drinks.

Music scene is [The Back Bar](http://www.thebackbar.com/). Cheap tickets and good bands, almost exclusively rock though if it's not your thing.

"If you don't mind larger apartment complexes there is a set of decent ones near the interstate that have gotten fairly popular lately with an average rent size.

http://woodsviewapartmentliving.com/

There are houses you can find on craigslist for pretty cheap depending on the area. You can find places like a 1 bedroom house for $500 if you're lucky but generally rent is $600~ range.

The spots to 'avoid' would be the 4th ward and Village Green apartments but as others have said, they aren't exactly terrible places to live compared to other 'bad' spots in cities. They're basically white surburbia's version of the small time ghetto. Beloit is much worse by comparison.",t2_9ldk5,blanketswithsmallpox,0,1485896394.0,0,t1_dd5rzra,dd5rzra,True,slapzgiving,t3_5r9lti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/5r9lti/possible_move_to_janesville/,Possible move to Janesville,/r/Janesville/comments/5r9lti/possible_move_to_janesville/dd5rzra/,3,r/Janesville,0,3
"Regarding places to live, the south and west sides are going to be more adorable, with some nice homes, but some of your neighbors may not be so nice, and your car is more likely to get broken into.

Only area I'd avoid is 5 points, but like the other poster said, it's not really that bad.

"Happy cake day.  Depending on how competitive you are at volleyball, Sneakers & Bogeys are your 2 options in the city.  I play at Bogeys (the old Watering Hole) it's a lot more relaxed and close-knit teams.  Sneakers is super competitive and they have a time limit on their games.

There's not many places to avoid.  A lot of people will say Village Green & 4th Ward would be those places, but there's been a lot of construction and upkeep in recent years of those places and I think they're both pretty viable options at this point.  

I actually think Village Green is a pretty good place to live as far as apartment living (that's what I've been told) since the renovation, and it's in walking distance of a liquor store & East Point Sports Pub which has great food.  They're also attached to a gas station & The Wedge (one of the more popular breakfast spots).",t2_83n4y,Brooshie,0,1485885409.0,0,t1_dd5hs0b,dd5hs0b,True,slapzgiving,t3_5r9lti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/5r9lti/possible_move_to_janesville/,Possible move to Janesville,/r/Janesville/comments/5r9lti/possible_move_to_janesville/dd5hs0b/,3,r/Janesville,0,3

It is and has been my opinion for quite some time that this name that was being yelled could have been something entirely different than Mary. Someone close to me has a girlfriend who's name is Melissa, but he calls her ""Meli"". I have imagined someone a distance away, yelling ""Meli"" it could easily be heard or interpreted as ""Mary."" Also, noting that the subject who was yelling appeared to be intoxicated which could have affected his speech as well. The report of the name Mary, could very well be off or it could have been correct, yet short for something else.

"Thanks Jazjustice!!! I have been looking for where I saw that he had cigarette butts in his pocket! I assume filters means butts. 

Anyway, you can see a really blurry picture of the isotope results in one of the most recent articles. I interpret; JCD most likely grew up in WI, MN or MI or the other darkest red areas in picture. So JCD could have grew up in other areas such as ND, SD, IA, IL, IN, PA...maybe even in the southwest.

I think the isotope origin results are difficult to describe definitively similar when defining soil types and attempting pinpoint a locality as opposed to a region.

"I think there are two or three of us from Wisconsin that are interested in attending metalfest with you and JCD’s posters and maybe a cardboard cutout. I have been collecting some silver plated forks and was thinking about finding someone to make a bunch of the stainless steel fork pendants like JCD had. Maybe people would buy them to support the search for JCD? Maybe a billboard in Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Chicago would be a good idea? And, if you need to pay for a vendor table or booth at metalfest that would help.

It is great of you to offer all this for JCD. I got to ask you about doing one more thing, maybe? You are so eloquent, knowledgeable and insightful, I am not sucking up! All true. I wonder what you think about writing a paragraph about JCD to some dark metal media like here; http://www.deathmetal.org/about/
Or maybe here;

"Jazjustice, you mentioned JCD was found near a tree stand. I wonder if you are familiar with that area; the creek, the homes, the roads and Carver-Roehl Park. Are you familiar with the kind of activities that occur in that area and would you normally see someone walking down Turtle Creek? Or walking from the park to the bridge on South Carvers Rock Road?

I think you bring up a good point about the transient nature of employment in the Janesville area and even if there were layoffs or if factory workers were transferred to other states. Maybe workers were offered jobs at other plants say in Michigan or west or south of Wisconsin? Maybe JCD was from a family that had to move to another state when he was younger and when he saw a chance to see some of his favorite bands at metalfest he made the trip because he was familiar with the area?

"Thanks Jazjustice! It sounds like the darker metal heads in the 80s and 90s got their information from the larger cities where the metal scene was happening at a larger scale. I wonder if you remember how you heard about Metalfest, how did you follow the metal scene? On the radio? Magazines or other subscriptions?

Maybe JCD was from a big city, maybe not. But maybe if we follow your great idea and attend shows in the big cities our search will be more effective and fun! And maybe when we find JCD we can attend shows in his honor!",t2_ky7du,zagataagan,0,1426223455.0,0,t1_cpdedw1,cpdedw1,False,[deleted],t3_2yjd08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Janesville/comments/2yjd08/the_unidentified_john_clinton_doe_can_you_offer/,The Unidentified John 'Clinton' Doe; Can you offer any new information about this cold case?,/r/Janesville/comments/2yjd08/the_unidentified_john_clinton_doe_can_you_offer/cpdedw1/,2,r/Janesville,0,2
