"Psychologist here working at a self-pay practice. The results are what they are, and I get paid the same amount regardless. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI don‚Äôt even make a recommendation as to eligibility; I just provide a report with the results and interpretation.   Most of not all of my private pay colleagues do the same. There truly isn‚Äôt a way to ‚Äúfake‚Äù results unless the clinician is giving the child the answers or providing credit for incorrect answers intentionally. And if that‚Äôs the case, that will come to light real fast when the child can‚Äôt perform in real life commensurate with their test results and then that clinician‚Äôs license will be on the line. It‚Äôs just not worth it.  

The only thing that comes close to what you‚Äôre describing is that sometimes a parent will bring a child in who has been tested multiple times. Ethically, this presents a challenge for me, because it‚Äôs not best practice to ‚Äútest shop‚Äù this way. However, I will often perform another assessment because Sarasota county requires that test scores come from the same administration- in other words, if a child has already demonstrated that they can perform in the gifted range in reading, but math was lower due to issues with time (just for example), the county requires another administration of a reading assessment; they will not accept the previous score.  On a related note, I practiced for many years in another state and I do not agree with Florida‚Äôs gifted process as a whole, particularly requiring both reading and mathematics to be in the gifted range; I believe children can demonstrate specific skills and still be considered gifted in one area. But I digress.

Contact local restaurants and ask them if they can put some of your art up for free.  If the art is well received people will ask the owner about them, give them a bunch of cards.  

Wear your art,  put your art on some shirts, beach towels and stuff and give them to you and your friends to wear.  Hopefully this will lead to people asking where you got it.

"I see some other opinion posts so I just have to drop this in here:

I loved PV. I went 2-12 and there were times when I felt like switching out around middle school, but I'm so glad I didn't. I don't believe I could have gone anywhere else that could have equipped me better for life after graduation. I had my own group of down to earth friends and it was just incredibly supportive and empowering. Because I went to PV and saw my peers succeed and aim high, I realized I could too. That's the only reason I applied out of state. In the end, I was accepted and went to a highly ranked college almost fully funded. I was also able to travel and study internationally on scholarships and do a number of really incredible internships. I don't come from a wealthy background, but I found an access point into that kind of a world through PV. It isn't for everyone, but it was a perfect fit for me.

"i think the testing depends on the grade afaik. but a word of warning: many, many kids come out of that school with anxiety (the diagnosable kind). i did, most people i knew did. the atmosphere there is so competitive that its suffocating at times. if your student has a good support system they should be fine, for the most part.

its also changed significantly, especially with regards to the non stem programs. theres not much funding for them, so if your kid is interested in things other than science or math, consider that. its not quite the experience you hear about from alums that graduated under previous principals. not that anything is wrong with the current one, theres just less variety.

also, not sure about the class ranking thing someone else said, but i was there for 10 years and never heard of there ever being rankings. the competition and feeling like failure isnt an option is definitely there, but i personally think a lot of it was from the teachers and admin, not students. every year there were assemblies where they‚Äôd shove the ‚Äú212 philosophy‚Äù down our throats and it got really old after a while. 

as far as college chances, it should not hurt you to go there. the whole ‚Äúcolleges dont like accepting too many pine view kids‚Äù thing is a rumor. at least thats what the college reps that came to campus always said. 50 kids from my class of 200 went to UF (the school that everyone says is super selective about PV applicants) if that tells you anything. 

i dont regret going there, but sometimes i do wonder what my life would be like had i not. i ended up at my dream college, but i have a terrible fear of failure that manifests in ways that limit my exploration academically.  but it was a unique experience that i did enjoy for the most part. having so many APs was nice, as it got me out of undergrad in three years, but i would have liked to see a more multidisciplinary approach to what was taught and more options in general. what was nice, though, is that no one ever got made fun of for being a nerd, or being ‚Äútoo smart‚Äù.

"Having worked for a major scholarship provider in town for over a decade, and having worked closely with every high school in SRQ and surrounding counties, I would caution against the assumption that Pineview is superior to other options. It's good for some kids, but bad for others. And it both helps and hurts their chances of admission to some colleges.

The one thing you need to know about Pinewood is that the academic pressure there can be very intense. Not so much from the teachers, but the other students. You know they had to stop class ranks there because they were causing so much unhealthy competition? A 4.0 GPA is laughable at Pinewood where many students are closer to 5.0 with weighted AP courses. 

And then there is the perception of Pinewood students at, well, basically every other educational institution and scholarship provider. The term ""Pinewood Brats"" is ubiquitous and clearly well-earned. They're going to be discriminated against in most other contexts, even by their fellow students at other schools.

"Do you live in and have your kids attend Sarasota county schools already?  If so, you need to work through your school's ESE liaison to apply to Pine View. The website below outlines what's required:

https://www.sarasotacountyschools.net/Page/2638

Basically it is a two step process. First your children have to score above a 130 (two standard deviations) on an IQ test and an academic achievement test. Your home school will offer a no cost preliminary screening, and if they score above 130 on the screening, the district will have one of their school psychologists do the IQ and achievement tests at no charge to you. If they score below 130 on the screening, you will have to pay a psychologist directly to administer the two tests. The deadline to request a screening at your home school passed in January.

Once your kid completes the two tests (with high enough scores), then your ESE department will work with you to complete the rest of the documents required to formally have your kid designated as a ""gifted magnet"" student at which point you can apply to Pine View.

As climate change is reportedly what's driving the increased frequency and severity of destructive weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, bitter frigid weather and snowstorms, which in turn affect the risk burden insurance companies take when insuring private residences and business facilities, I beg to differ with your claim that it has nothing to do with insurance rates.  As any insurance actuary or statistician can tell you, anything that affects risk affects insurance rates.  
Doctor, heal thyself.  
In other words, u/TRIGGERHAPYx, I recommend you take your own advice: educate yourself.  Even YOUR link  provides this intel, ""Your insurance premiums will likely go up in 2022 -- if they haven't already. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many insurance companies have seen elevated claims activity.

"I like the downtown area, 2 or 3 metaphysical shops if that's your thing, a used bookstore on main, about a score of cafes (of kors is a personal favorite but breakfast house or c'est la vie are better for sit down), antique stores too. In fact if you like antiquing or thrifting, Sarasota is great (check out canned Ham Vintage for a beautiful and curated selection of goods from the 50s through 70s that are ACTUALLY USEABLE) 

The ballet is one of the best in the country, though I think it's expensive (I've only ever bought student tickets) and may not be running a show when you're in town.

More aquarium is obviously touristy but also a lot of fun no matter what, and the beach on that island (kenthompson park I believe?) is my favourite in town bc no one is ever there.

If you're outdoorsy, there are a couple nature parks. Myakka is bigger but there's also Oscar scherer, and I've heard about celary fields but haven't been myself.

Again, more touristy, but the Ringling museum is also a lot of fun, and free on Mondays I think. They have a circus museum! And the grounds are so pretty.

There are also frequent art fairs or crafts sales, you'd just have to look at the specific time you're coming.

Spas -Lspa , The Met (mixed reviews, also owners are cheap and don‚Äôt tip delivery people )

Fun? Play some golf , fish , bar hop, kayak, relax on the beach, go to museum, find a shitty live band to listen to, go to a spring training baseball game, sit and watch people try to figure out a roundabout , bike the legacy trail, check out some of the nice parks , rent a boat, catch a movie at cinnebistro , bahi hut, go visit your parents , pool hop the nice rooftop hotels ,
Take your dog to 17th st dog park to get bit by another dog, van Wezel show, axe throwing , try to purchase a house but realize your income is 11% higher than 2 years ago but home prices are 37% higher , deep sea fishing charter , Labarge booze cruise , fight over parking at the beach.

People need to realize that superfund sites exist, and how it comes to be that taxpayers are paying for corporate waste cleanup for decades to come.  It is a great example when voters vote for those who believe profit over the environment.

Here are list of superfund sites in Sarasota County.

https://www.homefacts.com/environmentalhazards/superfunds/Florida/Sarasota-County.html

:What are Superfunds?

Superfund: A Superfund site is any land in the United States that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to human health and/or the environment.

NPL Superfund: The National Priorities List is a list of the most hazardous waste sites that have been identified by Superfund/ CERCLIS where long-term remedial response actions can only be conducted.

Superfunds can be sub-classified as:

Active: A non-archived Superfund site at which site assessment, removal, remedial, enforcement, cost recovery, or oversight activities are being planned or conducted under the Superfund/CERCLIS program.

Archived: A Superfund site that has no further interest under the Federal Superfund Program based on available information and is no longer part of the CERCLIS inventory.""",t2_9gajflvy,sayaxat,0,1647613335.0,0,t1_i15mpwj,i15mpwj,True,[deleted],t3_th1p4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/sarasota/comments/th1p4n/a_quick_reminder_that_ron_desantis_is_anti/,"A quick reminder that Ron DeSantis is ANTI environment (and supporting documentation).

"Wow. 

Lots of liberties taken here in my absence. 

As long as we are talking about common mistakes made, we should discuss assumptions. 

It‚Äôs sad that my 25 years of activism, labor, community involvement, education, and straight up efforts to raise the bar for the nation on sustainable construction is instantly neglected in favor of an assumption on who I voted for in a single race that had exactly ZERO impact on the current state of Sarasota, or my departure. 

Humanity is doomed. And, it is not because of who voted for who. 

Show me what you have done for this place, for your community, for your corner, show me your sacrifice, and then you can judge me.

Not that it‚Äôs your business, but I am an independent. 

Sarasota‚Äôs problems are non-partisan and have nothing to do with state politics. This town has been sold out to development interests by the left and the right. 

Growth is inevitable, and as much as I don‚Äôt like it, I accept it. My problem, as I tried to voice in this interview, is that in the process of that growth we have wiped away the three things that give a place it‚Äôs identity: The people, The natural environment, and The historical built environment. 

None of these things happened as a result of partisan politics. In fact, it is more likely that partisanship actually prevented anyone from stopping it. 

As long as people pretend they can vote in one direction and fix this problem, we are doomed. Want to fix it? Take action.

"This is false information. What you are talking about is in regards to the November vote , which continues the tax that we have had in place since 1989.

"So apparently this topic needs a little bit of explanation.  The food served at most Chinese restaurants in America bears little resemblance to what people eat in China.  I'll skip the history lesson, you can google that if you are so inclined.  The point here is that anyone who grew up in China and immigrated to the US will not even recognize the food served at Chinese restaurants in America.

Often cooks in these restaurants are immigrants and will cook the foods they ate in China for other immigrants.  That is the ""secret"" menu.  It isn't really any secret.  Sometimes there isn't even even a menu.  You just ask the chef for what you want and if they can make it they will.  China as a country is as large as Europe and the cuisine just as varied.  Chinese patrons looking for their regional foods will find a chef who also grew up and learned to cook in that region.  They will learn his specialties and order them.

This is basically what the OP is asking about.  If there is a menu for these items don't expect it to be available in English.  If you want to order off-menu, just ask.  This can sometimes be tricky as the people who understand the secret menu don't speak English, and the staff who do speak English often don't know the secret menu.  So don't be surprised if you need to find a translator to speak with the kitchen staff.

Needless to say, don't try to do this when the restaurant is busy.  Go in the middle of the afternoon when things are dead and they have the time to talk with you.  More than likely they will be happy to oblige.",t2_hvsv4,UnecessaryCensorship,0,1647531745.0,0,t1_i1143cm,i1143cm,False,Sir_Sir_ExcuseMe_Sir,t3_tfvfpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/sarasota/comments/tfvfpj/do_any_chinese_restaurants_in_sarasota_have/,Do Any Chinese Restaurants in Sarasota Have Secret Menus/Authentic Chinese Menus?,/r/sarasota/comments/tfvfpj/do_any_chinese_restaurants_in_sarasota_have/i1143cm/,10,r/sarasota,0,10

"that doesn't make it 'inauthentic!' It makes it different, and if you like one or the other, there's nothing pejorative about either, nor is one less real, authentic, or any other meaningless nonsense at best, or coded language at worst. This is not me talking out of my neck -- it's a fairly broad anthropological consensus, and one shared by culinary experts as well:

""About a decade ago, the most important thing food could be was authentic. ‚ÄúAuthenticity‚Äù was the buzzword that propelled people to seek out so-called hole-in-the-wall taco joints over Qdoba and blast their exploits all over Yelp. Places like Eataly popped up with the promise of ‚Äúreal‚Äù Italian ingredients over the impostors you‚Äôd find at your ShopRite. Could you even be someone who liked food if the food you ate wasn‚Äôt authentic?

But just as it rose, so did it fall. In 2011, Todd Kliman wrote in Lucky Peach that authenticity was ‚Äúa purely arbitrary, purely subjective surmise of a purely impure thing.‚Äù In 2012, Eddie Huang lamented the prototype of someone who ‚Äúwants to tell ME what Chinese food is because Bear Stearns sent him to Shanghai for six months.‚Äù The public discussion of authenticity in food began to feel cliche, the language of insufferable foodies more concerned with appearing to have the correct tastes than doing any tasting. The word buzzed no more.""

"The ""Chinese"" food you find on the menu in most American restaurants is largely unrecognizable to people native to any part of China.  It really was developed entirely to be served to Americans.

The ""secret"" menu is no secret either.  It is just the normal menu provided to native Chinese customers.  Any restaurant serving this population will have such a menu.  

And to the OP:  Generally the menu is only printed in Mandarin and if there is an English translation don't expect that it will help you much.  If you want to order from this menu be sure to visit the restaurant when they aren't busy and can take the time to explain things to you.

"And that's because people on pointless quests for 'ethnic' food ignores transcultural exchange in cuisines that have made pretty much *all* cuisines everywhere 'inauthentic' based on some honestly problematic ideas about 'essentialized' cultures that just don't reflect reality. I live in Mexico now (but have family there), and my in-laws eat pizza -- but with chipotle -- and sushi -- but with cream cheese all around the outside -- and I could go on and on. We eat that far more often than sopes, huaraches, tacos (are tacos pastor 'authentic' given they are basically Lebanese?) etc etc.

The reason for the answer is because OP should be asking all day long about 'secret menus' which could be stuff they like but generally doesn't sell because local palates find it odd, etc.

But I bet you he voted for DeSantis.  I like Josh, I follow him on a few outlets for his fishing content.  But I def get the vibe he's supporting the politicians of this state that do the exact opposite of what he's preaching.

That's a huge problem in Florida.  The hypocrites.  I was at the CCA banquet in Bradenton recently, CCA = ""Coastal Conservation Association"" an NPO working to protect Florida's fisheries.  I haven't seen so many Trump stickers and flags congregated in one place since the dumbass lost his presidential seat.  So many of the good ol' boys in Florida like to preach ""protect our waters"" then go vote for the opposite and shit on actual environmentalists.

Edit: To be clear, I could be wrong about Josh's political views.  I don't remember if it was in insta or FB, but I'm convinced I saw him make a comment that gave me this impression.

One hundred percent of all proceeds donated will go to support humanitarian and emergency response work in Ukraine and its neighboring countries.  
  
RADD for Ukraine was born out of a community request and created by DreamLarge, Gulf Coast Community Foundation, CitySide, Rosemary District Association, Triforce, Victoria Blooms and Massage by Diane Lane.

"I used to work at historic Spanish point and it‚Äôs purported to be haunted by the archaic/native people that lived there thousands of years ago who‚Äôs bodies were excavated from the burial mounds there. Also purported to be haunted by the ghosts of members of the Webb family. The original pioneer home is still standing and you can take active tours inside of it with a docent, or you can walk the property on your own and visit the sitting docent who will give you the history of the home/family who built it in the 1800s. One of the very young wives fell down the stairs inside while she was over 8 months pregnant and both her and the baby died. 

Some of my old volunteers that worked there would refuse to go upstairs or only sit outside on the porch. It bothered them that much. Other guests have reported being physically scratched while on the stairs even though they were the only ones there. 

Also there is an original graveyard with original headstones from the Webb family right next to a rebuilt church. 

I‚Äôve also had supposed mediums say they clearly felt a lot of energy at the place or wouldn‚Äôt go there after dark.

I would help with weddings very late at night there in complete darkness riding around on the golf carts by myself and I never felt anything spooky or odd or got bad vibes anywhere on property, but that‚Äôs just me, I only had good intentions and was trying to keep the place up and running as a historic museum. And usually ghost shit freaks me out. 

The only ‚Äúexperience‚Äù I ever had was when I worked in the original schoolhouse that sits on US 41 at the entrance (that‚Äôs where you used to go to get your admission tickets/office staff worked/we held meetings & you could rent out the school rooms.) One time I was trying to lock up and I was trying to input the lock code to arm the building and it would not work. Over and over and over. I had never had a problem before. I got so frustrated and yelled out asking if someone was trying to tell me something? So I did one more sweep of the building and had to go through another locked door and realized I had forgotten my house keys at the front desk. I immediately had an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment like a realization came over me that that‚Äôs the reason the building wouldn‚Äôt let me physically leave. I go back to arm the building by the back door and it worked on the first fucking try, no problem. I literally yelled out ‚Äúthank you!!!‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know if I believe in ghosts/spirits and that stuff scares me anyway so I kind of choose not to engage in believing it but I truly believe someone or something was trying to help me that afternoon since I was kind of like the caretaker of that building. 

HSP also used to go ghost tours where they would take you around in the dark and give you the rundown of the history on all that stuff.

I would bet my left tit they were killed by the same person or they are related either in age/demographic/lifestyle, or killed in the same manner. Hence why the SPD will not release any details about these murders to protect the investigation. 

What a tragedy two women were murdered and dumped like garbage. Hopefully SPD can solve this and we and the family of the women will receive answers. Something like this will also put the community on edge particularly in that area.

I often work up in that area as a food delivery driver so I‚Äôm always back and forth and didn‚Äôt realize until just checking my maps that these two areas are literally right next to each other on the bay. Not a coincidence the bodies were found less than a mile apart.

My son wore nail polish all the time when he was 5 and there was nothing wrong with it. He doesn‚Äôt do it as much now. He now wants to pierce his ears. All of this he‚Äôs done without his parents or friends pushing him to do it. So what‚Äôs a teacher to do or say if a kid teases him about the way he looks. This law prevents that teacher from saying gender preferences even fashion are not a place for them to speak. And that‚Äôs a sad state of affairs. Nothing is wrong with the way he expresses himself. And if you think wearing nail polish as a boy, playing with Barbies, or piercing your ears as a boy is sick and wrong you can put your opinions back in your mouth b/c that‚Äôs not how the world is anymore. Oh by the way he does all that ‚Äúgirly‚Äù stuff and is still interested in ladies. And they him.

No one is promoting questioning gender identity to a 5 year old. You are sorely out of touch with reality. All teachers are doing is acknowledging the reality of what kids are already doing (ie painting their nails, being transgender, being gay). Yes I‚Äôve seen some kids at age 7 and thought that one‚Äôs gonna bat for the other team. And that‚Äôs ok. 

Again your example is null because it starts off with assumptions that trans folks are ‚Äúsexual predators‚Äù. I know a few socially and professionally and I can tell you that they are not predators who want to peep on other girls in bathrooms. I would bet this guy who wrote this book is not a trained sociologist, psychologist or even has a PHD in what he‚Äôs writing about. And if he does, I bet this book has been peer reviewed and found to be a load of horseshit!!",t2_dx929rqf,CoincadeFL,0,1646963449.0,0,t1_i06qns1,i06qns1,False,RoboCrypto7,t3_taip6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/sarasota/comments/taip6s/dont_say_gay/,Don‚Äôt say Gay,/r/sarasota/comments/taip6s/dont_say_gay/i06qns1/,2,r/sarasota,0,2
