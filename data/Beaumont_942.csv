"""Coonass"" is slang for Cajuns, and more specifically backwater swamp people. Could be offensive in some context, but I've heard lots of cajuns self identify as ""connass"" that my first impression is the word is benign.

""Coon"" is very derogatory racial slur towards black people. /r/coontown was an example of that usage before being banned. And what complicates it is people who use that word will also use ""coonass"" interchangeably which further muddies the waters.

"That’s a good question & I think you could ask the very same thing to anyone living anywhere. Off the top of my head, one of its attributes is being fairly close to both a beach and one of the nation’s largest cities (where you can find world-class entertainment & anything you want). I can be close enough to Houston without actually living there and fighting that traffic daily. You want natural beauty? Go to the Big Thicket. Go canoeing at Village Creek. I’m in my mid-30s.

"I’m so sorry your health is suffering. Here’s my two cents: My sister-in-law, who I love, but is also kind of a snob, now lives in the Austin area. She grew up in Beaumont, and loves to hate on it now. She has talked about the air here being poor and won’t even drink our water. She purchases a bag of Sonic prepackaged ice when she’s here because she wants to avoid it. I have neglected to tell her that it’s very unlikely that Sonic trucks in their ice from another location & they probably just freeze our tap water into those perfect ice nuggets. Anyway, I digress. I’ve taken time to compare the air quality reports from her area and ours. Some days theirs is better than ours, some days it’s worse. I haven’t looked at her area’s water reports, but I will say that I sent off a sample of our tap water to an out-of-state lab a year ago (reasons unrelated to proving my SIL wrong) and they found nothing wrong with it.  My point is, a lot of people like to sh*t on Beaumont. That attitude is contagious and harmful, in my opinion. Beaumont is what you make of it. I know many people who are extremely healthy and others who are less than healthy. Your experience may also be affected by where you go, what you consume, & who you spend time with. It could also be seasonal allergies that you would experience all over the southern United States. There are many variables.

"There is a LOT of pollution in this area due to the refineries.

Generally the US has considered the gulf coast to be a sewer where they can dump as much industrial waste as they want, in the name of business profits.  This book covers it in the history of the gulf.  https://www.amazon.com/Gulf-Making-American-Sea/dp/087140866X

Also the Koch brothers have a lot of industrial dumping although a lot of that is in Galveston Bay.  The government says you should only eat one fish per month out of Galveston Bay due to toxic pollutants.

Its really sad.  Before industrialization and capitalist greed, the gulf was teeming with life.  Thomas Jefferson said the Texas area would make America wealthy due to this.  (He also thought the US should make Cuba a state, as a sort of protector of the gulf of Mexico, which could have been called ""The American Sea"").

"I'm not bougie enough to hire someone to clean my car, so I'm afraid I'm not much help on what the market looks like out there. :(

With self-employment contract work, it really all comes down to (1) the number of customers you need each week to make a living wage (after taxes, health insurance, long-term savings, and job expenses), and (2) the number of additional hours you have to spend hustling to find those customers (i.e., you need to know your ""CAC"" and your ""RCR"", and both of those only become clear when you have a good chunk of available data).

My advice: try doing it part-time. See if you can figure out how find clients (people you don't know).

">obfuscating

When I see people warmongering and weighing in with opinions that are purely reactionary like saying we should be sending arms or using a tragedy to spread inflammatory agenda, it’s obvious that they don’t understand the complexities of the situation. **I am not obfuscating by saying that there are consequences to consider. Especially since the country is a new sovereignty born out historical conflict, it is in a vulnerable position in more ways than one. The actions that happen during this pivot will shape the country in long run, and that is why it is important to be mindful in how we support the humanitarian efforts and behave as a global community. How we support, understanding where our support goes so that it is impactful for the greater good, and critically analyzing what is happening to be purposeful with our engagement is vital.** I am truly sickened by all the giddy excitement and sensationalism that is being spread. That helps no one. It’s a solemn moment. I feel like your reductionism isn’t the answer. Nor is over complicating things. To be clear, I am not running damage control for anyone, my statement about the neo nazi battilion was intended as an example to demonstrate the importance of reflection before reaction. Not to say that Ukraine is neo Nazi, and as I mentioned in OP Russian govt. isn’t in the right at all. Thank you for your insight.

"I am originally from Europe, I have spent time in Ukraine, I went to university with many Ukrainians (and Russians). Sure there are Nazis in Ukraine, they have (or had, I think the Russians pretty much wiped them out yesterday) one battalion in the national gaurd which was previously an independent militia fighting the Russians (and not even most of them were nazis, it was 10-20% or about 100-200 men). There's one member of parliament (out of 450) who is even slightly friendly to the nazis and they have no power. Their government wants nothing to do with Nazis, the vast majority of their people want nothing to do with the Nazis having suffered more than just about any other country at their hands. They are a tiny minority in Ukraine.

&#x200B;

I understand that there were some legitimate Russian concerns in regards to NATO expansion  and lack of Russian security guarantees aside from their nuclear arsenal that NATO and the Ukrainians probably should have done a better job at absorbing and deradicalizing the volunteer militias (though a country with a per capita gdp less than half of Mexico fighting a war and with multiple provinces occupied they had some more serious problems to deal with).

&#x200B;

But all of that stopped mattering when Russia decided that the best way of solving this problem was to launch a war that has already killed thousands and will kill tens to hundreds of thousands. Stop trying to obfuscate the situation. Stop running damage control for those who would rape the world and rule the ashes.

"Beaumont hike and bike is fun to walk every once in a while. The farmers market is on Saturday mornings at the Beaumont athletic complex on college street, it’s fun to go to sometimes. Claiborne park in vidor is nice and has good walking and biking trails and a big pond to fish. There are all kinds of clubs and groups you can join if you’re into art. The wheelhouse in mid county is a nice restaurant with active bar scene and is very pretty on the water with plenty of walking paths along the river. 

As far as bars and what not Madison’s, lil Woodrow’s, the west and a few others are popular spots. There a few Mexican dance clubs that are popular that I’m too old and married to attend. 

For gyms I prefer exygon, world gym is dirty and everyone there has poor gym etiquette. There is also a very active martial arts scene is this area primarily for high level BJJ/wrestling if you want to try that out, TPC is an old OG gym that’s been around a long time if you’d like to try a few classes. There also several golf courses (albeit mediocre) if you like golf. Beaumont Country club is the best around and beats most Houston clubs but it isn’t cheap for a membership. If you like water or fishing I’d suggest go down to Aransas pass or McFadden beach and have a nice evening walking on the beach and grill some food and you can also catch some very big bull reds if you know how.",t2_bwi7u,mic_strangeler,0,1644980642.0,0,t1_hx4ig5z,hx4ig5z,True,[deleted],t3_stk244,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beaumont/comments/stk244/new_to_beaumont/,New to Beaumont,/r/Beaumont/comments/stk244/new_to_beaumont/hx4ig5z/,19,r/Beaumont,0,19

"**Story Time:**  I was told that in the late fifties or early sixties NASA was originally looking to build in the Port Arthur Area. They liked the open land, the ports, the booming small city.  At this time I-10 was being built. Its original path was going to be from Winnie to Orange and pass right through Port Arthur. Agreements were made and the ball started rolling. I believe it was at that time the rocket in the picture was given to the city. The story goes that City officials saw an opportunity to make quick cash and started raising the prices of the land over time as the deals were being negotiated. Then it got stupid high for swampland and the tax deferments parts of the deal started to get smaller.  At that time, Houston (the area now Webster) offered the original deal with a 20-year tax deferment. The US Gov grew tired of Port Arthur and moved on to the Houston deal.  As a repercussion of their jacked-up deals, the US gov suddenly decided to turn I-10 into Beaumont, it was a little longer, but it steered people away from Port Arthur.

The rocket is a remnant of this time when Port Arthur was almost the home of mission control. Imagine Port Arthur being in a state of how Webster or League City is now.

"Hi! I'm in Nederland. Don't let some of these comments scare you! We aren't any worse than Florida, just steer clear of Vidor.  

Depending on what you're into there are plenty of local hangouts around the college (Lamar University) 11th Street has Bingo lol. I'm going to that Feb 3rd. Lamar U has sporting events you can attend. We really would like to see more people at the basketball games! I am a season ticket holder. 

Beaumont has a 5 Under on College where you can hang out and hit balls. Terrell park is lovely and has nice hiking trails. Gator Country is badass if you're into local wildlife. There are also a couple of shooting ranges. The one in Lumberton always has PoC hanging out shooting guns. I love to see it. 

Museum of the Gulf Coast in Port Arthur is neat. Sea Rim State Park is on the beach and also cool to visit. 

Nederland has a brewery on Boston Ave called Buckstin Brewery- welcoming crowd of all ages. Great beer! I highly recommend going there to watch a game. You won't be disappointed. 

Port Neches has a brewery too, also very welcoming crowd, also great beer with live music sometimes.


This area has really diverse demographics. We have a large Vietnamese community here with hella good food. There are a few good soul food places in Port Arthur. Lots of great local restaurant owners and food options. Our Sheriff is a black woman, you are not unwelcome here. I PROMISE. There are a lot of wonderful PoC business owners out here too. Lots of culture here if you know where to look.


Editing to add: I attended all the protests in 2020 in Port Arthur and several in Houston. The ones in Port Arthur never turned violent with cops and had several white people in attendance. You are welcome here. More and more racists are being outed and losing their jobs and businesses out here every day.",t2_k6s53,Jaxnickel,0,1642975062.0,0,t1_htxo9kh,htxo9kh,True,Positive_Ad_1959,t3_saoc2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beaumont/comments/saoc2d/any_spots_to_hang_out_in_ima_black_male_in_my/,Any spots to hang out in ?

"Hey there. Coming from a plant background, many industrial plants are becoming more and more interested in ICS/OT (Industrial Control Systems, Operational Technology) cybersecurity. Think about IT system cybersecurity (protecting networks against bad actors, guarding confidential information, etc.). Plants have the same concerns, but with their industrial equipment/systems. 

I recommend this because:

1. It's a hot topic right now

2. It pays well

3. I have personally worked with plant personnel who were military background who got into this industry after their service

4. You're going to school for CS, which can potentially position you well in an OT/IT plant environment (in a job role like I've described, you'd be doing systems analysis, writing code, scripting, etc.)

If you want more information, just google ""OT Cybersecurity"", or look at work that Dragos has been doing. Depending on your previous MOS, this might be a really strong option for you, not only in Beaumont or SETX, but internationally.

"State government, unlike the Federal, can't manufacture money.  This results in the state officials needing to balance the budget every two years.  They estimate how much revenue will come in from all sources and then divide that up as needed.  For education that lotto money is earmarked, but since the state has to balance it's budget, that just means that instead of applying $2B from the state's general fund, that general fund money gets applied somewhere else.  If the lotto generated $4B next year, the legislature would probably reduce general funding to education by something close to $4B. It's a zero-sum game.

Teacher's salaries are a locally set - not state set.  Our local schools collect money via property tax, which can be increased if that's what the local citizens desire, but BISD's tax dropped almost $0.05/$100v from 2020 to 2021(I am assuming a bond was paid off?).

 >Celebratory gunfire is the shooting of a firearm into the air in celebration. It is culturally accepted in parts of the Balkans, Russia, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Guatemala, Ethiopia, Mexico, Italy, and parts of the USA, even where illegal. Common occasions for celebratory gunfire include New Year's Day as well as religious holidays. The practice sometimes results in random death and injury from stray bullets.

>On May 3, 1985, a massive blackout occurred leaving 132,000 people in Southeast Texas without power. Kevin Carmody of the Beaumont Enterprise newspaper claimed that at the time of the blackout, his car also lost power, only to come back to life minutes later. People also reported picking up Houston radio stations that they didn't receive normally. The local electric company chalked it up to a lightning storm a hundred miles north of Beaumont, but that wouldn't explain the car battery dying or the radio station range widening. What really caused the blackout may never be uncovered.

"Small warning to anyone interested, rabbits can be a lot of work. They require constant access to hay and water, a litter box, lots of room to run and play, and should be spayed/neutered to prevent cancer/unintended pregnancies/poop everywhere. You should also keep all cords out of their reach because they love to chew on “roots” and rabbits hate being picked up due to their prey ancestry.

Edit to add: it is recommended that rabbits be kept in pairs, but they can be territorial and will fight each other for dominance. Rabbits also live for 10 years.

"Trying to get our committee to at least 1. Request a bargaining meeting (with they're not) 2. Hold a membership meeting (which we've filled out two special meeting requests following our by-laws to a T, and they were denied with no basis, just denied) 3. At this point, I'm pushing for decertification. 

This union has broken their own by laws approximately 32 times in the last 6 months to my personal count. I have all the documentation to prove said violations. Not holding general meetings, not holding special request meetings, publicly degrading, threatening other members, cursing during meetings, committing fraud, misuse of funds, I could go on an on. Most of these I listed have been committed on more than one occasion. I don't feel sorry for these scumbags on the committee. I feel sorry for the people who are taking the brunt of it who disagree and the union refuses to help. We're talking about dues paying members whom the union won't offer the same amount of financial assistance to just because their opinion differs whenever people who DO agree fully are getting every single bill/note/utility paid. They're buying their support. So at this point, I'm pushing to get of them.

Edit to add: our union recently filed NLRB charges that are baseless in an attempt to intentionally have our votes impounded and the vote count delayed in hopes that they can save themselves from decertification.

" This is about control- Exxon wants to eliminate a safety position which oversees the operations & change the seniority by splitting the workers into 2 pools instead of 1. This makes all workers there more vulnerable to layoffs if Exxon succeeds. It also eliminates the workers' ability to change roles within the facility, meaning there would be less opportunities to move to different roles during their careers.

I've been part of a Houston effort coordinating with the USW LU 13-243 to support them during the lockout, so I feel pretty plugged into the situation. I've heard from the union workers on what's going on, and it disgusting what ExxonMobil and their corporate greed is doing to working families! 

For those who want to support the USW workers in Beaumont, there's an action network fund that's raising money for their families.
