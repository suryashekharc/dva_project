"There's a reddish looking wasp here, looks like an ordinary paper wasp or dirt/mud dauber wasp, but it's aggressive as hell. Other than that and a rare black widow spider, there's not much in the bug line here that can hurt you. We do have brown recluse spiders but I've only seen a couple in \~25 years living here and spending a lot of time outside.

It may just be the places outdoors that I go but poisonous snakes, although they exist, aren't that common. I've also lived in southern WV and SW Virginia where copperheads are everywhere and if you go into the mountains, especially around rocky areas near water, there are rattlers.

"Looks like a millipede nothing to worry about just set it back outside it prolly wondered in.

The one bug you need to watch out for is a house centipede it's harmless to you (but creepy as hell). Seeing one on occasion like 2-4 times a month is a good sign. But if you see them on a consistently like everyday that means you have a bug problem cause they are feasting on the bad bugs.

Another spooky one is the wolf spider they get huge and can terrify people but are very skidish and fast so try to send outside or handle them yourself. They can't kill you and only really bite if your trying to catch with your hands.

Lastly tho very rare are red velvet ants and scorpions (I've lived in the area for over 30 years and have never seen a scorpion but they exist). Avoid the red velvet ant at all costs.

The only problem bug is the stink bug harmless but annoying and smelly. There's a few tricks but your kinda stuck with them.

Any other bugs your apartment should be spraying for and as long as you and your neighbors are clean shouldn't be a problem but you can call your manager if you notice them.

I recommend Google imaging the house centipede, wolf spider, and red velvet ant so you know what they look like. Leave the centipede alone do what you will for the spider and good luck trying to kill a red velvet ant cause they are tough. Tho those bugs won't bother you unless you bother them.",t2_5594v,tycat,0,1648171359.0,0,t1_i20c9t0,i20c9t0,True,AllikNowsofar629,t3_tmfhhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/tricities/comments/tmfhhm/help_bugs_just_moved_here_from_new_england_and/,"Help, Bugs!

"It’s cheap, laid back, people out west and up north are realizing they can do the same office job at home and can come live here for 1/4th the price.

"That's true but to a much lesser extent.

  
No housing crash, seller's market: I lose the money I used for closing costs and the money I need to pay to sell the home. Possibly, the market has continued to go up so there is a gain there but if it's been less than two years, I have to pay capital gains tax on any gain.  


Market crashes, buyer's market: Everything listed above except capital losses instead of gains. A 30% correction is possible. So now I am out that and it's also possible that I'll have to pay the buyer's closing costs just to make my place more appealing.

"What are you basing that off of? If they have a 30 year fixed mortgage at a super low interest rate, they only lose money if they sell.

In fact with inflation so high, you're basically getting paid to borrow money if you have a low rate (3% or under) that cannot change month to month. You're also getting more house for the money, instead of your monthly payments going percentage wise towards more interest to the bank. With a 4 bedroom house, the homeowners could take a roommate if they had to, most people wouldn't want to, but it's an option with a larger home.

Also, because of the Dodd Frank Act, people getting 5-600k 4 bedroom houses likely either had fat equity from from their last home, or they have high incomes, or daddy's money paid for their down payment. They're qualified borrowers who wanted to take advantage of insanely low interest rates. The chances they'll be 'upside down on their mortgages' is pretty slim unless they have a life-changing event like divorce or something.

A cooled down housing market actually helps homeowners, it lowers their property tax burden, which is a tax write off anyway if they have a mortgage.

Plus, demand is still extremely high nationwide, so even a slip dip would be quelled quickly, because people will jump at the chance to get a home.

Anyone can go to Rural King and pick up a rabbit on any day.  If you sell a rabbit, there is no guarantee that it will be taken care of any better or worse if it was purchased in a month other than April. Some people wait months for this time of year to get a pet rabbit because they know it's when they are for sale.

I also have a hobby farm. I'm eating rabbit meatloaf right now.  It's so good and the healthiest meat you can get.

I sell rabbits from time to time. When I do, I tell the buyer that I am always here if they need help with the rabbit, whether it's questions or they no longer want it. If it's the latter, I'll take it back and make sure it's well taken care of (clean, comfortable, full, exercised, and socialized) until it transitions into its next role. You may want to extend this service if you are not already. People have returned rabbits to me.

"I moved to Johnson City in 2018 from north Alabama and fell in love.

If you like hiking there are TONS of places to go hiking that ISNT in little Las Vegas (Gatlinburg - that place has gotten so overrun). I call JC area the smokies without the tourist traps. We have several breweries here and a distillery in Jonesborough (Tennessee Hills) (I now live married on the outskirts of Jonesborough)...

I used to make videos of all the hiking around here. Buffalo Mountain is a great day hiking trail with some awesome views with full cell coverage. (there's a sketchy parking lot in one section where groomer old men go to score - not kidding - but other than that it's very nice)

&#x200B;

My biggest complaint of Johnson City and surround areas is the cuisine. There are a few decent restaurants - some good dives - but the food overall is just... meh. You can't get stellar pizza in east Tennessee (or the south for that matter). You can get DECENT pizza - but not GREAT pizza. (I grew up in Port Saint Lucie Fl - was married to a girl from Brooklyn NY - I KNOW good Pizza - anything ""NY style"" in the south is just a poor imitation)

So food is my biggest gripe here. Bigger cities and hubs imho have better overall food choices.

I love JC though. It's been good to me. Prices are starting to go up significantly but thats everywhere due to inflation, housing shortages, Blackrock, people escape liberal hell-hole cradle to grave government nanny states etc.

Very very free here too. During the last 2 years to flatten a certain curve the government only SUGGESTED certain actions. Never once were any of us here dictated to.

"My mother in law picked up and moved here in 2018 from California at 70. It's nerve wracking moving late in life like that. He may qualify for some of the senior apartments in the area in the next few years, once he's 65 or so. They're usually pretty good, it's rent controlled (about 1/3 of the person's income), so especially once he's on social security, that would be an option. There are a few communities in Kingsport that I've heard are really good. They take a lot of legwork to get into and there's a waiting list, but there are some good options once he's ready for that. And these are independent living communities- They're basically just income driven and age restricted so that he wouldn't have neighbors with babies or young kids. Each community is different with what they pay for- it's varying levels of utilities, cable and internet, with some communities providing different services with rent and some offering discounted services. The apartment complex my mother in law lives in pays all utilities and includes basic cable as well. Higher level cable packages and internet service is provided at a steep discount. I think she pays $25 a month for her internet. She also pays for her phone service. Most of them are on bus lines and the area transit services also have senior specific services where they can call and get rides to doctor appointments and the grocery store pretty cheaply in mini vans instead of getting on and off a bus. 

Your dad may not need those right away, although he may be able to do a discounted monthly bus pass, but it's worth it to get information early and be able to compare communities so that he knows where he may like to move if it comes to that.",t2_8qvm00yb,Virtual-Cucumber7955,0,1647467358.0,0,t1_i0xu1og,i0xu1og,False,Sweaty_mut,t3_tf6vbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/tricities/comments/tf6vbj/apartments_in_walking_distance_to_things/,Apartments in walking distance to things,/r/tricities/comments/tf6vbj/apartments_in_walking_distance_to_things/i0xu1og/,2,r/tricities,0,2

"Downtown JC is somewhat of a food desert, only a lone discount United Grocery Outlet within reasonable walking distance.  The rest of town is so car dependent that it'd be difficult to find an open apartment near a grocery store.  An apartment along a bus route may be a possibility though?

&#x200B;

Probably Kingsport would be the better bet.  There is a Food City on Center St, and from a cursory search, the Town Park Lofts across the street have openings coming up.  There are a selection of churches within walking distance as well.  Same general thing applies here though in the further away from the core downtown you get, the more car-dependent the town becomes.  

Bus routes for both cities are available on the JCT and KATS sites to help find possible locations if a downtown loft isn't an option.  The JC silver line makes a stop at Walmart for example, so you may look along that route

"I lived in JC for years but I live in Colorado now and have for around 6 years so I’ll just tell you what I remember from when I lived there.

Pros:
1) it’s cheap.  Living in CO now it’s mind blowing how cheap East TN is.
2) the people are friendly for the most part
3) downtown is cute but there isn’t a TON to do.  Luckily you’re close to Asheville which does have a lot to do.
4) it’s pretty.  There is a lot of hiking and outdoorsy stuff to do.

Cons:
1) biggest con for me is that you’re not super close to any major airports.  Idk if that’s a problem for you but it’s the main reason I moved.  I got a job that required me to travel to Denver (flight attendant) often and there are way more options to fly to Denver in places like Charlotte, ATL, Nashville and even Memphis.
2) the city isn’t great about dealing with snow but that’s basically any TN city or city in the south for that matter.
3) There could be more options for food but again it’s not a huge city so it’s about what you might expect.  Coming from Memphis though you might be disappointed.  There are a few great restaurants though that you definitely should check out and I hope they’ve opened more since I’ve left (and the ones I liked are still around)

Neutral:
It’s a pretty conservative place overall.  There are pockets where it’s fairly liberal but overall it’s more conservative.  Not sure where you lean so that could go either way.

Overall I like JC quite a bit but if it were me I would move to Chattanooga.  There’s more to do and it’s close to Atlanta and Nashville.",t2_a3gqw,spishcadet,0,1647119580.0,0,t1_i0eylkk,i0eylkk,True,bluelelu,t3_tbb1ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/tricities/comments/tbb1ly/what_do_you_love_about_johnson_city_not_love/,What do you love about Johnson City?

"Oh amazing!! I hope it’s not too overwhelming, but here are some of my favorite things in Johnson City. 

1. Restaurants: Freiberg’s (trust me), Korean Taco House, Holy Taco

This sounds like too many tacos. It is not. 

2. There’s a pretty good beer scene. I like Atlantic Ale House.

3. Outdoors: Founders Park is great and in the middle of downtown. Tweetsie Trail is a little ways out but is neat to visit and lots of things to see. If you’re a hiker and don’t mind crossing a creek and climbing a little to get to a waterfall, I recommend Margarette Falls (fair warning: limited cell signal). If you just want to drive somewhere in town to see pretty mountains, visit Willow Springs Park.

Nashville is over 10x larger than Johnson City they are not comparable. You either want to live in Nashville or Eastern Tennessee and if you know the differences and are ok with the slower pace in East Tennessee move if you are questioning or have never lived in East Tennessee it could be a huge change. You can purchase a house almost twice as large and more private and central in Johnson City than you can in Nashville. Once you are over the bars and cool factor of the city you will end up with the same state rules and taxes but overall lower cost and slower pace in East Tennessee with scenery that does not exist in the middle of the state.,t2_6tewc,psychedape,0,1646961227.0,0,t1_i06lpcj,i06lpcj,True,bluelelu,t3_tbb1ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/tricities/comments/tbb1ly/what_do_you_love_about_johnson_city_not_love/,What do you love about Johnson City?

"What I love: proximity to the Appalachian trail, hiking, Asheville, our WETS public radio station, local history, tweetsie trail. 
What I hate: downtown parking is a pain, hard to spend an evening out without driving a little bit of everywhere.  It's hard to park and walk more than one or two places. Housing is probably not significantly cheaper than Chattanooga. All local government is very, very, very conservative. Johnson City immediate area schools are meh. Elizabethton has a great football program. ETSU has some decent programs, pharmacy school, paleontology program. Bristol has a better downtown for live music, etc. 
I spent a couple weeks in Chattanooga doing some training last year, but that's the full extent of my recent exploration.  I did not find it difficult to travel from one area of the city to the other. You're close to Atlanta, there's far more arts and restaurants obviously, and you can still be ""in the country"" in 20 minutes. If I didn't have the single family tie I have here I would definitely consider living in Chattanooga if I had good employment there. It has small town feels, lots of outlying areas like red bank and hixon,  but more ""city"" amenities.",t2_1rihnau,rainforestranger,0,1646954804.0,0,t1_i067idh,i067idh,True,bluelelu,t3_tbb1ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/tricities/comments/tbb1ly/what_do_you_love_about_johnson_city_not_love/,What do you love about Johnson City?

They might not leave crosses in your yard or call you names to your face, but they are judging. Some areas are more open minded than others, like Tree Streets.

"Are you considering the houses in the [Kingsport Westgate development](https://www.drhorton.com/tennessee/knoxville/kingsport/west-gate)?

This DR horton development is located between a 26-building government housing project, the interstate and a busy 6-lane throughfare. There are sirens a lot and people loiter near the shopping center across from the DR Horton/West gate development. But I think the main reason to avoid it is that the Shell Station on W Stone Dr has had the most crime incidents of any other business in the city according to a cop friend. 

IMO there are better built houses in better areas with yards and more space available in Kingsport than what DR Horton offers.

"I wondered the same thing. Went through their Facebook posts to find absolutely nothing other than other people also wondering what happened to her. 

I did find someone saying that she got Covid a while back and was staying home. I feel like I remember Izzy saying that on the broadcast too. 

I don’t think anyone knows exactly what happened. I feel like they would’ve said something if she passed away or something. 

Edit: found her personal Facebook. There’s a few comments from what seems to be an old coworker and she says “thank you for always being so sweet to me at work. There wasn’t a puddle you didn’t personally walk me through”

It sounds to me like she moved on from the station. I know that seems kind of a lot to infer from one comment but with her suddenly disappearing and her thanking a former coworker for always being so great… I think that’s the most reasonable answer.

"I was a DJ for an FM station for a couple of years. Nobody does it for the money until you get into major market stations - poor pay, short hours, no retirement &c are the standard, and you can be gone in a heartbeat if your ""numbers"" take a downturn. That's really unfair to the jocks, as sometimes the available new music ... sucks, and there's nothing you can do if you're locked into playing what the program manager picks.

The only reason to take a DJ job is that you love it, everything else is downside. If you want to make a decent living you have to sell spots (ads) when you're not on the air or recording.

"Telford is a loosely unified district of rural residential homes, with not much going on in terms of business (retailers OR restaurants). You'll absolutely be SAFE, but in terms of relationships with your neighbors, it will really depend on who you live next to. Just like WNC, the majority of people will be fine, but of course, you'll have some people who have nothing better to do than try to put you down (though you get that everywhere).

Like everyone else has said, the majority of the things you'll do will be in Johnson City or Asheville since there's not much to do in Telford itself. Jonesborough doesn't have a lot going on downtown, but when they do they do it well. So always be on the lookout for events, and maybe visit/walk around downtown every once in a while for an evening stroll.

The Tree Streets in Johnson City is the place to be in this area if you're either liberal, LGBTQ+, or involved with ETSU/any college. It's the historic housing district next to ETSU and Downtown JC, so all of the homes are historic and modified for renting or sold as-is.

"My interest was piqued at the audacity, but as someone who feels my intent is lost in the translation of texting, I'll try. 

I checked the link. Taxes are low (compared to other places). Cost of living is kind if tricky. Since you're moving from Nevada (?) it will most likely be lower, but as far ascthe local economy the COL is rising at a much higher rate than wages. If you Google the area at all, then the lifestyle things you mention should be an obvious fit. There's tons if access to various outdoors activities. The nightlife.....well. in JC it's better than the rest of the area, and JC in general is much more liberal as far as the vibes. It is a college town, so if drunk young people are something you are annoyed by, just be aware. There's also a growing homeless issue, and a long standing drug issue. 

Another thing that caught my eye was the question about racism. It kind of seems as though you are expecting it? People here, 99.999% of the time, are cordial. There's always the offchance of encountering someone who reacts angrily and says racist shit, but as far as things like I see happening on the news, no. Theres always assholes everywhere though. I used to work with mentally disabled people, the bulk of my job being to help them be active in their communities. One weekend we go to the flea market, and the group was staying together (as they typically did), when a guy walks by and says ""who let the sideshow out"". Of course it wasn't to me (obviously employed to help them with my uniform and work badge) or anyone individually. It was something said loudly enough for it to be heard. I cannot even tell you how shocked I was, as it was the first time anything like that had ever happened. There were the small percentage of people that would look uncomfortable or maybe stare, but that was the first and only time anyone acted out if pocket. For the most part, people here aren't really the type to be up from or outspoken with any negative opinions. It's more a smile to you, and talk whatever. One thing I think might be different, is people typically attempt to resolve issues person to person instead of involving authorities. 

The general vibe I'm getting from your post is you like the area, but aren't sure if you could deal with the ignorant locals. If I'm wrong, I apologize; however, I that is you're thinking, you may want to consider if this is something you really want to do.

"I agree with a lot of this. I'm also a transplant, moved here 10yrs ago. 

My biggest thing is that people FROM here think it's the absolute best but most have never lived anywhere else. It's difficult to make friends because people already have their friends they have known their whole lives. If you aren't in a church this is doubly difficult.

"Only problem you may out of what you mentioned in the list is finding somewhere to rent right now. I’d go ahead and start looking at places but the housing market in the whole tri cities is crazy right now. Lots of people moving in from up north and out west. You won’t worry about any stench in JC. You used to not have to worry in Bristol but recently the Bristol, Va cities landfill is creating a problem in the city that’s affect Bristol, TN with the smell. You can’t smell it everywhere in Bristol, TN but some places you can and it’s all coming from a landfill in Bristol, Va. I could be wrong but I believe theres some legal action being taken to get the landfill situation fixed. JC is growing more and more each year it seems. I think you’d be better going more toward a suburb of JC (Gray, Fall Branch, Piney Flats, Jonesborough and maybe even Elizabethton) then being in the city itself. Like several others mentioned there is a college that’s really and truly the main attraction to JC (ETSU). They’re sports teams are Division 1 FCS in the SoCon Conference. FCS are really just smaller D1 schools like: ETSU, UT Chattanooga, North/South Dakota State, Western Carolina, UNCW etc. and Many Asian students go there (I just went to school there 2 years ago) and I’ve not heard or witnessed any discrimination or prejudice towards Asians or Asian Americans in the area.

"So I’m from Wisconsin, but I’ve been in Tennessee for 10 years now. I lived near Knoxville and despised it. I could list a million reasons but someone will get on here and refute every single one of them because for some reason people who are born and raised in Tennessee would cut of a limb to spend 30 minutes in Knoxville. 

I moved to JC to go to ETSU and all I can say is that it’s okay. Better than Knoxville but just very middle of the road. You have your basic chain restaurants and stores but nothing that really gives it distinct character. I’ve dated a lot of people who are locals and they think Johnson City is the smallest place on earth just because it’s not the size of Knoxville and that infuriates me (I moved here from a town of 4,000 people). They really don’t know the great resources they are blessed with in this city. 

My sister-in-law lives in Chattanooga and absolutely loves it. I’ve also heard from someone who also lived in Knoxville, Virginia, and Bristol that Chatt was his favorite place to live. You do have a lot of crime there tho but there’s museums, the aquariums, a mall, etc. More of a progressive city vibe if you’re looking for that. Then there’s the cities and towns on the outskirts. My favorite place in the whole world is Tellico Plains, TN, but you’ll have to drive about 30 minutes to even get to a rundown Walmart. 

Maybe Google Athens, TN? It’s smack in the middle of Knoxville and Chattanooga on I-75. I would say it’s rather racist tho so be very careful of that. Oh, and the schools are terrible. Dunno if you have kids.

"Alright I'm going to try to tackle all of these in order.

1. The ""stentch"" is only really in Bristol and even then not the entirety of the town. Kingsport has a paper plant downtown that smells awful when it's going also. Aside from being within a few miles of the source (more for bristol) you will never notice a stench unless you move next door to a sewage treatment plant.

2. Renting I'm not so used to as I just bought a house but a year ago it was impossible to find a place but I'm assuming that has atleast slowed down a little but may take you a few weeks/months to get in somewhere.

3. Racism now you may hear horror stories and people even claiming the same in this subreddit. But I'm a minority myself and worse case you might hear some under the breath muttering or purse clenching or well some uneducated racist assumptions ( i.e you said again so may assume good at math bad at driving). But typically racist behavior is kept in private because well its obvious it's looked down on.

4. Culture well the biggest oddity one might say is that we're very talkative. I mean you'll be in line and there's a good chance you'll know the person infront of or behind yous life story. Also it's a very Christian area so either prepare a good excuse or be prepared to be invited to a new church every 10 mins. But typically people don't care what you do as long as it doesn't interfere with whatever they are doing.

5. The internet is fine here but do look into what your choices are before settling on a spot. The 3 big players are charter (solid internet with no contract so no cancelation fees with fairly good service outtage repair times) Comcast (awful everything avoid like the plague I mean you pay at least twice the price as charter for worse internet) brightridge (they are slowly expanding fiber it has been further slowed because of covid but they have a map online that shows where they cover and areas they are expanding to with rough dates).

6. Personally I would throw Knoxville straight out of the equation it is a God awful city and honestly I can't explain how bad it is you just have to experience it. Chattanooga I'm not very familiar with but I know it has amazing internet. Finally jc I would recommend taking like a weekend vacation to the area and drive around and explore. We have a fairly decent downtown and with all the other small towns nearby there's plenty to do. But honestly I would recommend Kingsport (or other smaller area -bristol it's the stinky lands lol) your roughly 30 mins from jc if you want to do town related things and the apartments/houses are half the price but you'll be stuck with charter internet witch is very good internet honestly.",t2_5594v,tycat,0,1645664457.0,0,t1_hy6drzw,hy6drzw,True,ConsistentBread1,t3_szqzz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tricities/comments/szqzz9/considering_moving_to_johnson_city_area/,Considering moving to Johnson City area,/r/tricities/comments/szqzz9/considering_moving_to_johnson_city_area/hy6drzw/,5,r/tricities,0,5

"Lived here for over 40 years,so I think I can offer a pretty informed opinion.

Rent-is terrible for what you get. Incredibly over-priced for the area,but thats everywhere right now. We're also being flooded with tons of people from all over the country who are selling their multi-million dollar homes and buying up whatever they can here sight unseen.

Racism- We ARE a College Town and we do have a lot of international students,but this is still a very massively conservative red-state area. Asians absolutely do have to deal with discrimination in this area-stay the fuck away from Erwin and Elizabethton. Especially after dark.

The Smell-as others have noted,Bristol and Kingsport smell worse,but parts of Johnson City are bad as well. Anywhere within a 5 mile radius of the dump,which is right past downtown,is going to have issues. Also watch out for Apartment buildings that plant a shit-ton of Bradford Pears in and around the buildings. A lot of landscaping companies plant them because they look pretty,but they smell like rotting fish when they bloom.

Internet-our local electric company is Brightridge and they are slowly but surely rolling out fiber internet across JC. I have it and its awesome. Your other best option is Spectrum and they suck ass.

Jobs-our job market is horrible. Unless you plan to work at ETSU,Ballad,oe Eastman the only thing available is going to be min. wage fast-food style jobs.

Its a pretty area,especially if you like the outdoors,but there are not a lot of opportunities and you're surrounded by small-minded hillbillies.

"ill just chime in with my opinion, but it's low effort because i'm tired and just got off work. i'd pick johnson city and chattanooga over knoxville. i've spent a fair amount of time in all 3, and knoxville always felt meh for me. internet is chatt. is some of the fastest in the country. internet in johnson city and knoxville are both more than adequate for working from home. Jonesborough is where i currently live and like more than any other place in TN i've lived. there isn't really much to do, but i like that as i enjoy spending off days at home away from others. johnson city smells in some places, but it's hard to say exactly where as it isn't a constant in most places. never had an issue with smell in chattanooga or knoxville.

&#x200B;

culture is fine. it's generally kind people in my experience in all 3 places. not as much diversity as where you're from. your SO may get the occasional ""where are you from"", but in the vast majority of cases it won't be in a demeaning or derogatory manner. I honestly doubt she will have a negative experience regarding her heritage here, but it's always possible. the renting scene is same as everywhere else i'm reading about. overpriced for what you get. ive rented from UDC in johnson city and piney flats. they were easy to deal with and kept their apts in good shape

"so i moved to jc from rural northern wisconsin. i've been in jc for on/off about 10 years and i love it. its beautiful and friendly. people keep to themselves and theres a lot of pride/diversity. 

i had a phillipino roommate who worked at the VA (vets) and she loved it her too and never felt any discrimation or bad vibes. 

internet is fast, cheap, and reliable. brightridge is your best bet for fiber and there quickly expanding service (check website).

the city is rapidly expanding towards jonesboro and kingsport. the market is hot. renting is costly. we paid 850/mo to live out by milligan university but aside for high rent cost we liked it. 

a lot of people from all walks of life move to jc, not all progressive or conservative. but the govt is entirely republican. which i guess is doing good enough since taxes are low and i dont notice much crime.

"Is- No JC does not smell like Kingsport, or Bristol. The Bristol is a more recent issue though.

How- Renting SSSUUUUCCCKKKKSSSS ASSSSSSSS... lol I moved away for grad school and then moved back. Took me three months, seven deposits, and still ended up with a smaller place than I wanted. It's just so crazy here for housing right now. 

How- I would say I have not seen any prejudice against Asian people in this area. There are tons of rednecks in nearby towns though... 

How- Culture Shock- I lived here my entire life, except when I moved away for grad school. I think the thing that gets most people when they move here is that they are not prepared for how nice people from this area are. lol Like you break down, you will most likely have at least one or two people stop to help. Your neighbors will bring over a dessert when you first move in kind of stuff. I've heard from people who moved from Cali that there is such a difference here. You get the best of both worlds in this area- small town feel, bigger cities close by (Asheville, Knoxville, etc). 

How- Internet- I have Spectrum and it does just fine with a grad student mom, a teenager with a gaming laptop, and a kid with many devices. lol Brightridge does have an option for some parts of the area, but not all. Also, Fairly sure Johnson City has an incentive for those moving to the area to work from home.... Check this article for more information on who to contact if it came to fruition.

"Renting is tough everywhere right now so that may be your biggest challenge.

Johnson City is home to East Tennessee State University so there is a larger Asian population than you might expect. It's not huge, but higher than in surrounding more rural areas. For food options, there is typical Chinese and Japanese/sushi, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indian at a minimum. Korean Taco House downtown is one of my favorites. There is a Korean market, a kitchen supply store that also sells some Korean and other Asian ingredients, and Spice World which carries a lot of Indian and Middle Eastern ingredients.

Depending on where you live you can get fiber for your internet from the local utility, BrightRidge. I have this at home and it's fast and reliable with great customer service. I've been working from home for most of the last two years and it's been fine - I do a lot of Zoom, some video uploads, etc. BrightRidge has an availability checker on their website.

The stench from Kingsport or Bristol doesn't really affect us in JC. There is \*something\* that smells bad sometimes near where I live - near downtown. I've been told it's the dump but am not sure.

Crime most crimes in the area are property crimes, every once in awhile there's a murder, that generally stays in the news cycle for a week.

as far as Asian heritage, I can't speak on that, I know one person of Asian heritage personally, and she does not seem bothered by it, she is also well off so take it as it is.

Borden Park is exactly that you're looking for. Two different playground areas, basketball courts, disc golf, bathrooms.

Brickyard park is nice and new, clean bathrooms, and only one entrance/exit to the playground so it's easy to monitor the little ones

Laurel run Park is also nice a bit west of town in Church Hill, and there's another playground/park behind the food city in Church Hill. There's a splash pad area that won't open until spring.

Warriors path has the biggest playground area I've found so far, but it can be a little hard to keep an eye on the kids without moving around. 

Andrew Johnson elementary also has a nice large playground but it's only available outside school hours (heads up no public bathrooms!)

"Coping things that work (or at least help) for me, that might be helpful for your son:

Know his triggers. Not everyone's asthma is the same. Some people are triggered by, say, cats but not other animals. If you know a specific trigger, you can treat or avoid it. 

Consider seeing a pulmonologist and/or allergist if you're able. As specialists, they may be able to help your son in ways his regular pediatrician or family doctor can't. At different points, I've also found help from a chiropractor.

Exercise can help, even with exercise-induced asthma. It comes down to finding a balance. As a kid, swimming and singing were good exercises that helped me breathe deeply without overexerting. Yoga type stretches can be good too.

Stress exacerbates asthma... and pretty much every other ailment. These are high stress times, and even if kids don't understand the depth of it the way adults do, they pick up on the emotion. Look for ways to help your son relax. Maybe it's a slow, consistent bedtime routine with a warm bath. Maybe it's talking with him about what's on his mind after school each day. You know your kid, so you'll know what's good here. 

If night time is harder for him to breathe and sleep well, see if he can sleep on his side instead of on his back or stomach. I've been a night owl my whole life, due in part to asthma keeping me up late. If this is the case for him, try to work in time for him to relax and/or nap in the daytime to catch up on lost sleep.

Dry winter air makes asthma worse. I use a humidifier often in the winter. I have no recommendation on what kind to get other than find one that's easy to clean, and clean it regularly. Otherwise they can mold inside, and no asthmatic needs to be inhaling musty mist in the air. (Thus my love/hate relationship with humidifiers.)

Food and drink items that have helped me: basil, black coffee, chamomile. Chamomile is calming and may help your son relax or sleep better at night. Basil is naturally very good for respiratory health. (I discovered this while traveling abroad. It has a mild expectorant effect, and it's tasty.) Last I heard, the experts aren't sure why coffee helps, but it can. Maybe it's the caffeine. Maybe it's the warmth. Maybe it's those magic beans. Whatever the reason, I've used it as a quick help since I was a kid. If I was somewhere without my inhaler and had an attack, I'd see if I could get black coffee. 

When I was a kid, it helped so much for a parent to rub my back. When those muscles are relaxed, it makes it easier to breath. 

I hope some of this helps you and your son.",t2_8sdjralo,BraveAlathea,0,1645080398.0,0,t1_hxa20tp,hxa20tp,True,shylocxs,t3_stv2y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tricities/comments/stv2y0/local_people_with_asthma_is_it_particularly_bad/,"Local people with asthma, is it particularly bad right now?",/r/tricities/comments/stv2y0/local_people_with_asthma_is_it_particularly_bad/hxa20tp/,3,r/tricities,0,3
"Be careful about applying for too many cards, it will lower your credit score if you have too many applications within few months time. There are some predatory credit cards aimed at folks with no/low credit that have high interest & annual fees. Be very mindful of these extra expenses if you do apply. Building a strong credit history is a long game & not something you can create overnight. If you do get a card, keep your usage low & always what you could pay off immediately. 

I know it’s almost impossible to be without a car but at this point in your life being tied to a predatory car loan, especially a buy here-pay here that will sell you a salvaged, auctioned jalopy with leaky valves and a failing water pump that you then have to spend $2000 to keep running.  Take time to look for a private sale that is a well-maintained (regular oil change/maintenance) moderate mileage car. Be mindful of what potential repair expenses are for the car you choose. A sedan or small truck may be easier to upkeep than a larger or performance car.

"Co signer helps tremendously when starting out but it sounds like you might not be in a situation where that's possible. The secured visa will help build credit. You could start with a small amount. Just pay it off completely every single month so it won't build interest and whatever you do make sure to pay it off every single month or better yet you could link your bank account and your card and pay off every purchase as soon as you make a purchase. If you do pay it off right away some of the cards (I'm not sure about the secured ones) can give you some nice rewards like % off every purchase, it's like having a 3% off coupon for everything as long as you don't let it start building interest against you.

"You don't want to buy anything from a dealership. You get buy a car from somebody on Facebook marketplace for less than $2k and start there.

Honestly, the last thing you want is a loan tied to your only form of transportation. Getting it repossessed would destroy any chance you have of success

You want an older car, something pre-2000. It will save you a ton in repair costs and insurance costs. Modern cars are designed to break. Integral parts of their operation are precision engineered to fail after the warranty period to increase dealership repair costs and to incentivize you to buy another new car. Unless you have the spare money to play that game or are incredibly mechanically inclined to fix it all yourself (still expensive), I'd focus on getting an older, reliable vehicle. One of the better purchases you can make would be an older pickup truck that can actually be a bit more versatile in what you can do with it.

"Those checks are claimed in paperwork, which we are supposed to take as a fact.....as if nobody could ever possibly lie on paperwork. 

I have worked with different agencies as a direct support staff, this was part of a state/fed program providing assistance to mentally retarded people living independently as possible. I was also an lpn.

Here's a real life example I saw with my own two eyeballs at SC Jail. A woman was throwing up throughout the night, throwing up bile. She then had a seizure. She had been in over a several months, so its jot as though she was detoxing. It took over 30 mins for a nurse to respond. When she did, she disregarded what inmates were telling her happened, the lady was unconscious. She then said ""well, there's nothing we can do now"". Ummmm.....excuse me? If a patient falls in a nursing home, there's a procedure for following up. There was another inmate who was detoxing from alcohol, which doing so without any medical intervention can be deadly. The lady was dedicating herself, repeatedly. No intervention. 

EVERY county jail surrounding Sullivan has a drug protocol for inmates who are addicts/alcoholics. Why? Because withdrawing can be deadly. There's been several deaths related to that through the years. Heres another thing, when you work for a state program, you are taught how to do paperwork (obviously), but more Importantly you are taught how to do it to maximize benefits and prevent any appearance of impropriety. 

Im not 100% familiar with this case. I'm simply stating things I'm familiar with. The most important being the ease in which paperwork can be *finessed* if not flat out falsified.

EDIT: anyone else remember several years ago when there was a county employee engaging in improper relations with female inmates? There were also no charges filed in that case. I knew someone on the grand jury. They were misled, abd the charges brought I'm front of them were a lot lesser than what should have been. So, technically, they filed no charge or whatever. Truthfully, the charges were not what they should have been. So, take that how you want as well.

"Not trying to talk down about people because I know I suffer from a lack of education in many things myself, but it's a case of inherited ignorance. A lot of people have not been taught about the connections with pollution and health. Their single piece of trash seems so benign and insignificant to them. They don't even give it a thought. They were not taught to.

Take sinkholes for example. Generations of people in this and other areas like it have been unknowingly poisoning themselves by disposing of their trash in sinkholes on their property. I have participated in a few cave clean ups. They put everything down there, household trash, cars, furniture, etc. What they don't realize is that sinkhole is likely connected to the same water as their well.

My friend who does landowner relations for some caving orgs says that if you want to know if someone has a cave on their land, don't ask them about a cave, ask them if they have a hole where they throw trash.
