"Zalat and Mellow Mushroom are your best options in town, outside of town Blaze Pizza or Pie Five are pretty good. The best vegan pizza I've had in DFW was at The Loving Hut, but the one I went to is in Arlington so it'd be a bit of a drive. 

Oh, the Alamo Drafthouse in town also has a vegan pizza but idk if you can order it without seeing a movie

Supposedly Whole Foods can also do vegan pizzas at their bakery, but I haven't given it a go - there's one in Highland Village though so might be worth checking out if you're near that area. 

For general vegan info the [North TX Vegans Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/327268717465622) is pretty good, and for local places [The Denton Vegan](http://www.dentonvegan.com/) is a great resource. 

We've got [Spiral Diner](https://spiraldiner.com/denton/), [Pepitas](https://pepitasrestaurant.com/), [Soul Good](https://www.eatsoulgood.com/), and [Plow Burger](https://www.plowburger.com/) for 100% vegan restaurants, and most other restaurants around town have at least a few options. There's also [Mashup Market](https://mashupmarketandgrocery.com/) that's a vegan store that does pop-ups and food truck type stuff pretty often.

"If you like country music (or at least don't mind it) Electric Cowboy is pretty solid and probably your best bet. It's $10 for 18+ and only $5 for 21+.

Like 3-4 songs of each with common line dances in between the end of the country set and beginning of the pop (cotton eye Joe, cupid shuffle, wobble, etc). 

Otherwise, most clubs in Dallas are 21+ only with the exception of a rare night where they charge crazy high admission for a Thursday night 18+ admission. They usually have it listed on their websites buried under all the other stuff. 

You're probably out of luck.

"Hey there,

Let me start by saying I really appreciate the sincerity in your question! It's rare to see an honest attempt to try and understand someone else's viewpoint so thank you.

On Candace Owens. I've listened to a few lectures of hers and maybe a dozen podcasts guest spots she frequented a few years ago. I feel it's about 60/40 when when I agree or disagree with her talking points. Now, as for the backlash she gets, in almost every instance I can recall, there is a pattern: Candace says something, her opposition disagrees, Candace explains her source and how they led her to her opinion,  and the opposition,   rather than trying to refute her claim, attack her character with exaggerated claims. 

Attacking someone (verbally or physically) on immutable characteristics is where true bigotry happens. It is racist to call someone an uncle Tom because the term associates blind malice to an entire race of people souly based on skin color alone (betraying your own race). Moreover on what to be called when abandoning your own race: what would you  call someone who walked out on their family? Someone  who left their job in the middle of a shift? These are examples of people abandoned communities grew to trust them. They would feel a betrayal of community before feeling judged by their race.

I don't see the necessity in judging people on immutable  characteristics. We have no control over them and it has no indication of one's moral character.

"Not speaking on my opinion of Gerard at all but your comments have me thinking and they're raising questions. I'm just curious but what do you think of Candace Owens? 

Plenty of black people have called her an Uncle Tom, just go to Facebook and see all the people denouncing her.  And that's definitely speaking on race, specifically black people, there's no doubt about it! But is it racist or is it because of the race of the person that's saying it? Or is it racist because it's being used in a negative way? Is the term itself inherently racist, regardless of who is saying it?

How else would you describe a person who seemingly abandons and throws their own race under the bus for personal gain/favor with a different race than their own, who is in power/control? Is there a term for that that's race-nuetral? 

It isn't racist to say it is common knowledge that the slaves who resided in the house were known to turn their backs on their brothers and sisters in the fields, so what word would be appropriate? A traitor? Or a race-traitor? (I know that's a lot of questions, they're mostly rhetorical.)

"Where's ur source on that 600th place? What records is she decimating? Do u even know how much she won by? Or the previous ncaa years winning times in the race where she placed first? Testosterone IS the huge athletic biological advantage. Her levels are most likely around the same as her competitors so it isnt an advantage. Ur refusing to acknowledge the impact hrt has. Im biased bc i understand hrt's effects. Mack Beggs was a trans man on t who was forced to compete w women and he had a HUGE winning streak. Because of TESTOSTERONE.  Ur ignorance is very obvious.

Also, once again u said 20 yrs but ppl dont hit puberty at birth/toddler age. So if we assume she hit her fist puberty at 12 that's just 10 yrs (which is still a lot of years) but not 20. Saying 20 makes no sense.",t2_1md2i5oa,Nivekane,0,1648070606.0,0,t1_i1ul1vk,i1ul1vk,False,[deleted],t3_tka1xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denton/comments/tka1xa/steven_crowder_at_unt/,Steven Crowder at UNT,/r/Denton/comments/tka1xa/steven_crowder_at_unt/i1ul1vk/,1,r/Denton,0,1
"I did respond. You just ignored it. Two years on HRT does not erase a 20 years of male development and genetics. Her muscle type, bone structure, bone density, strength, speed are all enhanced by being male. I don't care if she placed 2nd and some random swim meet. She was ranked 600th in the nation as a man and now as a woman she is 1st. Every year 10 high school men in the US beat the women's 100yd dash world record. 


She is clearly decimating woman's records. How can you possibly claim she isn't? As a trans man  your bias is clear. You are unable to look at this objectively and you are unable to admit that their are fundamental biological advantages that males have over females. That is a fact. Sports are separated by sex for a reason. A person's gender is irrelevant when it comes to competition. Their sex should determine who they compete against for obvious reasons.",t2_lejme,CherrEbear,0,1648070119.0,0,t1_i1ujt98,i1ujt98,False,[deleted],t3_tka1xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denton/comments/tka1xa/steven_crowder_at_unt/,Steven Crowder at UNT,/r/Denton/comments/tka1xa/steven_crowder_at_unt/i1ujt98/,0,r/Denton,0,0

You didnt respond to any of MY points, instead u moved onto  ""u hate women"" to try and put me on the defensive. Ur points suck.

"And the fact that Hudspeth just cast his vote without stating any reasons or giving an explanation for voting against the ordinance is maddening. 

Not a fan of Davis either, but at least he found it in him to explain why he voted against. 

Some of Davis’ reasons for voting against are dubious, but I do see his point when he argues that framing discrimination as a criminal offense makes prosecution difficult. On the federal level, discrimination is often addressed as a civil case. In civil cases, the standard of evidence is “preponderance of the evidence”, meaning “more likely than not”, or, in percentages “50.01% likely to be the case”. This means that the complaining party only has to prove that it was “more likely than not” that the responding party discriminated against them—you have a pretty high likelihood of success. 

Now, if you frame this as a criminal statute, the standard of evidence for proving discriminatory intent becomes “beyond a reasonable doubt”, or, you have to be 99.9% sure that what you’re alleging actually took place. In this circumstance, it’s no longer sufficient to allege that (for instance) deciding not to hire someone was “probably” done under a discriminatory pretext, but you have to 99% sure that the respondent had discriminatory intent, either because they said so or because they put it in writing. Those things do happen, but they are somewhat rare in practice—as such, framing this anti-discrimination ordinance to create a civil liability for discriminatory practices might have been more effective. 

That said, it’s great to see council take a stand and expanding its commitment to non-discrimination beyond the federal bare minimum.",t2_1ej3fme6,dubya_tx,0,1648062729.0,0,t1_i1u0h5p,i1u0h5p,False,oh-swells,t3_tkul3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denton/comments/tkul3n/mayor_gerard_hudspeth_voted_against_the_non/,Mayor Gerard Hudspeth voted against the Non Discrimination Act ordinance.,/r/Denton/comments/tkul3n/mayor_gerard_hudspeth_voted_against_the_non/i1u0h5p/,8,r/Denton,0,8

"Do u know when she hit her first puberty? it probably wasnt birth or 2/3 (she's 22/23). Also, if u want to argue the benefits of bone structure & muscle fiber them that should be tested in all the competitors. Testosterone is the biggest athletic advantage. It's literally a controlled substance because cis men have used it as a PED so much.

Ur the one who's ignorant bc u have no idea what hrt can do. Ur literally ignoring biology bc u view lia as a man on estrogen -which is very obviously transphobic- (& antiandrogens, which i would argue is the most important part of hrt in competition) & u think that (cis) men will always be better athletically than (cis) women just by virtue of natural puberty. U fail to realize that hrt is just another puberty and can have such a significant impact. It's not like lia was a bodybuilder or whatever, she's a swimmer.

If u would look at lia's records, u would see that she has not only been swimming the 500 y pretty well since basically the beginning, but also that the times she is swimming now havent been like this since 2015, and even in 2015 she was faster. If you compare her 1st place winning time in the ncaa this year to 2019 & 2018, she would have got 2nd & 3rd, respectively. Also, if her ""biological advantage"" was such a big deal why did she only win one 1st place and then get 5th & 8th in the other races she placed in? Why didnt she not only place higher in those but also place at all in the 18 other races?

">Knowing when it’s ok to pull, how to carry, etc is important. I can’t imagine you’d disagree with that.

I think this falls under common sense 100% of the time.

You're not allowed to draw your firearm unless you intend to shoot to protect yourself or others from physical harm.

This handles 99% of cases and is pretty much all you need to know in regards to ""when it's okay to pull.""

As for ""how to carry"", not sure that the courts even understand the law on that yet (for example, are drop-thigh holsters legal? Depends on who you ask).

>If it doesn’t make LEOs jobs harder, why do police unions regularly not support it?

People working in government may not want the people they're policing to have additional power. Is that really so hard to understand?

>Honestly, do you know any police?

Yes, but that's irrelevant. 

>If you don’t tell police they’re still going to run your info and it comes up. Now they’re sitting there thinking “why is this guy holding out.” Does that not escalate what should be a simple exchange?

In Texas, you don't need a CHL to carry in your car - you haven't for *years.*

Now you don't need a CHL to carry in most public places either.

There is no ""info"" to run that shows ""*hey, this person is a gun owner, which means they may have a gun*"" **unless you have a CHL.** This is one of the reasons people have been fighting against registration in the first place (Texas doesn't have firearm registration in part to prevent this).

**If you have a CHL, you are required by law to disclose this to the officer.**

**If you don't, you are not required to disclose whether or not you are armed.**

This is one obvious perk of not having a CHL.

That being said, the benefits of a CHL typically outweigh the disadvantages.

>The data you provide - as argued by Matt Gaetz of all people - isn’t clear. Even your source says it’s half true.

It's politifact... a left-leaning ""fact checking"" website.

Surely you understand that ""half true"" means true... they state this directly:

>Gaetz used Uniform Crime Reporting figures compiled by the U.S. Department of Justice to create his statistics. The data come 2012.

>Gaetz then compared the total number of violent crimes (defined by federal officials as murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) with the total population in the eight states without open carry in 2012. **We checked his math and found the same result: Those states had a combined violent crime rate of about 434 per 100,000 people. The remaining 42 states had a violent crime rate of about 352 per 100,000. That means states with open carry laws did have a 23 percent lower violent crime rate that year.**

They then try to argue why this doesn't matter (which is what they do).

>Are these reduced stats due solely to open carry…or any of the 500 other reasons crime is lower in certain states. Correlation / causation…blah,blah,blah.

I'm a data analyst, so yes, I understand. The **fact** that armed guards are a deterrent is common sense. 

""*Are criminals more scared to rob somebody who is a 6'8, 250 pound bodybuilder vs an elderly woman in a wheelchair? I don't know... we need to do a study!*""

>I’m sure any LEO you talked to would consider me more of a rational adult than sone clown who thinks concealing a gun during a traffic stop is the proper thing to do.

It's funny that you're so opposed to open carry citing LEO repeatedly when LEOs literally open carry, wear vests, and ""LARP"" as you say.

"Can the training be summed up in a five minute video? Probably understating it. But could it be summed up in an hour class / video? Probably. Yet it seems like a large % don’t bother. Knowing when it’s ok to pull, how to carry, etc is important. I can’t imagine you’d disagree with that. A gun is a tool, but like any tool, you need to know how to use it. 

If it doesn’t make LEOs jobs harder, why do police unions regularly not support it? Honestly, do you know any police? If you don’t tell police they’re still going to run your info and it comes up.

Yeah, a CHL has some requirements. I have no problem with any of them. You still need a warrant to search the car or house and last I checked the 4th amendment is still a thing. 

Is carrying a deterrent? Potentially. Does it make you a clear target? Potentially. The data you provide - as argued by Matt Gaetz of all people - isn’t clear. Even your source says it’s half true. Are these reduced stats due solely to open carry…or any of the 500 other reasons crime is lower in certain states. Correlation / causation…blah,blah,blah. If I go digging I’m sure I can find that states with lower crime are more likely to have top 100 rated BBQ restaurants. Doesn’t mean a whole lot. Lies, damn lies and statistics.

>As for handing over CHL…back the blue? Is that not a thing anymore? I’m not a LEO but I’ve got plenty of LEO friends. Why make their job more difficult? If you’re a “good guy with a gun” then act like it.

What are you even talking about?

It's a fact that having a CHL means you have to jump through additional hoops during traffic stops, keeping your address updated under penalty of law, etc.

There are downsides to having a CHL in a state with constitutional carry and the ""training"" you receive can be summed up in a 5 minute video titled ""what signs to look for.""

And not telling a LEO that you have a firearm on you and handing over another form of identification doesn't make their job any harder.

You may as well argue, ""*if you're a good guy, you've got nothing to hide - just let them search your car, your house, etc.*""

This has always been a vapid argument.

>Most people I know - and there’s plenty of LEO/Military in that mix - think open carry is for clowns or guys who worked the supply line and never saw active combat.

[Who cares?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)

We were talking about [normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology\)), and you normalize something by making it normal.

>I just don’t see the point in open carry. Either from a tactical or human standpoint.

There are countless reasons to open carry. It's a deterrent, provably.

If someone is planning on robbing a 7-11 and they notice that everyone standing in line is carrying a gun, they may rethink their strategy.

Ideally, this would be a common enough occurrence that crime would drop (and it just so happens that data shows this is the case):

>""It is important to note that in the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower, the murder rate was 5 percent lower, the aggravated assault rate was 23 percent lower and robbery rates were 36 percent lower.""

>>?Lol - yeah, hitting a target a few times at 15 yards... basically a PRO AT GUNS... and, of course, you're now required by law to hand over your CHL to LEO if you're stopped and reveal where your firearm is located.

It’s more about the safety and legal training you get but if you’re all for people brandishing guns over verbal insults in a parking lot or carrying revolvers that aren’t j frame in packed purses, cool.

As for handing over CHL…back the blue? Is that not a thing anymore? I’m not a LEO but I’ve got plenty of LEO friends. Why make their job more difficult? If you’re a “good guy with a gun” then act like it. 

>>>>Secondly, as suprakilwy said, firearm ownership needs to be normalized.I saw a guy open carrying at a local store and nobody was scared - nobody was freaking out.

So you can’t read where I agreed with gun ownership but you can read people’s minds? 

>>>Most people feel the same way (and people like you reinforce this with your b.s.), so carrying becomes denormalized and people are more likely to react negatively.

You’re basing “most people” on what? Most people I know - and there’s plenty of LEO/Military in that mix - think open carry is for clowns or guys who worked the supply line and never saw active combat. 

Again, I’m all for carrying. I have 4 guns. My wife has 1. My teen boys have a .22 to learn function & safety. My oldest daughter is going to the range for the first time with me this weekend. You don’t see me talking about “assault rifles” or those dang “semi-automatics.” While I don’t own anything like an AR-15, I see the value in it, especially for pig hunting. Cuz fuck those things..

I just don’t see the point in open carry. Either from a tactical or human standpoint. I’ve been told it’s to “send a message to politicians” but I don’t see that as a viable reason. 

If I do see somebody open carrying, I just laugh internally. Maybe count the number of skulls they have on their shirt. But that’s it. No scene. No reinforcing any negativity.

"I think it rubs me the wrong way because I keep seeing it used in a derogatory/dehumanizing way. If someone used female as an adjective, that’s different for me personally. For example, If someone referred to me as a female graduate of such and such school, no big. I think my discomfort comes from it being the only descriptor that throws me off. USUALLY when I see it used as the only descriptor it’s used by pick-up artists or in another sexualized context. So I definitely associate it with that.

"Full text:

The Denton City Council adopted a long-debated nondiscrimination ordinance Tuesday after it repeatedly stalled.

Council member Jesse Davis and Mayor Gerard Hudspeth were the sole dissenting votes.

Protected classes under the ordinance, which does not supersede state or federal law, are race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation and gender identity.

That last protected class was the subject of the most ardent opposition among locals and some elected officials alike.

The ordinance applies to housing, employment and public accommodations, and it was written to mirror existing state and federal statutes as much as possible.


Complaints of discrimination filed under the ordinance must be filed within 90 days of the offense and will be referred to state and federal agencies wherever possible.

“At this time, all complaints related to employment or housing on the list of protected classes could be referred [to other government agencies],” according to the presentation given to council members ahead of their Tuesday vote.

For all other valid complaints, the city would investigate the alleged breach and attempt conciliation with the offending party.

If found to be in violation, a guilty business, for example, could be charged with a Class C misdemeanor.

Opposition to the criminal aspect of the ordinance was one of Davis’ main stated reasons for voting against the ordinance.

“We will see fewer prosecutions because this is a criminal offense — not more,” Davis said Tuesday before voting no.

He leaned on his experience as a prosecutor in saying that proving intent is incredibly difficult and will bog down the ordinance.

Davis said he has been shocked by discriminatory things he has witnessed and heard of in town over the years, and that nothing within his faith required him to oppose the ordinance. In fact, he proposed a narrower nondiscrimination ordinance to council members years ago.

He also claimed there are valid, non-bigoted reasons to exclude certain people from bathrooms, locker rooms and other similar facilities. He proposed an amendment to the ordinance Tuesday night that would have removed requirements for businesses to allow people to use the restroom that conforms to their gender identity.

That amendment failed for want of support from any other council member.

Mayor Hudspeth was the only council member not to explain the rationale of his vote before casting it.

The council chambers at City Hall were nearly full Tuesday evening before the public hearing to discuss the nondiscrimination ordinance began. Six people submitted cards showing their support for the ordinance but did not speak publicly Tuesday.

The first two speakers staged performances to display their opposition. The first gave what audience members clearly saw as a hyperbolic parody of a family member concerned about discrimination in various forms.

He was heckled with calls of “troll” and “get a new hobby” by audience members after his performance, and Hudspeth called a break before the second speaker was allowed to take the mic.

“Can we get a five-minute break to wipe that all down?” he asked staff members.

Before the second speaker, who was wearing a tiger-striped blazer and carrying a guitar, approached, Hudspeth told the audience to “hold it together or give me a wink if [your comments] are for a YouTube page.”

That speaker performed a couple of minutes of a song parody disparaging female athletes who are transgender set to the tune of the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.”

A chorus of “trans lives matter” briefly muffled his song until a Denton police officer told people to simmer down.

What followed were 14 speakers who urged council members to pass the nondiscrimination ordinance. Appeals to morality, Christian virtue, compassion and economic sense were leveled at council members for roughly the next hour.

Among the 14 was George Ferrie, a local business owner who twice ran unsuccessful bids for a place on the City Council.


Ferrie spoke as a local who has fought for a nondiscrimination ordinance in Denton, and campaigned on its passage, for years.

“Today is a good moment, and I don’t want to let the first two speakers take that away from me,” he proudly said as he urged others to keep their chins up.

The five council members who voted in favor of the ordinance similarly spoke of the long process that built up to Tuesday night’s vote, but Deb Armintor said this was only part of the protections activists hope to eventually pass in the city.

After the vote, ordinance supporters gathered outside City Hall to celebrate the victory. Rainbow-striped masks bobbed above the cold bricks. Hugs, pictures and flag-waving spread in the happy huddle.

Among them was Kathleen Hobson, who is a former member of the steering committee for OUTreach Denton, founding executive board member of PRIDENTON and director of the Pride Alliance at the University of North Texas.

“I’m feeling euphoric and really, I think, kind of in disbelief because even though we were hoping that this is the way that it would turn out, this is something that has been such a long time coming,” Hobson said.

As for what’s next, Hobson said they would support a push to ban conversion therapy in Denton.

Carmen Cruz, a founder of OUTreach Denton and PRIDENTON, was with the joyful crowd Tuesday night celebrating and looking to what’s next.

She said the first serious talks about what would become the city’s nondiscrimination ordinance happened after an OUTreach Denton meeting roughly six years ago.

“I am feeling extremely satisfied and seen in the community,” Cruz said.

She spoke to the work of so many people that culminated in Tuesday night’s 5-2 vote.

“It truly takes a village,” she said.

Council member Armintor first proposed a nondiscrimination ordinance in 2018, but talks repeatedly stalled. The most recent iteration began in June 2021 when council members asked for a work session to take up the issue again.

Members pushed along a draft of the current ordinance in November that included much of the current framework. A revised version came back to the council on Jan. 4.

A public comment window was open from Jan. 18 until Feb. 15, and a public hearing was held on Feb. 15.

The ordinance will officially take effect 120 days after the city’s vote Tuesday. That delay is intended to give city officials time to bring affected entities up to speed on the ordinance.

Earlier estimates placed an annual cost to the city somewhere in the $30,000-50,000 range to carry out the ordinance.",t2_5r1c3,Lexrst,0,1648037544.0,0,t1_i1s9zev,i1s9zev,True,Lexrst,t3_tksfcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denton/comments/tksfcm/denton_passes_its_first_nondiscrimination/,Denton passes its first nondiscrimination ordinance,/r/Denton/comments/tksfcm/denton_passes_its_first_nondiscrimination/i1s9zev/,45,r/Denton,0,45

"This is a fair question. I'll include some good resources for burgeoning antifascists at the end.

In person: you won't have a lot of cues. Oftentimes visible tattoos can be helpful, and you can watch for iconography that is consistent with far right beliefs. The obvious are swastikas or the double lightning ""s."" Group affiliations such as W.A.R. (white Aryan resistance) or a cross protruding beyond the lines of a circle (associated with Stormfront), III for three percenters or the laurels and ""PB"" for the proud boys, oathkeepers commonly use a kind of stylized key image, iron eagles are common, as are iron crosses although the latter pops up in multiple cultures. Gang affiliated tattoos tend to be concealed among other artwork, but are commonly in visible places.

Decorations, bumper stickers etc: watch for dog whistles, anything that references zionism, global bankers, etc. Most common conspiracy theories feed into neo nazi propaganda, so watch out for flat earth stuff, qanon, illuminati, lizard people, false flag mass shootings and the like. Common references that support extrajudicial vigilantism tend to be picked up by fascists, a common one recently has been the punisher skull, many on the far right also like to invoke figures like Augosto Pinochet and ""free helicopter rides,"" I saw more of that around Vancouver, WA though than I do down here. 1776 flags.

Online: any of the above. Almost any reference to ""pilling"" as this reference to The Matrix has been largely co-opted by extremists. Look for overtly stereotypical representations of marginalized groups being presented in memes. References to white genocide. Etc. They're usually easier to spot online, but the culture is insidious as this is where they do most of their recruiting.

I graduated from UNT a long time ago, but we used DEXA machines back when I was there to verify this type of data on a daily basis (any decent medical university has access to one). 

In regards to Bone Mineral Density decrease:

>""Similarly, after a year of estrogen therapy, a male sexed body will have testosterone levels consistent with female bodies, decreased muscle mass and bone density and increased body fat that will be positioned in female fat patterns...

>Trans individuals may raise suspicion in sport...
Uninformed coaches, parents, administrators, or teammates may think trans athletes should be on a different team or that they have an unfair advantage. Neither of these beliefs is true (cf. Lucas-Carr & Krane, 2011)....The athlete has no innate physical advantage beyond that of any highly skilled competitor (e.g., they may be taller, stronger, or faster than average); there are no cross-sex physical advantages. (Krane & Symons, in press)... "" 

-George Cunningham, The Center for Sport Management Research and Education

>""...Treatment of adults with GnRH analogues resulted in loss of BMD...""

Hormones:
Estrogen assists in BMD in *low* doses. In high doses (which is necessary during MtF HRT) it becomes detrimental. It increases your risk for cancer, cardio vascular disease, tumors, osteoporosis, joint fatigue and joint frailty… 

For example, postmenopausal women worried about bone loss have been urged to try other drugs instead. That’s because results from the hormone trials show over the long term, a standard dose of estrogen poses certain health risks — especially when combined with a conjugated estrogens such as Premarin (which is what is used in Gender Reassignment Surgery and Therapy).

Further:

>Within nine months of starting hormone therapy in 2004, [JOANNA HARPER- PhD in physics and medicine] was running 12% slower.

Which both bothered her as a competitor and intrigued her as a scientifically curious person - so she started collecting data. She got race teams from eight transgender women before and after hormone therapy. One of the effects of reducing testosterone is reducing hemoglobin, which carries oxygen-rich red blood cells throughout the body. It provides fuel for endurance athletes. And with less, the athletes slow down, which is what happened in Harper's study. Collectively, the women were more than 10% slower after therapy.

And that's an important number because that's the difference between serious male distance runners and serious female distance runners - 10- to 12% sort of range.

In 2015,  She then wrote the book ""Sporting Gender"" and helps sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee craft policies in the middle - inclusive of transgender female athletes and restrictive by requiring them to undergo hormone therapy.

> Dr. Eric Vilain, a Washington, D.C.-based geneticist and expert on sex differences, said Harper's research has been groundbreaking.

Too that, the playing field has never been ""even.""

> The guidelines, which are employed by most sports federations, also established that trans female athletes must maintain testosterone levels below 10 nanomoles per liter. That’s on the far low end for most cisgender males but higher than average for cisgender women, whose testosterone typically falls between 0.3 and 2.4 nanomoles per liter.


>But, cisgender women with polycystic ovary syndrome and some other conditions can have levels three times that — or even higher. Nearly a third of elite adolescent female athletes have relatively elevated testosterone, compared to just 2 to 12 percent of the general female population. Female Olympians also tend to have higher levels than age-matched controls.​

"Having came from a communist country where saying anything about the government could get you arrested, beaten, and then delivered back to your family in a casket, I know very well what the 1st Amendment means. As for ""transphobic"" speech, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the protection of ""hate speech"" a multitude of times, to include speech otherwise that would be racist, transphobic, or derogatory. Important note to mention that they have also stated that that protection stops when it incites some form of illegal action. 

But, how is it that you determined Crower did this is bad faith? Of course he is biased to his viewpoint, but so is anyone that sits down and converse with him. Why is it that someone who is willing to engage with opposing viewpoints as well as provide objective statements that could be challenged, be doing so in bad faith? He never said that you couldn't challenge his belief, opinions, or statements, he encourages you to; and that's the entire reason why people of both the political spectrum engages in his Change My Mind segments. 

Given that the vast majority of college campuses and also the statistical likelihood of a more left leaning student body, wouldn't be beneficial to insert an opposition viewpoints for these students to engage with? How else are you going to develop your opinions and ideas without being challenged? And having attended UNT for 3 years now, I can absolutely guarantee that it is very left leaning. Having a productive and civil discussion in a classroom is painful, even some professors repeat misinformation. 

A good example is the topic of guns in my prior Political Science class, the professor stated wrong facts about guns, and was corrected by the few students. However the statements he made was parroted by other students and continues to be. Another example is in Morals and Ethics, feminism was a topic for the week and only a couple of students (myself included) could actually engage with the other students as the opposition. Hell, we had a girl cried and slander us after the fact, with VERY angry comments of ""no you're wrong"" ""shut up"" ""toxic"" for simply stating my end of the discussion, which was the premise of that class session.

"Except he also encouraged professors to sit down and talk...of course they declined, but the reasoning is probably beyond just ""losing"" a ""debate"". The Change My Mind segments, if you ever actually watch them, are quite good. The problem with our colleagues is that they don't really state hard facts and who can blame them? They haven't prep the material before hand. However, challenging ones views and discussing it is the basic fundamental of any democracy, something we have lost overtime. It's not about winning or losing to a view, it's about actually getting to interact with a different (and opposing) viewpoint. 

This opens up the bubble that a lot of college students might find themselves in, due to either selectively hanging out with like-minded individuals or due to content and search results being tailored to fit their views. It's not harmful for our development as critical thinkers at all, instead, it actually allows that process to happen. If you hang out with people who shares your exact view points and you shut down or block everyone who doesn't, how are you, as an individual, going to be able to saturate themselves with any opinions and viewpoints other than your own? There's a reason why devil's advocate exists and people practices it to combat opposing viewpoints, but to do so, they themselves have to have a level of understanding of the opposing view point. 

But in conclusion, it's America, the only country where protected free speech is written into the highest law of the land. Respect others 1st amendment rights and of course, expect the same from others. Instead of acting like an absolute jackass and talking over or shutting down someone practicing their rights because you disagree with them, figure out why they think that way and engage in conversation.

"Well, at face value, what his sign says is accurate- males should not be allowed to compete in womens sports. Obviously he is being purposely obtuse to stir up debate, and thus content, but even when you recognize what he’s actually saying, in this case, I don’t fully disagree. I fully support trans people in their life decisions and I believe they deserve to live a happy life of fulfillment like anyone else. 

That being said, in my opinion, while you can change social norms, you can’t ignore the biological component when it comes to athletic ability. Even after HRT, many trans women are still very masculine and display physical ability typical of men. I can understand how that feels like a slap in the face to female athletes, especially considering the hardships women have already faced through history just to have a seat at the table. 

On the hand, we want to be inclusive of one group, but it isn’t fair to let it be at the detriment of another group that already faces their own issues in society. 

I don’t know what the solution is, but I can very much understand people’s issues with allowing trans women to compete in cis-womens sports, especially as it pertains to women’s rights.",t2_7nlp0,sonofabee,0,1647992194.0,0,t1_i1q931c,i1q931c,False,[deleted],t3_tka1xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denton/comments/tka1xa/steven_crowder_at_unt/,Steven Crowder at UNT,/r/Denton/comments/tka1xa/steven_crowder_at_unt/i1q931c/,6,r/Denton,0,6
