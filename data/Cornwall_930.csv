"Honestly I find at the end of the day, Cornwall is what you make of it. (Like any place). I was born here. I was raised in the ‚Äúbad‚Äù part of town. I still live here, downtown area. Sure, my car‚Äôs been broken into a few times, but I‚Äôve never felt unsafe walking down the streets at night. It‚Äôs not likely someone‚Äôs going to mug me or shoot me or whatever. So dangerous? Nah. Wouldn‚Äôt consider it dangerous. Boring? Sometimes. Like others have said though, we‚Äôre on the up and up.

"Fit4Less has a pretty good range for beginners up to more experienced lifters. Website says $7 every two weeks, it‚Äôs good bang for your buck. Same amount of machines, maybe a few more than PlanetFitness. They‚Äôre the most modern machines

Summit has a bit more machines than the other two, it‚Äôs got a lot of experienced and serious lifters - not very quiet at all. I think it‚Äôs $20 every two weeks. Oldest equipment but good range of machines

"A little update

So I have a appointment on December 26th in Ottawa to see doctor to talk about starting female hormones

I have some health issues that might keep me from starting hormones

But I will find out talking with doctor

I guess I will get a blood workup
So the doctor will know what is going on with my body

I am a plus size person so I guess you could say I have a small B cup
If I pull them together and tape them

I figure if I start hormones I could be a C or D cup

All the woman in my family have been big breasted

Right now I have breast forms

48dd and bras 

I think I need female femininizing surgery

I am saving for that but if I can not get on hormones might have to add a couple of thousand for breast implants

As I have roommates I do not dress all the time

I guess when I am ready
I will have to get a place of my own

Somewhere on here I posted looking for someone to get a place with

Any ways that is my little update for anyone interested

I guess posting here is in a way a public diary

Rental places can‚Äôt actually ban you from having a pet.  I would just not mention the dog, if it‚Äôs causing issues with her finding a place.  It may be different if it‚Äôs just a room in a shared house/apartment though.  
Lastly, when I was looking for a rental place, I had trouble because I‚Äôm on ODSP.  I started mentioning that ODSP will pay my rent directly, so there is no worry about not having rent paid.

Turn right out of the parking lot onto Tollgate, drive down Pitt St., Left onto 13th at the DQ, then you take a few turns to get back onto Pitt (with a right turn), all the up Pitt again then right onto Tollgate. From there you take a left onto McConnell and take the on-ramp heading west. You‚Äôll take the exit on Pitt (or Brookdale) and make your way back to the department on Tollgate. 

Forgot to mention before the first right onto Pitt, they‚Äôll ask you to turn right onto Heritage and do some parallel parking (don‚Äôt forget to turn your tires towards the curb and set the E-brake!) and then a three point turn to get out of there.

">I just don't think there's any value in offering a discount for vacant properties

That's not what I'm talking about.

The hotc CIP leverages increased tax base to fund development improvements.

A dilapidated house is assessed at $60k, they pay $1500 in taxes. A CIP would pay you to improve the property from future tax income. So you redevelop your home and the assessed value climbs to $120k, but the homeowner still only pays $1500 a year until the cost of improvements is paid off (or a time limit is reached, usually 5-10 years) , then the city collects the full tax value of $3k per year forever. It doesn't cost the city anything, because without the program the tax base wouldn't increase.

">suitable options

That's they key.

Cornwall has a vacancy rate of 4.1, higher than any of the surrounding area. A vacancy rate of 3 is considered healthy. We do not lack for rentals. Theres plenty of places, just they're trash piles no self respecting person would live in. 

Charging slum landlords isn't going to improve things. It'll make it worse, because now instead of spending money on repairing places they can't rent, they'll be spending it on taxes (which the city will probably spend in Riverdale or north of the 401).

Housing costs are up across the nation, and not specific to Cornwall. The housing boom is really related to record breaking cheap credit for 15 years running then anything else. 

Cornwalls population has been stagnant for 10 years. Yet Cornwall's permit starts are consistently setting new records every year baring 2020. There is no shortage of new builds. But if the population is stagnant... What's the logical conclusion? That lower quality places will be vacant. 

If someone is going to buy strictly as an investment, do you really think they're buying in Cornwall? There are dozens of better markets to invest in.

So maybe instead of charging people, we should focus on making our community a better place to live to attract new people and to convince our slum landlords that it's worth investing in property they already own here in cornwall. 

A vacancy tax only works if landlords are *choosing* not to rent, in Cornwall the problem is they *can't* rent them, cause they're shit and for every new person in cornwall, someone leaves. We don't have a glut of new buildings sitting empty, we have a glut of old buildings sitting empty. We need to tailor the solution to the problem, not just pick a solution that worked (maybe) somewhere else and slap it on our problem.",t2_7ag4i,drae-,0,1610417237.0,0,t1_giydwes,giydwes,False,drae-,t3_kv6wmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CornwallOnt/comments/kv6wmo/tax_vacant_cornwall_properties_to_increase/,"Tax vacant Cornwall properties to increase rentals, councillor proposes",/r/CornwallOnt/comments/kv6wmo/tax_vacant_cornwall_properties_to_increase/giydwes/,1,r/CornwallOnt,0,1

"I think this only works if there's a demand for housing. If the demand isn't there for like 98% of Cornwall's rentals, this just hurts landlords and siphons away funds that could be use to improve the property, increasing it's appeal, and therefore it's likelihood to be leased.

The stated goal is to increase affordable housing, but Cornwall already has a glut of affordable housing - that no one wants to live in. Just because it works for Vancouver (and that could be debated) doesn't mean it'll work for Cornwall. Unlike Vancouver, I don't think there's an incentive in Cornwall to leave property vacant, rather if a property is vacant, it's likely because it's undesirable.

Perhaps focus on rehabilitating the affordable homes we already have, maybe with some sort of tax increment grant like the Heart of the City targeting la village housing, or the Brownfields CIPs.

"An issue will be the inventory of houses on the market. If there are only a few houses in a given price range then yeah that's would potentially be a bidding war.

"Anything near the water body really? with rising water levels....do you remember the Quebec Flooding drama, Gov using wrong maps allowing people to buy in Flood prone areas and then offering them 50% price of the property to buy back from them and Insurance companies refusing to insure such properties? our memories are just too short. I am not against area dynamics but being near a water body, this fact cant be overlooked.

"I just moved here from Toronto last year.

It's very different from Toronto, but in exactly the ways I was looking for. Its incredibly quiet, lots of nature, very few people. I don't drink and I'm not all that social but I have found plenty to keep myself busy, even in winter the trails by the waterfront are beautiful and teeming with wildlife. 

Transit is reliable within the city, but getting to places like Ottawa or Montreal can be expensive because you have to rely on VIA Rail. No service on Sundays, which was a pain at first because I kept forgetting, but I got used to it pretty quickly.

Lots of people here speak French, but everyone speaks English.

The appliances thing, I dont know. I'm renting a 3 bedroom house with backyard for $900 + utilities and it still works out to about half of what I was paying in Toronto, so having to purchase appliances wasnt a deal breaker for me. 

Apparently I live in the ""bad"" part of town, it's nothing compared to what I've lived in in Toronto. Mostly just poor people with too many kids. Mind your business and keep your place secure and you'll be fine. Not had any problem whatsoever with anyone here.

"I‚Äôm from Cornwall, went off to York for a bachelors in film studies and stayed in Toronto for three years after living downtown and you know what. IT IS unreasonably expensive over there.

I remember hearing that Cornwall has some of the cheapest real estate so I moved back to also be close with family. Hell, you can still buy a house here for 100k. A shit hole nonetheless but the same thing in hog town would be 3 to 4 times more expensive. I keep hearing rumblings in town that it‚Äôs on the up.

"I pulled the trigger on this about two years ago, after realizing that I didn't want to pay Toronto prices when I didn't actually utilize the reason those prices exist - I work remotely, and hated going downtown. I rented here for a year and then bought a house I love, something I never expected to do growing up in TO. 

Cornwall has surprisingly decent food options, great little community options for things to do (local theatre, board game groups, etc), and isn't so bilingual that Toronto folk will have problems.

As mentioned the transit here is much simpler, and it's a fairly car-focused city. That said there is some decent bike lane coverage once the snow dies down, and lots of trails for exploratory cycling too.

If you like going out and doing things four or five nights a week, Cornwall may not be the place for you. It's getting better and I'd say in ten or fifteen years we'll see a pretty significant shift and good bump in city growth in a younger demographic, but for now it's pretty sleepy until you find the right places and people.

"1. Transit is no Gta Transit. I loved GTA transit, i could always get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time. Cornwall has transit every half hour during the week. Saturdays is hourly and then turns to half hour i believe. Sunday's or holidays do not have any service.

2. Safest areas: East of McConnell North of Second. East of the eastcourt mall is safe South of second as well. South of Montreal is to be avoided. Downtown is to be avoided (South of 9th, east of brookdale, north of Montreal, west of McConnell). North of 9th Street is pretty much decent. West of brookdale in the Riverdale area is as well.

3. Interesting things: not really. There's some local theater groups if that's your thing, but there aren't really all that many things to do

"Been using Carrytel for a while ($30/month for 40Mbit) and have only minor things to say. Speed is great...have never been throttled, though I don't do much downloading.

Carrytel is a small carrier that piggybacks off one of the big guys (can't remember which) so I had to wait a week or so for install. Not a big deal though.

The other thing is their billing timing is a bit odd. They bill you for the month, 21 days before the month starts.

"On a busy weekend, if it gets backed up to Cornwall island you could wait up to 30-45 minutes. Depending on what the reason is. Like if it's busy because the powwow is happening, it should move relatively fast since most would be coming from Cornwall island (assuming they are leaving the powwow), because then they don't have to go through all of the questioning since they are coming from Canada. 

On the other hand, if there is a holiday in the States and they are making their way from across the border, your wait time would be longer as they have to answer all the questions that CBSA has and declare anything that they have to declare. 

It's hard to tell what your wait would be since it's a mixed corridor. It could be 45 minutes or it could be 45 seconds.
