"I'm a hermit, so I have no real input, but I like some of the events that come around.

Energetic Amazing Race is a blast

Pride walk makes me proud of this town, even if people also protest against it as well

When people are down, FSJ seems to rally around them. Like when someone dies tragically, or there's a fire, or something. Granted, you have to have kids or no one cares, but people DO rally and it's amazing to see.

Winter Fest makes me smile every year.

While the farmers market isn't SUPER diverse, getting local produce and such is amazing.

Honestly, I see a lot of options for kids, even if people say there aren't. To me, there's a lot less for adults to do that's affordable or not sports-based.

"stay calm.

If the bear is just non-chalantly grazing or other activities, maintain your distance but face it's direction to let it know you know he/she is there too as you continue to make distance. go back the way you came if it makes you more comfortable. consider the safety of the others you are with.

They will stand up if surprised to both make themselves appear larger to a potential threat and get higher up for a better scent pull.

An aggressive bear usually has a low swinging head with ears back, a loud popping/snapping noise as they fluctuate their jaws, hair standing up on their back (very difficult to actually tell the difference). They often do a bluff charge where they will change directions immediately at the last moment. You may need to change your pants after just this..

A bear with cubs will usually never bluff. You are likely in some serious trouble with mama bear. They are often trying to eliminate the perceived threat (you) so it's recommended to normally not fight back.

Make yourself big if you feel threatened. Arms up, waving, make noise with your voice or other noise makers (_stay away from whistles and other high pitched devices they can sound like an injured rabbit, rocks in a can work_).

whatever you do, don't run, ever. Try to avoid climbing a tree as you will have a strong urge to - black bear will climb up and pull you off like a kabob and if the grizzly is not too heavy it can likely climb up after you as well or if not, dig out roots and push the tree over. They are extremely intelligent and persistent animals. This is their world and they will do whatever they think is necessary to survive. You're a visitor.

If a grizzly does attack, you can often be as stuff as possible lying down on your stomach. Avoid fighting back if you can. Spread your legs out to prevent it from flipping you over. Protect your neck as much as possible. Grizzlies will likely (_not always - bears are like people and all different and can be unpredictable_) stop attacking when prey are subdued to bury and cache for later.

"/u/TheStateIsImmoral is 100% correct - the stereotype surrounding the word ""redneck"" is the problem, and usually describes a shitty type of human being.

Getting away from the stereotype of ""ignorant"" and ""racist"" and ""homophobic"" is the big thing, imho.

As someone who falls under multiple parts of the rainbow, I make the rude assumption of someone's personality as soon as I hear/see them describe themself as a redneck, as my experiences in and out of school have been negative.

I like meeting people who fall under the redneck category who show what being a redneck really is, instead of just the hate.",t2_68vuq,EmeraldLight,0,1646954290.0,0,t1_i066c3n,i066c3n,True,[deleted],t3_tb0mjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortStJohn/comments/tb0mjz/being_a_redneck_has_always_seemed_to_me_something/,Being a redneck has always seemed to me something one should overcome not something one should embrace.

"I grew up as a skater/hip hop head. So I was never a “redneck” per se. My dads side of the family is straight out of the backwoods of West Virginia. So I did grow up shooting guns, camping, being outdoors, etc…

Now, in my mid 30’s, the “redneck” life appeals to me, more than ever. In a world of constant flowing information, and high paced, stressful environments, all I want is to just get a piece of land, go to work, shoot guns, hunt and raise my family. 

I think a lot of people confuse “redneck” with “white trash.” In my opinion, redneck just means a country type of lifestyle.

"What’s really frustrating to us thinking people when trying to have a conversation with you people (and yes I mean you people in the Don Cherry sense of the term) is how you make up your own definitions of words. You define communism and fascism as nothing more than authoritarianism and you define as authoritarian as best as I can discern as any limitations on your personal freedom that you don’t agree is legitimate. The fact is that these terms do not mean exclusively what you’ve decided they mean. Communism means the public ownership of the means of production. In Canada the means of production are owned by private capitalists making Canada a capitalist country. Fascism admittedly is a hard term to define but is best described by the 14 characteristics of fascism developed by Dr Lawrence Britts. None of the characteristics developed by Dr Lawrence can be found being exhibited by the Canadian government.

"Yes, you are fine.

There's basically 3 types of people here: locals (born and raised here, great grandparents born and raised here etc), oil workers (can be here anywhere from a few months to decades), and transplants (like yourselves, people who came from elsewhere for work that is not in the oil and gas industry).

I find the locals to be perfectly nice and normal, if a little 'rurally biased'. I wouldn't say redneck, but definitely conservative as a base.

The rig pigs and oil patch workers are the ones with the 'Fuck Trudeau' stickers and whatnot, they are the ones most likely to be vocally anti-vaxx and maskless.

Transplants are just normal people from all over, so you get a mix.

">These arguments are perfectly fine until someone gets their panties in a twist because a private business kicks them out for refusing to wear a mask

Private businesses have every right to refuse service to anyone, for whatever reason. I go even further and apply it to things like race, religion and sexuality. 

But here’s the thing…the vast majority of businesses have no interest in discriminating against people, and alienating a portion of their customer base.

The problem is, it’s not, by and large, businesses that are mandating these things. It’s the government. 

>Or when you're ""just a bit sick"" and you decide to go out anyways.

Sure. Don’t be an asshole. Most people stay home when their sick, and have since the before times. 

But having said that, I don’t think I have the right to force people to lock themselves in their homes. Once again, I’m responsible for my own health. 

>Linking this to your children's freedoms is nonsense, but given your username I shouldn't be surprised.

No the fuck it isn’t. Children are being devastated by this. And frankly, I don’t give a fuck if you think it’s nonsense, or not. I will fight for the future of my children and I will never use them as human shields to protect the older generations, myself included.

"No you are not safe here. I will clarify that you are most likely physically safe as long as you don't stick your neck out. Mentally though, not so much. The last couple of years have shown how deluded the average person is here.
The region has had more money than sense on and off since the 60's with the boom and bust cycle of the oil and gas industry.  Kids can make more money in the patch than they could ever hope to from a college career path in many cases. And this fosters the mindset that they would make all the money in the world if it weren't for those 'damn libs' always meddling with the industry, and it is easier to be angry at some far of boogeyman than it is to try to find solutions.
I have to fend off politically charged conversations at work on the regular, have been followed and harrassed at Safeway twice, and have had to watch my grandmother slowly cut herself off from her siblings due to the fact that they are too far down the rabbit hole and are not willing to even take the most basic precautions.

One of which clowns? Vaccinated people contract and spread Covid, as well. I’m pretty sure you can’t even go into a nursing home, unless you’re vaccinated. Could be wrong, though.

In our time here, haven't been verbally harassed or given degrading looks from anyone in public for being gay. There is a pride group for the peace region that's centered in FSJ that we talked to when we got here but nothing really came from that.

"Machinist here that recently moved away from fsj. 

It was a good place to do an apprenticeship, lots of oil and gas work which is kinda niche but you can apply those skills to other sectors. I think most shops are mainly manual with small cnc capacity. One issue is demand fluctuates with the price of oil and gas so watch for that. 

The real downside is the city itself. It feels like a southern state with conspiracy theorists and right wing nuts. The management at my work were telling us not to vote for Trudeau if we wanted to keep our jobs. There’s garbage all over the city and any time a new playground opens there’s someone to graffiti it the first night. It could be a great place but with the amount of people in and out for work it seems like nobody cares to take care of the place.

"Funny how opinion can turn into “ complain “.


Busy summer?  maybe few ppl should not have  multiple jobs / bus but focusing on town improvements only. That’s what they sign up for not just a few hand shake pic taken and post on fb. 

I never say this town have too much empty lot, it’s the over spending budget planning that fail. You think all the empty lots won’t be pick up by some rich folks and hold on to it forever like the block of northern light hotel? It’s all about who know who inside and when is the right time for them to buy it with below expectations cost.

It was over budgeting spending with a fail calculations or worst-  people have no idea of how to budget and did the job and go ahead and approved it. And now hit another approve button for more cash injection to any projects. Have you wonder why ppl don’t involve much when it come to voting? It’s pointless . in this town when it comes to decisions like this. Building dog park, renew 100 because no matter what you sent, the city will goes with what they think it’s best for the town. Name me a thing that they ask for public opinion for a projects that will spend an arm / leg and city listen to what we want and decline it. Please fill me in. Im not talking about just a hot pizza lunch cancel type event/ projects. Im talking about a freaking dog park that cost how much? 

Now call me beat it to death. Who gave you the number of the percentage voters turn out? The city? one of the famous quote that hitler said “you want to control the dumb citizens you need to control their eyes andand ear - control the media” 

Yes the 100 is “ supposed “ to be fixing up the old pipe that is something that we need to wait and see in the Napa auto transaction- will they flood again this year if there’s heavy rain fall. 

Why can’t they just did the job for the past few year that they dig up 100? 
Fancy move, weak results. How many time people almost have accidents with the right turning line? 


Yes Is it much difficult to say then done but for those who only think “ oh give them a break” will never improve the the society. Look at how our Trudeau give lots of people a break when it’s covid, free money but yet turn around tax tho who still have to work and get income. 

here is my 2 cent for how money flow in town for hard working individuals and the immediate solution for this snow removal crap. 

We have multiple local Snow removal company why can’t we have multiple contracts set up to divide the city in different sector ? Each contractors take over a piece of the sector in the city. We can create so much more jobs in town and push for local business and the money stay local. Since it’s multiple contract, if one company fail to clean up one block one street, then the other contractor can take over the block as their new area. and get paid when jobs done. And each street and block have the contact information for that local snow removal contractor info. If they fail to preform all the  city need do is to answer the damn ph and send inspector over , did the inspection, assign others local contractors take over that street cleaning right away. It’s snow, not cleaning dust, snow only happen with in a few weeks of a month. Not every day. Multiple contracts means more unit available. Who ever sign up for the contract of cleaning up the street they Damn sure understand the consequences of the maintenance will be out of their pocket. Not more from tax payers. if they can’t do it, then next year city block them for bidding. The each business get more money/ income. Spend back, pay tax and do it again. There an health accounting cycle.

"You speak of flooding every year and complain about 100 st rework in the same sentence. The whole reason they ripped up 100 st was to repair and upgrade the underground utilities, including the storm sewer. 

Council has a tough task to spend money to maintain and upgrade municipal facilities and infrastructure while not over spending. 

Do you think they do not listen to what the citizens have to say about new projects like the dog park? It was the most voted for addition to the city and is very busy in the summer.

You complain that they spend too much money on projects and you also complain that we have too many empty lots in town. To build things on those lots requires money, which has to fit into the city budget.

One final thought, you say we ""sweep it under the rug"". I would absolutely love to hear your solution to the snow removal issue.

"Not just base on this snow removal thing ( but it’s a build up) The budgeting/ and the improvements end result. 100 street line change/ Dog park, Condill Hotel and now the rcmp building.

Not gonna lie I personally think of all this family/ fun activities that the city host is awesome, bring some life into this town and all that, those are the tax money well spend.

Yes agree. By law in BC we have to have winter tires ( with that snow flakes mountain logo, if not is a 140$ fine by the police.) . And with this condition of the road we just need to drive slow. Also walk slow, I slipped as I was crossing 100 st to CIBC the other day.

"I agreed with you, In fact I lived in Cgy and gp for long so I can really tell you the difference between all 3 cities. Gp and Cgy They still have multiple truck run over night in the main, and small st/ ave and so on. Bonus if you live beside / same block w the City Council. Equipment break down yes, but that’s why when the companies bid on the job they should be well expected. Now this “ too cold to clean up equipment might break and cost them repair fees ” is kind of funny, like you said for those who live in Fsj,  we know what we getting ourselves into this north - so as the snow removal company, you know what you are getting yourself into this business in this area too, but yet you are like high end gigolo that took the money, accepted the job but yet unwilling to taking off your shirt. Or better yet, all customers who paid for the show will have to happily/ patiently wait for you to get rdy. 


We just spend so much money to create a confusing 100 st because it was “ super high traffic “ and that’s why “ new 100 st  will improve “. There’s only two Main Street really in here. 100 st and 100 ave. And it’s not even have 30 blocks in between. And I do agree with you too about the inner city. 

City accept the “ bid” with conditions that they need the bidding company to follow, how can a company just laid flat and said “ yea we can’t run our machine because it’s too cold and we don’t want to spend extra money to fix it” 

Maybe just -  maybe, city did not budget right for the snow removal part and make the poor company who took the job can’t afford the maintenance. Or can not create a good enough rules for those companies to follow. But at the end of the day, the city can not make sure the road is clean because of “ the snow removal company “ can’t fulfill the requirements, yet help and try to have everyone “ understand “ the snow removal company pain….  Just sound bs.

I’m just saying, all it take is one senior fall. One car accident that cost life. The meaning behind snow removal is not just for convenience of everyone, it’s to prevent the accident that caused by the snow. 
And we paid tax. Why should we have to drive on such a bumpy road to kill my car in a long run. And I have to paid for the maintenance after :/

"Common sense is your best ally, they are looking for good habits and good situational awareness

-Use your turn signals

-When making a turn onto a road with more than one lane going in your direction, always turn into the closest lane to you

-FULL stops at stop signs. Like stop the car, look both ways, then start moving. A rolling stop is an automatic fail

"I wouldn't call it a bad decision but an easy mistake, you're not the first person to do this and you probably won't be the last. Since you're new to the country and it seems like FSJ in particular, you just didn't have the same information that someone would if they lived here for awhile. Depending on what you do, most people working in a senior management position here makes close to 6 figures a year, but it really depends on the size of the company and which company you work for. 

If it has anything to do with the energy or natural gas sector I'd expect it to be on the higher end considering most trades journeymen easily make close to or higher than 6 figures (Depending on the trade and person. Some trades people only work half the year) and a senior management position is generally the end goal in those careers so, as I mentioned in my last comment, they take a pay cut for the chance to work in town and stay comfy albeit for less hours, not that hours really matter too much if you've been making bank for long enough.

Outside of the energy and gas sector it's really up in the air how much you might make, but for a senior management position I'd still say you're on the low side. Considering the difference in what someone in senior management and a labourer are responsible for, you should definitely be making more than him. If a labourer fucks up, boo hoo, whatever, it'll probably cost maybe a small fortune and his job at most. But someone in senior management is at the top, the worst case scenario has much higher stakes for both you AND the company.

Anyways, the TL;DR is that, if you can, try to renegotiate your salary and if worse comes to worse just leave amicably (it's a small town, word travels fast) and look for somewhere in town that has a better offer.",t2_j04tv,OhHeyItsReece,0,1637477965.0,0,t1_hlhdzaj,hlhdzaj,False,elladayrit,t3_qyijuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortStJohn/comments/qyijuf/why_is_a_labourer_getting_paid_more_than_senior/,Why is a labourer getting paid more than senior management?,/r/FortStJohn/comments/qyijuf/why_is_a_labourer_getting_paid_more_than_senior/hlhdzaj/,3,r/FortStJohn,0,3

"To be honest, with the information you presented and if my math checks out, the only way this makes sense is if you're only getting paid 22 to 26 an hour and you're both pulling 8 hr days. 

Even if the labourer wasn't doing overtime his total at the end of the month would be roughly 3600 after taxes and whatnot. From what I can guess with the information given, the long short of it is that he simply works more hours than you do. 20 hours OT a week at 1.5 times his hourly wage ends up being an extra 2640. Add that to his regular hours before tax (3872) and that's 6512, otherwise roughly 6000 at the end of the month.

"I can teach you online easy peasy.  See below:

I charge $30 for a 1/2 hr lesson, but if I feel you could use a little more time to learn the materials taught that day, I don’t charge for that extra time.  That is something that the music schools won’t do for you.   It’s the Pauly difference 😎.  It works for me….and it gives you more bang for your buck.

Hit me up and have a great day!!

🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
The Pauly difference

If you love music and would like to learn to play guitar, or even take steps to go further down your path by understanding more about music theory….

I have been playing guitar for over 30 years.  I teach everything from rock, to country, to blues….electric or acoustic.  I can teach you from chords, strumming and timing… to quick easy ways to learn notes on the fretboard and what to do with them, to more advanced topics to help you to improvise and be in the moment….all on your schedule.

I teach by the lesson, not the by hour.  Why? Because I am more interested in having you learn the materials, so my time spent with you is important for you.  This means that if we’re in a lesson and I feel you need more time to learn the materials I’m teaching you on that day, I do not charge for that extra time. Win-win!

Each lesson is created and personalized for you based on your experience, your musical taste, your goals and what you have learned the weeks before.  And know that, I will always teach at your speed.  I would rather have you get good at a couple of things rather than throw too much at you, have you get discouraged and give up what could be a life long passion for you.

Music is a fun.  If you love music, you’ll never get bored.  If you have a guitar and the dedication to practice, you can and will do well. I can come to you, my schedule is flexible, so  let’s have fun 😎🎸

"Some people like it here, some people don't, and it's all about what interests you, and what you are willing to do.

Outdoor stuff that doesn't require someone to arrange it for you (hiking vs. a sports league) is always available. Sure, winter slows things down, but you can find outdoor things to do - snow shoeing, skiing, etc.

Indoor sports in the winter are less available, depending on your interests (again). Sports are minimal and sport spaces are usually expensive if you want to start your own fun.

-20 is normal, -40 with wind (which is how I measure, ""feels like"" is the temp, thanks) is also normal. If you're used to winter, it's fine. If you're not, layer up and plan your travel accordingly.

Winter driving can be shite, especially if you've never done it before. It's 4 wheel *drive*, not 4 wheel *stop*. And the roads are plowed crappily.

Things are expensive if you're living alone, and apartment costs vary depending on how new they are, or what you want. For example: I would want in-suite laundry because packing laundry everywhere is trash AND gets expensive. And that's if the machines aren't broken.

Bus routes are crap.

Depending on your interests, sometimes there isn't a lot to do. Lots of green space, especially if you have transport of your own, and depending on said interests, sometimes making friends is easy.

Good job on politicizing the murder of a young mother, without knowing any of the facts or even living within a thousand Km’s of the victim. 

Nobody here wants your leftist spin on a tragic event that brought the whole town together. 

Dude is fucking garbage and his worst trait is not that he was/is a white supremacist. The fact that he brutally murdered a young mother is far worse than his political ideology.

"The buses here are total crap if you work outside normal business hours.

Cabs take forever.

All rental companies have good and bad reviews - most people only voice their opinions when something is bad, not when something is good. No one feels the need to speak up for good things, yanno?

All apartment buildings have drug dealers, sex workers, etc. Some just hide it really well, or do it outside of said apartments.

Aim for something with in-suite laundry, if you can. Apartments are notorious for having laundry facilities that are broken, and there's no off-site laundromat in town anyone (to the best of my knowledge).

If possible, do an in-person check of the apartment, or find someone who can. Pictures are VERY deceiving.

If you know how to drive in the winter, any vehicle is fine, but I personally wouldn't drive anything smaller than an SUV - clearance is important to me. The roads aren't really taken care of at times and the ice ruts can get BAD.

-40 for around two months is normal, and we've been reaching 25-30 in the summer, so our weather is getting rather dramatic lately.

"So glad the hotel allows for kitty!

Rental options in this BS town are very minimal when it comes to pets.

A quick google turned up this: https://bchrc.net/no-pet-clauses-and-human-rights/

> However, the BC Human Rights Code provides an important caution. A person with a disability who relies on an animal in connection with their disability has a right to have their needs accommodated. Complainants are not required to prove that they “cannot live” without the animal. They are however required to prove that, due to their disabilities, not having the animal would result in an adverse impact.[2] No-pet clauses may be discriminatory in these circumstances.

I don't know if it makes a difference, but with mental health woes (of which I'm privy to as well - my cats kept me from fully giving up), perhaps this can assist you in some way.

I once watched a very nice young woman park in the wrong direction. Where she was from, it didn't matter what side you parked on, but here, it's only the right side.

Also, YOU may be a great driver, but never totally trust others around you. Plenty of people get in accidents not by their own fault, but because someone is blowing a stop sign or staring at their phone.

"If you buy, ALWAYS get an inspection and have it be the only way you'll complete the offer on the trailer.

These things care fire hazards lol.

And make sure the inspector checks the heat tape underneath - freezing pipes happen, and I know several people in this park who had frozen pipes this winter. Two of them had burst pipes because of it.

But, really, this park is pretty chill other than the occassional fireworks being set off.

It's still cheaper than renting, imho. I have 1000sq ft, pet friendly, two rooms, decent bathroom, nice kitchen... I pay around $1000 a month for pad and mortgage, and that's because I overpaid for my trailer (BY A LOT) - it wasn't a good time to buy, but I needed out of where I was living.

I'm in Peace Country (by the Dodge dealer) and it's fine... mostly. You don't get squat for the overpriced padrent, they just occasionally plow the park. That's it. It doesn't include driveways.

"Oh cool, quite a long way!

As someone else said, there are dorm facilities on the campus at NLC (but not a lot of availability, most of the students there are local I think). The bus system in the town is okay, not great. Renting an apartment in town can be a hassle, rent seems to be pretty expensive and most properties are rented through rental companies (I have had experience with Sterling, and they were hard to deal with.

"Highway driving tends to be better than city driving, tbh. Some areas of the city get plowed a lot because they are school routes, others... not so much. Whereas the highway is handled by a different company, NOT the city itself.

Drive smart, give yourself extra time, and watch out for idiot drivers. Shit gets wild in the winter, regardless of your type of vehicle.

That being said, there's absolutely a good chance you're going to get stuck.

Isn't insurance the same everywhere because ICBC governs the rates? Make sure you have the coverage that means you won't get hosed when someone else hits you - getting rear ended is unfortunately common, especially in winter.

Make sure you have a place to park and an extension cord to plug in. It's gonna get coooooold. Be aware of your park space availability before renting/buying, if possible. Plug in options are not always available in shit ass apartment complexes. Never leave your extension cord outside the vehicle - I know lots of people loop it around their side mirror, but that shit WILL be stolen. Quickly.

If you're buying (or renting a basement suite - make sure it's a legal one!), make sure your driveway isn't on a hill. That's not fun when everything is covered in ice.

Pack jumper cables and tow rope, just in case.

Gas and power is expensive, fingers crossed that your home has good insulation or you're okay with putting on an extra layer. My trailer stays at 18c all winter because I'm broke af.

Prep a winter car kit, get a good snow brush/blade, and make friends with your neighbors (or coworkers) - you'll probably need help digging yourself out one day.",t2_68vuq,EmeraldLight,0,1600144783.0,0,t1_g5bqxok,g5bqxok,True,yeahbuddayyyy,t3_it1onm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortStJohn/comments/it1onm/what_to_expect/,What to expect..,/r/FortStJohn/comments/it1onm/what_to_expect/g5bqxok/,5,r/FortStJohn,0,5
