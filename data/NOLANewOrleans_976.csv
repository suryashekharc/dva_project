"Best I can guess they watched me type in my code to my phone before opening it… or maybe social engineered me telling them the code “hey let’s take a selfie… what’s your code” I don’t really remember… this was at 3 or 4am on bourbon.

Then they changed my password to mg fidelity account which they would have needed the last 4 of my social. I’m assuming they found that in an email somewhere… with enough time it’s findable- took them about an hour and a half to do that- and then it was off to the races.

Now I deleted my mail app and downloaded spark. The only way to see my emails now even with my phone code is with a Face ID or a separate pin that’s different than my phone code- so in case this ever happens again I should be good.

"French Quarter, French Market and Jackson Square  are worth the walk but if anyone asks you if for 20 bucks they can tell you where you got your shoes , just keep walking. 
You can also rent the Light up bikes and ride through the city at night I’ve gone with my friends and it’s cheap and really fun to see the night life , & you don’t have to follow the group if you don’t want. 
Garden district is really pretty to walk through (it has JamNola which you can take some pretty cool pictures) 
Check out City park (itself ,it’s botanical garden & sculpture garden),there’s a little Cafe DuMonde there too, & Audubon Park is lovely during the day as well. 
If you’re coming right now for mardi gras dear God don’t pick up nasty beads from the floor, and if you’re going into the city, park somewhere where theres foot traffic bc broken windows aren’t too uncommon mostly at night. 
Also try as much food as you can: po boys, seafood gumbo, crawfish, daiquiris, hurricanes, beignets,& king cake since it’s in season. Lake Pontchatrain is also pretty chill it has nice restaurants right by the water. 
And only tourist like Bourbon personally i think it’s gross and smells like piss & any local can vouch me on that , it’s just a bunch of over priced shots, hand grenades which are gross imo and strip clubs Def not child friendly if thats the vibe you wanna go with. 
Also if you got some time to spare check out  Madame Laveau’s voodoo shop or the cemeteries like the ones with the big above ground tombs ,during the day they’re really pretty but go at night if you want it to be a bit more spooky lol.
Lastly but personally what I feel is most important don’t call it New Or-leens or New Orl-E-ans or Naw-lins 
!!it’s pronounced New Or-lins.!!
if you say otherwise anyone will immediately know you’re just a tourist and especially in the city they will try to scam you.

"The crime is real but that post gives good advice that should be heeded traveling to any city at any time, particularly among crowds where pickpocketing is more likely. The car break-ins and carjackings, primarily by teenagers, is alarming but shouldn't be a concern for someone who won't be driving around, which isn't recommended for tourists for more pragmatic reasons in the first place. To cancel your trip wouldn't be wise as much as it would be acting out of an abundance (perhaps excessive amount) of caution. If you are that fearful of the potential for crime, then you do what you have to do. The odds of escaping New Orleans or any city unharmed remain largely in your favor but safety is never guaranteed.

"If it were me, I wouldn't cancel. It is true that we are in the midst of a crime spike. That said, Mardi Gras, in general, is largely safe from serious crime. Protect your valuables and do the other common-sense things you'd do in any crowd, but things should be generally safe, especially during the day.

That said, things can and have happened. There have been shootings and other incidents at Mardi Gras, but those can happen at any time. Other than COVID-related risks, this Mardi Gras shouldn't be much more risky than previous ones. Mardi Gras kind of exists in a separate universe from the rest of New Orleans.

Now, if you're not coming for Mardi Gras, you should still be largely fine. Once again, stick to the tourist areas, use common sense that you would in any city or crowd and be aware of your surroundings.

The thing is that charter schools can make up basically whatever rules they want. They are not true public schools. Yes they are paid for by public dollars but they can decide on who gets to come to their schools. They are also not governed by the local school board 100%.

"No, there won't be any Mardi Gras festivities after March 1st which is Fat Tuesday. That's the culmination of it all before Lent starts. The best next thing would be St. Patrick's. 

But no, there won't be any Mardi Gras festivities/parades/activities going on. Think of it as... you notice your favorite band is playing. You can't go to the concert so you ask if they'll still be there playing the following day, week, etc. Of course they won't be. They wrapped that thing up on the night of the concert. Mardi Gras is like that. We have an entire month+ worth of fun and parades and festivals. It culminates on Mardi Gras Day (Fat Tuesday). So just like the band plays it's last set and leaves, Fat Tuesday is Mardi Gras final set before it goes dormant for another year. 

Check out WWOZ for live music and events. You'll find live music daily in this city and it's the absolute best resource you could have for finding live music.

"French Quarter to CBD/Warehouse District (Look up where the WWII museum is) isn't all that big of a difference. We live a block from WWII museum, so we know this area really well. Hell, Flamingo A Go Go has a large outdoor courtyard that you could even ask about taking over. I'm sure they'd rent it out to you. Worth a call.

French Quarter to Mid City is a relatively big difference. Mid City is more ""sketchy"" or ""seedy"" so to speak. It's more where a lot of the locals would live because it's just outside of the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter. 

There's a lot of great things in Mid City, but you'll definitely feel ""less safe"" than in the French Quarter or CBD/Warehouse District. But there's sooooo many great places in Mid City to eat/drink. Hell, the best Po Boy's you'll ever eat (Parkaway) are in Mid City. 

I'd go on google and do the street view and go up and down a few blocks from DMac's to see what it's like. Do the same for Ugly Dog and Howling Wolf. Do the same for Lucy's. You'll start getting a feel for what the area looks like. But CBD/Warehouse are very close to the Quarter.

"Not necessarily IN the quarter, but DMac's bar has an area that's kinda like, one of those ""walk up the 3 steps to this other area"" type of areas. I bet they'd rent it out. But that might not be where you wanted to hang out. It's definitely NOT the quarter. It's Mid City.

"First off, I'm sorry for your loss. I recently lost my grandmother and my mother took it really hard, and almost lost her own life from the grief. It's a tough thing to go through, and I wish you the best in making peace with your loss.

Secondly, as someone born and raised here, I dated a lot of girls who were self-proclaimed Wiccans or witches, what have you. I don't care much for Voodoo, and I've had hexes and curses put on me over a number of years. Nothing much ever happened to me.

That being said, it's important to note that correlation =/= causation. From what it seems, your grandmother seemed (I don't intend to sound rude or anything, just stating facts) pretty aged. Hell, Betty White died 3 days after an article praising her for her longevity. When one reaches that age, living to see one more day is a blessing. 

Going back to the correlation and causation relationship. Let's assume in June, both ice cream sales and suicides were at an all time high. Just because ice cream sales went up in June and suicide rates also went up in June does not mean the increase in ice cream sales *caused* the rise in suicides. So, too, does taking a picture of the Mansion and your string of bad luck have no solid relationship. They are two incidents that happened separately from one another.

I'm not a therapist, and I'm not going to give you real advice; only what I think is best. I think its in your best interest to make that separation make sense to you, and make peace with your grandmother's passing and the string of bad luck you are experiencing.

"You're getting bad advice. Sorry. There are some cool hotels outside of the French Quarter that I would recommend like the Hotel Chloe Uptown or the Hotel Peter & Paul in the Marigny. Frenchmen Street is great for live music. Just pop into any bar that sounds good from the street. Spend a day or two walking around the quarter. Hit Bourbon Street, Pat O'Briens, Cats Meow, and Razoo's one night but get off the street before 1am because it gets sketchy. There's usually festivals that time of year so check out neworleans.com for the week you are coming. If you want to hang at the college bars, head to Maple Street, The Boot, or F&Ms. Make sure to get dinner reservations a couple of nights.

"For section 8 to be a true success it needs to be spread out among mixed socioeconomic households and not concentrated, otherwise it is just the beginning of large public housing complexes, which history has shown to be a magnet for issues. 1300 units all section 8 is asking for problems, unless in addition to those units there are other units to help prevent concentrated poverty, and the complex has to be properly maintained. Haven't seen a plan for affordable housing yet, but also look at the way they did this the last time. Falstaff apartments got tax credits to renovate and develop, and in turn provided lots of section 8 and affordable housing, for only 10 years. Then they kicked everyone out and jacked up the rent.

"yeah no offense but i'm pretty confused what this flyer is trying to convey / what this club actually is. 

I would strongly suggest that you consider hiring a comms/design person. 

one other gentle suggestion that I'll throw out: the ""why you should NOT wait"" phrasing is pretty confusing. like most people, I've never heard of or considered joining a club like this, so coming on strong with the sales pitch off the bat is a little off-putting! may I gently suggest something more like:

**why joining the NOLA Dog Sports Club might be right for you!**

- fun member-only activities (including an upcoming holiday gathering), which are x, y, z (describe them! we have no idea what these gatherings are gonna be like)

- canine good citizen prep classes starting in January, which will teach your dog to x, y, z (again, please describe to us what the hell is going on)

"You said you'd do whatever it takes. Why not consider pursuing some kind of professional certification in some specialized field from a school that offers financial aid? There's ways to get certified fixing A/C/Heating systems (HVAC), others for autos, culinary arts if you like fancy cooking, and, of course, more formal education, and if this just doesn't seem possible, is it impossible to tell somebody that you'd like to be hired so that you can learn on the job while you pursue certification?

That paper on the wall is what changes your life. I'm recommending that you adopt a long-term plan. This attitude of ""I gotta have $35k by Friday of next week"" doesn't seem like it will help imo.

"I'm so sorry you went through that. It's so sad that people who preach ""adopt don't shop"" and think of themselves as the saviors of animals in need are ruining what should be such a wonderful, life-changing experience for both you and the dog. Based on what you're saying, I wouldn't doubt that you're thinking of the right one. This rescue definitely has lots and lots of positive reviews singing their praises to high heaven, but if you filter by one star there are some things there that set off serious alarm bells. Especially the ones about the owner, who is very privileged and entitled, and *very* good at manipulating situations to avoid taking any responsibility and make herself look like the victim. She shows zero compassion for the people she's put in difficult, even dangerous, situations. And to be honest, has zero dog handling skills herself. Which is crazy, for someone who not only runs a rescue, but judges others for not wanting or being able to handle a reactive dog in their home.

"I have a feeling I know which rescue you’re referring to, as I had my own really traumatic situation with them this year. Felt pressured / directed towards one specific dog out of the list of half a dozen I originally expressed interest in. I ignored red flags early on (but learned a lot, in retrospect). This dog had major fear-based aggression and was wildly cat reactive which made trying to walk him in the city really hard. We had multiple near bite incidents and eventually he did bite a friend, after which I finally had to force the rescue to take him back. But before that happened I exhausted every resource, meeting with multiple trainers and consulting with a veterinarian who specializes in behavioral issues. The trainers and vet all agreed that this was a super tough case and that the rescue shouldn’t have placed him. One of the trainers told me he usually doesn’t work with this rescue precisely because they only call him when it’s already too late. Every time I tried to communicate the problems to the rescue, I felt like my concerns were ignored, almost to the point where it felt like I was being gaslighted.

This rescue has sooo many positive reviews on Google and I’m sure plenty of people have had great experiences with them, but based on my own experience, there’s a couple of detailed negative reviews as well that I absolutely believe are true.

I still really want a dog, but after that experience I’m afraid even to deal with other rescues.

"You're right, it can be very hard to tell in a shelter environment if a dog is housebroken, because a shelter isn't a house. The routine and the environment are totally different. It's also reasonable to not know if an animal is friendly with kids or cats, and to be unsure about dogs because you haven't tested with other dogs yet. As long as the shelter is being transparent about those things. And dogs' behavior definitely can change when they get into a home. I *could* talk about how the industry as a whole has problems and needs to change, but that's not what I'm talking about here. There are rescues that have stellar reputations locally that are not doing their due diligence to prepare people for the reactivity and behavioral issues that they *know* a dog exhibits. And that aren't actually knowledgeable enough to assess a dogs' social behavior, or properly educate their adopters on things like prey drive, food aggression, and other common issues that we come across when transitioning (usually traumatized) dogs to their new homes. In one instance, a dog was advertised as cat-friendly and taken home by an adopter. That night, the dog killed the adopter's cat. Instead of taking responsibility or trying to make amends, my boss and coworkers got angry with the adopter. This dog is back up for adoption, and it's nowhere in her profile that she has high prey drive or anything of the sort. I also guarantee you that noone coming in to look at her or adopt her is being told about the incident. I'm not talking overrun municipal shelters here either. I'm talking small and mid-sized nonprofits that have complete control over how many dogs they take in. These places will post a dog's tragic backstory in emotionally manipulative ways to guilt people into donating/fostering/adopting, advertise them as dog-friendly, cat-friendly, kid-friendly without actually knowing for sure, or post that a dog has 'quirks' when they actually have severe dog aggression or stranger danger and have bitten people and attacked other animals. It's dangerous and irresponsible. Sorry for the long response, but I don't want anyone to think I'm just being unnecessarily harsh or dramatic here. There are serious problems happening and people need to be cautious and make educated decisions.",t2_f3bot6ag,RUPawsitive,0,1633306763.0,0,t1_hfajzyb,hfajzyb,False,RUPawsitive,t3_q0qaof,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLA/comments/q0qaof/vet_your_animal_rescues_yall/,Vet your animal rescues y'all!,/r/NOLA/comments/q0qaof/vet_your_animal_rescues_yall/hfajzyb/,5,r/NOLA,0,5

Also, depends on who you ask. Lots of people are still in a bad state. Garbage pickup hasn't happened since August. Housing / rentals are at a premi because people's ruined homes will take time to repair.  

Tourist stuff is always first to get fixed so it really depends on what you want. The french quarter should be fine-ish. Real talk, if you come, spend money and tip heavy. I have no patience for tourists that treat the city like a zoo and everyone like a tour guide. 

Everyone has repairs to do and extra stress so do your own specific research into the specific tour companies you want and make your own phone calls. Call restaurants you want to visit ahead of the trip. Be aware of covid restrictions. Do not come with expectations.

"Two things that might help - If you’re trying to schedule with CVS or Walgreens online and they’re showing that location’s schedule as booked up, head over to the location anyway (at ideally, a ‘lower crowd’ time around 9:30 or 10am) and ask if they’ll take you as a walk-in. Don’t be afraid to try and plead your case if that’s what it takes. Also indicate that you’re happy to sit and wait for a bit if they could possibly squeeze you in, (thinking if they’re inclined to turn you away bc they’re kind of jammed at the moment like with a just received pharmacy truck delivery or similar, being earnest and flexible might help sway things your way).
