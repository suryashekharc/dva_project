"Batsto made iron cannon balls for use in the Revolutionary War, it was used as a private meeting place for dignities, and after the war turned to glass making very much  in the south jersey area.

But Haddonfield. Elizabeth Haddon was ceded a vast tract of land that covered parts of what are now Westmont, Haddon Twp., and a bit of Collingswood. She came her unalone, no chaparone, at 17. Tough old lady.

There‚Äôs a book sold through the local paper, The Restrospect, that will give you a wealth of information about this important part of the state known as West Jersey. It‚Äôs a really good read. I‚Äôd check with the reference librarian, first at Collingswood because other books have been written. But check the reference librarians at Camden County College Library. They have items as well as books to help you navigate South (known primarily as West Jersey at the time).

Edit: Collingswood has two fairly grand homes built in the mid 1700s, a house in the 900 or 1000 block of Eldridge Ave., and the Stokes family mansion on the east side of town. I can‚Äôt remember the name of the street, but it backs out to the road running along Newton‚Äôs Lake. My 4th grade teacher was Mrs. Stokes. She was a very vibrant teacher who endeavored to have her class each year play out the founding of Collingswood by the men who ‚Äúofficially‚Äù settled the town.

Lots of library and reference sources that can fill in from Haddonfield at the old tavern and on down to the wealthy town of Cape May.

Things are not going to get better. They are going to get worse. They really haven't ramped up what they have planned. You can get an idea. I don't remember which portion of 70 but it's between 73 and Haddonfield Rd. They are digging out a huge trench in the center island where they will be laying pipes and cable. There is police car that sits there all day because they have to be present whenever a large road project is going on. I would assume they are going to have dig trenches on each island along the entire length of the project. This project is so massive that they working on all the areas concurrently instead of doing a 1000 feet at a time. If you have that many people working on it why is going to take 4 years. Because it's just getting started. They are going to make each crosswalk ADA compliant. This means ramps and raised surfaces for both wheelchairs and visually impaired individuals.

"Mt. Laurel has a surprising history. There‚Äôs the Evesham Friends Meeting House, built in 1778 and occupied by the British for a night, the General Clinton House as well. George Washington led troops through the area as well. Alice Paul, noted suffragette, was born in Mt. Laurel, and her childhood home is now a museum. Dr. James Still ‚ÄúThe Black Doctor of the Pines‚Äù is buried in Mt. Laurel. The Church where he‚Äôs buried, Jacob‚Äôs Chapel AME Church in Mt. Laurel served as a stop on the underground rail road for slaves fleeing north. In more recent history, a landmark decision (Mount Laurel Doctrine) that requires municipalities to have zoning for low-income housing, preventing discrimination of poor people seeking housing. This started in large part by Ethel Lawrence (who has a low income housing neighborhood in Mt. Laurel named after her), who is referred to as the ‚ÄúRosa Parks of affordable housing‚Äù. She was the lead plaintiff.

"Atlantic City is older than you give it credit.  It has been 168 years since it was founded. Unfortunately, except for the Coast Guard base and the Lighthouse, not much historic has survived the rush towards casino cash.

Cape May is 174 and billed as The US's original Seaside resort.  Claimed by the Dutch around 1610, it was not settled as a city until 1848. The number old Victorian homes is simply stunning, to the point that entire town is on the list of Historic Places.  It is also notable for Congress Hotel, once referred to as the ""summer whitehouse""

"What you listed are only major cities. Oldest Historic towns in my area of southern NJ would likely be old abandoned furnaces, like Batsto and Weymouth.  Batsto being nearly 50 years older than Trenton. 

Historically southern NJ was a iron hotspot with the pine barrens being a massive fuel supply and river mouths providing the the raw material.  This is nearly 400 years ago.  So it really depends how far you want to go back and if you‚Äôre looking for still active towns or not.

"A few reasons...

1. My yard was loaded with carpenter ants, mosquitoes and termites because when it would rain there were so many trees it would take a week for the ground to dry up

2. The amount of branches, leaves and general cleanup in my yard was ridiculous every year

3. I wanted an in ground pool

4. So much shade I had no grass. Only moss in the yard

Now? I have an inground pool on one side and some nice grass for the dogs to run and play in on the other. No more carpenter ants or termites and the mosquito situation is much better.

"Think back to when/how it was born?

Consider old city Philadelphia. If you buy a property with historical significance, the city has to approve any changes you make to the building.

"From the Department of Agriculture [https://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/pi/prog/beeinspection.html#4](https://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/pi/prog/beeinspection.html#4)  Scroll to the bottom of the page for actual links on their site.. Here's some of  the information.

""**Swarm Collectors**

Swarming is a natural biological function of honey bees. During swarming, honey bees are behaviorally very gentle. They have no home to defend and their stomachs are filled with honey. They will usually hang on a bush or tree branch in a ball of bees. The scouts then look for a dry dark cavity. When they find one, the swarm will take off and move into that cavity. This process can take from 1 - 5 days depending on the weather.

If you find one of these swarms on your property, please follow these links for lists of New Jersey Beekeepers who collect swarms:

"Do you realize that Roger Stone was convicted for lying about his e-mails to a known Russian State hacking group about leaking hacked E-mails from a U.S.server? 

Do you Realize that Paul Manafort went to Jail for taking millions of dollars illegally from a Putin Oligarch who was at the time President of the Ukraine before the whole country went batshit crazy and revolted against his govenment... and now resides in MOSCOW.

Do you realize that Trump sold millions of dollars to Putin Oligarchs in real estate to launder money for them.

Do you realize that Trump asked Russia .. at a Public Press Conference to HAck the previous Secretary of States E_MAILS... 

Laundering Money for Putins friends.. is not "" Business"" it's CRIMINALITY.

Doesn't matter now does it... because they lost it all and then some in the sanctions... of which... Joe Biden dropped so hard Economist are calling it ""Shock and Awe"". 

Just stop... The Party is over.. move on to the Next Dictator wanna be. Pick a new politician to fawn over.  Next time try picking one with basic decency.. perhaps one who doesn't sell his country out for a real estate deal.

"We didn't start the class action, and it wasn't for just the hike. The way they evicted us was illegal. After living there for 2 years with no problems, they brought in a new property manager to clean house. She was evicting 8-12 units a month. We got behind one time because how long it took my wife to get maternity pay. Even though we paid as much as we could every paycheck, they slammed us with so many fees and fines that it didn't matter. At the eviction hearing the next month they demanded $8k; past rent, current rent, next month's rent, fines, lawyer fees, court fees, fees, fees, and more fees. Since my wife is an attorney, the professional courtesy the eviction lawyer extended to us was that we had a week to pay instead of the end of that day. We were late in September, had court in October, and evicted by November. No payment plans or options besides paying thousands of inflated costs.

Years later I got what looked like junk mail from a lawyer that turned out to be for the class action. I just had to respond to opt in. A couple of months later, I had a check for a few hundred.

"How can I explain Audubon's culture to you?....

One year I went to the holiday choral concert. The auditorium smelled like stale cigarettes and BO. I put my coat on my chair and went to use the restroom before the concert. When I came back, my coat was on the floor and a large grumpy man was in my seat. He didn't acknowledge that he took my seat... He didn't help me get my coat from basically under him. 

As the concert progressed the talent was mediocre compared to the other area HS concerts I had attended that year. There was also this super passive aggressive undertone about.... Christmas? Where most high schools were putting some effort into inclusivity at that point (ya know, including the lighter winter songs, maybe a Hanukkah song or two, etc), Audubon public high school covered Christmas songs only and ended the night with these kids singing a traditional Christian hymn around a Christmas tree in the vestibule....???

Also, half way through the concert a baby started crying and someone yelled ""shut that kid up"" 

So that's what Audubon is to me.. not sure if it's worth the cost savings.....",t2_f1m2p7t,blenderfrizz,0,1647813536.0,0,t1_i1gfr94,i1gfr94,True,Riverwards_rat,t3_tis8r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthJersey/comments/tis8r4/moving_to_jersey_wanted_to_know_how_the_audubon/,Moving to Jersey.

"> and never *paid* any back

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.
