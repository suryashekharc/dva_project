"DC, Boston, and Philly all have functional mass transit systems too, although I've never taken SEPTA. I'm sure part of the reason why the larger East Coast cities aren't ""car cities"" is due to the sheer insanity that is driving there.

DC and NYC have huge issues with congestion and bottlenecked traffic. Boston gets congestion while also having the curse of pre-colonial street plans, so driving there consists of prayers that Google Maps didn't have a stroke and you're in the correct lane for the 6-way intersection coming up. Oh and every avenue is a one way whilst every street is a two way that is nowhere near wide enough for two cars to be driving at the same time.

Origin story about the final ""s""...as a native Chicagoan I recall ""The Jewel"" being said all my life, becoming aware of it c 1950.  I did not hear ""The Jewel's"" until I had been working with West and South Side Black Chicagoans for a while.  Maybe c 1980ish.

They had two origin stories for the ""Jewels.""  One group held out it was a frustrated dig at this 'expensive' chain store of much higher quality than the local stand alones.  They half jokingly said it must be owed by Jews, hence ""Jules' Store.""

The other, kinder origin story was that the place was so much a cut above their local stand-alones it was a collection of jewels, as in precious stones.  But also cost more.

"Looking through you comments, OP, am not sure you've grasped what you're asking.  Experienced in small town Wisconsin and visiting Chicago you seem to mention Navy Pier ... and maybe the Loop area?

You need some scale here.  The city, by itself, is c 245 sq miles and almost 3 million people.  Compare to your town, there are 50 wards, each with about 50,000 residents.  About 7,300 sit-down restaurants, not counting fast food.   About 750 bars. One hundred defined neighborhoods, each with a different character and history.  https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/about/facts.html

The point is, think of each of the 100 neighborhoods as its own town with its own infrastructure, resident culture, good spots, meh spots.  They range from impossibly expensive to rat infested.  Neighborhoods for youngsters, some strait, some gay, others for young families.  Some apartment living, others single family homes.  Some blue collar and some dominated by recently arriving Ohio college graduates.


Then there are the suburbs which add their own in each category.

The TLDR is study each neighborhood to discover its characteristics.    Make a list of the ones that seem to click.   Come back here and describe the life style you're seeking.  Include a realistic budget if you can.  Ask us which places fit you best from the list you put together.

"OP, i meant to follow up earlier but got sidetracked.

My recommendation to you would be to find a reputable and local residential architect, and if they have the ability to self-certify that would be a big boost to you to help you scoot through the permit process. Your first step however, should be a phone call to the building department.

You should also check the zoning ordinance to do your due diligence to ensure what you want to do is allowable by right. The CZO is available to read online for free. 

For your first question re: removal of the old failing roof:

\- Based on your description i am guessing this is an old shitty shed roof over your back deck. **You will need a permit for this demolition work**, the contractor should be able to pull the permit on their end. I know of no regulations that require a roof over an outdoor balcony or deck. 

\- Your second question is a bit more complicated. You absolutely need a permit for this work, and you should hire a professional architect to provide stamped and sealed plans. The city will also likely require structural calculations if you are doing structural work, which you will need for the new roof deck. The scope of work you describe is far more than an ""easy permit"" and will need plan review, which is why i suggest finding an architect with self-cert capability. It can be a wood frame structure, but the specifics need to be ironed out. 

Don't bother wasting your time digging a hole to figure out how thick your slab is, total waste of time. Most garage slabs on grade are 5""-6"" and i don't see a reason to just rip everything up when it might be a possibility to remove the old roof, selectively demolish where needed to install new columns and spread footings, which need to be detailed, sized, and provided with reinforcement which must also be detailed. footings need to be below the frost line and substantial enough to deal with chicago's shitty soil. but who knows, the contractor may just want to tear the whole damn thing down. The new roof structure and deck will also need to be engineered and detailed, including waterproofing and flashing details which an architect should weigh in on.

I would strongly recommend just giving a call to the building department front desk and asking them about the process and what would be required, they will be more helpful than I or your fellow redditors. Chicago has some unique and specific requirements for decks, patios, and porches, specifically related to life safety and combustibility requirements.

"Kids break stuff, lose it, smash computers against a wall. They're not held responsible for it. But CPS is even worse. 

Chromebooks and tablets get minor damage all the time. They sit for months before someone from CPS will come out and look at them. When CPS does come out, the service person will only look at the Chrome books on his list even though by that time the number of broken computers is double. It will then take months before the service man comes out to fix any of them so the principal just buys new ones and throws out the damaged ones.  
  
Same thing with $2000 smartboards in the rooms. They have $50 lights that go out after about a year. It never gets fixed so the principal just buys new smartboards.  
  
No vendor is going to sell CPS just what they need, it’s always more. I remember a while back some CPS high school culinary dept bought a half dozen cappuccino machines for $1000 each - because they can.

"I wouldn't say anyone is ""willing""....

And yes I know that, it's kind of my whole point.  Why should I be willing to pay for parking on a public road, to a private corporation, that provides no value back to the public?  And, for that reason, I am even more opposed to the subject paying increasingly more, just because it's the so called ""market rate."". I feel like we're going in circles here...

The current situation is not equitable, not because parking should or should not have a cost, but bc there is a layer of private companies pocketing the money when it should be going to the city.  What purpose does this extra layer serve? This is something I will not support.

"> I'd like to live within 20min by car of decent food, night life, and what you think of when you think of Chicago.

That covers a lot of ground. There isn’t really one single neighborhood that checks all of that. There’s a lot of neighborhoods that do. 

We have good food all over, especially if you’re a little bit adventurous and willing to try new cuisines. 

For nightlife, what’s your age range and what do you envision? For nightclubs, bottle service, etc, you’ll want River North, for sports bars, Lincoln Park or Wrigleyville, for dive bars you can go all over, for music venues, they’re also in a few different neighborhoods.  

Also 20 min by car … most of us don’t drive to get around, we take public transit or maybe Uber. If you drive you’ll have to deal with parking or valet which can be a headache and/or a lot of money. 

As for what I consider Chicago … if the address is Chicago. For what I consider Chicagoland, if there’s a Metra (commuter rail) station.

"YES. This is how you get a walkable and good transit city -- the supermarket (or shopping street, back in the day) is right next to the train station, so you do your shopping on your way home from work, you don't need a separate trip.

There are places in Chicago where this is doable, where you can see a supermarket from the L stop (or few blocks from it), where there's a supermarket between a good bus stop and my house, etc.  It's why I live where I do. But encouraging that would be great.

"Japan long had both private and public lines. The old public system ""JNR"" (for Japan National Railway) which is now ""JR"" (Japan Railway) was privatized, but by region, so for instance all the JR in Tokyo is JR East, all the JR in Osaka is JR West, etc.  The parts of JR don't compete against each other, but they do still compete with the private lines yeah.  Also at some point there were two subway systems in Tokyo, one public and the other not (I think) but they combined at some point to become the single ""Tokyo Metro.""  And they keep adding new entire lines over the span of a few years -- something like 13 now I think, just of subways.  Went back after an absence of a few years and there was a whole knew line in my friend's tourist book I didn't even know existed... all dug below 40m where property rights of the surface no longer matter.

For what it's worth, there are 148 train lines in the city of Tokyo alone, and you can transfer to go all over the entire country. All the stations have free public bathrooms too.

Transit in the US is just horrible.  I definitely appreciate (and rely on) the CTA, but moving here was a major culture shock...

I don't have much sympathy. Try living basically anywhere else in the city where bus service is vastly worse and there aren't even trains.

"Yep. As a lifelong non-driver, the transit here in Chicago is what makes even possible to live. There's endless room for improvement, but it clears that basic bar.

Absolutely there are parts of the city that you'd need a car to live in, I simply don't even consider living in those parts because I can't.

I'd like to see transit improved, new developments focused on transit. There's a reason that the parts of the city with access to good transit are attractive. Similar reasons that the inner suburbs (you know, the ones originally developed around rail travel) are attractive. They're walkable, and you don't need a car.

Yes, the reality is that a lot of people do drive in the city because they live in parts that aren't super accessible without a car. And, people can't just uproot and change their lives on a dime.

"New York is the only city in the US that I'd consider not a car city. You can rely on public transit in Chicago, but the El doesn't do enough to get you from east to west without a bus. Or even doing that quickly. Going from the Northside to the Westside on public transit is best with buses to bridge gaps or just using 2 buses. What I love about Chicago is that it's not just a car city, but is actually great for most modes of transportation. It is great for biking, public transit (which largely relies on buses which of course are automobiles), and driving. I use all 3 (plus walking). I think it's reasonable to say it is a car city, a bike city and a public transit city. It's not like these are mutually exclusive things.",t2_e767z2ic,chitown619,1,1648246424.0,0,t1_i24f05g,i24f05g,False,[deleted],t3_tntt6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/tntt6f/tell_me_the_mayor_has_given_up_on_the_cta_without/,Tell me the mayor has given up on the CTA without telling me,/r/chicago/comments/tntt6f/tell_me_the_mayor_has_given_up_on_the_cta_without/i24f05g/,2,r/chicago,0,2
