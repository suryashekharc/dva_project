"It just seems ironic that they paint themselves as defenders of democracy, but also feel the need to nationalize the narrative out of fear that Russian influence will not divide their narrative. It seems dangerous to only provide one narrative to the people and give them a false sense of the reality of the current situation. Ukraine has no incentive to be neutral in their coverage and instead will be very biased toward their objectives. I highly doubt the motivation for shutting down independent media is due to safety concerns.

That's the hope, but overall it is concerning that he views freedom of the press as a convenience that can be done away with when necessary.

"In war time, the battle for narrative is nearly as important as what is actually happening on the ground. If the Ukrainian government can’t control the media, then independent outlets are in danger of Russian influence. Censorship is an important weapon to have in your arsenal, and it could very well be important to the integrity of their military operations and safety of their citizens. Russia has been targeting civilian structures and independent media could very well do more harm than good right now.

Also, foreign media still has a presence there.

"My point was there are no articles you can point to that don't have some sort of bias or opinion in them. Regardless of the source someone will say it has some sort of lean. It's a fool errand to think you can find an objective source on every topic. 

That's not what it means. I literally explained it in my response to you that I said would because that was not the topic at hand. Yes I condemn Russia, but the point I was making was about Zelenskyy so it did not apply. The implied piece of that sentence is "" I'd condemn Russia (if that were the point of discussion)....""

I don't disagree with your argument about it potentially causing harm, no doubt having Russian propaganda is bad for Ukraine's side.

I find it hard to believe that you don’t see what would happen if Ukraine lets pro-Russian voices spread their own propaganda in an active war zone.  Russia is known for their powerful disinformation and far flung spies and such.  Flooding the media with those voices is 100% something they’d do and could cause some serious issues.

And I respectfully disagree that nationalizing media isn't a bad idea. You don't get to pick and choose when you get to censor voices. If there's pro-russian voices they deserve to be heard and shot down in the court of public opinion, but nationalizing one voice turns the media into a propaganda machine that will misinform the public.

I informed him my home had recently been inspected as it was a new purchase and the inspection found zero issues. He started measuring between existing deck spindles. The whole thing felt very icky.

I noped out. I wish I remembered their name, but I don't. The whole experience put me off getting another quote. They were on the top of the Google list last year, began with P I think.

"MORTON – The Morton School District must take steps to ensure that Morton High School female and male student-athletes have equal opportunities, facilities, equipment and supplies.


That's the bottom line of a resolution agreement reached between the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights and the district after a Title IX complaint was filed against the district last year by former Morton High School softball coach Gigi MacIntosh.

An investigation by the OCR that began in December resulted in the agreement, which was approved March 8 by the Morton School Board by a unanimous vote.

Title IX, a federal law enacted in 1972, prohibits discrimination based on sex in any education program or activity that receives federal funding.

MacIntosh and Morton Superintendent Jeff Hill view the agreement between the OCR and district differently, but both believe it will produce positive results.

""I'm pleased with the outcome of the OCR's investigation,"" MacIntosh said. ""The OCR is unbiased. It does fact-finding. It isn't on my side or the district's side. It did a great job with this investigation considering it couldn't do it in-person because of the pandemic.

""I'm sad, though, that an outsider had to come in 50 years after Title IX passed and point out the sports inequities in the district. The administrators should have been doing their job.""

MacIntosh said the ball is now in the district's court ""and hopefully the district will do better and girls will feel they matter.""


Hill said the district cooperated fully with OCR investigators and he found it telling that the agreement doesn't have any findings of non-compliance with Title IX, ""just things that we need to pay attention to.

""We've been asked to do things we typically do formally or informally. Now we'll formalize everything,"" Hill said. ""We're always assessing our sports facilities and equipment, and typically ask students about their sports interests. We're always working to make sure everything is equitable.""

Here's what the OCR has asked the district to do:

Provide Title IX training by July 1 for district staff members responsible for the athletic programs at Morton High School and Morton Junior High School including principals, athletic directors, business managers/staff who work with athletic budgets, and coaches.

Offer sports that accommodate the interests of female and male students at Morton High School no later than the 2024-25 school year. The district must conduct a survey of students within 90 days after approving the agreement to gauge athletic interests.

Provide equal locker rooms, practice and competition facilities for Morton High School and Morton Junior High female and male student-athletes by the 2024-25 school year.

Provide equal equipment and supplies for female and male student-athletes at Morton High School by the 2022-23 school year.

The district must meet deadlines to demonstrate its progress.

Hill said the Title IX training will be part of ongoing professional development for district employees.


What the investigation found
MacIntosh said the request from the OCR for Title IX training ""speaks volumes.""

In an email written to MacIntosh that she provided to the Journal Star, the OCR investigation team expressed concerns about:

Sports participation rates among Morton High School female students.

A difference in amenities between the Morton High School varsity softball diamond at Birchwood Park and the Morton High School varsity baseball diamond at Westwood Park.

The fact that ""boys teams (at Morton High School) are allocated substantially more funds for supplies and equipment both overall and per athletic participant than girls teams.""

According to the OCR investigation, the Morton High School student ratio in the 2020-21 school year was 50.9% male to 49.1% female, but competitive sports participation rates were 61.4% male to 38.6% female.

Birchwood Park and Westwood Park are Morton Park District facilities. The Morton Girls Softball Association and Morton Youth Baseball Association have contributed to the construction and upkeep of the varsity softball and baseball diamonds.


However, the diamonds are subject to Title IX scrutiny because they're used by Morton School District teams. The district receives federal funds.

The OCR investigation noted that the district has taken steps in recent months to improve the Birchwood Park varsity softball diamond including replacing the netting in the batting cages, working with the park district to install climate-controlled restrooms, changing the outfield grass so there can be IHSA post-season play, and removing a pond ""in which geese congregated resulting in goose droppings on the facility.""

However, ""spectator viewing opportunities remain inferior at Birchwood Park as compared to other district ... competition facilities and the facility has fewer amenities as compared to the (varsity) baseball field (at Westwood Park).""

Hill said the district has demonstrated its commitment to Morton High School female student-athletes by spending about $1 million over the past several years renovating the Birchwood Park varsity softball diamond.


The district's sports equipment and supply budget for Morton High School for the 2020-21 school year was $68,850, with $49,625 allocated to boys teams, $18,150 to girls teams and $1,075 to the combined boys and girls cross country teams, according to the OCR investigation.

Investigators also noted more frequent uniform replacements for the boys basketball team compared to the girls basketball team over the past three school years.

MacIntosh said she filed the Title IX complaint against the district as a last resort after investigating concerns brought to her attention by a community member, sending emails detailing equity issues to district administrators, meeting with administrators at Birchwood Park and speaking at a School Board meeting.

""I waited for a positive response to fix the equity issues. No response back,"" she said. ""So I filed a Title IX complaint with the OCR.""

"The story: I am a huge fan of the show.  As director of operations for Oliver’s, I am fortunate to have a lot of latitude in planning and executing themed events centered around my interests. My brother and I launched the Oliver’s Trivia Series in 2019, and it has been an incredibly successful project that we have a great time running. Being doubtful that there would be enough local die-hard ITYSL fans for a trivia night, we decided on more of a fan meet-up so that we could draw fans from all over and make all of the effort of throwing the event worthwhile. We are already drawing fans from many other states, and at the rate at which tickets are selling, we expect a sellout.

A non-exhaustive list of things this diaper person has done:

We had to put business expenses on credits cards that would be maxed out. 

He refused to pay at least one employee the raise amount that was agreed upon. 

He has been seen with white powder under his nose during work hours. 

He took every bit of credit away from the people that ACTUALLY did all of the work in regards to COVID: The lab professionals and IT department in Reditus and all of the factory workers of PAL (orthotics company) making faceshields. 

Apparently he's made over $200 million off of COVID testing. Complete pandemic profiteering.

He refused to compensate a previous business partner over $25,000 in travel and sales fees.

He swindled money from a local physician. 

Also, the guy that wrote the software in the IT department for the PCR machine interface was given no additional compensation even though this was not a part of his job requirements.

Even look at a place like Tennessee where housing is affordable and the weather not so bleak (I say this as a Canadian who lives here, weather would be fine if it got cold enough to skate outdoors more than few weeks or we had hills for skiing locally etc, even sledding is limited as we don't really get that much snow consistently.

"I transplanted here about 10 years ago now, from the Chicago suburbs. Still love it!  


It's got most of the perks of living in a big city, easy access to some actual big cities, but without the cost of living. The pace of life is just slower too, and folks are by-and-large genuinely nice.  


It's not as ""hopping"" as a city center, or even a sprawling suburb. If you and the family like to get out and do stuff, there's definitely some good options, but you will have to be a bit more intentional about finding the events. But they're there for sure.  


Other comments about the weather are spot-on. The rate at which it can change is mind boggling. Two years back, a good friend of mine noted that in a 3 or 4 month span, we went from having temps at -30F all the way up to 100F. Ya learn to just be flexible.   


Job market right now still seems really awesome, no matter what work you do. That won't last indefinitely, but it's a great time to get your foot in the door. While Caterpillar and the hospitals do make up a huge chunk of the jobs, there are plenty of chains and smaller businesses around too.  


I can't promise it'll fix all your woes.

The traffic is minimal, the people are warm and friendly and the housing prices are low in comparison to anything on the West Coast.  We don't have the ocean, or mountains, or deserts, but we do have nice lakes, rivers, forests, hiking trails, nice restaurants, and no crowds. The hospitals are excellent also.  And it is only 2 1/2 hours to Chicago, St Louis, and Indianapolis.  My only recommendation is to look at the surrounding areas to Peoria, like Dunlap, Washington and East Peoria.

"I'm a born and raised Peoria local and I have never moved out of the area so maybe take that into consideration with what I'm about to say.

Peoria is good if you are looking to live somewhere cheap and you don't care about outdoor activities for most of the year. I am someone who requires sunlight as much as possible to keep a positive outlook on life and Peoria (and by extension Central IL) has been hell in that regard. The winters are fucking brutal and most of the time it remains cold and dreary well into April. Weather patterns are unpredictable and you will often get 70 degree days followed swiftly by <32 degree snow storms in the Spring/Fall. The wind is almost always a major factor to account for and, accompanied by high humidity, makes for some blisteringly cold days.

Then comes summer. I personally don't mind the summers as they are usually pretty sunny but they are HUMID. If you've ever been to the south and experienced a summer there its very similar but without as many places for shade. Now the reason I say that you should move here if you don't care about outdoor activities is partially bc of the weather, but it is also because of the topography of the area. IL is actually the second flattest state in the country only outdone by FL and that is incredibly apparent in Central IL. Peoria itself is beautiful and the Illinois river valley is a scenic place to be when the weather is good, but everything (and I do mean EVERYTHING) outside of the valley is miles on miles of endless corn fields. There is no nature to speak of and you will get used to the feeling of deja vu while driving down the highway and feeling like you've passed the same farmhouse and field multiple times that day. I've seen people recommending Blo/No as an alternative to Peoria and I have personally lived there. It is by far the most bland and lifeless scenery out of the whole area. I would not recommend it unless (see beginning of comment).

It all comes down to what you value of course and you will find a hell of a deal if you want to buy a house here. Just know that there is a reason it's so cheap here.

Also to address your concerns about drugs and homeless people where you're from, unfortunately that's the case for most major cities that don't experience major winter weather. Many northern cities used to have policies of underfunding their homeless services and instead paying for bus tickets to ship their homeless to southern cities where they could survive on the street year-round. I can't speak to their current policies unfortunately. There are plenty of struggling homeless people and drug addicts coming from Central IL, they are just well hidden or moved elsewhere.",t2_15kz6mxq,ManDooku,0,1647387529.0,0,t1_i0tfydb,i0tfydb,True,NoBuilder9047,t3_tf0go0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tf0go0/hello_there_from_california/,hello there from California,/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tf0go0/hello_there_from_california/i0tfydb/,4,r/PeoriaIL,0,4

"“The simple irony here is that we have grown adults throwing temper tantrums over the Founding Fathers,” said a school board member during a private meeting Monday evening, “when what they really need to get mad about is the fact they haven’t FOUND any bitches.” In contrast, most D150 students affected by the name changes seem unfazed.

“I don’t care,” said Payton Martinez, a fifth-grader at soon-to-be Reservoir Gifted Academy, weighing in on the new name for Washington Gifted School.

In fact, a poll regarding the name change, conducted by The City of Peoria found that 87% of kids “don’t care”, while 10% “think it will be cool.” The remaining three percent were curious about whether our correspondent had games on their phone and couldn’t be bothered for an opinion one way or the other.

“The fact that the young people going to these schools have no opinion on the matter really draws the focus onto the creeps on the internet that are all of a sudden so infatuated with elementary schools,” another school board member said in a Tuesday morning video call to The City. “I just can’t help but ask, ‘why are you, a grown man, so interested in and getting defensive over elementary schools?’ It seems kind of suspect, in a real pedophile-type of way. I’m happy to say, however, we are working closely with the Peoria Police Department to document these comments and put these individuals on a watchlist in order to protect our kids. These childless freaks clearly have a mental health disease or something, to be getting this hot and bothered over elementary schools, and then to get defensive when they’re pressed on the issue. Just nasty.”

This story will be updated, so please like and share to spread the news on this polarizing event.

EDIT: I suppose after seeing all of these comments, I need to address the seemingly-invisible elephant in the room: 

Please consider the fact that this is parody and in no way real. The statistics are made up, the quotes are made up, no school board member made any such comments. There is no “Payton Martinez” in fifth grade at Washington Gifted School (well maybe not, I didn’t check honestly). It was fabricated to poke fun at the absolute absurdity that is the struggle between people who care way too much about the changing names of elementary schools, and the inability of the school board to act in a meaningful way that will actually benefit kids.",t2_fe00th67,TheCityofPeoria,0,1647380987.0,0,t1_i0t02va,i0t02va,True,TheCityofPeoria,t3_tf1bso,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tf1bso/d150_school_board_members_accused_of_erasing/,D150 School Board members accused of erasing history of Founding Fathers [MIC],/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tf1bso/d150_school_board_members_accused_of_erasing/i0t02va/,8,r/PeoriaIL,0,8

"Actually I thought the starlink dish points generally North?  We have it setup currently on its tripod on the ground and it points mostly north.  As far as tree canopy is concerned, we do have a very significant number of tall trees, but I've done a lot of testing with the dish until I can get it to its final mount point.  We also want to wait until the leaves come in on the trees before final mounting, just to be sure.

&#x200B;

In any case though the previous owner had an echostar dish pointed south on the east side of the garage on a pole.  Just to see if I could clear the roof line I put the Starlink dish on that pole, and as expected the garage blocked the north and it couldn't get a signal.  However I had some pole extenders and temporarily put two of them on the existing pole and threw the dish up on that, and it just barely is peaking over the gutter line.  Incidentally that location got a 100% signal after the 12 hours of gathering obstruction data.  

&#x200B;

So considering the peak of the roof is north of where the dish is, and the dish is pointing north (towards the peak), its able to clear the entire roof even that low, which means pretty much anywhere on the roof it will be able to get a good signal (peak of the roof would probably be best though).

&#x200B;

">this white flight is why we get a reputation for racism

Unfortunately it isn't as simple as that. 

""To determine the 15 worst cities for black Americans, 24/7 Wall St. ranked the nation’s metropolitan areas based on racial disparities in income, education, health, incarceration, and white-black achievement gaps in other socioeconomic outcomes using data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics."" [Source](https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/news/local-news/peoria-ranked-7th-on-list-of-worst-cities-for-black-americans-slight-improvement-from-last-year/)

Specifically listed for Peoria:

* 79.6% of black adults have a high school diploma, 13.4 percentage points below the area’s white high school attainment rate of 92.9%.

* One of the largest such gaps in the country. In Peoria, some 34.5% of black residents live below the poverty line, nearly four times the 9.3% white poverty rate in the metro area.
* The unemployment rate for black Americans is at 18.1%, while white unemployment sits at 5.5%.

* 32.6% of African American heads of households own their homes — less than half the 76.1% white homeownership rate.

* The median income for black community members is at just over $28,000, which is 46.4% of white income


So while white flight is happening in Peoria, it isn't the only reason for the racist reputation.

"I think your friend is going to have a lot of trouble finding any attorney to take a case like that on contingency.  Property, typically isn’t tremendously valuable, thus overall recovery would be limited, unlike personal injury where medical bills, pain and suffering, etc., make a case more valuable.  Thus, most attorneys would be reluctant to take a property case on contingency as they would only get 33% of what is unlikely to be a large recovery.  Further, it would probably be reasonably difficult to prove negligence for an electrical malfunction, which means the case will require more work than a typical auto accident or work comp case.  Overall, this is not a typical contingency case so I would be surprised if any attorney would take it except on an hourly rate basis.  My advice would be to find an attorney who will agree to prepare a demand letter for a modest fee and hopefully negotiate an out of court settlement.  That should only run your friend around $500, if the apartment is willing to settle.  Any litigation will cost several thousand dollars and he will have to bear his own fees so it would be unlikely to be worth paying an attorney to actually litigate.",t2_egkb9uqd,knoxfire66,0,1647225040.0,0,t1_i0kj6wn,i0kj6wn,True,[deleted],t3_tdjyuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tdjyuq/attorney_recomendations/,Attorney Recomendations,/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tdjyuq/attorney_recomendations/i0kj6wn/,11,r/PeoriaIL,0,11

"Roads aren’t as bad as some will claim. Most of the main ones have been replaced recently or are due for major overhauls in the next 2 years. If you aren’t an excessive speeder, the potholes are pretty easy to navigate around, and they get repaired quickly if you report them. 

Internet access is pretty good. Several options, same cost as anywhere else, and fewer outages than my remote colleagues. 

Airport access is crazy good as long as you don’t mind connecting flights. There are relatively few direct destinations, but I’ve had surprisingly good experiences with them… Chicago, Dallas, Denver, and Mesa/Phoenix. Of course you can connect to just about anywhere from Chicago, Dallas, and Charlotte. 

The weather is a pretty wide range, but similar to Northern NY. Hot summers, cold winters. The people talking about -20 temps must be talking about windchill. The real temps rarely dip subzero. 

The main problems with owning a home here are the same as elsewhere - be wary of older paint and plumbing. We get a fair amount of wildlife including coyotes, foxes, owls, and hawks, so keep an eye out if you have smaller pets.

A few other points I’d add…
- People will recommend moving to the collar communities around Peoria due to crime or bad schools… this white flight is a big part of the reputation for racism. Most Peorians are fairly progressive and embrace diversity. The outlying towns are super conservative with zero diversity. 
- The people that complain the most about Peoria don’t actually live in Peoria. The violent crime here is almost exclusively amongst gangs and those in the drug trade. The property crime is a little less than I’ve experienced elsewhere. Most Peorians I know haven’t had any issues with crime. 
- Peoria has had a recent mass-exodus and mass-influx. A lot of folks moved due to CAT HQ moving. Probably more moved due to seeking more conservative states or retiring to warmer climates in the south. The people that have moved to here recently see the value of our low cost of living with relatively great amenities. We still have a fair amount of complainers that will never leave, but the area’s getting better in spite of them.
- Covid hit hard here. We were adjusting and bouncing back pretty well from the CAT move when the pandemic hit. A lot of stores and restaurants had to close with the shutdowns and people generally avoiding public places. Now that the pandemic is subsiding, a bunch of businesses are expanding, new ones opening, and big developments and infrastructure improvements are planned for the next 2 years.",t2_91sdmpqh,Muffin-True,0,1647201439.0,0,t1_i0j3716,i0j3716,True,ChiefOnomatopoeia,t3_tcjygk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tcjygk/moving_to_peoria/,Moving to Peoria,/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tcjygk/moving_to_peoria/i0j3716/,3,r/PeoriaIL,0,3

"I’m not the original commenter but I may be able to provide some context. I moved away from Peoria/Morton 5 years ago after living in the area my whole life. 

* It felt like everyone I grew up with or ever worked with talked about “when they were getting out”. Personally, it was hard to work with middle-aged people who hated this town so much but were clearly never going to actually leave. They were bitter and it stung. There was not a lot of pride or hope for improving Peoria until recently. From the outside, it seems like that is shifting and there are groups working to change this attitude (like [Angie Ostaszweski)](https://www.hoiabc.com/2021/12/15/peoria-woman-uses-tiktok-bring-dozens-new-families-city/). This is so cool, because I think this is going to have a huge, positive impact. 
* It is the [5th most racist city in the US.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-city-rankings/most-racist-cities-in-america) this is down from #2 several years ago. In my experience, coworkers would say slurs with no hesitation. There is a lot of casual racism. There is also more overt racism, like a classmate telling me Black people are a different species. 
* Depending on your politics, it can be depressing. It is pretty conservative, with republicans running with no alternate options for many county and state positions. I had coworkers who liked to taunt me about policies being put in place. A lot of people I grew up with were hyper religious and anti LGBTQ. 
* At least when I was there, city politics were also mind-boggling. Peoria bent over backwards for Cat but still got fucked over majorly. A lot of money is misused in other areas too [for example](https://amp.pjstar.com/amp/3915159001). The city politics make it hard to make improvements to the city. 
* It’s flat. There is beauty in that, but it could also be boring. Coming from NY, I’m not sure if you would love the change or hate it. A lot of lifers hate it. 
* Winter is odd. This year there was more snow in Peoria than normal. Usually there is not much, which means there isn’t a lot of snow sports or winter activities. It sometimes felt like people just hunkered down to get through winter rather than living and enjoying the season. 

There are a lot of people praising the pros in this thread and that is such a nice thing to see. There are things I miss and the growth makes me happy.

">Second, the genuine kindness and warmth of people here is unparalleled and continues to be one of the most special parts of living here. For example, if you get to know people around here, when you do buy a house and you tell people - they won't just show excitement and ask to hear all about it. 

While this may be the view of a New England transplant - it's by far not the case with any kind of world experience.  Restaurant servers are barely polite.  Basic manners are rarely culturally the norm.  People in your neighborhood may be nice, but generally speaking the shrinking economy is putting the pressure on most.

A little bit of googling will show you that Peoria has actually ranked in most racist places in the country - by statistics; they actually pay black people less here.  Systematically, and socioeconomically - they're separate - block by block.  Growing up here, I did not have any diversity in my friends group; now that I've moved back, I still don't...

"In my experience he was very rude and weird at the showing... 

I don't drive so I had taken an Uber there and was waiting for an Uber to go and view a second property of his and it was to arrive in 5 minutes.... rather than wait the 5 minutes or just go ahead and leave me there to wait the 5 minutes and drive himself to the next property he said that we had to leave right then for some reason and that I would have to walk to the next property....keep in mind this is fairly cold winter weather and I was wearing a dress as I was not expecting to have to walk anywhere.

He acted very strange while showing the place doing an absurd amount of social distancing and constantly talking about the professional occupations of the other people in the building that they were professors or med students or played in an orchestra, etc.

We asked him ahead of time if he required a certain minimum credit score before even viewing the two apartments and he said no you just have to have no prior evictions and have references.... and then he took almost a week to go through the process of setting up the viewing and applying... And he had me drop off the application and fee in some weird mailbox with no office which seemed shady ....and after which he took more than a day to tell us that our credit was too low, and he was even rude on the phone saying ""your credit is just very very bad""... My credit score for the record at the time was 635...
He could have just told me before I went through all of that that I would not be approved.

"I lived in the Rocheester and Houghton areas for 15 years - so I can compare for you.

1. Roads suck, and there are way too many of them, peoria thought it could sprawl into success - and now bears the burden of maintenance it can't afford.
2. Xfinity is xfinity - but there's also two broadband (fiber) companies, so if you're moving that much data for work, you'll want to buy a house with fiber service.
3. PIA is pretty nice, I commuted out weekly for 5 years, so was a Delta Platnum flyer.  With starting hops to Minneapolis, or Atlanta, sometimes Detroit - you can get anywhere fast enough.
4. The weather sucks IMHO - you'll be having high humidity summers, and we regularly get cold snaps in the winter of -20F.  The cold never stays, because our winters fluctuate.  The worst winter travel conditions I've ever seen were on I-74 a couple weeks ago - 100+ tractor trailers in the ditch, plus double that on automobiles.  The temperature fluctuations create a lot of icing and iced over conditions.

If you're just coming for the 'value' real estate - realize it won't have an upside in the foreseeable future.  If you are looking for mid-sized cites to move to Louisville, KY; Fayetteville Bentonville AR; and Greenville SC are all more temperate, soft winters and actually growing economies.

"I've lived in the Peoria area for almost 70 years.  The recommendations in this thread are pretty good and to the point.  The only recommendation I have is to not move into the actual city of Peoria.  Property and sales taxes are a bit higher than the surrounding cities.  Also, there are pockets of Peoria that are sketchy.   The newer houses and developments are in the Dunlap, Morton and Washington areas.  All these towns are a quick commute to Peoria and have much safer neighborhoods.

"Welcome! I moved to Peoria from Albany, NY 2 years ago. 

*Here’s what you will like about Peoria relative to the Capital Region:*

Lower cost of living. Rent, buying a home, food (especially dairy), possibly gas.  

Winters are less harsh

While PIA doesn’t have as many non-stops as Albany, the parking being free is a HUGE positive. A 30 minute flight to ORD connects you with the rest of the world. If you seek warmer destinations for a getaway, PIA does offer non-stops to several places via Allegiant. 

Traffic is almost non-existent. I don’t miss the days of being stuck south-bound on I-87 coming from Clifton Park towards Albany or being in bumper to bumper traffic on Henry Johnson.

A lot of parks that you can hike, bike, or catch views of the Illinois River. Peoria does this very well. 

Number of car wash locations . Peoria is the unofficial car wash capital of the USA. You’re never more than half a mile away from one. If you own a car and like to keep it clean, you’re coming to the right spot. 

Peoria does have a VA facility but I can’t tell you what it’s like relative to the one in the Capital Region. I’ve never been to either.

*What you might miss coming from the Capital Region*:

The variety of restaurants offered in the Capital Region. Peoria has some excellent places to eat but Albany had the type of cuisine (Korean, Ethiopian, Afghani, South Indian, Pakistani, Yemeni, etc) that you won’t find here or it won’t be nearly as good as what’s offered there. 

Crossgates Mall. It was always nice to go there and browse. They have some wonderful stores and Colonie Center was getting better and better during my 7 years there. Northwoods Mall in Peoria doesn’t have the quantity or quality of retailers that Crossgates does. I hope that changes moving forward. Shopping is one area where Peoria really falls short. 

Mountains. This is what you may miss the most. The 45 minute drive to hike in the Adirondacks or Catskills or the 15-20 minute drive to Thacher Park. Peoria does have some nice trails and Starved Rock State Park is only about an hour away. But the views hit different when you see the snow on 4K feet peaks. 

Rail travel. I used Amtrak often from Rensselaer to NYC and Syracuse and I know Schenectady was a stop. Peoria doesn’t have rail service right now but the local politicians are working on getting rail service to and from Chicago. Hopefully this gets approved soon.

"We relocated to Peoria from the east coast as well, about one year ago. Very familiar with the greater Albany area! Welcome! If you have a similar experience as I did, you will be absolutely shocked and amazed by a few things. 

Firstly, you will continue to be aghast and feel so grateful for the price of houses here. Relative to the east coast and lower New England, it feels like a gift that continually keeps on giving. You can buy a very nice house in a very nice neighborhood for $150-$200k, perhaps even less.

Second, the genuine kindness and warmth of people here is unparalleled and continues to be one of the most special parts of living here. For example, if you get to know people around here, when you do buy a house and you tell people - they won't just show excitement and ask to hear all about it. They will probably be genuinely excited for you, and immediately tell you the specific ways they can help you with your move and the new house. On the east coast, it felt like the methods people once used to maintain close communities are lost to a good degree. Not here.

VA in Peoria/new clinic in Bloomington.

Champaign is home to U of Illinois which has a huge influence on what is offered there, due to the high degree of international students (great Asian food options) and general affluence that the student body brings. 

BloNo is home to Ill State U and headquarters to State Farm and Country Companies and recently the electric car company Rivian, so lots of buyers for houses.  Has a distinct compact bar/restaurant area in downtown Bloomington with lots of options and in Uptown Normal similar but smaller scale of walkable downtown dining/shopping close to ISU.

Peoria still has a lot of CAT influence, but less so, the hospitals definitely draw a lot, but Peoria has the larger crime element compared to other cities, but it's usually within specific areas. Peoria has the benefit of geography/topography just don't swim in the IL river.

"Roads got pretty bad this winter, typical buckling from cold weather and potholes forming after. Not sure why peoria gas tax is so incredibly high when our roads always seem to be worse than neighboring counties when i've driven on their roads.

Data cap right now for xfinity is 1TB, if you need more it's not that much to pay for unlimited data. can't speak for i3. have heard good things but i've never lived anywhere that has it.

Airport is easy to get to and from, you won't get any large aircraft there and there's less direct flights right now than they've had before. I've never had a bad time going through PIA.

Coldest you've seen being -7, is that before wind chill or after? It's not super common but over this winter and last there was more than one time where the wind chill was in the -20s, but this isn't as frequent. My car will often behave differently in the mornings because it's usually gone below 15 or so, but that might just be from me having a less good car.

There's no specific problems i can think of for owning a home in Peoria that aren't the same as general complaints i have against any single family homes. Obviously research the home and the neighborhood, especially if you have children. 

My partner is a veteran, and they've said they have the typical VA problems. 

&#x200B;

Other thoughts would be that public transportation is pretty bad here, so owning a car is essentially required. Bike lanes are almost non-existent and where they are they're often merged onto roads with cars that drive in the bike lane for ??? reason.

"> How are the roads around Peoria?

Some are fine, some suck, but from what other people tell me apparently it's better than in other states like Alabama or Indiana. Not sure how it would compare to Schenectady, though. There is often a lot of construction on the highways in and around Peoria.

> How is the internet access? Are there data caps?

I've not really had any issues, but I also have only lived in Xfinity territory and don't work from home. Xfinity is better here than where I lived in Atlanta, GA, and about the same as where I lived in Chicago. 

> How is the airport access? Is PIA any good?

Generally easy to get to--one of the pluses about Peoria is that there is rarely any traffic unless it is construction-related--but the destinations are pretty limited, unless you're going to Florida a lot. 

> How is the weather? It gets pretty cold over here; the coldest I've seen is-7F.

It gets pretty cold here too, but nothing unusual and probably not worse than upstate New York. We have had a lot of snow this winter, but with the exception of one particular snow day it's been tolerable, if a bit annoying. It's not like moving to Minnesota or Northern Michigan. Plus, Peoria is a big enough city that they clear all the major roads when it does snow.

> Are there any particular problems with owning a home?

Problems like getting a house? Peoria apparently has a very affordable housing market, so good stuff can move pretty fast. A lot of ranch houses and split-levels in the good neighborhoods. The water around here is *very* hard though. Some houses have water softener systems installed. I would also second the person saying beware of lead pipes and paint, although if you have a higher housing budget you can probably avoid those issues fairly easily. 

> Any veterans? How is the VA?

I don't have any hard data, but there does seem to be a lot of American Legion buildings in the surrounding communities, so maybe? Peoria definitely isn't like a military town, but with Caterpillar having had their headquarters here until recently, you'll probably find a fair number of veterans I suppose. 

I'm sure you already know this, but visit, see if you like it (especially see what neighborhoods appeal to you), and go from there. Interest rates might be a bit higher 6-7 months from now, so maybe the housing market will slow a little, but maybe not... who knows.

Quick drive on the freeway out there. Any direct flights are going to be pretty small, and a lot of times you're better off driving to Bloomington or even Chicago.

"It happened slowly. originally, their leader Mrs. Nutter (lol) was only leading the womens Bible studies. She became a good friend and spiritual leader to all the wives and young women in the church, leading to her leading Bible studies including the men. Her husband was the pastor and was actually a very kind and nice person, good head on his shoulders, and she over time turned them all against him and they kicked him out. She is extremely manipulative, but comes off as gentle, kind, and empathetic. Some very narcissistic behavior. They started recording her lessons and there are probably over 100 that everyone in the church has on tape, CD, and now they have began to convert them into book form. Everyone has to listen to them daily at home. it’s like the Bible to them. The women are tied in more deeply than the men, because the aren’t allowed jobs (unless they are divorced) and spend a ton of time on the church and ministry, so it’s basically even if you disagree, you risk losing your family and everything you know and love. So many times a husband had tried to leave but the wife won’t go, breaking apart many families. In the past 10 years more couples have left together, but their older parents will almost always cut off all contact because they don’t believe you should even eat a meal with people who don’t believe the same as them.

"Wait, did Fake Nate know what?   You probably meant Real Nate, right?

"What's up Ptown!  There's a story related to this mural that not a lot of people know, but it can now be revealed:

A little over a year ago, a mysterious patron hired me to write a 2-hour rock opera about the Cookie Monster mural.  I made demos of two songs as proof of concept, but then the project was scuttled as funding fell through when my patron suddenly moved to Patagonia ""for legal reasons.""

So I give these songs to the community instead, free of charge.  Some of you have heard the original live demos of these, but these are re-recorded versions, of slightly better quality.  There was supposed to be a full band with professional musicians if we had our whole budget, but on these recordings I had to do it all myself instead.  If anyone wants to perform these songs around town, please do.

The first, better known, is ""Fuck Real Nate"", done in a hip-hop style: https://soundcloud.com/fridayproductions/fuck-real-nate-1

I think Fuck Real Nate represents a genuine moment of anger on the street, and I stand by it.  However as a long-term legacy, we should not focus on the villain so much that we lose sight of our hero, Fake Nate.

So the follow up song is kind of a feel-good stoner-rock thing, ""Fake Nate Forever"":  https://soundcloud.com/fridayproductions/fakenate

So, next time you see Fake Nate, or someone who might be Fake Nate, raise a cookie in his honor.
