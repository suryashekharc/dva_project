"From what I've heard at work from those that deal with the city. Covid was used as an excuse to fully kill market night. The newer chic little hot to trot bars and businesses that have set up shop on State St. raised bloody murder about having what little parking there is taken for a few hours one night a week and the city listened to them rather than keeping market night going for the wider community. They've have the Saturday morning little one back for over a year. So Covid nothing. This has nothing to do with Covid. And Covid is all over as far as cities and counties and the state are concerned now anyway.

Which to me only says someone or more than one on the city council has a personal vested interest ($$$) in keeping some business(s) there happy.

"Where is your work? I grew up in Moreno Valley and went to middle and high school in Redlands. But most of my friends a lot of my life was split between the two towns. Redlands is more quaint, charming and generally more affluent (with a LOT of churches) and a more tight knit community. I both loved and hated this as I was seen as an outsider and weird for wanting to have a life outside of Redlands as people in a Redlands were very condescending towards other people in the IE. Riverside is bigger and has a larger scene for food and events and had better shopping. Downtown Redlands was always pretty fun and there are more international food places opening because of the University. It also depends where in Riverside you’ll be as the 91/60/10 all have their different traffic nightmare scenarios.

"Dear Mother  
  
Not legal advice but practical, parental advice. Your son and most kids between 6th grade and 12th grade are raging bags of screwed up thoughts, testosterone and a mixture of other things. I was the same way at that age just as every other person that has ever been that age. You may not remember it but I'm willing to bet you were a messed up bag of hormones around then as well.  
  
Girls fight with thoughts and emotions. Boys end up getting physical more often than not. The fact that your son ended up getting into an actual physical fight with fists (rather than simple shoving and tripping) isn't a big deal; shit happens.  
  
You already mentioned the medical scans came back clean. Your sons ""symptoms"" are common knowledge and/or easily googleable. If you or your mother asked him something along the lines of ""are you having vision problems? are you dizzy? do you have a headache?"" or similar things your son just found a way out of getting in trouble.  
  
Also, the fact that your son wants to return to his old school probably means he's aware of more than you give him credit for. You raised a smart kid, enjoy that win. Even if he lost that fight at least now every bully in his school knows not to mess with him. Bullies only like to pick on people that don't fight back.  
  
Hope the police don't do any more regarding this incident than they absolutely have to. Depending on who took the report and how bored the PD is the report may simply be filed and forgotten. I hope for your son's mental and emotional well being this is what happens; he doesn't want to get a reputation for being a mommy's boy that can't stand up for himself or a snitch that makes a big thing out of a bit of testosterone.  
  
If you do find an attorney willing to take on your case be prepared for unintended consequences; ie, your son will be targeted and harassed more in the coming years than if you just dropped the entire matter and let him stand up for himself.",t2_4cwa3851,Mykidsdad2009,0,1644783190.0,0,t1_hwtiay7,hwtiay7,False,[deleted],t3_rkzfdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Redlands/comments/rkzfdp/intern_in_redlands_for_the_summer/,Intern in Redlands for the summer,/r/Redlands/comments/rkzfdp/intern_in_redlands_for_the_summer/hwtiay7/,1,r/Redlands,0,1
"This week my son was in a fight at school around noon. He was immediately walked to detention, not once assesed for injury, not asked if he needed to see the nurse, not asked if he could call his parents. He sat in detention from noon to until school was released at 3:30. As normal, my mom picked him up and dropped him at my house as I work from home. When he arrived I noticed my son wasn't well. He had a black eye, hurt his leg, scrapes all over and seemed emotionally distraught. Once he saw me he immediately started crying telling me he was in a fight. He told me he had a headache and was dizzy and was having vision problems. I took him to urgent care and immediately called the school to find out what happened and why I wasnt called when my son was injured. The school security gaurd called me back 2 hours later, followed by the assistant principal 3 hours later after I told the security guard I will be filing a police report and he failed to do his job ( in other words) The assistant principal only wished to discuss discipline while I was sitting in the hospital with my injured son. Urgent care wanted my son to be assessed at the emergency room, so we went there and got a cat scan. The next morning I filed a police report and the principal called me at 7am and told me he is conducting an investigation.  He offered an immediate transfer to another school per my wishes.  I denied the transfer per my sons wishes and asked for time to sit on it over the weekend. I've contacted a lawyer, but no one has called me back. I posted the events on social media and my community were outraged, alot of them telling me different stories of the happenings to their children at this school. Some even giving me leads to a lawyer and some calling the school themselves on my sons behalf. 

What are my next steps in this? What do you suggest? I intend to fight it, I want my son to be in a safe environment during school, and they neglected care for my son for 3 and a half hours.

Another East Coast transplant who settled in Redlands here. I really am happy we moved to the town. I originally moved to the area for work and downtown Redlands reminded my husband and I of the awesome seaside downtown we lived in for a while back in New York. We were on the fence about having a kid at the time but wanted to move to somewhere with good schools in case we did. I like that I can walk or bike to a lot of shops and places to get a coffee/drink/snack (it’s about 1.5-2 miles from where I live to downtown). My kid is younger than yours but we are really at a point where we are starting to take advantage of the parks and events the town puts on. During the summers there are free concerts at the Redlands Bowl and it’s pretty easy to find things to keep us entertained the rest of the year as well.,t2_364hm,troixetoiles,0,1641943386.0,0,t1_hs9y0bb,hs9y0bb,True,[deleted],t3_s1eike,https://www.reddit.com/r/Redlands/comments/s1eike/how_do_you_like_living_in_redlands/,How do you like living in Redlands?,/r/Redlands/comments/s1eike/how_do_you_like_living_in_redlands/hs9y0bb/,3,r/Redlands,0,3
"I'm 32, grew up in San Diego and lived all over Nor Cal as well. I wasn't looking forward to moving to the IE and Redlands for work however I've been presently surprised.

Its hell hot in the summer and pretty bad air quality with all the smog blown in from the coast then stuck in front of the mtn, but it comes and goes. I find I drive a lot to get to more desirable places but I live a very solo active lifestyle to I'm sure family life would be more sedentary.

No I'm not sure why. I have 3 boys and we have only dealt with 2 of the middle schools. I know there are more problems and trouble in the one middle school (Cope)  in particular but when we moved to another middle school (Moore) there weren't as many problems. And if your kids are in sports you may want to check each high school too as some have better sports teams then others. Honestly we knew nothing about Southern California before we moved here.

"Redlands will have plenty to do. To back what others are saying, there's a rail project that will be done by the time you are here, which can take you to downtown Redlands. Downtown has grocery stores, restaurants, bars, whatever you would need, so I would recommend just going there. ESRI has a stop on the rail so transportation should be covered for necessities.

If you take any exits beyond the ESRI stop on the rail, I'd say be careful or go with some friends or other interns.

I do recommend taking the internship though, it is pretty valuable and the ESRI campus is beautiful.

The Redlands passenger rail project if it's finished by then will have a stop at the University and a stop at the esri campus. There's also a stop in downtown right across the street from 2 grocery stores. So you shouldn't have any problem with that. I'm not far from that area.

"I think Redlands is too spread out to be walking everywhere. A bicycle would be doable though. Redlands is bike friendly. (Look up Redlands Bicycle Classic, and Orange Blossom Trail). The closest grocery store to the campus I believe is Stater Bros. which is almost 1 mile away but it's on the North side of the freeway which is around some sketchy neighborhoods. Not as bad as San Bernardino but I definitely prefer shopping or living on the South side of the freeway. Ride just a little further South to shop at Trader Joe's instead. ESRI is about 2-1/2 miles from the campus which is about 15 minutes by bike. A lot of the roads have bike lanes. The UofR campus is very nice. They had Zipcar available but I'm not sure if they still do. There are plenty of people doing Uber/Lyft or even Turo if you need to go further than a bicycle can reasonably take you.

No you will not be able to go to the store without a car. From the university you will need to walk several blocks to a bus stop. The university is a way from ESRI if you are working on their campus.

"At even 4 stories these things will be taller than anything on State St. save for the Citi building. They should be trying to rebuild/recreate State St, the way it was before the mall went through. Match it up. Something that big is also going to alter/block the view somewhat. Is that part important? Not really I guess. But to me, just look at that parking structure they're building for *all* those people in need of the light rail to get a couple miles down the road to those happening places like ??? (yes that's sarcasm). That thing is a pretty big eyesore already if you ask me.

They want tall condos they should stick them over there by the warehouses and DMV with the rest of them. 

The other thing to think about is this. This condo w/ store beneath thing is a fad. These 'it' centers where it's your apartment and your entertainment all in one. Whatever you call this madness. This younger generation of people will move on form this. And owners will be left trying to rent out locations that all the other generations would have looked down and will again. Thus becoming sort of empty or slummy spots. It's inevitable. These people interested in this type of arrangement. Their own parents and grandparents wouldn't have been caught dead living in a location above a store or with amazing views of warehouse rooftops, busy streets and parking lots (again, the JCP and Harkins apartments). It would have been beneath them. This isn't a long lasting shift in the market. It's a fad. And just like every new and shiny shopping center. In time, people, businesses, the town overall will eventually move on to the new and better location leaving the old one to rot. Slowly. Look no further than the old Mervyn's center and the Wal-Mart center.

That is the inevitability of these condo/store things. Only it'll be smack bad in downtown.

I’m from Ma was looking at U of R still am but from what I’ve seen for a student to pay $1000 and up for rent is absolutely insane especially if they want to be a student athlete… so you would need a full time job while taking full time classes and if wanted a sport … it’s ridiculous rent for college students should be like 600 a month it’s one of the main factors making college kids more stressed out we are still trying to find what we want to do not be forced to bar tend 40 hours a week and full time school we don’t get time to experience our youth or express our selfs and that’s bs cost of living is way Ik and it’s not just in Cali also here in MA anywhere near water really because generations before us don’t seem to understand much nor the economics that are happening,t2_7s5qshxd,B1gMosh,0,1628659710.0,0,t1_h8i3kzz,h8i3kzz,True,[deleted],t3_owhknt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Redlands/comments/owhknt/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Redlands/comments/owhknt/deleted_by_user/h8i3kzz/,1,r/Redlands,0,1

"So a couple things happened:

When UoR got their new president, the admin cracked down on off campus housing. Students are required to live on campus all 4 years unless they get a waiver. The way it used to be, I could just say “oh I have allergies” and get a medical exemption to live where I want off campus. Now, the admin is much stricter on who can live off campus. As such, they announced over the summer that students who had signed leases during COVID that went through their junior/senior years are required to come BACK on campus, effectively hanging these students out to dry.

Some nearby things that might scratch your itch; East Coast Bagels in the shopping center near Clarks in Loma Linda. The little friends of the library bookshop in the basement of AK Smiley. The University of Redlands library lets you in to browse/sit and read a book even if you aren't a student and in non-covid times I've seen some amazing senior showcases in art and music there. There are some interesting exhibits and classic cinema events put on by the Redlands Art Association.

"I lived at Citrus Grove Apartments in Redlands for about 13 years (left in 2018, bought a house). Wasn't perfect, but crime was pretty low - just the odd theft of a license plate or... wheelchair (!) in the complex, but otherwise pretty sound. I always felt safe.  Not much to complain about, and had some decent neighbors.  They are advertising the 2-bedroom 2-bathroom apartments (859 sqft) for $1,949.  At least worth a look.

The bonus was that my balcony overlooked the Ted Runner Stadium, which is right next door, and is where they let off the fireworks for the 4th of July celebration at the University of Redlands.  It is one of the nation's leading fireworks displays. You would also get the low-flying planes over the complex which was a sight to behold.  ...Oh, expect about 30 car alarms to go off that night too, due to the fireworks and low flying aircraft. :D

"Olive Avenue Market is cute as hell, especially the outside patio area. Huge selection of pastries, coffees, bottled sodas and beers, even hot food... Grab coffee and pastries and take them out there and they'll be enchanted!

Bricks and Birch has delicious food and great coffee, and is really nice inside, but can be a bit busy.

Stell's is great food but mediocre coffee. Nice outdoor seating.

Molino's replaced Augie's so don't go there. Avoid.

The Cupcake Bar (I forget the name but it's in the Citibank building) has great pastries and nice seating, too.

The Meek Place at Mountain Grove is nice, especially if you wanna see a movie before/after at Harkin's across the street!

"Finding housing in Redlands is rough right now! I pay $2100 for a brand new apartment with 1 bedroom and a den. 900sq ft.  Little pricey and going up $100 when I resign lease in August.  Crime is lowest in Redlands, Yucaipa, Loma Linda— I believe (extend grace if I’m off please).  Just be aware of crimes of opportunity (e.g., leaving cars unlocked or bicycles not locked up).  Homelessness in CA is off the hook right now.  Nearly every exit has people asking for money.  There’s a local push to encourage panhandlers to seek resources— and not reinforce the behavior through handouts (I know, I know seems harsh from a humanity side. Just sharing what I learned).  Right now there’s a hot commodity on catalytic converters. Don’t ask.  Get a Ring camera and/or alarm system just for peace of mind.  Lots to do!   Mountains, desert, beaches, or even local!  I feel like tons of opportunities here for great food, coffee, wine, craft beers, arts, or outdoors. Food is insanely expensive right now.  Steak cost is how I base this perspective 😂 anyway, glad to have you moving to town! Let me know if you have any more questions. 42/f with 8 year old.

"I have two so far!

Pho Long in grand terrace us about a 10 minute drive away. They're all great to talk to, I've never had a bad experience with them. The broth is great on its own, portions are huge, and their pork bun appetizer is 100! The only downside I've found is that their oxtails are small for the price, and sometimes the cut of their fatty brisket is wrong, which can make it tough and chewy. 

Pho TnT is also very close, I've only had it once but their broth was great, and the meat was delicious (perfect, good quality cuts)! It's number two because I've only had it once so I can't tell if they're consistent, and because they don't have as large of a variety when it comes to drinks and appetizers as Pho Long does. 

Side notes: I don't eat tripe, and haven't found a place that has tendon that I'm very fond of.

Places I wouldn't try again would be Ocean Pho (I've tried two of their locations) and Pho Mai. I'm not sure if I ordered on off days, or if it's specific to the to-go experience, but everything about my pho from these places fell short. 😫

"I think the price for the apartment got to me because I worked 10 hour days and then spent another 2+ hours in traffic. The space was small, and I wasn't around during the times the amenities were open. So I couldn't wrap my head around why I was paying the price of a mortgage for a place I couldn't really appreciate. When they tried to raise the rent $200 in the middle of covid, I thought about it - I was saving for a house, and was no longer trapped by the job, may as well leave the apartment that I only got while trying to get as close as possible to work. 

Now I split the rent and have twice the savings. So far I've been gardening (my black thumb is turning green!), hiking (blue mountain was awesome in the winter time, and eating (a lot!

"I've lived in Long Beach, Torrance, Carson, and Glendale! (Born and raised LA Native, when I wasn't off the slow-oh-five, I was off of the terrible 101).  Ive also spent time in Orange county. My family lives in Redondo, and driving there from Glendale - which I did love but didn't appreciate the price- was about an hour, which is close to the same timing from where I live now. More miles on my car, but less fighting the urge to bash my head against the steering wheel from traffic rage. And I like driving. 

I'm 29, but fairly introverted. So while a lot of my friends live in the middle of it all, it can be overwhelming. And yeah -im never happy in anything above 80 degrees 🤣 but if I'm out and about in the summer its usually early morning or after the sun has set. I picked the habit up years ago - no brunches, no errand running, nuh-uh, no way. You picked the wrooonggg gal. 

I guess I can appreciate it here because I searched and narrowed it down, then visited a few times and decided I liked it. There's a home depot,  target, a library, and thai food, the house has AC and I can get 1gb internet.  Everything else is a bonus.

I'm remote! I worked in Hollywood, the drive from my apartment that was 10 miles away was an hour, sometimes more.

My boyfriend drives big rigs out this way, and wasn't ready to leave state yet. So we looked around and found redlands. It's actually the perfect location for what he does.

"There are quite a few good spots for Thai food in Redlands. Thai House, Mu, Garden Thai, and Aroi Mak Mak if you want it a little more authentic. The Gourmet Pizza Shoppe is fantastic, they have some really crazy pizzas in their menu but they're amazing. Carne asada fries at Kluddes are amazing plus they usually have taco Tuesday specials. The Tartan has a nice happy hour and pretty good food. It feels like you've traveled back in time when you're in there. Their patio is nice too. Night market will come back, there was a guy that used to be a high school science teacher that sold succulents and other plants. He has some cool stuff.

"Local-ish: Banning/Beaumont. Follow Highland Springs all the way south to gates. Beyond that is a valley. Lockheed (not sure if this is the one other posts are referring to) use to test rocket engines out there during the 50s-80s. Among other rumored things. Some bunkers are still there. Haven't gone out there hiking since high school in the 90s. Back then it was an open secret that there were government types roaming around even though it was suppose to already be abandoned. Dark clad armed men in trucks and bikes. Helicopters would fly low in and out of the area. Saw it with my own eyes as did many others I know back then. There was stuff going on. What exactly I'm not sure. Lots of rumors though. Seeing lights in the sky over the valley to supposed experimental engine testing. If you stayed off the road while hiking in and parked a bit back they wouldn't notice you but you could see them driving around in the distance on the valley floor. Stick to the gullies and along the low hills.

What it's like now idk. I've heard a few people say as of the mid 00s it now really *is* abandoned. Lots of housing encroachment.

But it use to be quite a thing back then. An open secret. Idk if anyone here remembers it.

Redlands will be more expensive and tighter than surrounding communities, check out Highland, Yucaipa, etc for other options.",t2_7j5oa,comosellamaella,0,1619291647.0,0,t1_gvqmvwa,gvqmvwa,True,TheChaosJester,t3_mxpq1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Redlands/comments/mxpq1p/moving_in_may/,Moving in may,/r/Redlands/comments/mxpq1p/moving_in_may/gvqmvwa/,2,r/Redlands,0,2
