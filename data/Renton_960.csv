"I walk this area with my dog daily. Renton is beautiful, and 3rd ave is an active corridor for businesses. Yes, the unhoused numbers have skyrocketed (especially since Seattle started removing camps a few weeks ago) and the numbers of actively intoxicated people walking the area is high. I do have to give a shout out to our police here though - they support our businesses wholeheartedly and show up within minutes of any conflict. Not to say they are the go to problem solver, but they have all been exceptional from my perspective in protecting our businesses. Growing the business sector is huge for the city of Renton, and it shows through incentives and directives. 

Long story long, this issue is gonna be an issue regardless of where you put up a brick and mortar in king county. Renton is a great choice because they have ways to support you, a real small town vibe of community support, and a vibrant customer base who utilizes the walkability. 

My only advice is don’t go right off Rainer unless you plan to install A LOT of security measures. Bars on all windows and doors at minimum. 3rd ave is better, as is the shopping center with sierra fish and pets. In general, the closer you are to the city center, the less hassle you will get.

"Yes, the homeless situation will continue getting worse, for the following reasons: 

1. Renton should be opening more homeless shelters/resources. When there's no place for homeless folks to go, they stay out on the streets, which is what neither you nor they want. Some Renton city councilmembers are pushing to work with the King County regional homelessness authority and open more shelters, but they tend to be outvoted by the ones who don't want to. 

2. Renton housing and rental prices keep going up. However, Renton city councilmembers tend to be very against affordable housing / increasing density / building more homes, which would be necessary to keep the housing prices down. From the 2010-2020 census, we see that there was very low population growth in Renton compared to other areas in King County; this will keep housing prices high because the population is just going to keep growing. 

---

Getting off my soapbox, though... I think downtown Renton is still a beautiful thriving place. You see a lot of traffic around Rainier Ave / 2nd-3rd all the time. McLendon is a _little_ further from the downtown core walkable area, but it's near Safeway and Fred Meyer, meaning people can drop by your small business when they pick up groceries, etc.",t2_117fud,blandlycunning,0,1648160200.0,0,t1_i1zmvja,i1zmvja,True,humpty2019,t3_tn5pc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renton/comments/tn5pc0/renton_downtown_crimehomeless/,Renton downtown crime/homeless,/r/Renton/comments/tn5pc0/renton_downtown_crimehomeless/i1zmvja/,18,r/Renton,0,18

-Moderator Experience-

I have NO Reddit mod experience but have plenty of moderation experience. In fact I shied away from moderating on this platform because I previously managed a fair number of live event/broadcast chat rooms as part of my IRL job. 

This community is pretty positive and drama free, but if its ever needed I do have experience dealing with ‘the crazy’…. including a debate between James Carville and Ann Coulter (I still black out thinking about the chats I had to moderate there lol).

Happy to send the mod team some relevant personal/job/LinkedIn/etc info to support this via DM. 

-A bit about me-

As a matter of transparency I feel I need to talk a bit about myself…

Im a dirty transplant that came for a job in Seattle back in 2015. However my wife was born and raised in the region with most of her family living in Renton. We moved her from Tukwila this past fall and have decided this is where we’ll stay…. We have a two year old kiddo and another on the way… and we’ve found that Renton is the perfect mix of community, diversity, and opportunity that we want for our children. 

As with the above, happy to share my fb profile with the mod team - at the very least to prove I’m not off my rocker. Unless an unhealthy love of Tim Hortons is considered crazy!

-Why I’m interested-

As mentioned, this is my home now. We all get involved in our community in different ways, from spending money at our favorite Renton Teriyaki joint to freezing our butts off at a kids soccer game. Being a moderator of this community is just a small way that I can get involved in sharing and supporting positive news and conversations pertaining to Renton.

"The rumor/widespread knowledge is that Renton's leadership at the time opposed ST3 to the point where they didn't ask for light rail. When the plans came out (and obviously didn't include Renton), they complained that the ST3 didn't include Renton. As a result, Renton got really screwed over by the city councilmembers at the time (many of whom are still city councilmembers now).

Technically, there's some kind of plan to build light rail that links Renton to West Seattle, but imo that's really useless to the vast majority of commuters. I used to bike 5 miles up to the Rainier Link Light Rail station and take that the rest of the way into Seattle to get to work. There are bus ""rapid transit"" lines, but those are also useless given that buses aren't given bus only lanes on the highway, and therefore get as tied up in traffic as every other car. Of course, the same kind of people who fought ST3 and light rail in Renton would also be the same kind of people that would oppose bus only lanes. 

It's really unfortunate that Renton's local politics have been so dominated by business interests (chamber of commerce) and wealthy NIMBYs.",t2_117fud,blandlycunning,0,1646890350.0,0,t1_i02nhpf,i02nhpf,True,kxserasera,t3_taka04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renton/comments/taka04/will_there_ever_be_a_light_rail_built_in_renton/,Will there ever be a light rail built in Renton?,/r/Renton/comments/taka04/will_there_ever_be_a_light_rail_built_in_renton/i02nhpf/,8,r/Renton,0,8
"Yep! Fully agree that the city of Renton sadly missed the boat when it came to fighting for its fair share of light rail. All of us paying exorbitantly high car tab fees are paying for light rail everywhere but here. It’s a shame that they caved to a small minority of wealthy landowners. Renton claims that they are ahead of the curve on all their manhole covers but its just lip service. The rail line that once carried the Spirit of Washington dinner train would have been better suited as a light rail line instead of a pedestrian trail.

"Here's the situation as I understand it, complete with hot takes:

No, Renton will never get Light Rail.

We'll get a few bus routes (probably serviced by second-hand Metro vehicles...you know, those super high-quality buses that aren't rattle-y at all!) that can run the tech folks through Renton to Bellevue Transit Center during normal commute hours. But nothing running with a reliably high-frequency, or with extended hours.

We already have train tracks running from Renton to Bellevue. But they're unusable. Several years ago the rich folk in Lower Kennydale got up in arms over the idea of commuter-serving trains running through the public land near their lakefront properties, so they pushed local councils to instead cover them up with paver gravel. Not concrete, paver gravel; so it can't even function as a reliable commuter path for bikes. (They also didn't want to be a throughway for commuters on bikes.)

I moved here after all this and the ST3 decisions were made, and from what I hear, there's a lot of ugly bitterness over how shafted Renton got/is getting with public transit over the years, compared to other growing cities and regions in the area. A lot of Nimby-ism in this area; we are home to a very wide swath of incomes.

I guess I'm a tad bitter about it too...

My advice is to make sure you explore and don’t just stay in the East Renton Highlands. Even though the Downtown Renton construction to improve the infrastructure has been going on for years, it’s such a great place to spend time. Two breweries (Dubtown and Four Generals), family friendly stuff (8-bit Arcade), unique retail (4 Sisters, Urban Sprouts), active stuff (Renton Hot Yoga, Ascendance, Vigor Ground Fitness), neighborhood bars (The Local 907), and great options for food. Free parking (street, lot, garage) and easy access to other cool places in the area. One of our favorite things to do is take our bikes out on the Cedar River trail then ride 5 more minutes to a brewery for a pint.

"We've been in what's technically East Renton Highlands for over 10 years now, and moved from north Green Lake.  We love it.  It's definitely grown around us as far as housing developments, but it still feels like the suburbs and relatively quiet.  
There's pretty much everything you need nearby, if not in the highlands then in downtown Renton or the Renton Landing.  
If you're concerned about crime or safety, it's not that bad in this area.  Renton has had a bad reputation, but that's mostly lower Renton or along Sunset (which is still a bit sketchy).  But East RH is more residential and chill, probably because 10-20 years ago most of it was still woods.

"Correct. If you don't do the proper double stop traffic rule when turning right and count to three seconds before going you just set your self up for a ticket. 

I try to avoid photo enforced lights but there's like three of them on my way to work. I talked to the local police department and asked the rules to prevent from getting a ticket. If you do the proper driving rule of the three second double stop rule and stop before the line you're fine.

You won't get a ticket if you:

Stop before the line, not after, not on, but before. Count to three one thousands of a second. It counts your fender not just your tires. So be sure you're calculating for that as well.

Pull forward, stop again, count to three one thousands of a second. Then proceed.

If you do a yield check stop that's a ticket.

If you don't come to a complete zero mph it will ticket you.

If you fail to stop all together it will ticket you.

If you do one stop instead of 2 it will ticket you.

I'm glad they activated a lot of these at problem areas because it forces people to actually stop correctly. Instead of going oh shit traffic's going I'm going. i see a lot of people fail to stop all together as well.

"Increasing HOA fees is always a possibility. Like the above poster mentioned, the fees themselves can jump (but it has to be voted on by the members of the association), but more importantly, there can be those pesky special assessments.

Never understood why these things were not factored into the standard dues, but one of the condos I was looking at had a special assessment to the tune of $100k (spread out in payments over a 15 years, on top of the standard HOA fees) for siding/exterior paint!!

I personally had a hard time swallowing that pill, so I ended up going with a sfh. Even on a whole sfh it would not cost half that to replace siding/paint.

So then it breaks down to: do you want to plan for/take care of maintenance around your house, or do you want to pay someone to do it? Most dues I've seen were in the $400 range, and included sewer/water/trash/gym. If you subtract, let's say, $200 (my estimate on what one might pay for those services), that's $200/mo for gardening and maybe snow plowing twice a year. 

Worst of all, you have neighbors that share walls. I get that sometimes you can have amazing neighbors and become friends, but you can also have nightmares. I'm not willing to take that risk. Of course, you can have neighbor nightmares in SFHs as well, but at least there's some distance between you. 

And lastly, there's the back end. SFHs tend to increase more in value.

"I live in the Fairwood area, and I would describe it as ""boring"". Downtown Renton is somewhat sketchy, but should be pretty nice once they get finished with the roadwork.

It's pretty quiet, largely because there's no reason to come to the area unless you live here. The area is affluent and always has been. Fairwood proper was designed for 1960's Boeing engineers and upper management based around a private golf course. It's up and out of the way from all the hubbub in the valley, downtown area. Great biking/jogging trails, parks & library within 1 mile with easy connection to the massive Ron Regis Park complex, Cedar River Trail, Maplewood GC and connections to all the valley trails.

I'm old school, having lived in the area most of my life. I remember going to the boat races for free. Things have changed dramatically over the decades.

"Bro, as some one who was born and raised in Renton, I feel this. These other peeps responding to you don't seem to understand  the types of changes you're talking about. 

You're 100% right about being priced out, for one thing. Since Amazon built its headquarters in Seattle much of the kennydale has been taken over by people making much more money than the people who used to live there would traditionally be making. 

Beyond the blatant gentrification, racism seems to be worse. The area had always had at least mild diversity. There were no real problems with that in my youth. Now, a young POC goes for a jog and everyone in the area treats them like car prowlers/home invaders/subhuman scum. 

The area is absolutely beautiful, but the character quality of the people that have been moving there in more recent years has been lacking. It's as though there was a mass exodus of Karens and they all decided to move to Renton. 

Most these other people commenting have probably moved to the area in the last 10 years and are thus oblivious to the change.

"I grew up in Skyway, where it was fine back in the day, but I agree that it’s not someplace I would recommend moving to today.  

I have lived in Renton and the Seattle area for most of my life.  If you’re looking for a safe, walkable neighborhood, come to lower Kennydale.  We have a beautiful walking trail, two swimming beaches (three if you go a little further north of us to Newcastle), no stoplights, and a great little neighborhood coffee shop beside a 7-11 and a new fire station.  I know of at least 3 free little libraries within the small “peninsula” that makes up lower Kennydale.  A little over a decade ago a new shopping center went in and now we are just an exit away from a movie theater, restaurants, Lowe’s, and Target.  Top Golf is slated to open in the coming year.  We enjoy being close enough to a city (Bellevue and Seattle are less than 10 miles away) but also just outside of the metro areas—and so do the resident deer, eagles, coyote, heron, and other various wildlife that haven’t been scared off from overdevelopment and that are observed here often.  Other than opportunistic thefts and speeding vehicles along Lake Washington Boulevard, our neighbors and our community is pretty friendly, safe, and welcoming.  Many of the homes here were built in the 1950’s and although there have been numerous McMansions interspersed throughout over the last few years, you will still find many sprawling ramblers on decent plots of land, lakefront homes, condos, or smaller homes for singles or couples, and many homes have a lake view.  It’s changed a lot over the years (and is still changing) since we have been here, but it still has retained much of the charm and character that it had when we first moved to this neighborhood.

"Earlier this year there was a regional article (The Reporter?) that the owner was selling, but then the next day there was a low-key industry website where the owner said it wasn't for sale. 

Personally, I think there are a lot of very good plans and intentions all around that have led to unrealistic and unstainable output. The buildings are beautiful.  It seems (based on some of the PR and interviews, so who knows) like the company was designing around and pitching Southport to the fancy big names - MS, Amazon, Google, etc, which would explain the degree of intense pr they've done.

I guess, worker-wise, I'm curious who this was built for. I hope I'm proved wrong, but it feels more aspirational than realistic. Is this campus supposed to influence more high-paid tech workers to become Renton residents? Let's assume the private ferry thing is dead. They do have a massive garage. Workers will clog up ""Southport Drive"", Lake Washington, Logan, Sunset, which all already have issues due that these some of historic roads, plotted back in the coal days. Simply put, how many highly-paid tech workers want to move to Renton? If they don't, how long are these workers willing to spend in traffic before they start thinking about jumping teams or companies? I would guess that Southport should become a HQ or a lone campus for a unicorn or smaller company. As a satellite campus, I  worry that it might gain a stigma.

I, too, am hoping that well-paid Southport workers can help the local economy. I've very excited by the business taxes that could fund infrastructure and civic upgrades. It's cool that this is attracting Top Golf. Boeing becoming less reliable, I love that Renton's being proactive. But... 

1)  The development is planned with dining and restaurants within the complex, but I'm not sure the dining concepts are strong enough on their own to be supported by Southport workers, Landing residents (after hours), or outside Renton residents. I call this the East Lake Union Problem. It looks like the restaurant planning is based on what looks marketable and then planned in a ""if we build it, they will come"" fashion.

For example, the Black Rooster Restaurant - probably not sustainable for lunch crowd, but Southport's placement/crowding during workday might discourage outside diners (other than hotel guests and residents of Landing/Bristol.)

2) Walking path between Landing and Southport. I can't tell if the designers were trying to encourage of discourage outside access. To me, the complex feels like a fortress. They may want to do some pathway work to encourage pedestrian access.

3) If a full Southport does create hyperlocal congestion, how much extra time will commuting workers want to spend here in town? Next door, Boeing shifts create clogs a few times a day. Are we assuming morning shifts won't converge.

I don't like being Debbie Downer. It's possible that, as a non-tech worker, I'm just jealous. I do wish they'd cool it a bit with the PR/fake reviews/airplane messages and just focus on making a complex that will be beneficial in the short and long-term.",t2_8e1u8cmb,SnooDonuts8963,0,1633645065.0,0,t1_hfs8hk7,hfs8hk7,False,SnooDonuts8963,t3_q251ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renton/comments/q251ub/the_bristol_at_southport_has_been_sold_new_owner/,The Bristol at Southport has been sold; new owner investing $7 mil into upgrades,/r/Renton/comments/q251ub/the_bristol_at_southport_has_been_sold_new_owner/hfs8hk7/,3,r/Renton,0,3

"I was curious, so I did some research. I tried to make a post on this and Seattle's subs, but I keep getting autobotted out... which, I gotta admit, makes me feel rather paranoid. On its own, I think the project is sketchy.

In March there was an article that it was up for sale, then a few days later the developer backtracked in a longer interview and said that it was never actually up for sale, but he's taking offers. And some bullshit about caring so much about the people who move in. There was all this PR about a Chinese restaurant's grand opening, but it never did open. Black Rooster still has a facebook, though it hasn't been updated and it's still listed on the project's home page. Tons of fake reviews  everywhere for a project that hasn't opened. (Office with kayak storage! OMG!) They have put so much into this project, like all the development, planning, PR around the water taxi BS or the Geekwire ""Renton So Tech1e!"" series. Plus, the city has a lot on it. I'm curious how much the developer is out. Maybe they can't help but dig the hole deeper. It feels a bit like if the Bluth Company built commercial real estate.

I knew someone who lived in the ""luxury"" Bristol apartments, who said that the buildings aren't actually well built and the luxury services never came to fruition.

Maybe when WFH lifts? It'll be interesting how it shakes out. Maybe if Boeing completely leaves and they redevelop the entire area?

I feel like Top Golf being put in is both a bit smart, possibly thirsty, maybe a little understudied on the impact side.

Even with the new roadwork, if the development sells out, it'll be interesting what impact that amount of cars would have on the area roadways. And then there's the impact on regional housing prices and higher-end rental availability. I think a lot of existing tech workers wouldn't be happy if they were told they had to work there. Perhaps some unicorns might be interested in opening their first formal offices in Southport, if they get a deal - which Secco might not be  in the position to make.

TLDR:  Despite the Feb 2020 river height being in the top three recorded flow rates since charting began in the mid 1940s, there was no urban flooding or airport flooding.  My basement got a few inches of water, but such is the basement life.  In years prior to riverbank raising and dredging, lesser flow rates resulted in urban and airport flooding.

"It’s legal to fly drones in Kennydale — you can check the FAA map to see if it’s a fly zone or a no fly zone. Likely the drone owner was flying for Ariel shots, not to spy on you. It was a gorgeous day today and I’m sure the lake looked lovely from that vantage point. As another poster mentioned, a lot of real estate agents are also using these nowadays. 

Also as a side note: if the drone is 100-150 ft in the air, people look like ants without discerning features. If the done is 10 ft from your window that’s another story.

"Unfortunately, there are no laws, state or federal, that directly address drones as they pertain to privacy.  Given that, there are many cases that went through the WA courts that grant us a reasonable expectation of privacy in general.  If a drone can see and record you in a place that the public wouldn't normally be able to view, it could be a violation (such as a backyard surrounded by a 6' fence).  The one part that confuses me is that it seems as if a violation has to involve ""capturing an image"" so maybe simply flying by is ok?

There is also no hard law specifying to what altitude our property rights rise so what constitutes ""trespass"" by a drone seems to be up in the air <rimshot>.  It's an interesting topic though and I'm sure we'll see heated discussion about it before long.

The FAA regulates ALL flying aircraft and made the decision to classify most drones as general flying aircraft and they're protected as such.  This is the same legal regulation that gives them the power to require drone registration. So no, you can's force one down anywhere whether it's via a rifle or slingshot or water balloon.  Those regs can be found on the FAA's site.  

IANAL but this topic has interested me for some time because of the privacy implications.

"What about employed productive people with disgusting living habits. The way you say this makes me think you want to do something for them too. It's not like being homeless makes you forget how to use a plunger or go shopping. Everybody sucks at multi tasking. Washing your hand is easier with a sink let alone a rest room. Where the fuck would you shit if nobody would let you use the restroom. I'm sure you'd be less talented at domestic cleaning task and scrutinized for it if you had less time or reason to nurture those skills. I've seen all the problems you mentioned more behind closed door or homes people that many homeless . Unfortunately they don't have walls to protect them from shit like this from people that share you opinions. Homelessness is a multi faceted problem and people with ideas like yours get a lot less credit for it than they deserve. 

I agree they need more and a lot different help them they are getting. I think you should reflect on what your problem with them is and make sure your issues are ones you believe in. No one prefers to shit in a bag and anyone given the opportunity not to likely wouldn't need a couch.  I get that you don't like seeing that shit but I bet somebody you know lives like that in the home.

"You can't help those who don't want to help themselves. If they live in clutter and chaos in their tents, they will continue to clutter and break things in a hotel room. If they don't know how to use a plunger then they'll clog their toilet and resort to urinating in bottles, defacating in grocery bags. They don't know how to ask for help, and they dobt know how to clean up after themselves. The hotel thing isn't any better than the city providing a camping cot and event tent. If they don't have the life skills to care for themselves and keep their living space functional, then they're gonna destroy the space they're in. 

If they don't know how to grocery shop with a lot of multitasking and improvising, if they don't know how to slice vegetables or cut/prepare fresh and raw foods, they're not gonna be eating any better than what they eat while roofless. If they don't know how to wash their hands with soap and a sponge, their hands are still gonna be greasy and full of bacteria when they handle food. If they don't know how make a bed or change a fitted sheet, they always gonna sleep on the same dirty sheet and dirty blankets from day 1 to the last day they're in that space.
