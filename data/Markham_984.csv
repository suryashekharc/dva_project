"Mandarin... but traditional Chinese for written form...
Best is to learn both spoken language, both have their own history, but mandarin will have more use, for the multi language class provided by the YRSB, there are Mandarin classes in either traditional Chinese or simplified Chinese, simplified Chinese is used in Mainland China, and they have different ""pinyin"" to Tradition Chinese Mandarin, but all in all they are mostly the same spoken wise, and grammar follow the same rules... Tradition Chinese are a bit harder to learn than Simplified Chinese simply because Tradition Chinese are more complicated to write, but they are the true Chinese language in written form(and I'm willing to die on this hill)...
Cantonese will probably be the harder one to learn between the two imo, mainly because they are not spoken as how you write/read, like most other languages, and their ""pinyin"" system is not as good as the ones with Mandarin, very hard to express the ""tone"" with alphabets...",t2_7ynix1f2,FlyinRustBucket,0,1648171330.0,0,t1_i20c7i7,i20c7i7,True,StrangeWedding770,t3_tmw7t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Markham/comments/tmw7t4/cantonese_mandarin_speaking_residents_can_i_get/,"Cantonese & mandarin speaking residents, can I get your advice on language for baby?",/r/Markham/comments/tmw7t4/cantonese_mandarin_speaking_residents_can_i_get/i20c7i7/,1,r/Markham,0,1

"Yep, I have.

*DISCLAIMER: Before you do this, consider your neighbours. Clover will spread like crazy so if they are the type of people who are always outside working on their lawn, maybe just have a chat with them before you seed.*

So it's actually really easy. I bought my clover from [OSC Seeds](https://www.oscseeds.com/product/white-clover-6735/) \- they come in a bag. You can also order mixed wildflower seed from them if you want it. Basically this spring instead of overseeding with grass, just overseed with clover. Do it early spring once the ground has thawed and that's pretty much all you need to do. Keep the ground damp for a few days as well.

I found that the first year I didn't see too much clover action but year 2 it's everywhere. Just note that clover tends to grow in patches so you'll have to overseed again the following year. No biggie, it's super easy.

"I am out in Greensborough here (just 1 intersection away), but I guess I really got lucky with our neighbours here who are friendly. Heck, we even did a block party in 2017 (dang, that now feels like a COVID century ago) and dragged the entire street out for an afternoon of meet-the-neighbours fun. My neighbours and I will sit out on the porch and talk all evening - and we are both asians by ethnicity in case you are wondering.

I can attest - never a language barrier but a cultural issue. People are afraid you want or expect something in return when you talk. We tend to have to go above and beyond to even get a response, and this can get tiring. Suggestion - lending a hand, present homemade baked goods - the good ol' bribery tends to work. Also, animals get people talking too as long as your pets are not too naughty! (remember, everyone needs an r/aww)

In my mind - if your neighbours are respectful, mindful of personal space, and make no stink - you have already won. I won the lottery for having awesome neighbours but my brother's overly friendly neighbours (refusing to name ethnicity, but not asian) are borderline stalkers with a NIMBY attitude. He couldn't even get Rogers to repair and bury the cable line because it crossed his neighbour's PUBLIC lawn, and the neighbour petitioned the city to NOT replace his public curb during a repaving of the road.

"You assume that there's some sort of standard that people must adhere to if you live in Canada and that they MUST conform. The entire point of Canada being a diverse nation means that the country is accepting of every culture and not force them to give up theirs. 

Yes, it is illegal dumping, but the act of doing it does not suddenly warrant labeling somebody a fresh immigrant who ""hasn't integrated"". By labeling them an immigrant based on their actions is racist. Your comment also assumes that those you consider to have ""integrated"" do not do this, but in fact if you do a quick search on YouTube there are hundreds of videos of people that do this, namely white people in Canada or USA.

There are also general areas that feature a distinct ethnic presence (people, restaurants, grocery stores, etc.): Brimley Road is kinda the east/west divide (below 14th Ave) between Southeast Asian & East Asian - the more east from here, there are more Southeast Asian businesses, the more west, more East Asian (in general)... also includes neighbouring Scarborough just to the south. North of 14th Ave is more East Asian & Canadians of Western European descent.

West of Hwy 404 until Yonge St (north of Steeles Ave/south of Hwy 7 is also a part of Markham, but it honestly feels like it's either part of Toronto or Richmond Hill!) Lots of Koreans and Taiwanese when you get closer to Yonge St.

Public transit is easiest if you live along Steeles Ave or Hwy 7 corridors.",t2_3znuk6wj,treelife365,0,1647823913.0,0,t1_i1h2pc7,i1h2pc7,True,tossmysalami,t3_ticah9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Markham/comments/ticah9/how_is_the_rental_situation_in_this_city_any/,How is the rental situation in this city?

"Are you upset that there aren't more anti-Asian hate protests? Protests don't just happen out of nowhere, they need to be organized. There is absolutely nothing stopping you or an organization from starting a protest, or a convoy, or a blockade, or an occupation. The police certainly won't stop it, as we've seen recently. 

But considering you [literally just want to protest against black people as a race](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/s4wwhz/man_who_pushed_woman_to_her_death_at_times_square/hsuln6v/), if you tried to start a protest it would probably get nowhere. I certainly wouldn't join it, even though I'm Chinese. 

I know there's been an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, as do the police, the government, and the general public. They are being taken as seriously as any other hate crimes. No one is 'diminishing' these hate crimes just because there aren't enough protests against black people for your liking.

">‚ÄúWith the improvement of business, a new problem has emerged: the shortage of labour,‚Äù Tang said, explaining that it has been particularly difficult for restaurants to hire staff, as many people prefer collecting government benefits at home rather than working outside since the pandemic began. 

Business owners had no problem having the government pay half their rent, pay up to 75% of their employees wages, and give them thousands of dollars worth of grants, but they're upset that the government gave $500 and later $270/week to the employees that they laid off. 

And anyway, all the COVID benefits have expired and there are more people working now than before COVID. Yet, instead of asking why they can't find people who want to work for them, they're going to blame the government. Perhaps it's the low pay, irregular shifts, long hours, lack of benefits, or poor working conditions, not the government preventing them from finding workers.

>‚ÄúMany restaurants are poaching from each other by using high salaries to attract other waiters and waitress to work in their own restaurants,‚Äù Hou said. She believes this is not a long-term solution. ‚ÄúWe hope to create wealth with hard-working hands, and we also hope that the government can support us with a policy of rewarding diligence and punishing laziness.‚Äù

Again, more people are working now than ever. They just don't want to work for your restaurants. It's not the governments fault that restaurants are unattractive workplaces.

">The instructor recommended that we could try to find a rather calm dog to interact with (but we know that is rare)

there are plenty of calm dogs around but energy of animals is impacted by energy of the owners, other dogs and the situation so if you're nervous, dogs read that energy and get nervous as well.  A key component though, is to ensure that you learn your dog's body language; that itself can stop many conflicts if you keep an eye on your dog's body language and redirect or descalate a situation if things get tense.  

The most important thing to help calm a dog -- the owner has to be calm and in control; the owners need to act and be the leader/master so that the dog follows your lead.  If you are timid, nervous or anxious, dogs pick up on that energy and will feel that same energy (anxious/reactive) or go into guard mode (to protect you hence, reactive).  There are ways to hold the leash, use your body language and body to redirect your dog when they react in order to avoid confrontation/conflict with other dogs.  Puppy obedience classes will only take you so far working with a *dedicated trainer* that trains both the animal and the owner gets the best result because when the owner is confident, the dog learns how to become confident too.
