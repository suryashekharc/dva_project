Apart from that they were just other kids you were friends with or met at parties.

Same as any other schools.  Mostly normal just other kids you don't know as well, occasional shit happens but you all end up at a party and it's a good time.

"My boys have gone to Heights and done well. It was their decision to attend Heights and based mainly on where their friends were going.   I doubt that they would have done better or worse at Haythorne.  One of my boys is unmotivated and the other is a high achiever and they were both happy there.   

Heights is an old building and showing it‚Äôs age but Haythorne was at capacity a couple of years ago - I don‚Äôt know if that has changed.  I have friends whose children have gone to Haythorne and they were happy with it.

The one point I would make is that in my experience a lot of how good a school is based on the admin team.  Over the years we have had some great administrations and some truly terrible ones and it has definitely affected the boys grades and their overall experience.

If your son is motivated and has a good friend group that is a huge advantage wherever he chooses to go.

"As a former SCA student, I did gripe a lot about being there at the time. In hindsight, I realize that I truly owe a lot of my post-secondary success to the quality of teachers I had there, and how they prepared me for university and beyond. I say that in comparison to some of my friends who attended other junior high and high school locations in Sherwood Park and Edmonton. 
For some background, I was not a teacher‚Äôs favourite student (thanks in large part to undiagnosed ADHD), but I feel that the teachers really put in every effort to make sure I was successful academically. I was able to keep straight A‚Äôs and have a relatively easy transition to post-secondary. 

I hated the ‚Äúsmall school‚Äù aspect at the time, as it felt very clique-y. But I don‚Äôt know of any bigger schools that had teachers voluntarily stay with students over lunch to help them if they were struggling with a subject (i.e. lunch time math help with Ms. Wilkins helped a lot of kids grasp the concepts that were eluding them)

"Not a parent but was once an unmotivated student.

I'd say just listen to your child and what they prefer, then make sure they understand the differences/consequences of their choices. What classes are available to them in each program, why honours could be a good thing leading into university or for jobs applications, how some things won't be as easily accessible in the future if you don't put the time in now

The most important part is just being open about their options and making sure their happy and in a good environment as it'll help them be motivated to learn things that interest them, and then they can make an informed decision of their own

If band is what their most interested in then keeping it in their life may be important, something fun to learn along side other academics, and it shows the importance of sticking with something to get results (they may see how more time with their instruments makes them better and it'll relate to other school work, more time studying gives better test results and so on)

Each school has it's perks and draw backs and the main difference will be the courses/programs available to them, the teachers/students around them are a little more unpredictable and while it's important to have a teacher that motivates you to learn or friends you know, those things can change relatively fast and personally I find it more important in this day and age to be able to motivate yourself (especially with online, even in person some university teachers can be little to no help)

Seeing different faces/opinions can be good as well and it teaches you to question things and find reliable information on your own, exposure to different things at this age is key in my mind as it'll open their perception of the world and how they see themselves in it

No decision is a bad decision and I would've killed for an opportunity to discuss my education path like this, let your child know they have a say and they'll take that knowledge forward, that they have a say in their own future, and in this world

Good luck and I'm sure whatever choice you make will be a good informed choice, which is more than what most can say about their early education",t2_8fyew48,Bonfire_Monty,0,1643839578.0,0,t1_hvc3r2e,hvc3r2e,True,kevingameryz,t3_siyrpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SherwoodPark/comments/siyrpp/honor_class_or_stay_at_sca_for_junior_high/,honor class or stay at SCA for junior high,/r/SherwoodPark/comments/siyrpp/honor_class_or_stay_at_sca_for_junior_high/hvc3r2e/,8,r/SherwoodPark,0,8

"You've already got some great answers to the detailed questions that I agree with.  

Here's my 2 pennies.... It sounds like a perfect fit for you guys and your careers.  My husband and I sound similar to you guys, minus the kid.  We're homebodies, I garden and craft, he putters and works in his basement shop, built a basement gym (wanna hang out when you eventually move here? LOL).

Sherwood Park and rural Strathcona County are 20-30 mins away from urban Edmonton and great outdoor areas like Elk Island National Park and Cooking Lake-Blackfoot PRA.  Drive a couple more hours and you've got amazing lakeland wilderness for camping and outdoor rec.  The mountains are barely 4 hours away for weekend trips. 

You're going to be able to afford a great family home/property that will let you continue investing and saving for your future.  Lower taxes, lower cost of living, lower property values and not a crazy market.  There are tons of financial advantages to the move.

You don't need a truck, unless you want the cargo/towing capacity for projects and your property, but I wouldn't live here without an SUV/all-wheel drive.  Especially in the rural area outside of Sherwood Park, the winter roads would get sketchy for a smaller car.  Invest in good winter tires and you're set.

Areas to avoid - there are some neighbourhoods in Sherwood Park that have been built in a boom.  These newer areas (e.g. post 2000 construction) have lower quality build and finish.  Going into the older areas in town or older acreages, you'll likely get a more solidly built place.  When we were buying a few years ago, our realtor was steering us away from the post 2000 builds, and after looking at a few we were on board and thankful for that.

Alberta politics - lots of alarmist hyperbole about Alberta being the Texas of Canada and disgustingly conservative.  Yes, it's generally got a more conservative population.  No, most Albertans are not the stereotypical foaming at the mouth conservative, especially in more urban areas like Sherwood Park.  Since moving here, I've found most people here to be quite moderate - some lean pretty fiscally conservative, but most are not social conservatives and many support a lot of progressive ideas.  Kenney and the UCP have been a trainwreck and a half, but most of Alberta is over their BS to the point that I'm not sure how they can win another election without major changes.  The biggest obstacle is voter complacency in the moderate majority - we have low voter turnout in lots of areas, which leads to the more vocal minority having their way with things.  I see lots of signs of that changing.",t2_n6yvt,peanutt222,0,1641489351.0,0,t1_hrij6q8,hrij6q8,True,Big_Telephone_5406,t3_rwd7sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SherwoodPark/comments/rwd7sf/im_thinking_about_moving_from_bc_to_sherwood_park/,I‚Äôm thinking about moving from BC to Sherwood Park is that a mistake?,/r/SherwoodPark/comments/rwd7sf/im_thinking_about_moving_from_bc_to_sherwood_park/hrij6q8/,2,r/SherwoodPark,0,2

"I don't live in Sherwood Park, but I work there. I've lived in Alberta most of my life, and have traveled through rural BC, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. 

What most people will tell you: Alberta is a dying province, and the politicians ruling the province are one step away from being the Taliban.

The reality: the economy of Alberta is transitioning and it's hard. There is work out there still, but for trades at the moment there is a surplus of people looking for work. We have a strong entrepreneurial spirit here, and we are transitioning away from Oil and Gas, despite the protests of Conservatives.

Our politics are more conservative, but as the current government has discovered, you can only push so far in that direction. The municipal governments of Edmonton and Calgary are very progressive, so politics in Alberta are also transitioning. If this matters to you. Our rural areas are no better, nor worst then rural BC/Sask. or even Ontario. It's just Calgary has always tended towards voting in Conservatives provincially/Federally.

The weather can be brutal compared to the Fraser Valley, however the cold can be dressed for. We typically don't get the brutal heat waves that occur on the coast. That being said, if you don't like winter weather, then no don't come here. Winter starts in Oct/Nov ends in Mar/Apr. Summers are usually pretty mild, but too short.

Public education was really good, and the government has backtracked on their radical rethink of the curriculum. It's tilting back to the status quo, which was well regarded. The actual schools are well run.

Cell phone structure in the province is great, phone companies invested heavily when the oil industry was booming. There is an initiative within Strathcona County to improve Internet access speeds, especially for the rural areas. Internet access is better in Edmonton, due to TELUS basically wiring the entire city with fibre.

Lower taxes, no PST...yet. Decent infrastructure, traffic around Edmonton is not horrible even in rush hour.

The place I'm moving to has a 2400 gallon cistern and it'll cost me about $120 to have the water hauled in and filled.   I expect to fill that monthly with my wife and 2 kids.  If you haul it yourself you would probably save $50 a month, but then you need a vehicle that can tow the tank as well as having to do it in the really cold winter months.

***What's the internet/tv like? providers? cell phone reception any good? I believe it has to be a cell type internet? is that complete sh\*t? will I hate my life?***

There are a number of wireless highspeed providers in the area.  The place I'm moving to has a tower by MCSNet nearby.  Will see when I move in what speeds are like, but if you have line of sight to the tower you should expect 40Mb/s down and 10Mb/s up according to their site.  Cost is $80 for 600GB of data ($100 for 1TB of data).  There are a few other similar wireless providers in the area (Syban is another one) so it depends on where you move to and what towers are located near you.  The other option is Telus LTE.  One of their plans is $85 for 500GB of data and 25Mb/s down (don't remember what the upload rate was).

&#x200B;

That said, the second the purchase of my new place was a done deal I put a deposit on Starlink

***Does anyone know the current hourly rate for Class 4 power engineers at the refineries? Is oil and gas going to be around for a bit longer in Alberta?***

&#x200B;

Sorry, don't know the hourly rate, but Oil/Gas will always be around.

***Does anyone know the current hourly rate for Dental hygienists in Sherwood Park or Fort Saskatchewan? I see what the internet is telling me.. but I've learnt not to believe everything I read on the internet.. first hand is usually better. feel free to DM me.***

Don't know this one either.

***If you currently live in Edmonton/Sherwood/Fort Saskatchewan, why would you move away? What‚Äôs keeping you there? IF you were to move away, where would you move?***

I'm obviously not moving away because I just bought a new house.  But Kenney is the only reason lately that I've even thought about moving away.  The cold can get a bit much when there's long stretches of -25 or lower.  But you adapt and dress for the weather.

***Nice areas to look to buy (keeping in mind I‚Äôll be working North of Fort. Sask)***

The Ardrossan area would be a good fit for you (off of highway 16).  They have good amenities for the kids (rec center, schools, etc).  It's a quick drive in to Sherwood Park on HighWay 16 and within 15-20 mins of Fort Sask.

There's not a lot available right now, but something like this might of interest.  This is actually very close to the property that I purchased.  I work downtown and my commute will be about 36 minutes.  I have coworkers that live in Edmonton and have a longer commute than that.

***Do you need a truck to live in Alberta to get around?***

We have an AWD Toyota Sienna and a Subaru Legacy.  We have no plans to buy a truck but will probably buy a decent utility trailer.  It depends entirely what you want to do on your property, but a good yard tractor might serve you better than a truck (again, depending on what you're wanting to do).

***Areas to stay away from?***

You want to be near Fort Sask so don't move to a place where you're going to get tired of the LONG commute in a few years.  Properties south of Wye Road might be pushing that limit.

"Moved to Alberta three years ago from Vancouver, started in Sherwood Park, and recently relocated southwest Edmonton. 

The political climate is incredibly bad, unless you‚Äôre a hard-core right-wing conservative Christian, then it‚Äôs great.

The winters are absolutely ridiculous, the city does a shit job of clearing roads and the transit is absolutely atrocious.

Sherwood Park is very white, very Christian, which might be your thing or not.

There‚Äôs not a whole lot to do in Sherwood Park, but as you said you and your family are homebodies, that seems to be OK.

Property prices have been going up quite quickly in Alberta over the last year, you might wanna take a look at what the value of a property is in Strathcona County, and what the historical value has been. It might be worth continuing to rent and wait for the market to even out, or if you were really determined to move your, straight now.

Make sure you understand what it will mean to bus your kid to school once they are old enough. You may decide to drive them, that‚Äôs fine but take that into account too.

"My husband and I moved to sherwood park proper in 2020, February. we are early 30s. We moved from Vancouver where i had lived all my life (well and surrounding suburbs). 

I can‚Äôt speak for acreage, but i can speak for the town and area I live in. We rented a condo at first, we bought a house in feb 2021. We really like it here. The people are friendly and warm, 

I hear the schools are excellent. However there are both public schools here that are catholic public schools (yes actually. It‚Äôs all of AB) and non catholic public schools. They have middle school as well so you‚Äôll have to think of which ones they will attend. Additionally, being in rural strathcona, you will have to keep in mind they they will have to either walk to school, or you will have to drive them.   BUT there are also many schools with school bus programs. These are often cancelled in severe weather. If the bus is cancelled, do they stay home? Can they stay home? Can you stay home with them? 

If you are further rural, it will be harder for you to get out and about on snowy winters days, on freezing rain days. The winter out here is so different from the lower mainland. You will need a truck on an acreage. Probably also a snow blower rather than just a shovel, but if you have so much land probably think about investing in something that can mow, plow snow etc, something ride along. 
 
You can and people do get around fine in their cars, but if you‚Äôre rural, you won‚Äôt want something small. Maybe for one of you but you will need a truck or haul stuff.

In sherwood park the internet being complete dog shit is a big problem, we just had an election and it was a running promise on every candidates campaign. 

Honestly, anywhere in sherwood park is nice. Just pick houses, if you want to work in ft sask probably take a look at Emerald Hills, its the most northern tip and they are building brand new houses and townhouses right now and they are nice ( though obv not rural or acreages). 
]
Don‚Äôt live in mill woods was the advice given to me when I asked if there was a place not to live. Oh and the area around 118th is sketchy but that‚Äôs in Edmonton. 


It‚Äôs currently -30 and lower. You have to be prepared on an acreage that something will fail, and you wont get help right away. Your heat, your water, electricity. 
I think if you wanted to move, move to a smaller place first to establish yourselves and routine. You don‚Äôt want to have to take care of all this new stuff when youre just trying to get into the city and a life. Move up, buy a house or a townhouse, get some work and live in the climate. Figure out if you like being in the cold, which is more than half the year, May 15 is the time you can start to plant outdoors for example, it feels sooooo late in the year by the time heat returns.  We live at the end of a cul de sac and love not having to shovel sidewalk.

Also, heated garage, and an automatic starter are king.

I hope that helps a bit, feel free to DM. Hubby and I wanted a plot of land like you say, but decided it was a lot of work.

"First off, in the current political climate, I would never move to Alberta from bc. 
But that's a choice you have to make. 

I live on an acreage, close to Sherwood Park. 

I'm on well water. It's very hard. I have an iron filter and need to get a softener. 
The well is 40+ years old, iron casing. 
Wherever you look, look to see if your well is registered with the province (mine is not)
See if you can get records or stats. How deep is it, when was the pump last replaced, what's the flow rate (we bought a brand new very large washing machine. Our well flow rate can't keep up with it when it fills)

Also look into, study, and learn about sewage. Septic tanks can be very big coin if they aren't in proper condition. 

I'm closer to the city, so I am able to get shaw fiber internet. 
The further you go out, the less chance you have of getting that. 
The county does have an active broadband project to bring the big guys in to provide high-speed to the entire county. But it's not there yet. 
https://www.strathcona.ca/your-property-utilities/services-and-infrastructure/internet/#community-broadband-project

Can't speak to your job questions.

Would I move away? Yes, but not because of the county. But for political reasons. 

Personal opinions are my own, you will have to research council and their platforms. 
I think our current council is useless. Nothing gets done, constantly asking for more reports. Mayor's is obviously wanting to be friends with current provincial govt, which I am against, which is the only reason I'd move away. Not because of the county but because of the province. 
Make sure the county and elected official goals match your own. 
Mayor has zero leadership capabilities, as shown by the parkade bombing and covid policy handling. 
The employees make the county what it is despite the abismal elected officials. 

Keep in mind, Sherwood Park and most of the county are god fearing white middle class christians. There are no casinos here (by bylaw) and there are a ton of churches. 

You do not need a truck, despite what all the ""fuck Trudeau"" stickers tell you. 
I manage the range roads in winter just fine with a Subaru. 
Truck might be nice if you actually use it to do truck stuff on an acreage. 

I was a city slicker, lived in Edmonton all my life until I wanted a change (left Edmonton for a while host of reasons and would never go back)
Acreage life is brand new. Tough, always something to do, always something broken to be fixed, but I'd never go back to city. 

I've traveled all over the county and always had full cell signal with koodo (Telus) so no problems there. 

Hopefully that helps.

"Alright, let's see if I can pound out some of these answers for you quickly.
I am mid 20's and have lived in Sherwood Park my entire life.
Acreage life- sounds awesome. Location though is a huge factor. Do you have to truck in water, is there a ground well? Also what roads go out to that specific subdivision is important to look at for winter driving as the range roads can get ugly.
Is a truck needed for in town life? No, but if you want to have an acreage honestly it's going to help, if you need to truck water in you'll either need a truck and trailer to haul it or pay a company to deliver. I'm not sure the costs of such as I've lived in town forever, but there has been issues with getting water in the rural areas ( heat in the summer, and too cold in the winter) 
But your lifestyle for the family sounds like it would fit, the cost of such is ever growing though sadly.
Cell/ internet. Cell companies here are about the same as bc id imagine, all the same ""base costs"" and the coverage for rural areas you have to stick to the major companies (Rogers, Telus, bell). Internet kinda sucks in the rural but you could apply for starlink Internet, or just suck it up with the rural providers but it isn't great from what I've heard, especially depending on location. 
Not sure the pay rate of your job, but the oil and gas industry here is still going strong, very built into everyone's life. Although it's slowly changing, and layoffs are happening. The major refineries here are going strong still and or changing lanes to hydrogen production. 
I'm unsure of dental hygiene wage but I have a peer that is doing such and I can definitely reach out if you want.
Living in Sherwood Park, I would move away simply because I've been here my entire life, but it is a great place to live. The housing is often costly but if you can find a place it's a wonderful place to live and raise your kids, often people I know move out of sherwood park because they can't afford to buy or rent a place in town here so go into Edmonton, but often would rather stay in Sherwood Park. There's a ton of awesome people but at the same time alot of very entitled people who believe the world revolves around them.
I wouldn't look for a house in town in emerald hills or anywhere north of Lakeland road as I've heard crime is on the rise as it is very easy to get on and off the highway from there.
Most of the rural properties are going to be south of fort Saskatchewan and probably of sherwood park so it'd be a 30-45 min drive for you going north to the work sites.

"Honestly, I think it more so has to do with how far away from the company's Central Office you are. For instance, in Sherwood Park, the Central Office for Telus is the building beside Starbucks on Wye road.

I'm not sure where Shaws is located, assuming they have one for the area as well. 

Think of it like a long hose. There will be more water pressure closer to the faucet, especially if there are multiple side-chains siphoning pressure (bandwidth) along the way. There are boxes set up to boost the signal along the way, but that can only help so much.

Always be cognizant of the ""up to"" in the advertised speeds. It means exactly what it says, you pay for ""up up __ Mbps"".

"Yup, Brian Botterill was pushing heavily for it. [He conducted a bunch of feasibility studies and posted them here but has since taken some of them down from his website.](https://www.brianbotterill.com/blog/successes/fiber-optic-internet-report) The County needs to cut red tape and roll out the welcome mats to make it happen. Other municipalities are doing just that and Telus has been prioritizing where they spend their capital because of it, leaving us in the dark. I asked Rod Frank about it on social media once and he said something about [Telus investing $11M](https://www.sherwoodparknews.com/news/local-news/telus-invests-11m-into-park-communications-infrastructure) and how it was up to them how they spent their money. But that's peanuts compared to the over $1B they're spending in Edmonton and the $100M in St. Albert, so either Frank is deflecting or he has no idea what he's talking about.

[https://www.yourbestdigs.com/reviews/the-best-teeth-whitening-kit/](https://www.yourbestdigs.com/reviews/the-best-teeth-whitening-kit/)

Not sure where to get the send-away kits in Canada since I don't see any on Amazon; I'm still using the trays I got made back by [https://sparklingwhitesmiles.com/](https://sparklingwhitesmiles.com/)  in 2019 as night guards. This looks like a different page for the same company: [https://www.sportingsmiles.com/sporting-smiles-impression-instructions](https://www.sportingsmiles.com/sporting-smiles-impression-instructions)  (US only mailing service, sadly.)

The $10 trays you find on Amazon.ca are fine, though. You wouldn't want to wear them for more than an hour when you're awake, it's just like a hockey/boxing mouth guard except a little bit tighter-fitting. The custom trays you can almost forget you're wearing.

Teeth whitening gel is all pretty much the same, just different concentrations for different speed of bleaching. The increase in performance is not linear with the increase in concentration, though. 35% is pretty common.

Some gels (e.g. Philips Zoom) include things (like potassium nitrate, fluoride, stannous fluoride, ""PF"", etc.) to reduce pain from higher concentrations of peroxide. (see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11820045)  You pay more for these gels, and they're harder to find, but most are designed for at-home use. You can also use Sensodyne toothpaste (same ingredients) before you put the trays in for a similar result.

If I were to do it again I'd find a Canadian dentistry supplier that sells to consumers.  I haven't used this one, but it looks like they'll sell you brand-name materials for only a little more than the generic stuff on Amazon:  https://frontierdental.ca/collections/frontier-brings-you-a-complete-range-of-cosmetic-dental-supply/products/opalescence-35-pf-mint-refill-kit-4-pk",t2_k1drc,TheDissolver,0,1635614898.0,0,t1_hinz5yi,hinz5yi,False,[deleted],t3_qhg2eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SherwoodPark/comments/qhg2eh/best_place_for_teeth_whitening/,Best place for teeth whitening?,/r/SherwoodPark/comments/qhg2eh/best_place_for_teeth_whitening/hinz5yi/,2,r/SherwoodPark,0,2

"DIY. Not the best way for everyone, but I was very surprised at how easy the materials are to get ahold of.

Don't buy anything that comes with an LED, those kits are a scam. (Not because they don't work at all; they just don't work any better than a tray with no light.)

Strips work, if slowly, but they're not any safer than using trays with a comparable low-concentration gel. Brand-name strips are ridiculously expensive and don't work any better than generic strips.

Don't buy the higher-concentration gel, since you can do multiple treatments easily and make up for lower concentration by keeping it on for longer.

Trays are not hard to buy and mold yourself. (Boil and bite.) People routinely buy the same trays for night guards and sports mouth guards. they usually come in sets of 2-5 so you're covered in case you mess up.

"I've lived in a house that backs onto cloverbar. House is quiet enough, but we had pretty good windows (we did have to replace some of the bedroom windows because of noise from road actually). In the backyard, the noise is super noticeable, SPECIFICALLY from spring to autumn when people go ripping down the road or rev their vehicles. Tried adding plants, foliage, shrubs, trees, etc but it doesn't seem to make much impact for when you're in the backyard.

Love that home, but it is a pet peeve of mine. Often times, people are overly focused on themselves and don't think about others during daily actions. That would require self-reflection lol

&#x200B;

EDIT: I read up on PACE financing, and I agree it is a great idea. If the proposal was just to incorporate it into the property tax system, I'm fine with that.

I just don't want the county to spend money on subsidizing anything. Any money the county spends comes out of my pocket and too often it goes to benefit people with more wealth and income than me.

"Xplornet is the only one I've ever been warned about - they're famous for bad service and throttling. 

MCSNet, I've been with them for a long time now, they've mostly been good and put a solid effort into customer service and supporting the community. When you have to call for support the people on the phone are good to deal with and usually things get taken care of. I had them fall down a couple times over the years but got it escalated and they made it right.

Speeds are okay for rural, 25-35 generally. No throttling until you pass your cap, although you can get saturation at peak times that drop your speed.  They're working on backhauling fiber to the towers which should improve that.

Unfortunately that won't keep up with Starlink when they get more cells opened up, even on beta with the occasional outage the speeds are putting all the wireless providers to shame.

At about 1am neighbors called 911, police went to check it out and patrolled the area by car and on foot but without more to go on couldn't find anything so suspected fireworks were being set off.

Neighbors started reviewing their surveillance footage at 6:45am, heard 13 shots in their footage, went looking and found a few .22 casings and a shotgun shell.

At about 8am they called police again, they identified the home that seemed to be targeted, spoke with the person inside who said they had no idea it had happened.

And neighbors aren't impressed, they've been seeing suspicious stuff going down at the house.",t2_10johf,jsrsd,0,1630101297.0,0,t1_halzura,halzura,True,Paper_Rain,t3_pbfdn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SherwoodPark/comments/pbfdn6/driveby_shooting_in_sherwood_park_not_a_random/,Drive-by shooting in Sherwood Park 'not a random act of violence': RCMP,/r/SherwoodPark/comments/pbfdn6/driveby_shooting_in_sherwood_park_not_a_random/halzura/,3,r/SherwoodPark,0,3

"I work in IT,  mostly cuz I like it but... the one case where I do use it is...

sometimes I take family pictures on my DSLR, then I gotta send it to my wife.

what I do is then take the jpgs and send it to her via facebook messenger, so what happens is FB messenger has a limit of 25MB per message, this means I can only send 4 pictures at a time.

so if I did that, I choose 4 at a time, drag and drop it to her on a browser. my connection has to send it to her. at the old connection 300/15, I have to wait for the message to confirmed sending before I queue up 4 more. cuz if I work too fast and go before the message is sent, i've had cases where the computer/connection doesnt queue up properly and then dont send it, then I lose track of what is and what isnt sent as the pictures are similar cuz i'm click happy with my DSLR.

at 150 upload, it sends it faster than I can queue it, typically by the time i've clicked on the next 4 pictures, its sent. then I just drag and drop. hit send, and so on. I dont have to wait anymore for it th confirm sending.

"Fair point, and I absolutely agree with and support you. However, my concern (regarding the commenter above) would be that conclusions about a medical professional not be made on the postings of one person whose motives are unknown, and the accuracy of his/her statements undetermined. If by the appropriate question, you are referring to asking if all staff at an office are double-vaxxed, my point was that it is illegal for an employer to answer that, as it is in contravention of the Privacy Act. This info is provided in hopes that it will save people from becoming angry and frustrated when they are unable to receive an answer from a dental office to what seems like a totally reasonable question. Also, it has been literally years before Covid that dentists have been wearing masks, and gloves, chairside. It absolutely is the Standard of Care now. Unfortunately, the inference (from the commenter above) that it might be otherwise shows just how damaging the original comment can be. Please note that you and I are not disagreeing here. I absolutely respect your comment and position. It helps to contribute to the conversation. Note as well that I absolutely support mandatory vaccination for health professionals.

"It‚Äôs not bad you get used to it. If you have your tv on or a fan you can barely hear it. It‚Äôs gotten better since they put the lights there. I really enjoy this area. 
Although, I have heard not nice things about cravenbrook so if you‚Äôre looking at a duplex there I would advise against it.

"We are in Bonnie doon now, and already hear some train horns but not a ton, while the cars whipping and reving their engines is common almost a nightly occurrence. 
But thank you for your info.

Is Lakeland that bad for racers whipping down the road? I figured they still wanna go fast from getting off of highway 21",t2_3psuowe,DJojnik,0,1628725957.0,0,t1_h8ll10k,h8ll10k,False,DJojnik,t3_p2obpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SherwoodPark/comments/p2obpi/noise_on_lakeland_and_summerland_drive/,noise? on Lakeland and summerland Drive?,/r/SherwoodPark/comments/p2obpi/noise_on_lakeland_and_summerland_drive/h8ll10k/,2,r/SherwoodPark,0,2
Well you have yellowhead and highway 21 noise. Then there‚Äôs the cars that like to race up and down Lakeland Dr. So noisy? Kinda depends on what level of noise you‚Äôre used to. I didn‚Äôt mind it when I lived in summerwood. But I also lived downtown and was used to noise.,t2_13ju2z,erindpaul,0,1628725692.0,0,t1_h8lkgks,h8lkgks,True,DJojnik,t3_p2obpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SherwoodPark/comments/p2obpi/noise_on_lakeland_and_summerland_drive/,noise? on Lakeland and summerland Drive?,/r/SherwoodPark/comments/p2obpi/noise_on_lakeland_and_summerland_drive/h8lkgks/,3,r/SherwoodPark,0,3
