Micon is locally owned and operated. Mike and Connie (Mi-Con) are great people with decades of experience working in entertainment. Micon offers lower prices on tickets and concessions and they are committed to giving back to the community.

Video Gamestar was the best! Last year when the final video store in EC closed down (the Family Video out on London) I started researching the history of all the video stores in town. Thanks to help from the LE Phillips Library staff and others I actually found the dates of business operation for every one of the local stores and contacted a few of the old owners. Here's a picture of the [1984 EC phone book](https://ibb.co/ChgTgJH) with the 2 first video stores ever in town. Wrote [a story](https://volumeone.org/articles/2021/04/30/275774-be-kind-rewind) for Volume One about it because I was such a video rat growing up.

"I've never been a big fan of house parties either (and I'm way past that point now), but I enjoy drinking with a group of friends and going to the bars. 

When I was in campus, there were two gyms - one on upper campus, one on lower. I believe that's still the case. Lower campus one was where all the athletes worked out, and the upper one was a little more casual. There are also some nice trails to walk in the area around campus and honestly, a good chunk of the city.

I'm not really sure on museums... I know the Children's Museum is building a new place, but I'm assuming that's a little different than what you're looking for. The Chippewa Valley Museum has a lot of historical stuff from the days when Eau Claire and the surrounding area was being initially developed. There's also Rassbach Heritage Museum over in Menomonie that looks like it's a little more industry-focused, and looks like there are some antique cars and stuff. I've never been there, so can't really speak to the quality. 

There's the statues all around the city (water st and downtown areas) that you could go on a walk and look like. I'm not a huge art guy, but the city seems to hype up that ""outdoor exhibit"" quite a bit. I also know there are some art studios in Banbury Place. I'm not sure if there's much on display in those places or not.

I don't ice fish. It can be kind of an expensive hobby to get all the gear. But if you're in the dorms, I'm assuming you'll meet at least one or two people that do it. I would just ask them if you can tag along some time.

Edit: to add on, college is great for expanding your horizons and figuring out what you like. Even if you aren't specifically trying to find new things, you'll probably find some things... if you're into working out and walking, disc golf might be a good hobby for you too.",t2_qjgni,mschley2,0,1645567131.0,0,t1_hy0qwfe,hy0qwfe,False,ItsNesquiik,t3_sy6jaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/eauclaire/comments/sy6jaf/what_should_i_know_before_moving_to_eau_claire/,"What should I know before moving to Eau Claire?

"Thank you, this is really good to know. For drinking I don’t plan on drinking unless if it’s one on one with someone close/really small group of friends. I never found party drinking appealing. 

And to answer your question, I’ll be a 19 year old freshman in September when I start the academic year. For hobbies I like to workout, video games, nature walks, do art (illustrations/origami), read philosophy/current events, and I started gaining an interest in antique cars, small one I’m still fresh out of the box with it. 

But I’m just honestly open to trying new things so I can get out there more.

I know that ice fishing is common during the winter so I wanna try that out for the first time next year. I essentially am trying to get out of my comfort zone and try out new things while getting to know the area and people along the way.

I will ask though, are there any museums? If there are which one would you recommend? :)

"If you're not familiar with Wisconsin's drinking culture, it might be a bit of a shock. There is a lot of pressure to drink here, and a lot of pressure to drink a lot, both in terms of quantity and frequency. If you can handle it (more from a mental health/still being productive/addiction/abuse standpoint) it makes for an absolutely incredible time in college. But it's also the downfall of some people. So just make sure you take some time to self-reflect on that every once in a while and make sure it isn't a problem. I'm sensitive to this because there's a lot of alcoholism in my family, so I just want to point it out in case it's a potential concern for you. 

You'll kind of figure out your people and your hobbies when you get here. But what are you into? Are you an 18-19 year old freshman, grad student, or a non-traditional student?

Unfortunately, most of those things are spring/summer/fall events, but we've found ways to have fun during the winter, as well (hence, all of the alcohol). There are multiple music festivals in EC and the surrounding towns. There is free local music in the parks multiple times a week during the summer. Camp/bonfires and tubing are popular chill hangout ideas around here that don't need to include drinking but usually do. 

Feel free to let me know if you've got questions.

"Wisconsin native, moved back to Eau Claire a couple years ago after leaving for school and staying out of state for more than a decade.

1: Drinking culture is a thing. Everyone handles peer/cultural pressure differently, but given you're young be careful. It is significantly more accepted to spend a lot of time getting and being intoxicated in wisconsin. Add that to the already binge-y way most undergrads drink, and it can be very, very bad. There are perks, though, it can be easy to cement friendships by spending a couple hours over beers at your local.

2: Warm clothing is a good idea, but not really for survival, just convenience. There's a lot of fun stuff to do in the winter, and most of it isn't possible without the proper attire.

3: Eau Claire has a large Hmong population, and it's very worth seeking out some Hmong food/culture (restaurants, groceries, the vendors at the farmers markets, going to the big new year celebration/events, etc).  The food is amazing, the people are welcoming, and the stories about their family history and the exodus from Laos are fascinating. 

4: Getting a job out in the community is easy if you have transportation or you're just working over your summer break. Right now restaurants are starved for employees, as are coffee shops, retail, grocery, etc.

5: If you're a religious person there's a healthy smattering of most types of congregations in the area (various christian denominations, Jewish, Unitarian, there's a mosque in Altoona which is within the metro).

6: If someone invites you tubing, tailgating, biking, hunting, or to a bonfire, say yes immediately and figure out the logistics later.",t2_5zd2f,Riddul,0,1645516918.0,0,t1_hxxvu93,hxxvu93,True,ItsNesquiik,t3_sy6jaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/eauclaire/comments/sy6jaf/what_should_i_know_before_moving_to_eau_claire/,"What should I know before moving to Eau Claire?

"Haha that's kind of what I figured. 

I'm a little more familiar with the divier/townier bars. I'll try to list these in the order of most rough crowd to least rough, but sometimes it just depends on the day... 5 O'Clock Club, Wig Wam, Oliver's, Southtowne Pub are all places I go regularly and enjoy. There are plenty of others, too. The Joynt isn't my vibe, but I know people that love it. It's my the college bars, but it's a little more of a townie/hipster vibe. Mouse Trap is downtown and kind of has that same vibe without the college kids. They have live music sometimes, but not sure about next week.

Southtowne is kind of business/happy hour-ish earlier in the evening too. For another on that end of town, Red Mixer is a specialty cocktail kind of place. Cowboy Jack's and 44 North are in the Altoona River Prairie area. The Dive is a fancier place downtown. 

I'm sure if you're checking out any of those places, you'll be able to meet someone else to give you some suggestions too.

Edit: also should clarify. ""Rough"" is pretty subjective. I've never felt unsafe at any of those places. They're not hangouts for gangs or motorcycle clubs or anything like that. They can just get pretty blue collar and maybe a little abrasive.",t2_qjgni,mschley2,0,1640043040.0,0,t1_hpcv4mh,hpcv4mh,False,Hambone_Marone,t3_rkt2fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/eauclaire/comments/rkt2fl/traveling_to_eau_claire_for_work_on_the_26th30th/,Traveling to Eau Claire for work on the 26th-30th!

"Mexican - Tacos Juanitas is my favorite, but there are a couple more that I've either never been to or haven't been in a long time (it's been several years for Casa Vallarta, so I'll have to try that one again soon).

Asian - Thai Orchid is my 3rd favorite in town behind Rice Palace and Muang Thai. Egg Rolls Plus is right behind Thai Orchid. They're all amazing. They just do things a little different, and it depends on what I'm in a mood for and which place has which specials that day.

Burgers - I'll add Wig Wam for another place downtown that's got great burgers. Total dive bar, but their food is awesome and they have lunch and dinner specials every day. 

Sandwiches - EC Cheese & Deli is phenomenal too. Jay Ray's is my favorite, and I always feel bad for ECC&D because they're right down the road and I hardly ever go there.

Loudenslager accuses opponents in District III Court of Appeals race of having special interests By: Michaela Paukner, [mpaukner@wislawjournal.com](mailto:mpaukner@wislawjournal.com) December 11, 2020 12:01 pm

Aaron Loudenslager, one of the candidates in the race for District III Court of Appeals, is accusing his two opponents of having special interests, political connections and ties to wealthy donors.

Loudenslager, a Madison criminal-defense and appellate law attorney, is running for the position against Rick Cveykus, a Wausau lawyer who practices criminal law, family law and small claims; and the Outagamie County Judge Greg Gill Jr.

In a press release sent on Monday, Loudenslager said he’s the only candidate discussing what he called the two “fundamental issues” affecting the Wisconsin judiciary: what he deemed the influence of outside monetary contributions in judicial elections and a lack of support staff throughout the system. His opponents, meanwhile, are ignoring their ties to politically connected and wealthy individuals, Loudenslager said.

Gill, for example, worked at his family’s law firm, Gill & Gill in Appleton before serving as a judge. The firm represents management interests in matters pertaining to business, corporate, and labor and employment law.

“Today, Judge Gill Jr. still has ties to wealthy individuals—and corporate interests,” Loudenslager said.

Loudenslager took exception to Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hruz’s support of Gill and two people involved in Gill’s campaign. One of them is Landis Holdorf, Gill’s campaign manager. Holdorf works for the Republican Party of Wisconsin as a senior data analyst, according to Holdorf’s LinkedIn page. He also served as campaign manager for two Republican Assembly candidates, Scott Soik and Calvin Callahan.

Holdorf did not respond to inquiries requesting comment from him and Gill.

Cveykus is working with Nation Consulting on his campaign. Loudenslager said hiring the firm and Cveykus’s history of giving money to various political campaigns shows Cveykus has political connections.

According to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, Cveykus made $2,400 in contributions to candidates over the past 10 years. He’s supported justices Jill Karofsky, Rebecca Dallet and Ann Walsh Bradley, along with the Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul and several other Democrats. Cveykus also gave $10 earmarked for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin in May, according to data from the Federal Election Commission.

Searches of both databases for “Aaron Loudenslager” produced no results.

Meanwhile, a Wisconsin Democracy Campaign search for “Greg Gill” revealed various contributions but did not show whether the money came from Gill Jr. or Gregory Gill Sr. However, Gill & Gill was listed as the donor’s employer, and the contributions were made during years that Gill Jr. was serving on the Outagamie County Circuit Court, suggesting the contributions most likely came from Gill Sr. It’s unclear if $750 in contributions to Scott Walker in 2010 by Gregory B. Gill came from Gill Jr. or Gill Sr. A search of the Federal Election Commission’s database for Gill returned no results.

“But maybe as judicial candidates—and current judges—we just need to get back to basics at the moment,” Loudenslager said. “And instead of pandering to partisan interests and the affluent, maybe we should just make sure we are conducting ourselves in such a manner that communicates to the public that we are truly independent adjudicators of our justice system and free from partisan interests.”

In a statement, Cveykus said he’s also concerned about outside influences on the court.

“I support the creation of a stronger recusal rule, more open administrative processes, and have pledged to be an impartial, honest, fair, and transparent judge,” Cveykus said.

Cveykus said he plans to use his wisdom to reform judicial practices in Wisconsin. That’s why, he said, Republicans, Democrats and Independents throughout the norther part of the state support his campaign. He also said he is respectful of anyone who wants to serve the public.

“I do not think it is healthy to the judiciary to attack candidates that we do not know, and I will just make clear that I wish them all the best of luck in their future endeavors,” Cveykus said.

The candidates are now collecting signatures they need to get on the ballot for the April 2021 election. Each candidate must collect 1,000 signatures to appear. The election is scheduled for April 6, 2021.",t2_dwuqk,OverZealousKoala,0,1607760805.0,0,t1_gfi2pse,gfi2pse,True,loudens1,t3_kbav4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/eauclaire/comments/kbav4z/loudenslager_accuses_opponents_in_district_iii/,Loudenslager accuses opponents in District III Court of Appeals race of having special interests – Wisconsin Law Journal,/r/eauclaire/comments/kbav4z/loudenslager_accuses_opponents_in_district_iii/gfi2pse/,1,r/eauclaire,0,1

"Altoona is actually a bird city, so there are annual birding events. From the city’s website: 

>	On May 9, 2020, the City of Altoona is hosting River Prairie Festival. This event will promote the education and awareness of birds and nature. We are planning to have various educational speakers (including a bird/birding education session), recreational activities, photography contest, and activities for the whole family to enjoy. This event is currently being planned and is developing rapidly. We've chosen a bird as our festival art the last two years (a Blackburian Warbler in 2018 and a Crow in 2019). We are also planning to showcase our festival bird image throughout Altoona, with a guerilla marketing campaign. Our event will incorporate the IMBD theme relating to plastic pollution awareness, with recycling stations present and a deliberate emphasis during our bird education session. Our event will also host an early morning birding walk in River Prairie Park. 

And

>	Altoona's River Prairie also hosted the 2019 Wisconsin Society of Ornithology Convention. We have worked with Steve Betchkal, President of the Gaylord Nelson Audubon Society, a few times before and he strongly shifted the discussion of hosting the 2019 Convention in River Prairie.

"Likes - The downtown area feels great to be in and there are lots of small shops and things to do there. We have lots of restaurants and places to see here. My favorite place is at the confluence, where the Eau Claire river and the Chippewa river combine. There is good fishing and lots of music festivals and events to attend, many of which are free. One place in particular I enjoy. If you get the chance, visit the Local Store near Banbury place for an amazing experience. There, you can find all things Eau Claire including wine and cheese. \*wink\* There are lots of things to do downtown with children, too. The children's museum is a wonderful place to take your children that never gets old. The library is a wonderful place to take your children, and don't forget the Farmer's Market in Phoenix Park! (I cant remember when its open but I believe Wednesdays in the summer) We have lots of walking and biking trails if you like to move. Plenty of gyms too! Eau Claire is a wonderful place to grow up. 

Dislikes - The winter season can be pretty harsh if you aren't prepared. The homelessness population is also a problem here. You should try to find a house that isn't in one of the crime populated neighborhoods.

All in all, I believe that the benefits outweigh the downsides. I'm sure you would find Eau Claire very charming and a great place to raise your kids.",t2_1cgy6zlk,EthanLikesAnime,0,1597274139.0,0,t1_g19pe80,g19pe80,True,my_super_cool_name,t3_gfntjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/eauclaire/comments/gfntjn/relocating_to_eau_claire/,Relocating to Eau Claire,/r/eauclaire/comments/gfntjn/relocating_to_eau_claire/g19pe80/,2,r/eauclaire,0,2

"The angled concrete thing with black “doors” is the remains of the coal conveyor.  The area behind the cement retaining wall on Galloway was the coal bunker, and a long angled conveyor carried coal up to the boiler (Bldg 19) which provided steam power and heat for tire making.    To the best of my knowledge, the tunnels are accessed from inside building 17 and several others.  I’ve been told by people who have actually been in them that they go 4 levels deep. I have never been in them or really had a chance to explore Banbury at length, so my info is secondhand.  

I did, however, give myself and a friend a “self guided” tour of American Phoenix one night at about 1am in the summer of 2002 while third shift was in operation.  We even brought our own wine with us.  One bottle each.  The factory doors were wide open so we just walked in and started exploring.  All the machinery was running.  The workers didn’t even care that we were in there. It was fascinating, but an obviously miserable place to work.  Down in the basement - 2 levels down - we were spotted by a foreman who chased us out.  He never caught us, but within a day or two there was chain link fence covering the factory doors and fire escapes, which are still there to this day.

My husband and I moved here at the end of last summer. We relocated for his work. He is paid very well, we have a nice rental, we've enjoyed the city so far. We are bummed that we will be missing out on our first Eau Claire summer because of Coronavirus, but it is what it is. Overall, we've enjoyed our time here.

The major downfall, I have yet to be able to find full-time work. For us, it's not a big deal financially because we don't have children. It may be different for your family.

"I moved here from a large city with sprawling suburbs around 5 years ago. Me, my husband, a 2 year old at the time, although now we have a second baby.  We moved for my work.  I work in healthcare and I get paid a very good salary here.  We love eau Claire.  Here are the things we like:
-No traffic!!! 
-Great sense of community
-Tons of family friendly events, especially in the summer (probably not this summer though). Also the library and children's museum are excellent.
-It's beautiful here and there's great walking and biking trails to enjoy
-School district seems to be good and they have a lot of free summer programming
-Cost of living is low. The first time I went to the expensive grocery store in town I was shocked by how cheap it was. 
-Midwest nice is a real thing, and people in EC are great
-Nice variety of culture events- the children and community theater is great and there's a lot of local music

Things we don't love:
-The winters. This past winter was very mild and they have been doing something called winter mission, which actually helped us find things to do to be outdoors in the winter. But usually it is very cold for several weeks, like negative double digits. My boss told me when first hiring that there's no bad weather, just bad clothing. That's a lie. -45 is bad weather.
- The shopping. I suspect the mall here will close or be nearly closed at the end of covid. This means shopping will be virtually non existent outside of a few boutique stores or driving to the cities.

Brewing Projekt - Their IPAs are popular. They're known for having experimental flavors. They do have stouts. The last one I had was a Mexican hit chocolate Stout and I really liked it. It was very spicy!

Modicum - I believe they are known for their IPAs as well. Not sure if they have any stouts or barrel aged. I've gone there a few times and they are good beers

"**Inversion (meteorology)**

In meteorology, an inversion is a deviation from the normal change of an atmospheric property with altitude.  It almost always refers to an inversion of the thermal lapse rate.  Normally, air temperature decreases with an increase in altitude. During an inversion, warmer air is held above cooler air; the normal temperature profile with altitude is inverted.

"Sadly I'm not much into sports, so I can't help a whole lot with that.  I do know there are various groups / clubs around you can look into joining.

For music and theatre, I can help a bit more with that. Both of those (and anything else considered ""The Arts"") are areas that Eau Claire is really trying to build up and make more of a central focus. This is part of the reason why the new Confluence Arts Center is being built right now.

Music:

If you are looking for more of a community based music group (and not just a ""band""), then there are a few options you can look into. 

* [Chippewa Valley Jazz Orchestra](https://www.chippewajazz.org/)
* [Chippewa Valley Symphony Orchestra] (http://www.cvsymphony.org/)
* [Eau Claire Municipal Band] (http://www.eauclairemunicipalband.org/) ** Summer, so not for a while.

For small bands, that's something that will require a bit of digging to see if anyone is looking for someone to join them. Can't help much here.

Theatre:

There are two main public groups.

* [Eau Claire Children's Theatre] (http://www.ecct.org/) - Typically geared towards the younger crowd, but they do put on shows for adults.
* [Chippewa Valley Theatre Guild] (http://www.cvtg.org/) - Typically geared more towards adults, but do put on shows for all ages.

So you can't go wrong with either of those two.

Gaming:

As you saw in another comment, the District Company (or now called Eau Claire Games and Arcade) is the way to go.

"Wow, thanks!

Depending on where you go, you might still end up in a house, even if renting.  If you're near Water St, it'll probably be a house.  Some just have rooms available, some are converted to multi-plexes.  Some 1 bedroom apartments are $850, and some 2 bedroom houses are $600.

There's a FB group you might want to check out too.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/650074651691756/

The bus station is currently between Farwell and Barstow in that part of downtown, so that would be a good place to be if you needed transportation, although there are bus stops on Water st as well.

One other thing I forgot, the bars on Farwell and Barstow are less college/party bars, and no dance floors.  Being that you're a little older than college age, you might not want ""nuts to butts"", and might want a place where you can actually sit down.

Thanks for your input.  These maps are saved.  Another landlord I'm working with is right where the map says Speedtraps right under Hillbilly Heaven.  I can deal with that crime map.  The crime around here has been unusual in 2015.  This place is turning in to Murderapolis.  I live a few miles north of Mpls so the guns aren't as big of a problem.

"So Hwy CC (or Folsom) and Truax would be considered westside.  Good average houses over there.  A fair amount of families around that area.  There are a few schools over there (Sherman Creek Elementary and Delong Middle).  You'd be near a Mega grocery store, Menards, Culvers, Burger King, some other basic restaurants and bars.  A gym nearby too.  There's an apartment complex called WestWinds apartments right near Mega.

[I've created a picture that might help a bit, based around the center of downtown.](http://i.imgur.com/kquDKtA.jpg)

Red is some of the biking or walking trails.  It extends up to the westside area a bit, so you could probably walk to it.  From there they are all connected.

Purple is the west side, where you were asking about.

Yellow is college area, down near Water St.  There are kind of 2 downtown areas, Water st and Barstow/Farwell, although most people refer to Barstow/Farwell as downtown, and Water st as Water st.  Light blue lines are bars/restaurants.  It's mostly houses and mostly rentals near Water St.  Farwell/Barstow is mostly business buildings, but some have rentals above them.  Most of the popular non-chain restaurants are in these 2 areas:  Mona Lisas, Mogies, Nucleus, Acoustic Cafe, Houligans, Galloway Grill, Livery, Stellas.  Also bars: Brothers, Pioneer, House of Rock, Dooleys, Firehouse, Mousetrap, Clancys, Stones Throw. Oxbow apartments on Water st, and Riverfront Terrace in Phoenix Park.  Most of the places in this area are already renting for June of 2016, if not already claimed.

White is 3rd ward.  Lots of older houses there, and a lot of university professors.  Some students on the outskirts.  No apartments.  No restaurants or bars.

Dark green is East hill.  Lots of starter homes there, some rentals.  Near an elementary and 2 high schools. East of there on 53 is typical business district.  Lots of fast food and chain restaurants, and a couple bars.  Near a bowling alley.

Light green is Putnam Heights and farther off the map, southside.  Typical middle class, $100k to 300k homes, depending on where you are.  

Black star in the middle is Phoenix Park.  They are really trying to do a lot to revitalize downtown, tear down old buildings (big argument for some people, saying they should be saved/fixed), and get new businesses and apartments down there.

Dark blue is ""ghetto"" areas.  It's not really the ghetto, just for Eau Claire.  If someone gets stabbed or shot, it's usually in one of these areas.  Lots of rental homes above Phoenix Park.  Trailer park is lower left of map (EDIT: It's actually a little farther south west of where I marked.  This area is also known as Shawtown).  Imperial Circle area at bottom of map has lots of seedy apartments.  They recently built what looks like a much nicer one (underground parking), but I haven't seen them.  Beverly Hillbillies on bottom right, lots of duplexes.

Top right pink is getting to the north side, although most of it is off this map.  Some of it is also known as ""the planets"", since streets are named after them.  Out near the airport and a high school.

And south east of the map, that I didn't really draw, is the Oakwood Mall area.  Lots of expansion there over the last 10 years.  Many houses in the ""Oakwood Hills"" area are upperscale.  Plenty of retail buildings and chain restaurants.

As /u/ecNate mentioned, if you like beer, there are a couple new breweries.  Lazy Monk is opening a new location just across the river from Phoenix Park, right near Luther Middlefort campus on the map.  Brewing Projekt is about 4 blocks from there.  They are looking to move soon too, but to that same area.

Are you geared more towards renting a house or apartment?  Most housing is pretty cheap compared to the Twin Cities.

"Drink: Firehouse for selection, Mousetrap/Joynt for townie feel with good beer.
Food: Ninja Sushi is opening back up downtown soon, The Nucleus for breakfast, and eh... I think we're hurting a bit for good restaurants at the moment.
Interesting things? Tons of great local music! A lively farmers market. An unusually strong improv scene. The worlds best college jazz. Great kayaking and canoeing along the Eau Claire and Chippewa. Skiing at Hoffman Hills and Lowes Creek Park. It is a little drive but you can hike chunks of the ice age trail as day hikes if you really want to get away. Great biking/running trails along the rivers (EC is my favorite city to run in). 

Above all else: volumeone.org

As far as ""bad neighborhoods"" I would say there are some areas around the north you might want to avoid but really, EC's ""bad neighborhoods"" are better than most cities' good neighborhoods.

"There are lots of bike trails around/through Eau Claire.  The college area is North of Water St, up a bit past Lake St, from 1st Ave to 10th Ave.  Water St has about 12 bars in 4 blocks. A lot of the houses there are rentals.  There is a bike path parallel to Water along the river. It crosses and follows the river heading west. It also follows the river going east, and forks and crosses the river to go to Phoenix park. People float the river in the summer, starting at Phoenix park. 

Phoenix Park has the farmers market and music on Thursdays during the summer. That JAMF is headquartered near there, as is RCU. The nearby area is being redeveloped, dubbed the Confluence Project.  There are newly built apartments nearby, but I think they are pretty full. There are some bars, restaurants and other businesses within walking distance. North of Phoenix Park is Madison st, and across Madison St is the ghetto.

If you go up State St from Water St, that's Putnam Heights. No apartments around there, but there are houses to rent. The outskirts of that, behind Shopko, has some apartments. The new ones I think are ok. People have been stabbed at the old ones. 

Lots of starter homes are purchaed in the East Hill area. There are rental houses there as well. The East Hill is west of Business 53, from about Brackett to Highland, maybe Main St. 

There are other neighborhoods and parks, but I've already typed a lot...

"ok so back in the day it was a Uniroyal tire plant, the bank RCU also had its beginnings from that. now one section still makes rubber product but its shipped else where for manufacturing. the rest has been converted to shops, apartments, and storage. shops range from heady glass blowers to lesson studios for music and arts to a wood working supplies shop (great selection of difficult to find fine lumber). also on the far end near the tunnel entrance you can get on the roof from climbing up the outside and is a pretty cool smoke spot (not a climb for the faint of heart)

>__Kubb__ (pronounced [kɵb] in [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language) or [kub] in [Gutnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutnish)) is a [lawn game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_game) where the object is to knock over wooden blocks by throwing wooden batons at them.  Kubb can be somewhat described as a combination of [bowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling) and [horseshoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoes).

>Some rules vary from country to country and from region to region, but the ultimate object of the game is to knock over the kubbs on the opposing side, and then knock the ""king"" over, before the opponent does. This, combined with the fact that there is a certain level of strategy that can be used by players, has led some players and kubb fans to nickname the game ""Viking Chess."" Games can last from five minutes to well over an hour. The game can be played on a variety of surfaces such as grass, sand, concrete, snow, or even ice.

"Glad you found us and decided to move here! =D Where did you read about us? Anything particular that helped make your decision?

1) Hard to say how much it snows as it varies, but expect to shovel every week or so during the winter until about April. It can get pretty cold here though, but once you've been here long enough, you'll start to somewhat get used to it. This year in particular has been really cold with plenty of days below zero. So make sure to have warm clothes handy on those days.

To give you an idea of the temps:

* 2014 - http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/clim-history/stations/eau/eau-tts-2014.gif
* 2013 - http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/clim-history/stations/eau/eau-tts-2013.gif
* 2012 - http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/clim-history/stations/eau/eau-tts-2012.gif

2) There is usually a good amount of things to do around Eau Claire, especially if you are willing to actually look for them.

* During the summer there is music playing in two of parks Mon - Thurs.
* We have annual events like SummerFest (beginning of August) and the International Fall Festival (coming up on Sept. 20th!).
* If you are into plays at all there is the State Theater downtown.
* If you ever heard of the game 'Kubb' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb), the national championship is held in Eau Claire every year.
* A ton of bars.
* If you have family, or want to feel like a kid, there's Action City. (http://actioncityfun.com)
* If you love biking (or even just walking), we have some great trails going through Eau Claire. (https://goo.gl/maps/7eCGx)
* Other Things: http://www.visiteauclaire.com/things-to-do/

3) No help from me regarding real estate agents as I never had to use one. I do work with quite a few different realty companies at my work though, so I could possibly see if anyone there has a preference.

Neighborhood-wise, I'm also going to go with the East Side Hill. Though I might be biased as I live there... It's pretty quiet and right next to the downtown area.
Here's a map of the neighborhood: http://goo.gl/maps/viY0s

This is also a college town (University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire), so depending on where you end up living, you'll most likely see plenty of college-age students hanging around.

Firs of all its not so much the snow as the cold that you should prepare for. when its time you would probably enjoy some long underwear http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_underwear and a good snow blower if you are buying a home. as far as things to do Eau Claire has a newish really nice farmers market for a city of its size https://www.facebook.com/EauClaireDowntownFarmersMarket . there are consents in the park during the summer http://volumeone.org/sites/concerts/events and the music scene from my perspective has really been growing a lot or at least is more out in the open over the last couple of years. there are tons of dive(ish) and neighborhood bars if you are in to that sort of thing. ah what else oh yeah all the out door stuff like biking hiking fishing hunting / ice fishing show shooing cross country skiing.
