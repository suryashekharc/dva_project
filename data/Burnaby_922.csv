"About 235$/sq ft but this was in 2016. I'm right next to skytrain(surrey central) in a new concrete condo with 12 ft ceilings. Burnaby at the time came at a considerable premium to Surrey even with both being next to rapid transit. All feels the same to me along the skytrain andI like that the tax rate is lower and will remain lower over here compared to surrounding cities.

Edit: Scrolling through listings now it seems like some higher end places @ brentwood are over $1000/sqft

"Great investment and entertainment district albeit you may have to cough up more $$$ on the services provided around that area. The stores/shops are more expensive than Metrotown. 

Is it great for family? We don't know yet until the community center is built (maybe 5-10 years?)

Metrotown is far more established and more walkable. 

You have Bonsor and Edmond Community Center reachable by walk/bus+skytrain (yes, I know it's old but facility wise, it's ""good enough"" / ""complete""). 

You have more Elementary schools around Metrotown. More business options (insurance, restaurants, health-related, groceries, big chains).

Edmonds is a good compromise: small town-ish but 2 stations away from Metrotown. There are quite a few smaller groceries around Edmonds and the Edmonds Community center is great!

"If you want a more quiet and relaxing place I recommend around Edmonds area or high gate. Highgate seems a nice area there is a mini mall nearly by and I think the pricing is still cheaper but have lots of potential once more developers start developing in that area.

As of right now apartment near metrotown and Brentwood is through the roof 2 bedroom apartment over 900k? One bedroom over 600k? Not really worth the price IMO. Rent is also high in those area. If you are going between Van and coq you can also look at lougheed mall.

Edit depends on your life style. I used to love living near metrotown for like 6months and then hate it. Sure there is a mall, a community center and a ton of restaurant nearby but is  Too busy, too many people, too much traffic, even skytrain is packed and there is hardly any street parking.

"I lived at Brentwood and Metrotown and the only reason I'd suggest Brentwood for you is because it's by the highway making it easier to commute.

If that view is held someone could show up with a nazi flag at any protest and the Prime Minister could say they are all nazis.

It's the most ethnically diverse community in Canada, which is saying something. I've lived here all but one year of the last 25 and I love it. It's walkable, heavily treed, well served with transit and has just about everything you need to run a household or enjoy recreation or get an education close by. I've been lucky with my neighbours (There's a lot of rentals on my street but these folks are awesome). 

Parking is a bit of a drag depending on the street and there's quite a bit of petty theft - bikes going missing from yards, weirdos looking from yard to yard. If I was moving into the area I would definitely put security cameras over the entrances and garage, if applicable, or pointing at the car. (My brother's car was stolen from the carport about ten years ago and apart from the new crack pipe in the footwell he got it back in one piece.) 

There's occasionally noise from night filming down on Marine Drive (BOOM! at 2 am, what the hell was that), and sometimes you can hear the foghorns and train horns down by the Fraser, but it's a relatively quiet neighbourhood.

"Living in Brentwood Tower 3 and I will list the cons only (You should know the pros)

&#x200B;

* No AC
* Small Lobby for 55th floor Condos (Worst compare to T1-2)  
* Small and Expensive 
* Parking down to P10 level (P3-P10 for residence ), 
* Strata suck as my opinion...it is an investment property more than for owner
* lots of renters, Not good for a family (It is more like a student or young couple place) 
* Always smell weed from any unit
* Amenity suck in T3 (Just a small gym)
* don't buy south-facing (Skytrain noise), Live at high as possible to avoid elevator congestion
* Laundry and fridge so small 
* constant HRV running  
* You feel excited about those fancy malls, neighbourhoods for the first month and slowly feel ""cold"" about it.

"Well, it seems that you are missing my point. 
I am more than familiar with everything about the Burnaby Mountain. It’s our backyard. We are not discussing the Playground of the Gods, which is related to the carver Toko (some history bellow) but the new name of the Horizon restaurant. 
As a person of non -Aboriginal decent, who has a huge respect for our Aboriginal people and their sacred sites such as the Medicine Wheel site on Burnaby Mountain, I think that the new restaurant’s name is not appropriate. That’s all. 


“ The surprising thing about the Playground of the Gods (known in Japanese as Kamui Mintara) is that, in general, many folks automatically think that the First Nations people carved the totem poles. Although there are some similarities in the workmanship and symbols, the woodcarver is, in fact, a Japanese man named Nuburi Toko.

Toko is an Ainu people—an indigenous tribe from northern Japan.

"My former upstairs neighbour would do dishes and run kitchen equipment and all sorts of other crap between 11pm and 2am on a regular basis. Her kitchen was above my bedroom so this was very unpleasant. I had to start wearing earplugs, but even that doesn't muffle what sounds like dropping a cast iron pan from a height into the sink. I filed noise complaints on 4 occasions. When she had lived there for just under 2 years, she listed her place.

This is where it gets interesting:

One day I was riding down in the elevator with her and her dog. I petted the dog's head. As I go to get off, she cut in front of me and said I was the reason she had to sell and referenced a noise complaint that wasn't even one I made (she'd also gotten in trouble for garbage in the hall, dog poop on the balcony). I ducked past her and she followed me to my car screaming and yelling. I was so scared she would attack me. I filed a report once I got to work on the advice of our security head (to document in case something happened to me). Was so glad when she finally sold the place.

"Well, let's see what the numbers say.

Let's use a subset of crimes that people seem focused on: Assault, Robbery, B&E.

Burnaby had: 
* 1006 Assaults, or 404 per 100k, down 13% from 2020
* 75 Robberies, or 30 per 100k, down 23% from 2020
* 854 B&Es, or 343 per 100k, down 39% from 2020.

Vancouver had:
* 4608 Assaults, or 682 per 100k, up 2% from 2020*
* 568 Robberies, or 84 per 100k, down 5% from 2020
* 3512 B&Es, or 520 per 100k, down 27% from 2020

So the answer is that at their current rates Burnaby will never have as much crime as Vancouver, but that's because crime rate isn't increasing in either city.

\* Note that this is still down from 2019.

"Bears do not live in Deer Lake Park. Deer Lake Park has some food sources for them and they come through seasonally. Pay very close attention to the dogs around you, if there's a bear they will LET YOU KNOW. I have seen coyotes, seen precisely one  bobcat (lynx) and I spoke to someone who had just seen a three hundred pound bear, who climbed the railing of the walkway, bellyflopped into the lake and swam away to avoid people.

I have no problem walking around the park at night, and in the summer time that is how you see bats and owls. However, I don't walk alone, I walk with one other person.

My favourite part park is the raised walkway in the middle of the park at the west end of the lake, where there are very often frogs. There's also a snake den on one of the trails and if you're standing in the exact right spot on the first truly warm day in the spring you'll see the garter snakes come out and have a mass orgy.

"not sure what your self defence goals are but you may as well enrol into any of the above and go at minimum 3 times a week. one on one instruction doesn’t get you that far as your trainer can’t spar with you or “pressure test” you in the same way as sparring with different people (more and less comfortable and familiar with, and different body shapes and sizes, etc). the cost of a month’s membership is the same (ish! - don’t roast me too hard internet) as a single hour one on one.  alternatively, if you can find instructors/coaches who have the time… (if they don’t have a full time gym that is busy), consider getting some of your friends to do some kind of group session if you want to get a lower student to teacher ratio.

i also want to be clear about “getting you that far”. a one on one limits that instructor’s ability to watch you perform and do what they’re supposed to do to help you improve: coach. so… i mean the ecosystem of a lot of gyms allow for this as you spar with others, instructors can watch and provide feedback. especially if you request it. 

that’s my two cents on “one on one”.

to address that part about 1 on 1 bjj. i think 1 on 1 helps to learn techniques and deeper understanding of stuff. but you gotta try that on a variety of different people (sizes, skills, social familiarity, etc). so much of it is feel… this applies to every martial art really.

in bjj i suppose you could accost a purple belt and buy them dinner and fancy things to do one on ones 🤷🏽‍♂️. 

earlier covid times created a larger market/supply of personal trainers for that stuff i think… and others that i’d think of have gone to running/teaching at a gym or don’t have time for that side hustle due to life (married, career, kids, etc).

"•There were bear sightings; have never heard or seen any bear dens around. There are two coyotes; they usually come out at dusk. If you are walking, would highly recommend a head lamp. It scares them away. 

• Walking at night? That’s your call. It’s safe or unsafe as anywhere else. Quiet neighborhood does not guarantee you any safety. 

• Baldwin House seems to be accessible to public since there are visitors on a regular basis.

• Favourite areas; gardens, Art Gallery, and kayaking (short distance but pleasant recreation after a work day). There is a rental place if you don’t have your own kayak. Burnaby lake is much better; it has a beautiful 2km stretch one way. 
Shadbolt Centre used to host lots of arts/crafts exhibitions, which unfortunately is not the case anymore.

"Burnaby is pretty big, so if you specify your area you might get more tailored responses.  In North Burnaby you have Confederation Park with pool, library, skatebowl, rubber walking/running track, water park, dog park, forest... basically everything :D.  Restaurants around there include Ramen Gaoh, Uomo Sushi, Glenburn Soda Fountain, and of course Anton's, plus some Thai places.  I have to shout out Mountain Gems (a rock/gem store) and Muck About gift gallery for being very homey and welcoming with nice original and affordable gifts.  You'll also find Rocky's meats and Coiffe's independent delis.

Go south a few minutes and find the ""Amazing"" Brentwood, which has some good stores and is near Whole Foods, a good bubble tea place (Coco, I think), and what looks to be a popular Korean BBQ and a Vietnamese restaurant (but I'm too old or too busy putting kids to bed at the times I would want to visit those places).

Capital Hill has a nice park with a sunset view on the west side, and same with Horizon's park on BBY Mountain.  Some OK mountain biking down BBY Mountain as well, plus walking trails there.  The park across from Home Depot is very under used and in the summer evenings you can almost always find garter snakes at the edge of the grass.

"I've lived in Burnaby for 20+ years - this is how I'd rank it from best to worst in terms of quietness/livability:

- Buckingham heights.
- Deer lake. 
- Garden Village.
- Suncrest/Southslope/Area next to Burnaby South.
- Metrotown/Maywood.
- Edmonds/Highgate.

I agree with /u/Alternative-Tear-296 that South Burnaby > North Burnaby for the same reasons. I'm really not a fan of Edmonds, having lived there for 2 years. I lived in the 'nicer' part of Edmonds too, at the Bosa properties behind Tommy Douglas Library. You often hear people screaming in the middle of the night outside - whether its fighting or mental illness. Also, its not particularly convenient - the food selection isn't great/restaurants aren't good and the major grocery store you can walk to is Save-on/Buy-Low which isn't as cheap as Superstore/Wal-Mart. 

If you want convenience, I would just live in the various towers next to Metrotown. Be warned, the units in the newer buildings are smaller. The only new building I would avoid is Element unless you're renting. In general the restaurants beside Metrotown are bigger brands/more well-known so the quality is more consistent (service/food).

"The best,
Suncrest. Garden village. South slope. Maywood. Deer lake. Buckingham heights. 

The okay,
Eastburn. Edmonds. Highgate(middlegate). Metrotown.  

I live in Edmonds currently, although I love it and have no issues with it, some people tend to not like the area as much. I would say its safe but maybe not as safe the rest?, due to occasional vehicles brake ins or whatnot. Similar issues around metrotown when I used to live there baxk in the day (over 6years ago) probably better now. 
I live in the heart of Edmonds and what possibly could be the “hood” of it, however last time there was a vehicle brake in in our neighborhood was over years ago so its not that bad honestly. 

In comparison to north Burnaby, I personally believe the south to be more alive and active, more convenient public transit and transportation, somewhat better prices of housing in certain areas, you’ll feel a slight change of locals but nothing crazy.

"I'm looking at similar condos mostly around Brentwood.

I also live in Ontario right now so I took some ""crash course"" about the area from my agent.

Metrotown is the most established city center area. Brentwood is still considered in development but compare it to Lougheed or Surrey center and you'll see it's on the later phases of being ""up and coming"".

2-bedroom units, at least those that fall through my filter, exist (one on Beta (I think the complex is called Lumia Waterfall/Starling) avenue just got sold for 750k or so) but are extremely rare. Since I am eager to move west, I shouldn't hold my breaths on finding one. 

&#x200B;

One way to assess the local community, IMO, is to look at the grocery stores. Metrotown has Superstore, Lougheed has Walmart and Brentwood has Whole Foods.

"I second this, Burnaby as a whole is a wonderful place to be. While I agree with the pros and cons,  I will say that the city of Burnaby put in a nice walking path between Brentwood and the heights. I think this was a way the city tried to tie the two together.  It's a well lit,  wide walking path that has been decorated with art structures and greenery to encourage walking to hastings from Brentwood.  Once you get to the heights,  there is already Confederation Park,  Eileen daily pool,  McGill library, and I believe they've just approved to rebuild the community center. It's about a 20-30 minute walk but if you have a car it's super quick.  Plus the restaurants on the heights are tasty and quite diverse in cuisine types and there's always parking. 

My biggest issue with Brentwood that wasn't mentioned is that the traffic there gets really backed up during rush hour.  A ton of cars in a dense area but not enough road space to accommodate and half of the buildings aren't even completed yet. It isn't an issue if you're transiting or working from home. 

Lougheed mall has less of a neighborhood feeling compared to the heights. A lot of the area is being renovated,  developed or was recently built. Lots of tasty Korean food options. It's definitely quieter of the 3,  and the mall really isn't anything special nor big but it's currently under renovations so I haven't seen what the result will look like. When it's all done,  I'm sure it'll be quite nice,  though maybe not Brentwood nice since they were trying to attract more upscale buyers with the new mall. 

Metrotown is a great hub,  but it is older so the apartments are definitely a mix of 30+ year and new buildings and will probably be more expensive.  It'll probably go through some development in about 5-10 years.  I think they originally had a plan to remodel the mall to make it more outdoor,  but I don't know where they're at with that, though station square is already quite nice now.  Your amenities are really close (library, community center),  it's a great transit hub,  and lots of easy access shopping.  As it is a more popular spot,  it can attract some questionable people sometimes, and overall its always busy but you can get a great view from an apartment depending on the place. They have a few small parks but central park is not too far away either, generally the skytrain stations at royal oak and Patterson next to metrotown still have some great apartment options and restaurants nearby if you want to be in a quieter area but still close to Metrotown.

"I know Brentwood better than Metrotown. Brentwood is a much newer development.  IMO The Heights is the coolest part of north Burnaby but it’s not near the sky train.   All the Italians that used to live on commercial drive moved to this area.  So there are lots of great cafe’s and deli’s.   There are also great restaurants and stores of many cultures in the heights.   In Brentwood town center it’s almost all chain / corporate restaurants.  Brentwood is very clean and has easy to access major transportation routes. There is a really positive feeling walking around the neighbourhood. 

Con: Despite collecting huge amounts of money from development permits and taxes from Brentwood residents, Burnaby city is not spending any money on providing civic facilities to the Brentwood town center area.    Burnaby is spending lots of money to upgrade the CG brown pool by Burnaby lake, major upgrade of Cameron center in Lougheed, and some plans to upgrade Eileen Daily in the Heights.   But none of these are directly connected to Brentwood.   There is a lot of potential for Brentwood.   But for now it’s a building site for places to sleep and places to spend money.  No current plans for anything else.  But it could be Amazing 😉. 

I would also look at Lougheed.    It’s very much under appreciated for what it is going to be.    If sky train is not a big deal, look at ‘The Heights’.   I do like Metrotown, I think they have great facilities, their restaurants and independent shops are better.  Driving access is not bad, but not as good as Brentwood. 

Honestly, I think you’d be fine in anyplace in Burnaby.   Each area has great things about it. I’ve been here for decades.

"We are definitely having troubles deciding between the two of Brentwood vs Metrotown. On one end, we’ve been told that Brentwood is the ‘up and coming’ neighborhood and has not fully been developed with all the bells and whistles which makes it hard to visualize what it will be in 10 years. On the other hand, we’ve been told Metrotown is an older and mature area with already built in amenities.

We are hoping to pick a neighborhood that will serve us in the long term, as well as would appreciate as an investment.

"> I’ve literally been told to park on another street and just walk. Well, they don’t own the street so I refused  
  
No. The owners do have more entitlement to the street in front of their house.  They can park there 100% of the time.   Non-owners have to follow this rule:  *Visitors and non-residents can park in a legal parking space for 3 hours only, between 8 am-6 pm.*
