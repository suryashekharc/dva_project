I chose Alexan Crossings, new management took over so now it's  now Sync a cityline.

it was my choice because GAS STOVES ( according to an apartment locator only 3 properties have that!!) the other one that I have seen with my own eyes is the neighbor property Axis 110.

I moved in back in nov '21

its normally quiet, moving from south east Dallas ( Pleasant Grove to be exact), it's oddly quiet. so far not many neighbors walking the halls.

on that i can hear my upstairs neighbor, not the neighbors on either side, nor the bottom one (I chose a second floor unit. 

now in the unit are granite or marble countertops, stainless steel appliances , washer and dryer included.

its a controlled access parking, only the second floor has 2 ports for charging electric vehicles.

they have open and reserve parking. 

all the balconies face into the courtyard which will be the pool area where the gym, mail/ package centers and ""rec"" room are in that building. they have a pool table and lounge area.

my trade off is I should've axis 110, being they have larger closets, some units appear to have a built in under counter wine shelf  (if you are into wines that is)

I'm a minimalist to a degree so not really a bother.

living here you are walking distance from Aces sports bar, some restaurants. a barber, a burger joint, sushi place, smoothie place/ toll house dessert combo.

right next to 75 and bush toll. 

whole foods is not far, neither is Costco and Sam's which are practically across the street from each other.

it's really quiet...

with the proper cookware the gas stoves are the shit!!!

in the whole food area are other restaurants, a CVS, and that is not to far from the large paved  trail walking park. 

you have downtown Plano that has a few cool pubs and eateries.

"Windsor Cityline is awesome. Cityline in general is awesome. Grocery within walking distance. Multiple restaurants. The population is diverse.

Wrt Windsor Cityline specifically, the maintenance team has always been quick to get things taken care of and the management has been responsive.

"Remember that, people don't always review apartments unless they have been compelled to do so by an agent/manager in the leasing office or by some really bad experience. It's often the case  that negative experiences are over represented  in these reviews as that's the only way you can vent your anger at an apartment management company.

"Hey, welcome! So I'd say there isn't really any areas to ""avoid"" in Richardson. There are some lower income or business park areas, but I've never felt not safe in any of them. Richardson offers a ton of variety and it's fun to experience them all. It's also adjacent to some really great options that make Richardson bigger, too.

Here's some fun things to do (again some of these are Richardson adjacent, but extremely close):

**Eat/Drink:**

* Lockwood Distillery: Local distillery with great food and drinks.
* Communion Coffee: The best coffee in the hood until Eiland Roasters opens up their shop (if they ever will?). Dutch Bros is also about to open in Richardson Heights.
* Angel Chicken Kitchen: Best chicken sandwiches (and everything else) in town.
* Cindi's Deli: The best diner in town and prolly the best bagels.
* Four Bullets Brewery: Small little brewery with a fun crowd on the weekends.
* Free Play Arcade: Fun arcade/bar with vintage machines and a flat fee to play.
* Meteor Hamburgers: Great hamburger joint.
* Del's Charcoal Burgers: Great hamburger joint that's been here since the 50s(?). Get the root beer, too.
* Jeng Chi: Great Chinese in Chinatown.- Everything else in Chinatown is worth exploring, too, including...
* 85 Degrees: Amazing asian bakery. Red bean buns are a fav.
* Imperial Noodle: Really delicious noodle dishes and other Chinese. We bounce between this place and Jeng Chi.
* Afrah / Bilad / Ali Babba: These just scratch the surface of middle eastern cuisine in Richardson.
* Industrial Pizza: Local fam owned newer pizza joint with really wonderful flavors and thin crust.
* Shady's: Best patio in town on a nice day + great burgers/more.
* Frankie's: Good tex mex.
* Tounge N Cheek Ice Cream: Great locally owned ice cream. Their cinnamon chip is fantastic.
* Masami: Favorite sushi spot in town, friendly owners and always delicious, much more affordable than the fancier...
* Sushi Sake: Super nice sushi spot.
* Bangkok on Beltline: Neighborhood Thai joint.
* Asian Mint: Fancier Thai.
* Bigdash: Middle eastern ice cream and dessert spot. Try it all!
* Pho Pasteur: Best pho in town. On a hot summer day go here and order the Pickle Lemonade!
* Monta Ramen: Favorite ramen shop.
* Cafe Amore: Neighborhood red sauce Italian joint. BYOB.
* Saigon Block: Really unique Vietnamese.
* There's obviously a ton more but onto....

&#x200B;

**Grocers (aside from all the neighborhood grocers):**

* El Rancho: Wonderful Mexican grocer. Great place to grab fajita meat.
* Deep Cuts: Local butcher, so many good things here. This might be a good place to ask about cajun sausage.
* Sara's Market Bakery: Middle eastern grocer.
* H-mart: Amazing asian grocer up the hwy in Plano.
* Central Market: Best big grocer around.
* There are a bunch more smaller grocers along Coit south of Arapaho but I'm blanking on them..

&#x200B;

**Do/Shop:**

* Cottonwood Arts Fair
* Santa's Village every x-mas at city hall
* Wildflower Arts and Music Festival
* Lots of really nice rec centers and parks
* Explore the UTD campus - some very cool buildings
* Rock Barrel: Interesting rock/gem shop by TI
* Wood World: Cool little woodworking shop by TI
* MicroCenter: One of the last remaining brick n mortar computer shops around.
* Lamborghini Dallas: Eye candy.
* Lone Chimney Mercantile: Great local gift shop. Really unique stuff here.
* Bruce Miller Nursery: Local nursery with very friendly/helpful staff.
* Quigley's Playhouse: Fun ceramic/pottery/art place.

But yeah, blue bags for recycling can be acquired anywhere, you don't have to use the ones from the city.

If you're ever around Huffhines park, they do sell blue recycling bags too. I prefer those because they're thicker than what you can get at the grocery store. This is also the place you go to get your free recycling bags but you have to have the letter the city mails out and relinquish it.

"Hi! I’m very new to Reddit and not too sure if I am doing this right but I am a student writer for one of the high school newspapers within the district. While our job for the newspaper is to only report on the news and share honest information with an unbiased tone I can say that a lot of drama not only within the school but within Richardson is funneled through our small staff. Some true, some false

With that being said absolutely do NOT take anything I am about to say as fact.

Recently Miss Stone has stepped down for a multitude of reasons. First being the way she has handled race relations within the district. Around the high schools there have been protests over mistreatment of minorities in the classroom. Stone has been outward about these issues and put together a diversity council of students to try and discuss problems and fix things within the schools. This however has been frowned upon by students as it is seen as “not enough.” On the flip side… the more right leaning political activists think stone has done “too much” and is not “focusing on education.” This has obviously lead to a polarization of neither republican or democratic families to like her. 

While that might be a more well known occurrence in the district, this was nothing new. This has been happening since she signed on. What pushed Miss Stone to the edge was the backlash she received for her mask mandates. Stone was very adamant of safety over all at the school and took Covid-19 very seriously. RISD lifted the mask requirement far after many other districts. This is where all hell broke loose. The democratic side was very upset that the district was no longer serious about Covid-19 anymore and believed we were doomed to repeat digital learning and multiple outbreaks. The conservative side was arguably even more upset that Miss stone disobeyed the order of Gregg Abbot and decided to mandate masks despite his ruling for such a long time. As I have been made aware the hate for miss stone went deeper than “fire stone” signs… I have heard and have VERY close sources confirm that there were constant death threats projected at stone and her family. Out of safety Miss stone decided it was best to step down out of safety for her and her family.

"Some of what you are reading on this thread is inaccurate.

The former board President who is not bound by any confidentiality agreement (because she wasn't there during the resignation) speaks.

It is very much the national irrational denial faction slipping into RISD politics and some on the board letting it happen.

"My wife and I run a nonprofit named HelpingHumanity.life! We're fairly new, but growing fast! Our main service is a FREE online thrift store where we accept donations and then redistribute them for free to families and individuals in need. It's a completely free service!

We also have just started offering Parents' Nights Out where parents can drop their kiddos off for a night of fun at the Explorium in Denton while they go have some time to themselves. This is a paid service, but still about half the cost as other similar programs.

We're having a free Christmas event there on 12/4 from 10-3 where we'll have a Santa giving away gifts for free and a large bin or two of other free gifts parents and kids can pick out. We've been extremely blessed with MANY donations for Christmas, so we hope to have a LOT to give out!

We love what we do and we love helping people, most of all!

"Just an FYI in case you didn’t already know, plugging random drives into your computer is a good way to get a virus. It’s a fairly common tactic to just scatter a bunch of really cheap USBs all over the place, because people find them and naturally get curious.

It’s especially useful for targeted attacks. Let’s say hackers want access to a specific company. All they need to do is scatter a handful of USBs around the company’s office lobby in inconspicuous places, then wait. They basically just cast a broad net and see what happens. Even if 90% of them get ignored/trashed, the other 10% will get them in the door.

Thursdays (?) Popeyes chicken sells a thigh and a breast for $1.50. I think I had Popeyes on Thursdays for a year straight in 2015.

For dates we used to buy the “2 appetizers, 2 dinners, and 2 cocktails” Groupons for random restaurants you’d usually never notice. It was an incredible deal, but Groupon is lowkey trash these days.

The ultimate struggle lunch that’s actually amazing? Central Market and Sprouts bit sell a kids bagged lunch in the front coolers for like $3.50! You get an apple, raisins and a choice of Turkey, PB&J, or ham and cheese sammie. Let’s goooo, sometimes you have to eat out but you just don’t need to spend $15 for lunch.

"Recently “salad and go” has been built in the UTD area. The concept is $5-7 salads that you can purchase through a drive through or app. Really good for healthy, cheap, and fast.

“Pho DK” has really tasty Bahn Mi for $6. Honestly that could last you for two meals. (Another person mentioned Bistro B which is also good)

Starbucks spinach feta wrap is a pretty good choice considering there will always be a Starbucks near you. It’s cheap enough and healthy. 

Chinese restaurants like Jeng Chi don’t look cheap from the menu, but they give big portions. You could make some minute boxed rice and have the Chinese food with rice for a few days. 

Finally, use a friends Costco membership and buy the rotisserie chickens they sell. You could have the chicken with boxed rice or a bed of greens and have a tasty complete meal.

"My wife and I lived there for a few years several years ago (during the transition from Amli). Overall I’d say a pretty typical apartment experience. They raised the rent year after year and getting a repair man to come out to fix stuff was a hassle at times. But other than that we didn’t really have any complaints. We liked having the Mexican restaurant, Starbucks, Walgreens, and gas station right across the street.

The only other thing I can say - and I actually hesitate to mention it because I don’t think it necessarily should factor into your decision - is that the fatal shooting of the Richardson police officer from a few years ago happened at that complex. It was after we had moved out, but it was only two buildings down from the unit we were in.

"I’m not afraid of walking. I walk most of the day, in fact. But most people walk ~20 minutes/mile, (and fun fact, the 7-11 is almost exactly a mile away from the Renaissance Hotel.) If you’re taking a quick 15 minute break from work, you wouldn’t even get halfway there before having to turn around. Not a very **convenient** convenience store, except for the people who live at the Mallory apartments. Unless you suggest I run? Most non-competitive people run about a 10-12 minute mile, so I could probably make it there and back if I *really* pushed and didn’t actually do any shopping. If I put in the time to be competitive on an Olympic level, I might sprint a 4 minute mile, to be able to actually do some shopping and suck some wind before turning around and sprinting back. But that kind of defeats the purpose of taking a break to walk to the convenience store, yeah? Also… In 110° during the summer?

"I lived in Junction Galatyn Park for two years when it was originally Jefferson Galatyn Park. It was a great experience. The unit was brand new when I moved in to it, all the appliances were pretty nice. I enjoyed the area, my wife and I always felt safe walking my dog around even late at night. We often walked down to all the shops and restaurants at Campbell.

Check out the Spring Creek Nature Preserve! It's several miles of well maintained paved walkways through the woods there. It's usually a bit cooler in the woods so even if it's kind of a hot day the nature preserve can still be pretty comfortable for an outdoor space.

As a Stars fan living right next to the train station was great, very easy getting to the American Airlines Center from the train line. If you're going to move there I really encourage you to check out and use the train. Its an easy trip down to Uptown, going up to downtown Plano is great, there's now a lot of stuff happening in Cityline, and it's easy to get to Deep Ellum.

The Wildflower festival is usually around this time of year in that Galatyn Park area. Living right there made it easy to attend.

"I do remember a few months back when cops were parked down the street. They had three or four people cuffed and sitting on the curb. I seem to remember it was something to do with that, or maybe a fight? But yeah, police are rarely here.

Two potential issues: The apartments on the east side of Plaza Blvd (Galatyn Station, Junction at Galatyn) are older, and actually used to be fairly cheap. But their prices spiked when the ones on the west side of the street (Cue) got built (or are still being built? Not sure if they're even done, to be honest,) and were charging ~3x what the east side was. No upgraded facilities or increase in services; The east side simply realized they could charge like 3x what they were before, so they started doing so. So if you're looking at rent, consider the fact that just a few years ago, the prices were only like half or a third of what they are now.

Second issue? There's not a goddamned convenience store anywhere convenient, because the retail spots are notoriously difficult. It sounds like a small complaint, but it gets old after a while. Want a cup of coffee? Get in your car. Want a soda? Get in your car. Want a bag of chips? Get in your motherfucking car. As someone who doesn't mind walking a block or three, it's irritating that there's nothing within walking distance. You can't just pop down to the store on your break. Because the closest 7-11 is on Campbell. And no convenience stores have been willing to open in the area, even though they'd (supposedly) get business from the hotel+venue crowds, the office commuters using the DART station, and all the apartment complexes. For instance, the retail spots next to the Eisemann Center/Renaissance Hotel have sat empty (or had places that were only open for a few months before shuttering because they couldn't afford the rent,) for years. Porta Di Roma is probably the longest something has been there in recent memory, and even it appears to be struggling sometimes. Hopefully some retail at The Cue will bring some new businesses and variety into the area. But as it is currently, it's sort of a desert.

I am very familiar with that area and I know several people who live in and around there and use the PT system. Granted this is anecdotal on my part, so I will call Monday to see what the issue is since I’m now curious.

"Hey everyone!  This is Posie!  She is about 3 months old and she was born to a stray mom.  By the time she was about 4 weeks old it was obvious she was behind her siblings in development.  She was mostly having trouble walking.  Her mom was trying to take care of her but it was getting harder and she was malnourished at this point.  I’ve taken her in as a foster for the time being and she is doing SO MUCH BETTER!  She was diagnosed with very mild Cerebral Hypoplasia (so her back legs are wobbly which does NOT stop her from walking, running, climbing, and using her litter box)!  She is close to totally blind but can probably see lights and shadows (I’m pretty sure her absolute favorite toy is her own shadow that she LOVES to attack and chase)! There is a local no-kill shelter (Take Me Home Pet Rescue) who is working on getting her adopted!  Please feel free to reach out!

"That’s actually fairly common for outpatient procedures. Surgeons are usually only in surgery for a day or two out of the week. The rest of their week is spent doing things like aftercare, follow ups, consultations, etc... So like if a surgeon’s surgery day is Wednesday, they’ll have multiple surgeries scheduled on that day. And that means they don’t want you to take up their surgery bed for an extra 30 minutes, just so you’re finally cognizant enough to order an Uber. After all, you’ll be able to walk around and get into the passenger seat of a friend’s car *way* before you’d actually have the mental faculties to be able to use your phone. 

Easy to say “why can’t they just wait,” but if they waited around for each patient to actually sober up, they’d have massive delays, (or wouldn’t be able to schedule as many surgeries.) Imagine having a dozen surgeries scheduled for the day, then adding an extra 30 minutes of sobering time to the end of each one. You’ve just added an extra six hours of “just sit around and wait” to your surgeon’s day. So instead, they require that the patient bring someone along, to ensure they arrive and leave in safe hands, and without the need for the patient to take up a bed.",t2_5mbyjdg2,KATIE_EATS_POOP,0,1605747822.0,0,t1_gcs55z5,gcs55z5,False,Mobyh,t3_jwpg53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Richardson/comments/jwpg53/help_i_cant_believe_im_posting_this_on_reddit_but/,[help] I can't believe I'm posting this on reddit but I'm out of options,/r/Richardson/comments/jwpg53/help_i_cant_believe_im_posting_this_on_reddit_but/gcs55z5/,3,r/Richardson,0,3
