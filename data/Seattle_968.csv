"What kinds of items do you want to find, OP? I don't mean quality level, but category. A given Goodwill doesn't put out all the items donated there; many get sent to a central processing spot, then meted out to stores depending on which items are known to sell better, where.

For example, in my experience, Ballard and Bellevue Goodwill have the best misc. furniture selection. The Dearborn location (the largest Goodwill in existence) has a huge furniture area, but leans heavily toward chairs. Dearborn also has the best and biggest ""fancy stuff and antiques"" section.

The Goodwill outlets (SODO and Kent) let you dig through bins of very loosely-sorted items at much lower prices.

"I would say yes, though I have full hearing. I have a feeling you already know to watch out for errant cars; they're a problem here as much as any other big city.

The only area I would expressly avoid is 3rd Ave. (runs loosely north/south) between Union (south end), Pike (middle) and Pine (north end). Those two blocks of 3rd get *jammed* with loiterers, and it seems to be a mix of people waiting for the buses there and people just hangin' out for a myriad of reasons, some criminal and some not. I find that walking with purpose and projecting ""I'm on a schedule and going somewhere"" wards off trouble, but with that much of a crowd, my speed is impeded enough that I (male, white, tall) feel very vulnerable.

Generally, walking downtown is safe, if you don't project ""I have nowhere to be"" and you don't stop to talk to the (very) occasional people who try to get your attention. You'll see some panhandlers, but most aren't at all aggressive. If you see anyone hawking newspapers, that's ""Real Change,"" which homeless buy and then resell at a pre-set higher cost, pocketing the difference. It's worth buying and reading.

As others noted, beware that Madison is a fairly steep hill. For that, get off the Link (light-rail) at the University Street stop. You'll come out from under Benaroya, our concert hall. Just south is University St. Two blocks further south is Madison. Benaroya is between 2nd and 3rd (the numbers rise with the slope, higher numbered streets are further east).

"That's a fair question. To clarify, the Federal department of housing and Urban Development gives the guidelines but property management companies make their rules based of of the recommendation. So yes, it is a rule, but that recommendation is how it became the rule. It's also the same guideline that gives mortgage lenders their rules which usually mean mortgage monthly payments including tax and insurance and interest should not exceed 33-34%. 

To take it a step further, you've probably seen verbiage in fine print on applications for all sorts of things from homes to jobs to credit cards that state that the entire application is considered. This means that there are certain parameters in the screening software that give weight to different parts of the application and as long as the parts all equal a low enough risk factor the appl is approved. The variance is small, but $400/month is not a deal breaker for the software when there aren't other factors like extreme delinquency on other monthly installment payments or an extremely high debt to income ratio. 

The software can actually provide 4 outcomes- 1 is aplr with standard deposit, 2 is approved with increased deposit ( usually if there is no credit history or less than ideal credit but good income) , 3 is approved with cosigner (for lack of income) and 4 is denial. Denial usually occurs when there is a deal breaker, like an eviction, certain felonies, or a combo of low credit and low income.",t2_ktzy414u,SkyPointeRealEstate,0,1648276613.0,0,t1_i25yyrn,i25yyrn,False,samethystt,t3_tld8es,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tld8es/landlords_getting_stricter_on_3x_rent_rule/,Landlords getting stricter on 3x rent rule?,/r/Seattle/comments/tld8es/landlords_getting_stricter_on_3x_rent_rule/i25yyrn/,1,r/Seattle,0,1

"> all of W Seattle has one?

West Seattle isn't where the fishing boats come in. That's an especially far-flung neighborhood, too. We have crab, and oysters, and lobster, and clams, and geoduck, and trout, all in a fair amount. Some areas like you named have *ONE* major seafood and, thus, it's the big deal all the shops crow about. Salmon is the closest thing we have to a focus, and most shops do feature that, but they usually sell lots of things... and they don't advertise as ""salmon shops,"" they're seafood in general, which is because we get such a wide variety.

The other thing is, the fishing boats don't come into West Seattle. There are some seafood shops elsewhere (like Mutual Fish in the Central District) but not a lot in West Seattle because it's so, well, disconnected from much of Seattle proper. You'll find most specialty seafood stores within a fairly short distance of where the boats come in. Go to Fishermen's Terminal in Ballard, and what does the big shop in there specialize in? *Salmon*.

"[linking to the study at McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Public%20and%20Social%20Sector/Our%20Insights/Why%20does%20prosperous%20King%20County%20have%20a%20homelessness%20crisis/Why-does-prosperous-King-County-have-a-homelessness-crisis.pdf)

Tell me you didn’t read the study without telling me you didn’t read it. It’s about adding housing to attack the supply side of affordability, not addressing chronic homelessness.

“Economic growth in the region is a leading cause of homelessness.”

“Additional affordable housing stock must be built.”

“Growth is driving homelessness up”

“Additional affordable housing stock is required”

“Rents have grown faster than income in King County, exacerbating pressure on the poorest households.”

“Continue to drive efficiency in the current system”

Here’s the part about permanent supports:

“For homelessness, this could entail increasing shelter capacity or providing mental-health services, meals, or other services. Other short- term actions include improving governance in nonprofits serving the homeless and beginning to form public–private coalitions to advocate for commonsense policies”
 
It’s feeling like a waste of time going in circles with you. You misinterpret information and parrot a talking point, like some undefined fully supportive system with low success outcomes is cheaper than jail, or cite data that’s about ELI housing and stock and claim it has to do with services, or simply repeat the point that housing will solve everything. Attempting to educate you with long, thoughtful comments has proven to not be a good use of my time. If this is unintentional I can only
advise you to seek more information. If it’s intentional, good luck sealioning and pushing propaganda on behalf of whatever agenda you are pursuing.",t2_1sdx7y5,nomorerainpls,0,1648269806.0,0,t1_i25ppe9,i25ppe9,False,widdershins13,t3_tmaym5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tmaym5/many_homeless_people_decline_shelter_offers_by/,"Many homeless people decline shelter offers by city of Seattle, report finds",/r/Seattle/comments/tmaym5/many_homeless_people_decline_shelter_offers_by/i25ppe9/,1,r/Seattle,0,1

"Because when European settlers came to the region the indigenous people were really into salmon and other fish. It was their main source of protein. An entire industry sprung up around it (that later lead to overfishing but that came decades later). Crabs were only in specific places. The Columbia and Snake river run through the entire region and was full of salmon. Also salmon can be perserved for months. I imagine that was a factor too but I’m guessing about that part. There are no “crab boils” but there are several places like 30 minutes drive from Seattle you can go eat fresh salmon caught by indigenous people and listen to the history of the region from their persecution. I imagine they don’t have anything like that in GA do they?

There’s also the influx of Asian cultures that are also heavy fish not into crab cuisine that drive the restaurant culture in the PNW. Basically it’s cultural.

"In addition to the Interstate numbering described in the video, our state system (with the [George Washington head](http://www.aaroads.com/shields/img/WA/WA19700071i1.jpg)) also follows a logical numbering pattern:

Major highways that cross parts of the state have one or two digits, with evens for east-west routes and odds for north-south routes. For example, SR 7 goes north-south from Tacoma to Morton and SR 9 goes north-south from Sumas to Woodinville. These numbers increase going north (for evens) and east (for odds) for the most part, but there's a lot of exceptions to this.

Three-digit routes (and a few two-digit ones) are off-shoots of the major routes and are numbered with the first one or two digits of their parent. So all child routes of I-5 begin with a 5, such as SR 520, SR 522, and SR 525. As with the major routes, the evens are generally east-west and the odds are generally north-south, but there's exceptions here.

A few of the outliers are SR 99 (named for old US 99), SR 16 (which is more north-south), and SR 410 (named for old US 410 and sharing children with SR 16).",t2_66mb7,SounderBruce,0,1648269341.0,0,t1_i25oyrk,i25oyrk,False,Pure-Macaron4321,t3_tnonvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tnonvo/the_driver_entered_405_with_one_foot_out_of_the/,The driver entered 405 with one foot out of the window.

"My reasoning is this:

1) The ratio of cars to trucks on I-5 is in the same ballpark as the ratio of cars to trucks on Seattle's arterial streets.

2) If I-5 was closed, essentially all of the trucks **and** cars that currently use I-5 would use other streets instead.

3) Traffic overall would likely increase a bit on Seattle's arterial streets, but the ratio of cars to trucks would stay about the same.

405 through Renton would still be tricky with the S-curves and freight, but it would keep freight and thru traffic from the downtown core. Those traveling through downtown would be going downtown for a reason, and it would connect Capitol Hill, First Hill, Downtown, and SLU far better than they are today (like the lack of connections between Denny and Lakeview).

"> It was about constrained supply and missing middle housing

This is wrong.  Did you read the section I was referring to?  Here are the first two paragraphs:

> A new unit affordable to an ELI household would cost approximately $325,000 to build, with additional spending for operating and services. Some households can obtain housing through tactics such as diversion and incremental vouchers, and some will require incremental services such as mental and behavioral health on a permanent basis (permanent supportive housing).

> Using a conservative set of assumptions, ending the homelessness crisis in King County would therefore cost between $4.5 billion and $11 billion over ten years, or between $450 million and $1.1 billion each year for the next ten years. To put it another way, ending homelessness in King County would require spending three to five times the approximately $260 million currently spent locally on homelessness and ELI housing in the region.

Permanent supportive housing is a subset of ELI housing.  

> city and county’s investments aren’t really that far off.

Considering the above the report makes it clear that the county's programs are underfunded.  Additionally your rough calculations show a gross gap in currently built PSH units and units needed to to house currently un-sheltered peopled.

Thanks for your hand-wavy analysis without any sources and a link to an opinion piece discussing the opioid epidemic solved through forced treatment.  The article uses an individual who was already housed as the main subject.  Where do you expect people experiencing homelessness to go after completing this program?  Relapse is more likely to occur for low income people who have received treatment[1].  This is why housing first works.  It is a holistic approach.

You also didn't address nor edit your original comment to correct its inaccuracies and misrepresentation of the data, which makes me believe you are doing so intentionally.

"Thanks for supporting my point!  From your article:

>	With over 150,000 vehicles using the corridor each day, the Spokane Street corridor is the most traveled roadway in the city (outside of I-5).  Over time, the combination of marine vessels, trains and vehicle required significant traffic management solutions. 

Pushing all this traffic onto surface streets would be a nightmare, which is why Seattle has invested in limited access roads in this corridor for generations to keep it separated from surrounding neighborhoods.  (And then has subsequently failed to maintain the infrastructure, which is how we’ve ended up isolating an entire community through lack of connectivity.)

Irrelevant Ship of Theseus arguments about what constitutes I-5 are a distraction.

"Engineers who know what they're doing negotiate on salary and have multiple offers in hand in order to have leverage. When companies extend an offer yes they want to pay you as little as possible but they also want to hire you since they spent many people-hours on people who they already pay to interview multiple candidates. It's not worth it to do all that interviewing and end up not hiring anybody time and time again.

I don't think this will lead to large pay ranges for most companies. And in tech I assume most companies will post their real ranges, some engineers will ask for the top pay, and an even smaller group will actually get it while most will be ok with slightly lower pay for, you know, actually getting paid.",t2_44mxl,golf1052,0,1648248973.0,0,t1_i24kqqx,i24kqqx,False,a4ronic,t3_tnnp6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tnnp6r/bill_to_require_salary_information_on_job/,Bill to require salary information on job postings on Inslee's desk,/r/Seattle/comments/tnnp6r/bill_to_require_salary_information_on_job/i24kqqx/,1,r/Seattle,0,1

"> You said posting on Reddit won’t change the situation. Explain the purpose of that statement. 

I said that to a person who stated they were concerned about their sister's safety. Does that clear things up?

>That rhetoric is very common. ‘Why are you talking about it on an Internet forum? Report it to the police and help your sister move.’ 

They made no indication that they were considering the latter, which is why I suggested it.

>We should do both. We should talk about how I am afraid of walking through the parks near my office due to needles, or how the other weekend someone tried to break into my office building with a sawzall.

All that matters is that it should be unacceptable and we should be outraged at the complacency.

"It's more difficult to do in a car than in a semi because there's a lot of slop in a semi transmission that I guess makes it easier.

You can do the first step in your car without risking damage...getting it into neutral. Basically, when you're driving down the road at a steady state, or even accelerating, you take your hand (or even a single finger) and put light pressure on the shifter towards neutral.  Then, gently let off the accelerator and there will be a point where all the pressure between the engine, transmission, drivetrain, and tires just kinda goes away when all the speeds match and you're not accelerating or decelerating. The shifter will gently slip out of gear with very little pressure and into neutral. You will never hurt your transmission doing this. It's arguably just as easy to do this in a car as it is in a semi.

The second step is to get it into another gear. If you want to downshift into a lower gear, you have to use the accelerator to rev the engine up while simultaneously use light pressure on the shifter to gently push it into the next gear. As long as you use light pressure, the transmission *will not* go into gear until all the speeds of everything line up again, and you can feel this happen and push it into gear with a single finger, even in a semi.

If you want to upshift instead, the procedure is the same only you don't have the touch the accelerator as long as you don't miss the shift as the engine speed drops (because you were accelerating and at a high rpm when you slipped it into neutral, then you have to gently push the shifter into the next higher gear as the engine speed drops) If you miss it, you have to rev the engine up again a little bit to get the speeds to line up, but the most important thing is to *never ever force the shifter into gear*. This can damage the transmission, especially if you do it repeatedly. The shifter should always slip into gear easily.

Shifting into neutral is just as easy as a car as it is a semi, but shifting into a gear is arguably easier in a semi for reasons I described above.

In none of the above steps does the clutch ever get depressed...only when stopping does the driver depress the clutch, then releases it when starting out. Truckers call shifting without the clutch ""floating"" the gears.

If you use the clutch when shifting in a semi, you have to ""double clutch""...that is, depress clutch, shift into neutral, release the clutch while the transmission is in neutral, depress the clutch again, shift into another gear, release the clutch. Because the clutch in a semi is rather heavy, and there are a lot of gears (usually at least 10) this gets tiring VERY quickly.",t2_hk75ddma,specializedcatenary,0,1648240656.0,0,t1_i241h2b,i241h2b,False,Pure-Macaron4321,t3_tnonvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tnonvo/the_driver_entered_405_with_one_foot_out_of_the/,The driver entered 405 with one foot out of the window.

Presently, the clearest perspective to entertain is that there is nothing to value. Ignorance may suggest otherwise.

Fear & desire are the illusory fuel sources for causing one to exhaust themselves by running around in circles, in response to interacting with these inevitable encounters.

If I desire no one's company, then perhaps I should become a homeless nomad; like so many others before me.

There is no value in connecting with others.

I have been using Reddit as a means of retort against this inevitable truth.

The infinite quantity of potential interactions, here on Reddit, has dwarfed the potential quality of any single one if them.

There is nothing of value; only humiliating forms of loss & disappointment to be had.

Loss of the extraneous components would certainly be advised. Nobility VS humility, however, is one thing to deeply consider.

"So the city is divided up into precincts and beats and patrol officers are assigned to each beat.
Imagine there are 50 beats that are normally divided between 500 patrol officers who patrol each beat around the clock.

Their presence is a deterrent which is better than sending an armed response to a crime that has already been committed or is in progress. Now imagine de-staffing one or two beats to stick officers at 3rd and Pike. That means no deterrent and delayed response from some other beat, which means new hot spots.

> The drop of crime in the 1990s affected all geographic areas and demographic groups. Table 3 presents the percentage decline in homicide, violent crime and property crime from 1991–2001 by region, urban/rural and city size. In each of these subgroups and for all crime categories, the trend has been downward. Crime declines in the Northeast outpaced the rest of the country, whereas the Midwest was a laggard. The greatest percentage improvements in crime occurred within met- ropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and especially among large cities with populations over 250,000. 

This study goes on to suggest the 4 drivers of the drop in crime were:

1) More police than prior decades
2) More criminals in prison 
3) The decline of the crack epidemic 
4) Legalized abortion

Something has to give with the judicial election system. Judge Rothrock was appointed in 2018 and elected by default when the 2019 election was cancelled (she didn’t even appear on the ballot).

"This is nice in theory-but they passed a law restricting the level of public housing to the level it was at when it was passed.( year 2000 maybe) Considering the current political climate-I doubt it will happen where the number of governmental run units will increase, considering it cited data that the market does it cheaper.  However, in California some municipalities are fed up with the issue and are attempting to more actively solve it but it is costly and also taking considerable time. Another market is attempting to convert old hotels which is another workable solution, but it needs to be ramped up. In my opinion-there has to be greater incentive for the market to solve this-doling out unrestricted vouchers is foolish and costly.",t2_3d2j2t3d,and-through-the-wire,0,1648237334.0,0,t1_i23t9hh,i23t9hh,False,gharrity,t3_tmfoek,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tmfoek/seattles_rep_frank_chopp_moved_2_million_from/,Seattle’s Rep.
