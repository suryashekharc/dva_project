"I asked myself the same question almost 7 years ago when I moved to Woodstock. Remembering home video footage my Dad took on his last day at Westrock (a gypsum mine NE of Woodstock near Drumbo) the voices of his coworkers while talking outside in the parking lot was drowned out by crows being absurdly loud. From that I started looking into it. 

Woodstock is a hot spot for crows along their migratory path. Some North American birdwatching clubs renown Woodstock for its seasonal crow population. Given Pittock’s proximity to fresh water, access to soy beans/corn fields and ample coverage of coniferous trees, Woodstock provides the perfect abundance for survival throughout three seasons while giving them the option to stop by or stay, given the harshness of winter that year. Their numbers in which they arrive consistently reach near 100,000 annually so expect the weaker ones to die off. 

I hope this answers your question.",t2_znakk,jbs43,0,1647422526.0,0,t1_i0v4juj,i0v4juj,True,chefhommes,t3_t7h9nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/t7h9nt/dead_crows/,Dead Crows,/r/woodstockontario/comments/t7h9nt/dead_crows/i0v4juj/,2,r/woodstockontario,0,2

Sometimes you see people with bikes spraypainted because it's stolen.

I've also had a locked bike stolen when I was younger. Both brakes didn't even work, so I didn't even ride the damn thing. I was more upset about the cut lock. 

I mean, if they wanted it I probably would have given it to them.

"All jokes aside downtown Woodstock IS a gross sh*thole. Id aim for the outskirts of town if you can, especially if you have kids. Also Ingersoll is usually got cheaper options and its only 10 mins away and really close to London. Good luck!

Ive heard of several people getting jumped pretty bad downtown. Theres been several stabbings over the years. You can run into these problems in any city or town at night if your by yourself or too naive/careless. 

Woodstock/Ingersoll can be bad for “big fish in a small pond” tough guy mentality. Where as in bigger cities you get a lot more of people just walking past each other with less aggressive eye contact.

"Honestly I have found Woodstock very doable to live without a car in the summer months, in fact in terms of walking it really is not that bad. Over the summer I routinely make the walk from around Brompton Park to the downtown area. Though the sidewalks are often a mess in the winter, barely passable in many areas. The bus system is not terrible but it does lack much of the conveniences of larger cities transportation network as there is no bus going the opposite direction on the same route which means unless you are in a lucky location it can take you 5 minutes to get somewhere but 50 minutes to get home so that it might be faster to just walk home. I don't use the taxis very often, I am low income so the $10 flat fee that they charge as a minimum is not something I can afford to do on a regular basis, the few times I have used them I had no complaints. I prefer Kendall as it seems they use larger vehicles which better accommodates my service dog, but would also be helpful for a shopping trip I would imagine.",t2_23ki8um6,MaplePaws,0,1646502413.0,0,t1_hzh45j6,hzh45j6,True,chirag171987,t3_t7b0z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/t7b0z2/surviving_without_car_in_woodstock/,Surviving without car in Woodstock?,/r/woodstockontario/comments/t7b0z2/surviving_without_car_in_woodstock/hzh45j6/,5,r/woodstockontario,0,5

I think surviving in Woodstock without a car is doable here.  I would recommend a bike so you can enjoy a few more places. I do think it would be a bit more difficult in the winter months.  I would consider where in Woodstock you live and how close to bus service. The bus service here has expanded recently and is quite reliable time wise but service is infrequent (every 30 minutes).  I’ve used Enterprise in Woodstock to rent a vehicle and it was reliable service. I moved from Vancouver and I have always enjoyed a car free lifestyle.  It’s good to see people in smaller communities are considering this. Maybe one day we will even have a car share service. :),t2_5z7ngqjh,burnaby84,0,1646493423.0,0,t1_hzgjbcp,hzgjbcp,True,chirag171987,t3_t7b0z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/t7b0z2/surviving_without_car_in_woodstock/,Surviving without car in Woodstock?,/r/woodstockontario/comments/t7b0z2/surviving_without_car_in_woodstock/hzgjbcp/,2,r/woodstockontario,0,2
"Hello! Taxis are pretty good, prices do tend to differ depending on what area of town you live in. I live in an area where they do tend to get pricier.
For groceries we do have Instacart! I also use SkipTheDishes and Door Dash when I want a meal delivered! If you live north of the river like I do you may have to call in to restaurants for meal delivery since for me the websites tend to say they won’t deliver. There is the enterprise for rental just as the previous commenter said but it’s been several years since one of my family used it.
As for the buses, I use those to get to and from work! An adult bus pass for the month is $60 which is definitely cheaper than using cabs! We now have seven routes and they’ve recently extended to one route out to my area! Now I have a bus stop less than 5 minutes away! Buses come every half hour and I can link you to the website for it if you’d like! A general fare has upped to $2.50 so the monthly pass is great! It even goes right by our main stores!
The buses run from 6am to 10pm Mon-Fri and 8am to 10pm on Saturday. They don’t run Sundays though.

"I haven't lived here in half a decade+ really, but -

Woodstock was a place that I was reasonably comfortable to walk over to the 7/11 alone at like 3 am, even with those random guys that sat in the parking lot all night (do they still do that?) - I'd respect anyone who says otherwise though.

London - not quite so much. There were times after 12 even that I felt pretty uncomfortable on my like 1000m walk home from work. - As a male no less. Eventually I worked like 1200m away from home instead, and my boss would actually drive me home from that job.

Knate, Syd, Canuck hit it pretty bang on though.

While both places -can- have their fair share of sketch. In Woodstock though since the community is smaller, it's a bit less erratic what you get than London?

I will say, while there is less to do, if you live without a Car, I think I actually did more stuff in Woodstock than London since getting around in London without a car is expensive or time consuming. Woodstock's cab service was affordable, and otherwise I just walked everywhere in my younger days.

London is kind of insane to drive in too, compared to Woodstock imho.  


I will say though, Fritzies(West end was my preferred one) and Sebastians are the absolute bomb for greasy delight, something I've struggled to find elsewhere.

"I grew up in Woodstock, went away for school and living abroad, and now I live in London. I agree with everything u/Bitter_Canucks says.

Woodstock is growing like crazy! Schools are overcrowded everywhere. To the North of Dundas are beautiful, old neighbourhoods, and the brand new subdivisions keep expanding further and further into farmland. House prices are skyrocketing and the price of renting is crazy. At it's core Woodstock is a conservative, blue collar city. Times are a changing though...

I truly don't think there are any bad neighbourhoods in Woodstock, but there are rougher ones. The area between Main and Parkinson to the North and South, and Mill and Springbank on the West and East is that part of town. The city isn't doing the best job at addressing the homeless problem in the downtown core and it looks a little sad these days, especially with many empty storefronts. Drugs are a big problem. You will encounter people shooting up and pushing large carts of their belongings around. Fentanyl overdoses are high. That being said there are some awesome business owners trying to revive it and there is a Woodstock BIA.

There isn't a nightlife in Woodstock. Crabby Joes and Charles Dickens Pub are the most popular places to get dinner and drink on Dundas. A lot of the other places are sketchy and have a weird crowd. Upper Thames Brewery has been a great edition to the city. They host live music, and trivia nights. They also have Brickhouse Brew Pub which has a beautiful patio in the warmer months. Both are popular with young and old. Neither are in the downtown, but are worth going to.

Outdoors, there are many golf courses, and walking trails.

Shopping is limited and the movie theatre is old and only has a few screens. It's better to go to London for all of that, but the drive is nothing to me anymore. Theatre Woodstock is a great community to get involved with as an adult or if you have kids. I know there are a lot of adult sports leagues you can join - frisbee golf, volleyball, baseball, hockey, and cricket I think, and I know there is a nerd/board game/DnD scene.

I personally think the activities and amenities in Woodstock are more suited towards kids and families. I had a great childhood growing up and the kids I teach have access to theatre, dance, hockey, soccer, gymnastics, music lessons etc.

That's my two cents.

"I grew up in woodstock, spent 4 years in waterloo then 4 years in london, now back to woodstock

Woodstock is smaller, so its a lot less busy. you can get around a lot faster. less traffic to deal with, less lines, things like shopping go faster. so you end up with more spare time. 

there is a LOT less crime in woodstock than london, be people her complain about it a lot more. there are less homeless and addicts here, but again, people here complain about it more. because its easier to see. 

since its smaller you have less choice on where to go out to eat, drink, be entertained. but there are options. and in the end, london, KW, brantford, heck even toronto, are not that far away.

the BIGGEST difference for me moving back here is the lack of live music. you get the odd singer/songwriter at the brewery but thats about it. woodstock does not have a live music venue at all.",t2_7ed9y,NastyKnate,0,1646346533.0,0,t1_hz8ppad,hz8ppad,True,LXTDHT,t3_t62k4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/t62k4g/question_for_anyone_whos_lived_in_both_woodstock/,Question for anyone who's lived in both Woodstock and London (or a similar city),/r/woodstockontario/comments/t62k4g/question_for_anyone_whos_lived_in_both_woodstock/hz8ppad/,9,r/woodstockontario,0,9
"Woodstock is something like 1/10th the population of London, and has no university. In general, expect things to be quieter and less busy, but also a tad boring if you're used to city nightlife. It's a decent place to live, but if you want to have a good time, you'll likely have to drive to KW or London. We have a couple decent bars/restaurants like Brick House and Upper Thames, but that's about it.

We like to gripe about crime - which primarily consists of theft, vagrancy, and the odd junkie stabbing another over some feud. But compared to London we probably have less ""violent crime"" to worry about. Generally no shootings or gang activity here.

As far as neighbourhoods go, the main places to avoid are downtown and the west end. The area between and around Dundas St. and Main St. seem to be the worst, and that stretches west to Beachville.  This is where most of the theft and vagrant activity seems to happen.

The newer subdivisions on the north end of town (e.g. Havelock Corners) and south end (near the new hospital) are all quite nice, and the area east of Vansittart/Hwy. 59 and north of downtown by few blocks (e.g. Ingersoll Ave) encompassing Devonshire is all generally decent. The east end of town is primarily industrial.

"I've only tried the one on Devonshire once, but I wasn't  impressed. The sauce is good but it masks the blandness of the other ingredients. 

Big Fat Pita on Dundas (might be closed now?) was also disappointing. Bland, tasteless chicken. A pity, since it was within walking distance from my house. 

In spite of being a chain, Osmows seems to very consistently produce a good meal.

"Awesome shot! I always see that district as developing fairly rapidly. Used to be a problem area and now through the city and developers alike, it's a much safer neighborhood. 

For those lurkers wondering - This is taken on the east-end of Dundas facing west. Those two residential towers (by Drewlo) recently went up and are one of the tallest projects in the city. The neighborhood is full of mid & high density residential units; Along with some chain businesses running along Dundas.

I also know that they do have their 2022-2023 season lined up and auditions for the October show (the first in the season) should be in late spring/early summer. In the past, they have announced things in April-May and the first round of auditions should be in June.

"Well glad ya asked! Here in historical downtown, all the locals used to hang out around the fountain, but now they're 20 steps ahead under the stairs of the old museum shooting smack because of a wonderful thing called 'anti-homeless architecture' where they take away benches and stuff.

Take a trip down by the telus phone booth and join some of Woodstock's finest! Before the old coffee shop closed down, many of Woodstock's locals hung around outside trading something other than Pokémon. Now, they sleep in makeshift shacks in the crypts behind said old coffee shop.

In fact, plenty of tourists come from Toronto to observe Woodstock customs, of getting high and stealing stuff from peoples backyards and propping up stashes in the city's forested areas.

"I moved here a year ago. House prices are increasing at about 20% per year, largely due to an influx of people moving here from Kitchener-Waterloo or Mississauga/Brampton. 

Most of the Mississauga/Brampton folks are moving into the newer subdivisions on the north end of town. They're nice (if you like that sort of thing), but plan to spend $700-900K for a house. The people moving out of the GTA have some serious buying power, and prices reflect that. 

The rest of town is a little more reasonable, but it's rare to see anything sell for under $400K anymore unless it's a real bad fixer-upper. There's a lot of nice older homes in the central area of Woodstock that will go for $450-600K; these might need a little maintenance but the neighbourhoods are quiet and mature. 

Generally speaking you can plot out the bad areas by looking at train tracks. Main St., Henry St., James St. Yeo St., etc. This and downtown is typically where you may get some sketchier folks hanging around. The city is gentrifying rapidly though. There's at least two local drug dealers who've been evicted via sale in my neighbourhood in the last year.

As others have mentioned, junkies and theft are an issue here. It's worse closer to the sketchy areas, and police seem unmotivated to deal with it. I think a few more years of gentrification may wipe that out though. 

South end of town near the hospital has a lot of newer developments and these seem to be fairly clean areas. It's also quite a good hospital; my son was born there and I was impressed with the level of care. 

If you really want a truly ""small town"" vibe, it's evaporating fast here. I'd advise looking at something like Tillsonburg, Norwich, Scotland, or Ingersoll as alternatives to Woodstock if that's a priority. That being said, Woodstock has a lot of local shopping options & amenities available, and is very accessible via highway if you drive around a lot.

If you're investment-minded, it's probably not a bad area to buy in. It's expected that real estate in London and surrounding regions will appreciate another 20% this year. People continue to move here from the GTA, and I suspect they'll continue to do so in search of ""affordable"" housing.

I'm not planning to live here forever. But as a first home, it's pretty decent. I'll stay here for 5 years and then hopefully cash out, buy some acreage up north, and raise my kids on a homestead.",t2_7exw74tx,Bitter_Canuck,0,1643002043.0,0,t1_htzgbbd,htzgbbd,True,[deleted],t3_samyiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/samyiy/hello_woodstock/,Hello Woodstock 😃,/r/woodstockontario/comments/samyiy/hello_woodstock/htzgbbd/,1,r/woodstockontario,0,1

">I’m also not that much of a social person so my ‘entertainment’ is very basic 😂

I find people on reddit overvalue things like art scenes and whatnot when in reality I've always found that stuff very niche. It's cool, but if you really wanted to you could always drive to Stratford from Woodstock in about 25 minutes on a regular enough basis. Woodstock is much closer to other cities than Stratford is due to the 401 and 403 proximity.

Tbh anything you might need will probably be here within reason for a town of 50k people.

"The downtown core is where the predominant homeless and drug issues are occurring, particularly since the methadone clinic is right across from the market square and fountain. City council decided the way to address the situation was to remove all benches and places to sit and relax, so that would discourage them from loitering and/or building shelters. Our council, IMO, isn't blessed with the most forward thinking of brains.

The southwest corner of the city has been developing over the last 15-20ish years, so, while it's not as new as the development in both the north east and west areas, it still has relatively new homes and is in close vicinity to the hospital, the local arena, Fanshawe College and Southside Park and the aquatic centre, to name a few. The expansion in the north east area towards the Toyota plant was still in boom the last time I went through that area, and, I feel, is likely the most expensive area to look. There's Cowan Fields there, with several ball diamonds (I believe), but I can't really say what the neighbourhood is like to live in. Nice houses, but I think you can pass toilet paper through the windows between them, that's how close they seem to be built lol.

My favourite section to drive through is on Vansittart Ave. That's definitely the historical part of the city. Lots of beautifully maintained homes from when Woodstock was first growing. And trees... autumn is magical to drive down this street. To buy there, well, unless you have a million or two to spare, that likely won't happen. But there's a nice park there to take in all the beauty around you. South East section has a lot more industrial than residential, which is a mix of older and newer built homes,  especially right off the 401/403 corridor.

Honestly, if you have the chance to go for a road trip,  your best bet is to come for a visit when the weather is nice. The city is still growing both residentially and industrially, so if you pull up Google Maps, find a few points of interest in the area your thinking. Of all the areas, I like and live in the SW section. I'm in a rental situation and most likely will never be able to afford to buy again, but I'm close to all of the amenities I mentioned above, and live in a duplex with a deck and decent size back yard. I'll eventually (hopefully) be downsizing when my kid moves on, but for now, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.",t2_fw6joro,kittykatmorris2390,0,1642959383.0,0,t1_htwjlqw,htwjlqw,False,[deleted],t3_samyiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/samyiy/hello_woodstock/,Hello Woodstock 😃,/r/woodstockontario/comments/samyiy/hello_woodstock/htwjlqw/,3,r/woodstockontario,0,3

"Look into Stratford. A decent art scene, wonderful renown theatre and original live music. The old neighbourhoods near the hospital in Stratford are beautiful. All small towns are a bit difficult to find meaningful friendships and they can be a bit cultish in that respect. Stratford is little bit more expensive and it’s a bit out of the way from the 400 series highways but it is well worth it. If you’re planning on starting a family, the richer culture there would benefit the children. All small towns have issues, but the lack genuine culture and entertainment in Woodstock is very problematic for young people finding their place in the world. Housing is expensive everywhere, so explore more small towns before you invest.

"Woodstock has expanded a lot in the 26 years that I've been living and working here. But, as the other posters have commented, the real estate and rental markets here have gone insane, particularly since the pandemic. There are new builds in the northern part of the city, but those new builds come with hefty price tags. Not to mention bidding wars. Garbage collection services here are on pay by bag fee ($2/bag) even though your taxes should cover that. There is no composting available, and recycling isn't on par with other municipalities. 

There is a good amount of parks and hiking trails for exercise and activities, but you will most likely want to look out of town for other entertainment, once pandemic restrictions ease, as there is only one small movie theatre, several small bars and chain restaurants, providing they survive this latest shutdown. 

For the most part, there is a generally decent small town vibe here, particularly in the older developed areas. The big snowfall we had last week brought out most of my neighbors to help clear the mess, and usually everybody looks out for the other. But there are also ongoing issues with drug addiction, homelessness and stealing, and city council is struggling on how best to approach and handle the matters.

I think I've given you an accurate reflection of the city. Maybe the others can give you more idea on the night life scenario (pre-pandemic, at least), as I'm pretty much a homebody and don't enjoy the bar scene.

"The cheap areas would be the $480k, and they’d sell for ~$550k. (There is no inventory though so the prices go up drastically with each listing). 

Tillsonburg is a smaller town close by, the houses there are more reasonably priced but not far behind and there are downfalls (ie not being near a major highway).

"You sound like a great boss to have at least. Maybe there has been systemic change since the 7 years ago I tried.

The biggest issue I had personally was the hours and sheer disrespect Temps get/got. Some of my ""friends"" have moved up from vutech and such to Toyota. Sounds like a very similar experience from yours. I worked at Tim hortions inside Toyota recently and it (Toyota) gives off the same feeling your describing from vutech. I think the factories have wised up in the last 10 years since temp agencies kinda ruined their reputation. Not without good reason mind you.. Temp agencies are vultures.

"19 is only if vuteq is the one employing you. Most people's experience is at a far less reasonable 12 to 15. Through a temp agency. This is my experience. And 40h a week for 12 h isn't worth the body tole it takes when most can go find a job at Tim hortions or something else that's much less taxing. (yes not all vutech jobs are taxing but even the hours is for some people like myself)

I believe they've slowed recruiting from temp agencies because of this issue.

Im not trying to diminish your experience from my perspective it's the same experience most have that stick it out. But I couldn't handle even 2 to 4 years on the line to get to the better positions that I could do. And as a male they simply don't employ you in an office setting unless you've got some serious credentials. At least college..

"Right because the cost of homes isn’t the real problem. I bought my home 25 years ago as a single mom working at Vuteq as a line worker. If line workers made 100,000/year than you could never afford to buy a car. They would become a luxury and your job would be gone very quickly. That’s not sustainable either. 
Like I said, I’m not arguing fair wages, but if wages go up so will inflation. 
The cost of labor is the most expensive part of any business.
But I’ll leave it at that because you seem to know much more about the cost of labor than I do. 
All the mfg giants certainly aren’t building new factories in Canada. But new ones are going up every year in Mexico. Toyota, GM, Ford, Mazda, Nissan, not one is building new plants in Canada and certainly not in the automotive belt of Ontario, they aren’t creating any new jobs here, they’re all in low labor paying 3rd world countries. 
Even non automotive, those massive shipping containers on the seas coming here from China weren’t always on the water, they used to be on the CN rails moving product within North America. 
Now they just pick up from the ports in Vancouver. 
Inflation sucks, big corps are greedy, the poor suffer, nothing new here, but my point was that Vuteq isn’t too bad of a place to work. When GM was down for almost a year we paid our team members 80% of their wages to sit at home. Vuteq took care of their ppl better than the government did. They try to take care of their team members. They try to develop those who show willingness to learn and want to be better. They pay for education, they give back to their community, they give bonuses, when they succeed they pass that on to every single team member. They offer incentives all the time. 
And it’s pretty easy work. My dad worked in a foundry for many years to carve out a life for his family, labor intensive work, horrible working conditions and ended up with cancer. His company gave 2 shits about him or his family. 
Vuteq bottom line is no different than any other company on the planet. But they do care about their ppl, some ppl are just born with a chip on their shoulder and can’t see the positive in anything. I don’t choose to think like that and perhaps that’s why I found success there for 30 years.",t2_f4lt5,GirlWithTheMostCake,0,1642099983.0,0,t1_hsislxi,hsislxi,False,[deleted],t3_s2z8p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/s2z8p7/tomorrow_i_celebrate_my_30_year_anniversary_at/,"Tomorrow I celebrate my 30 year anniversary at Vuteq, it’s not perfect but I started when I was 21 and it’s been a pretty good place to work.",/r/woodstockontario/comments/s2z8p7/tomorrow_i_celebrate_my_30_year_anniversary_at/hsislxi/,-1,r/woodstockontario,0,-1

"This is how governments of all political parties work- they do everything in the most lengthy and inefficent way. Yet for some reason people keep voting for particular parties that want the government to control more and more. If I was to humour a conspiracy theory, though I'm saying right now I'm doing it more in a joking way, if it's harder to get tested it might encourage a certain group of people to get the vaccine in hopes they wouldn't need to get tested. I say this as someone who is vaccinated and is pro vaccine but anti-mandate.",t2_b5tapk2q,greenalbumposer,0,1637937628.0,0,t1_hm5phmr,hm5phmr,True,Mackinstyle,t3_r29b7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/r29b7y/a_wee_bit_miffed_with_the_covid_test_site/,A wee bit miffed with the covid test site,/r/woodstockontario/comments/r29b7y/a_wee_bit_miffed_with_the_covid_test_site/hm5phmr/,-3,r/woodstockontario,0,-3
"The EMS (ambulance) station near Mill St does on site testing but it's really weird to get an appointment. You call someone and they give you a time period to show up, then you park near the ambulance bays and call a second number to get someone out to do a rapid test. It's stupid but it works.

Might not have to do this soon though because apparently the school is giving my kid 6 rapid test kits to take home for the holidays with no guidance on why because the provincial govts policy on COVID is like a child trying out splatter painting for the first time.",t2_1323pk,eight_ender,0,1637907338.0,0,t1_hm4kgc6,hm4kgc6,True,Mackinstyle,t3_r29b7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstockontario/comments/r29b7y/a_wee_bit_miffed_with_the_covid_test_site/,A wee bit miffed with the covid test site,/r/woodstockontario/comments/r29b7y/a_wee_bit_miffed_with_the_covid_test_site/hm4kgc6/,3,r/woodstockontario,0,3
