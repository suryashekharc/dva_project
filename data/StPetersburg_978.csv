"I thought my position was simple; I apologize if it seemed conflicting. National housing prices increased more in the last 1.5 years than the prior 5 years combined largely because of speculation by investors and institutions. This speculation has been fueled since mid 2020 by several factors including the Fed's ballooning balance sheet (QE to the tune of $3 trillion), low rates, low inflation, and supply chain bottlenecks. The WFH migration did contribute to price increases in certain areas, but to a lesser extent.

That said, in recent months we have seen the Fed's balance sheet shrinking, rates increasing, record high inflation, and the supply chain smoothing out (lumber falling 27% and steel falling 20% off their highs) prompting my opinion that there could be downward pressure on housing prices in the medium-term.

Also, I didn't say ""Never going to go down!"" in reference to Tampa Bay housing. I did however say I believe TB will be ""insulated from most downward pressure on housing prices"" because of its viability. These 500-home developments that are being built in semi-rural areas outside of Salt Lake City, Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ocala, and Boise for instance are as viable. Likewise, expensive sprawling metropolitan cities with high tax rates, homeless, and thousands of office buildings sitting empty are also not as viable.

Just my opinion based on what I see and hear. I'd be curious what you find with non-owner occupied ownership (primarily nationally), so please do share when you get the chance.",t2_a234j,BobertJ,0,1648142669.0,0,t1_i1yefdr,i1yefdr,False,boujeeFett,t3_tfydbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tfydbw/st_pete_announces_major_steps_in_housing/,St. Pete announces ‘major steps’ in housing affordability,/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tfydbw/st_pete_announces_major_steps_in_housing/i1yefdr/,1,r/StPetersburgFL,0,1

"Cities seem to like accommodating tiny portions of the population without giving a shit about the majority of the population but that's just how government is.

"At the start, He helped us narrow down specifically why my pup was itching. We ruled out mites, skin conditions, dermatitis, etc. Then he helped us work on food allergies. We started to find that certain foods caused him to have worse allergic reactions than others so he helped us create a rotating schedule to try different foods, most of which we were cooking, but also substituting different types of kibble.

After a long process we found he was allergic to chicken, pork, wheat, rice, fish, flaxseed, corn products… the list goes on. He was able to prescribe us a Royal Canin IVD prescription diet that was dry kibble either venison and potato or rabbit and potato. And we would add a half can of green of beans and some boiled potatoes to each meal. 

We never went with the medications because The issue was he had too many food allergies for it to really even be worthwhile and we felt bad giving him medication that wasn’t really necessary when all it would take was a careful diet, special baths and some lotions on his paws and belly.

I highly recommend MALASEB shampoo. We Used it on him and it tremendously helped his skin when he would start to get itchy. It is prescription shampoo though just a head’s up!

Also, if he was a sneaky boy and somehow got into something that would make him break out and get itchy, and his nose swell (like chicken), a Benadryl worked wonders to help with the severe part of the allergic reaction. Obviously his were all food related so I’m not sure about allergies that are moreso environmental

Edit: super random, But we had a neighbor with a springer spaniel who underwent so many different allergy tests and treatments and nothing seemed to work.

"Realtor here.

If you're not interested in doing it full time, do something else.  Being a Realtor isn't a side hustle you can do after work in a couple of hours.

The only exception to this would be if you have a huge sphere of influence (friends and family)  and enough trust built with them that they would use you or use who you recommend.  In that case you can refer those friends and family to another agent and take a referral fee, typically in the 20%-30% range of 1 side of the transaction.

The main issue is flexibility.  While the ""sign call buyer for an immediate sale"" is mostly a myth, the truth is that you will have to be available at various times of the day, and it will change day by day.

One week you will have people that can only look after work, 6-8pm.  Next week will be weekend showings, do an open house, then you have showings tuesday at 10am cause they're flying out.

If you want to do it full time, then yes, you can transition from current job to Realtor full time.  But if you just want to make some extra bucks there are way easier ways to do it.

And that's if you're busy, which the vast, vast majority of agents \*aren't\*.  The 80/20 rule is more like the 95/8 rule in Real Estate.  The misconception is that you get your license and friends and family fall over themselves to buy or sell a home immedately, the broker is there with perfectly manicured prospects for you to work, and the entire process is easy, open a few doors, get some signatures, and fat checks roll in effortlessly.

The truth is that while it can be lucrative, the industry overall is like trying to straighten 2 day old spaghetti to go back in the box.  It takes time (months to years) to learn how to be effective at it.  Why?  Because each agent HAS to be their own business.  Meaning you are responsible for marketing, sales, process, quality assurance, and accounting.  And the broker provided leads (if any) are probably zillow / trulia purchases that go to 30 other agents across the area.

The only shortcut through that is to join a team (which I am currently looking for Realtors both listing and buyers agents to join my team on both sides of the bay currently if anyone is reading this is interested).

But the problem there is teams usually want an agent that is committed, meaning full time or with a set schedule.  An agent only interested in doing stuff after work is little use because most of the major stuff happens 10-5, 7 days a week, with paperwork and contracts occassionally going  later into the evening.

Your thought about saving closing costs is also a little off.  Funny enough, the state classes for licensing doesn't even cover the contract or listing agreement everyone uses, but here's the brief overview.

Listing agreement is between property owner and Brokerage, and it sets commission both for the listing agent and the buyer's agent on a transaction.  So listing agent is getting their commission no matter what, and title company and the state via taxes are also getting their closing costs from you as the buyer, and one of the other main chunks is lender origination and prepaids (basically paying for property taxes and insurance for the month up front).

So what you \*may\* save would be the 2%-3% buyers agent commission which would go to you or you could maybe apply towards the purchase, however that is highly dependent on the Broker.  After all, brokers make their money either off commission split with you or via transaction fees.

Plus, like I said, the licensing classes cover absolutely NOTHING about the contracts, how they work, how to successfully negotiate, how to make sure you're protected.

Anyways, it's not a cakewalk, it's an actual profession.  Only go through the hassle of getting your license if you actually have a passion for it.",t2_16nkgp,GreatThingsTB,0,1648082873.0,0,t1_i1ve6le,i1ve6le,True,Shmeklenburg,t3_tkhfva,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tkhfva/obtaining_realtor_license/,obtaining realtor license,/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tkhfva/obtaining_realtor_license/i1ve6le/,5,r/StPetersburgFL,0,5

"I would be shocked if you, as a Realtor, openly admitted that the market is rife with speculation. The fact is that we all know that the WFH migration alone cannot account for 39% annualized price growth. While there are people relocating by choice because of WFH, you simultaneously have *less* people relocating now for new jobs due to remote work capabilities. Dovish monetary policy and supply chain breakdown have had a much larger impact on the supply-side of the market. The widely-held perception that housing is drastically undersupplied has actually *encouraged* accelerated investments. When there is unlimited free money and limited supply of new housing, it would obviously incentivize speculation from market makers. There's a reason RE Investment Companies have been on a buying binge for the last 3 years; because they're aware there is little to no downward pressure on pricing. On top of that, RE is leveraged and when a leveraged asset increases in price, so does your buying power. Literally every ingredient was there to cause a run on housing the last 3 years.

I believe that the Tampa Bay area is a very viable market and therefore will be insulated from most downward pressure on housing in the next couple years (higher rates, inflation, supply chain clearing to increase supply, WFH migration concluding, people who refinanced at 2.75% not wanting to move, etc.). We will at-most see supply equalize. The markets that are going to get hit are rural suburban communities that speculators have flooded the market with.

Hundreds for the course, fee to take the exam, then licensing fees to the state, background check, hundreds in realtor dues, hundreds in fees to hang your license at a brokerage, hundreds for E & O insurance, and hundreds for services needed to find and show houses (MLS and Supra), etc. You can see how this adds up to thousands before you'll ever see a commission check. Plus it may not be worth all that when your main motive is to save on the purchase of a home, because the seller pays both sides of the realtor commissions at closing. I can see how it would be nice to get paid a commission on the purchase of your home, but it may be a wash with how expensive it is to get licensed, depending on the purchase price of said home.

"Having previously rented a house by owner, I can tell you it's a nightmare to get out there.  The major services like [apartments.com](https://apartments.com), zillow, etc are pretty cost prohibitive when you just have a single door to list.  

The end result was that the best method to attract renters was literally just putting a big ""for rent"" sign out front.  

It was a long time ago for me, but it worked well, and in this current housing situation I imagine it's working even better for places for rent by owner. 

Granted that telling you to drive around all of St. Pete looking for signs in front of houses isn't a great answer.

"The Hilton on central is nice. It’s a TRU by Hilton and it’s between the edge district and grand central district so you are sort of close to the middle of the Central ave corridor with all the good food of grand central to your west, the pier and the cool bars to your east all within a walk and the trolley to the beach is right outside the hotel. 

Smaller boutique hotels closer to the center of downtown like the Cordova, Avalon, Indigo are another option. Some are charming and closer to the nightlife but that whole area is relatively safe, well trafficked locations and shouldn’t be a problem so long as you use your head. Fine to walk around, do t pass out drunk on the sidewalk though, probably not safe. 

Crackhead areas to avoid like the greyhound station is close to 31st and central, always weirdos hanging around there. Some sketchy areas south of central avenue but it’s all neighborhoods so there isn’t really a reason for you to wander that direction on foot.

"Seconding a lot of what u/rgordill2 said: the best thing about DnD is that, while there are base rules, there is no incorrect way to play.  Everyone has different play styles, but at the end of the day, you are part of a cooperative group that is working together with a dungeon master (DM) to build out a colorful story.  What's in that story--how it starts, continues, and ends--is 100% completely up to the people at the table.  

People who are new to the game do not ruin the experience, so long as they are willing to immerse themselves into the story just like everyone else.  It can be a bit daunting to learn all the base rules (which are mostly there to provide at least SOME structure to the game) but honestly, the best way to learn is by doing.

"Places with cheap rent tend to not advertise anything online and are harder to find but if you make use of google maps and street view then you can find lots of apartments and trailer parks are don't have websites or information online. Houses and trailers outside of trailer parks are a bit harder to find this way but that's been my method and it worked out good.

I would spend free time for an hour or two on google maps and seemingly randomly find apartments and trailers and I would look at reviews and street view then if still interested I would add them to a list. If there was a phone number I'd add that and any info I could find. Call ones that actually will answer the phone and give info over the phone but some places are stupid and want people to come in person just to answer simple questions.

I guess they believe if they get you in person that they can more easily sucker someone into renting from them. That's pretty much the best method I've found for finding cheaper rent without settling for something dumpy. Cheap rent does not always mean dumpy or in bad neighborhoods. Some of the landlords that rent cheap are maybe just old school and are no good with internet or something but offer cheaper rent than others.

The problem with just going online to zillow, [apartments.com](https://apartments.com), craigslist, etc is that many trailer parks are owned by the same company and don't care to offer cheap rent. Many apartment complexes are owned by one company as well. The ones that don't have websites and don't advertise are often the ones offering rent cheaper than the rest. It can be a lot of work and a lot of time spent but if you need to find something for a cheaper price then it is definitely an option with results.

It can take days or weeks or longer to find enough places to put on a list but once that's done and places with phone numbers are called, in my past experiences I would just add them to google maps and go in person to each until I found what I was looking for in the desired price range. I personally don't care for having to do shit this way because it makes me feel like it's the 90s all over again but it is the best method I've found for finding good places for rent with cheaper rent than others.",t2_q7l447a,southbeatz11,0,1647881842.0,0,t1_i1ju8ma,i1ju8ma,True,upsidedownwillett,t3_tjfk5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tjfk5t/rent/,Rent 🙄😪,/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tjfk5t/rent/i1ju8ma/,10,r/StPetersburgFL,0,10

"Realtor here.

You should be asking your Realtor these questions.

Is it a good reason?  The answer is depending on the time of the contract doesn't matter if its a good reason or not.  With the inspection period on most typical contracts buyer has sole discretion to determine if the property is suitable to use.  They don't even have to give you a reason.  Past the inspection period?  Well that's where things get spicy.

Did you disclose the pool before they put the contract in?  If you didn't well.....

A buried pool is a bit of a blight on the property as any future improvement is going to have to deal with that, plus it screws with soil drainage.  Obviously the house won' fall down if it's filled in but there's a reason why demo is the proper way to deal with it.

"I’ve posted this about Fusion apartments before, so just a copy & paste:

My experience is dated by a few years but the turnover in property management several times, created a place where things didn’t get taken care of and very poor communication overall. The towing company patrolling the parking garage relied on predatory tactics; even towing a car despite the fact it had a parking permit sticker. Speaking of parking, there are very few guest parking spots (for the number of apartment units) in the parking garage. Good luck having someone come over and park if there is a baseball game next door or on a Friday night; people have waited, in their car, 45+ minutes for someone to pull out guest spot (street parking fills up pretty fast on game nights and weekend nights). Also, in case you don’t  already know, parking permit to park in the garage doesn’t guarantee you a spot; you’ll need to pay even more for a specific parking spot.

"Run a credit check.   There are services that cost between $25 and $50 a shot.  It's something you can pass along in a non-refundable application fee. 

You will quickly weed out the craziest people by how they explain their credit scores.   Bad credit from a circumstance such as a hospitalization or divorce, is pretty easily explained.  But people with chronic late and missed payments often have every excuse in the book and every one else to blame but themselves.   Guaranteed you will wind up being one of those people they blame.

"Realtor here.

The solution you are suggesting is already the current state of things.

1) Unoccupieds can't be homesteaded.  So they get nailed with full tax increases every year until they sell it.

2) Rentals, again, can't be homesteaded and so get nailed with whatever tax increase the county wants to throw on them.  They are not protected.

3) Flips don't need levies.  I can't believe I need to point this out but people improving property in rapid succession for resale is \*a good thing and net positive\*.

4) The literal definition of the Homestead Exemption is to protect homeowners from tax increases and give them a discount for owner occupying.  Which typically is around 70%-80% of most neighborhoods in the area.  


Also it's way more of the mass migration and shifts than speculation.

"AMI is Area Median Income - it's pretty much the starting point for affordable housing.  That is 72,700 annual income for Pinellas County.  That number changes some based on Family size.

Very Low income >30% AMI
Low income 30-60% AMI
The apartments listed in OP's original article were geared to those income categories.  The maximum rent anyone living there will pay is $600/month for a 2 bedroom.  Everyone's rent will be slightly different because the rents are based on someone's income.

60%-120% AMI is considered workforce housing.  Most of what the City is doing for folks in this category are construction bonuses.  If the zoning for a piece of land allows me to build 100 luxury apartments and I agree to provide a certain % of units to folks in those income categories, the City will give me a bonus and let me build 112 units which spreads the cost of the whole building among more units so I can rent them for a lower amount

THere are 1st time homebuyer programs if you fall below 140%AMI The City will loan you money at 0% interest to pay closing costs and your down payment.  The lower your AMI, the more the maximum they will loan you - but $60,000 is the max you can get at 81% AMI (loans can be made to people making lower incomes if they qualify for the loan).  Let's say you got the full $60,000.  It would be a 2nd mortgage that you pay back at $259/month for 20 years.  But once you've paid back for 10 years, they will forgive the balance of the loan ($30,000)  If you didn't get that money, having a higher mortgage of $60,000 would be an additional $109,000  in payments over the life of a 30 year loan
