"I've stayed in Madison (during pandemic) and Grant (pre-pandemic).  I've never stayed in Canyon.

Madison and Grant are both nice, the main differences being related to size and amenities.  Madison has flush toilets in each camping loop, a very small store with some of the bare basics for camping and fewer sites.  It is closer to the main road, so road noise is very prevalent.  Grant has flush toilets in the campground loops plus showers and laundry facilities near the entrance.  It also has a well-stocked store (food and souvenirs), access to the lake, a pricey hotel, restaurant, better cell service (if that's important) and many sites.  It's much closer to the feeling of a typical private campground in terms of amenities.  The showers and laundry are re-opening this year.  So if those are important to you, then Grant is where you'll want to be.

Both are well-located in terms of the main attractions of the western side of the park, though there are many road closures and lane reductions throughout the park this year.  One of those lane reductions is around Old Faithful.  If you spend more time around Old Faithful and north of there, then Madison might make more sense due to the construction.  But since part of your trip includes time at Canyon, maybe the time you spend in the more southern end of the park would be best spent at Grant.  That would give you faster access to points south of Old Faithful, including the Tetons.

"The issue is bandwidth more than coverage. There is some coverage in Canyon Village (AT&T and Verizon) from a tower on Mt. Washburn, but there is extremely limited bandwidth to that tower. Using that tower at 6:38 a.m. one day in August last year while in the backcountry, I pulled 1.27 mbps download / 0.06 mbps upload, and it would have gotten worse through the day as people woke up. You don't have a prayer if you're trying to VPN into your company system.

There is absolutely no coverage, from any carrier, at Madison.

If you drive out to West Yellowstone or Gardiner, there is plenty of bandwidth and good coverage for Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile.

With the possible exception of Mammoth Hot Springs, the bandwidth issue is the same for all areas in Yellowstone with coverage (Lake, Old Faithful, Grant, and the areas that get coverage from Mt. Washburn).

As I recall, Mammoth Hot Springs has Verizon coverage from a tower that is in the park, but AT&T is via roaming on Union or weak spillover from down the hill in Gardiner. In Gardiner, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile all have good coverage.

From Madison, you could drive about 2/3 of the way to West Yellowstone and probably have useful signal from outside the park. In normal conditions it wouldn't take more than half an hour. But if there is a buffalo on the road ... who knows.

I believe that the wi-fi at the hotels will have the same bandwidth issue, but don't know that first hand from recent experience. It was horrible when I stayed at Lake Lodge back in 2019.

Someone in the comments mentioned Cooke City. There is absolutely no cell coverage in Cooke City either. When I stayed there in 2020, I got about 2 mbps download in my hotel.

"First, I am relatively price insensitive and we stayed at several in park lodges like old faithful and canyon. Second, the prices for groceries inside the park general stores were high enough for me to take photos of the prices. $7 butter! $12 for bacon! Selection was small. 

We brought a cooler and a portable dual propane stove along with camping kitchen gear, buying groceries outside and inside the park. We flew into bozeman and there is a costco next to a target next to a super market. 

We eat meat, but we also made pasta, omelets and pancakes, grilled cheese sandwiches, noodle soup, crepes (pre mixed at home and just add egg and water), those camping dehydrated food packs from rei, etc. Was part of the fun since then restaurants in the park last summer were sad. Every meal we bought I regretted it, including eating in the old faithful dining room. There are lots of beautiful picnic grounds. We never had issues finding a table. My wife bought a fancy tablecloth from one of the general stores.

There is also a grocery store in gardiner which is very close to mammoth so perfect from madison on your way to slough. Otherwise cody and west yellowstone are serious roundtrip drives. Jackson if you are down there also has grocery stores including a whole foods (and I am sure vegetarian friendly restaurant options).

The cowboy cookout was lovely including the horseride - but if I was vegetarian I wouldnt have been thrilled with the food. Budget permitting, there are other horse riding options. It is thrilling to ride a horse inside the park.

Our 7 year old enjoyed identifying different types of animal poop (especially in the area around slough).

"Not to rain on your parade, but it sounds like a very frustrating way to experience Yellowstone.  Even with an early start, you're going to need to be heading towards reliable service by 8:30 or 9:00 with traffic, bison jams, etc.  You said you'd work until early in the afternoon.  Say you're done at 2:00.  Now it's going to be 4:00 until you get back to the things you want to see.  You'll essentially have two round trips per day.  So you'll end up commuting for work more than actually enjoying the park.    


I guess the only redeeming part of your plan is that sunset will be late, so you will have quite a bit of daylight after your work day.

"Check the average night time temps for your stay and make sure they have a bag that can handle it; layers can also be good for staying warm after the sun goes down.  

Stock up on your groceries outside the park.  A lot more limited inside.  But Madison is also very close to West Yellowstone, which has stores - you can make a run there; just time it so it isn't when there is a lot of gate traffic (I'd assume later in the afternoon is better but not sure).  

An important factor in seeing the sights is hitting the road early.  Get up and go; the traffic picks up later in the morning.  So pack easy to eat things like breakfast bars and such (or quick oatmeal to eat in the car).  But you'll be able to see all the big sights in that time frame (and get in some hikes).

"Sounds like a good chunk of time! Madison campgrounds has bathrooms with electricity and flush toilets but no showers. Slough has vault toilets. Showers are available at Canyon campground, in Gardiner, MT at the laundromat, and the Mammoth Hotel and Old Faithful Inn used to have pay showers for campers but I'm not sure if they'll be doing that this year. You can call Yellowstone National Park Lodges reservations and ask. For a lot of folks the Old Faithful ones were convenient- just take your shower stuff and a change of clothes when you go to Old Faithful. 

Be sure to stop and get groceries outside of the park- if you're coming from the east you'll probably stop at Cody (East gate), Billings (if coming from the NE- don't wait until Red Lodge for groceries), or Livingston (closest big grocery store to the North entrance. Gardiner has a good grocery too, but Livingston has better selection) . All of those will have good grocery stores to stock up. Gardiner has a better grocery than West Yellowstone, so if you need to restock while you're in the park I would head out to Gardiner, just 15 minutes north of Mammoth Hot Springs.

"I was last there in summer 2020, so maybe the selection would be better now, but there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot in the way of fresh produce in the park.  There was always some kind of fruit, and a display of some things like tomatoes and onions.

Bread, granola bars, cheese, all manner of canned food, eggs, condiments, peanut butter and jelly etc. were all available in the park, but last long enough you should buy them outside.

I‚Äôve never tried pro cook vegetarian in camp, but I‚Äôd probably lean on beans.  Dry beans take a long time to cook and camp gas isn‚Äôt cheap so go for canned.  Chili is an obvious choice, and you can cook cornbread right on top of the chili in a dutch oven kind of like a pot pie.  Measure out your spices and cornbread ingredients in advance (or use a box of jiffy) and bring it ready to go.

Eggs last for a long time out of the fridge too.  Hard boiled for lunch/snack if you‚Äôre into that, and obviously they work for breakfast.  I‚Äòve wanted to dump a jar of salsa in a pan and then crack in some eggs for a quick shakshuka, but haven‚Äôt tried it yet.

Sweet potatoes can be wrapped in foil and cooked in/by a fire, or the canned kind can just be warmed.  Canned greens are a good source of some nutrients, but try them at home first to find a recipe you like (maybe cooked with onions and tomato paste).

Mushrooms seem like an obvious choice too, canned.  Put them in the chili or whatever else.

Macaroni and cheese made with velveeta is easy too, though probably not enough protein alone.

"It looks like your questions about food wasn‚Äôt answered yet.

The general stores inside the park have everything you‚Äôd need at a price, so I‚Äôd highly recommend bringing as much as you can from home and stopping at the last real grocery store in Cody on your way in.  A decent cooler will keep meat cold enough for your first two days, then you can buy more at the general store or eat spam and peanut butter.  Let me know if you need any suggestions for food/meals.

The general stores also close pretty early - on our last visit we would visit the store closest to the sights we were seeing that day, rather than waiting until we got back to the one closest to our campsite.

&#x200B;

As for the other stuff - no one is going to complain about the smell, but it is nice to be able to clean up a bit.  For only 4 days I wouldn‚Äôt bother using the showers, but a washcloth can go a long way.  You definitely do not need to rent an RV and I wouldn‚Äôt put this off.

Almost a necessity in my opinion, but if you're out socializing and enjoying the park you may forget about the online world, which is wonderful. Bring books, movies, and board games. It's easy to meet people, and the rec centers host various sports and even movie nights.

I'd ask what COVID precautions are currently in effect. There may be limitations to how many visitors can enter your dorm room. Xanterra was more strict than local governments regarding mask mandates, but I wouldn't be surprised if even they have relaxed some with CDC's guidance in the last month or so.

If you're willing to say what location/department you'll be working for, I'd be curious. I was in Mammoth Reservations but knew people in many other departments. Didn't know many NPS or Delaware North people though, just in passing. 

Many people are cynical about Xanterra but I found it alright. Short staffing in past years exacerbated issues, especially with the lack of international workers (J1 visas). Hopefully they'll be back. It's fun working with people from all over the world, they definitely add to the liveliness of the park.",t2_7p4sa432,ynpdude100,0,1647988375.0,0,t1_i1q048x,i1q048x,True,madydoesthings,t3_tk7wzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/tk7wzj/working_at_yellowstone_this_summer_what_can_i/,Working at Yellowstone this summer what can I expect?,/r/yellowstone/comments/tk7wzj/working_at_yellowstone_this_summer_what_can_i/i1q048x/,3,r/yellowstone,0,3

"Are you used to driving on ice covered, barely plowed two lane mountain roads that were built by the WPA in the 1930s where there is no cell reception to call for a rescue?  Tow is $700.00 and will take several hours for them to get to you, btw.

Do you have clothing and the experience to handle sub zero temperatures?

Almost everything is closed and only one road is open. And, that road is only open because it is a US Hwy that is the only way for Cooke City residents to get supplies in the winter because the Beartooth Pass is not plowed until Memorial Day -- not to give tourists a place to drive in the winter.

It's beautiful in winter and there are far less tourists. Lamar is stunning in winter, also Cooke City is a winter paradise.

It's also one of the most extreme places you can go in winter as the entire park is at altitude.  Tourists are CONSTANTLY getting in over their heads and needing to be rescued. 

I drive through the park to Cooke City every week and in three years have witnessed hundreds of cars -- including tour guides -- that have slid off or had terrible accidents.  It still blows my mind that the park lets tourists drive right by the ""snow tires required"" sign in Mammoth in bad weather in little rental cars that have no business on that road.

Unless you have lived in the mountains and have experience and the right vehicle to drive in very difficult conditions, OR have the money to hire a guide to take you through the park in their vehicle --- January is NOT the time to visit.

So in you‚Äôre set on staying inside the park, Mammoth is for sure the best option. Easily accessible from Gardiner, and you can drive to many of the attractions in the northern part of the park pretty easily. Getting to the interior of the park though would either require a snow coach tour, snow mobile tour, or cross country skiing/snowshoeing. 

If you‚Äôre not dead set on staying inside the park, I would recommend checking local Airbnbs in Gardiner. We stayed at a cozy cabin about 5 minutes from the northern entrance to the park, and it was extremely reasonably priced, it was close to town should you need groceries or toiletries, and there was a gas station nearby that was good for grabbing snacks and drinks for the road. 

As for the park itself, it is *COLD.* While we were there, the temperature never once went above freezing, and some nights and early mornings the temp (before even factoring in wind chill) was in the negative double digits. If you‚Äôre okay with that and are ok wearing 4-6 layers of clothes, you‚Äôll love it. The park is generally sparsely populated this time of year. Sure, you will definitely see other park visitors and the occasional roadside convoy stopped to look at wildlife, but compared to how it usually is in summer, the park is dead in the winter. 

One thing we found nice about this time of year is it seemed to make it much easier to spot wildlife from a distance as they stood in stark contrast to the bright white snow.",t2_c2x6vy,Yondu_the_Ravager,0,1647914838.0,0,t1_i1m0xkn,i1m0xkn,True,matcroberts,t3_tjojc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/tjojc9/my_wife_and_i_are_thinking_about_visiting_for_our/,My wife and I are thinking about visiting for our 10 year anniversary.

"It‚Äôs very cold but beautiful. My favorite time of year to visit. We snowshoe, XC ski, backpack but you don‚Äôt have to do that. Winter is a special time because there are fewer people and the wildlife come down to lower elevations so you see all kinds of wildlife. 
The road is open to Cooke City and it‚Äôs plowed once or twice a day, so I‚Äôve never felt unsafe driving on it. 
Lamar Valley is great for watching wolves and other wildlife. 
You can take the snow coach to Old Faithful. 
There‚Äôs snowmobiling from West Yellowstone. XC and snowshoeing from many places. Sometimes we backpack and stay in the backcountry, but we are very experienced so that‚Äôs not an option for most people because Yellowstone is brutally cold in winter. 
But it‚Äôs magical. We usually stay at Gateway Yellowstone in Gardiner. Some of their units have kitchens so we cook most of our meals. Grocery store is just across the street. 
We usually fly into Bozeman and rent an SUV, and stay a night in town coming or going.  
Gardiner has limited restaurants and such in winter but there are enough open. 
We once ate nearly every meal at Wonderland Cafe when we were camping and it was cold rainy and snowing some and we were too cold to sit outside, cook & eat. They were kind and accommodating and the food was yummy.

"My wife and I got to Yellowstone every year, have for the last 30 years. We always go out on our own, with maps and information from the ranger stations at YNP. There are plenty of areas that you can do solo and perhaps enjoy more by getting closer to nature. That being said, I would NOT recommend backcountry hiking solo in YNP, even for the experienced.

So, from April 15 to May 6 around half of the park will not be accessible, but the big sights will be.  You‚Äôll have to stay in Gardiner or West Yellowstone, which are the closest towns to the park anyway.  Gardiner is very close to Mammoth which has thermal features but not the big geysers, West Yellowstone is closer to Old Faithful, Grand Prismatic, and most of the other geysers.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if many of the trails are still covered in snow.  The roads should be plowed, but drifts may form in some places.  The roads headed to the park equally so.

There likely won‚Äôt be much in the way of crowds, but I think you‚Äôll be limited in what you can do.

"There are a lot of good suggestions here.  One big consideration is the size of the rig you'll be driving around the park.  If you're driving your RV around, you will find parking to be extremely difficult at many areas, especially midday (10:00 - 4:00 or so).  Grand Prismatic is almost impossible with an RV.  Mammoth would be difficult.  Old Faithful probably isn't too bad because there is so much parking space.  Many pull-offs will be too crowded to fit an RV.  So if that's what you're driving  around the park, then the suggestions to be out very early are not just a suggestion but necessity.  (I don't drive an RV, so these are just my observations.)  

I'll second the comment about seeing Old Faithful at night.  I've seen two eruptions over the years during full moon and it's one of the most amazing things you'll ever see.

"As others have said, there is a lot of things to see in Yellowstone so you'll have to decide what you want to do.  The park roads are primarily a figure 8, and you'll be on the east side of the bottom loop.

From Fishing Bridge you are really close to Hayden valley - I'd do that one morning on the way to Canyon and/or Mount Washburn (I really like Mount Washburn, but maybe that's because the road was closed on my last visit so I've built it up in my memory).

Obviously you should go to Old Faithful, and probably lower geyser basin to see Grand Prismatic (hiking to the overlook, out and back from the Fairy Falls Trailhead is probably worth it).  You could either get to those by going out and back on the southern most part of the road, or make it part of doing the whole southern loop.

I like Mammoth, but it's a bit of a drive and with only 4 days I'd forgive you if you skipped it.  If you want to see loads of thermal features, Mammoth plus upper, lower, and midway geyser basins are the places to go.  There's also Mud volcano by Hayden Valley, West Thumb Geyser basin, and Norris Geyser Basin.

The Lamar Valley, reached by going North and then breaking off the figure-8 to the East, is another great place for seeing wildlife.  Hayden has tons of buffalo, but Lamar might have a bear or if you are lucky a wolf.  Go early or late for most animal sightings.

I would plan to see a sunset one day from Steamboat point or Sedge bay.  It's not too far from fishing bridge and will be nice to watch the sunset over the lake.  If you weren't staying at Fishing Bridge I wouldn't bother, and might instead see a sunrise at West Thumb or Bridge Bay.

I think if it was me I'd do:

* Southwest to Old Faithful and Grand prismatic etc
* North - Hayden in the morning, canyon middle of the day, Lamar a bit before sunset
* A hike somewhere - maybe Avalanche peak, Storm Point is very short, or a longer one to Turbid lake is all pretty close to Fishing Bridge.  Find out if any of those areas are closed for bear activity though - I think they may be in the spring (but I think Fishing Bridge Campground is closed then too).
* Mammoth - see the elk herd, some of the thermal features up there, get some park history at Fort Yellowstone.",t2_frz4y,Regulators-MountUp,0,1647599551.0,0,t1_i14xfkk,i14xfkk,True,Ok_Communication9243,t3_tgpjox,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/tgpjox/fishing_bridge_rv_park_we_have_reservations_there/,Fishing Bridge RV park.

"There is - at most - two options to get to any attraction from the Lake area.  And usually there is one that is going to be a lot more direct. 

Sunsets and sunrises in the valleys - Hayden and Lamar - are the best times to see wildlife.  Those are also times of low traffic. Mid-day is going to be the worst.  If you can, I'd say be up early and get going.  If doing Hayden valley (the closest to you), do that for sunrise, and then get to your furthest point (or possibly the one that will be most popular, so you see it with the fewest others around), and then work your way back.  If it makes sense, be back at your park at mid day and have a siesta, and then have a second shift in the afternoon / evening.

"Do you have any attractions you specifically want to see?

If it were me, I‚Äôd pick one main thing I want see each day then make it my priority to get there as early as possible. Once you get it out of the way you can kind of leisurely make your way back to home base and stop at whatever on the way. 

I would personally do something like:
Day 1: Drive through Hayden Valley and try to spot some wildlife. Hit up Canyon Village and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone since it‚Äôs relatively close. 
Day 2: Drive through Hayden Valley at dawn and continue all the up north to Lamar Valley. Stop for any cool animals or attractions on the way. Try to be in Lamar Valley for sunset but if your not comfortable making the long drive back in the dark then try to time it so you are back in Hayden Valley for sunset instead. 
Day 3: Get to Grand Prismatic as early as possible, hit Old Faithful on way back and spend rest of day walking around. 
Day 4: If you aren‚Äôt tired of driving yet, drive up to Mammoth then back down the west side of the park and stop for attractions along the way. If you‚Äôre tired of driving then just stay around the lake for a day and relax on your final day of the trip. 

It really depends if you are looking to see wildlife, landscapes, geysers or do some hiking.  I tend towards wildlife watching so my itinerary skews towards that a bit. 

If you do end up near the Tower-Roosevelt area around sunset, drive a bit west to the Petrified Tree. There is a little road to the tree and I have never failed to see a black bear there at sunset.

"Guess where Montana's laws about hunting and wildlife management came from...not the state wildlife biologists. 

And if a wolf spends 95% of its life in Yellowstone, where it is likely to become much more habituated to people (there are more people in Yellowstone than wilderness areas in the rest of the state), what would you call it? If a wolf has been collared for research in Yellowstone National Park, what would you call it? The population is doing great overall, yes. The hunting numbers across Montana are about on par with other years, yes. But 25% of Yellowstone's wolves were harvested this year. Those wolves are worth literally millions of dollars alive in terms of the scientific value they offer through research and the positive economic impact on the local tourism economy. 

Up until this hunting season, Montana had quotas in place specifically limiting the harvest in the 2 Wolf Management Units nearest Yellowstone National Park. That allowed for hunting throughout the state, it allowed for control actions outside the quota if necessary to prevent depredation, but accounted for the positive impacts those particular wolves had. Those protections are gone now, and wildlife biology will suffer from the loss of research subjects, as well as the damage done to pack dynamics in the area. I am not anti-wolf-hunting. It is an important management tool. But Montana is not doing it based in science this year.",t2_9phv0z6t,JabberwockyMT,0,1647321950.0,0,t1_i0prvfa,i0prvfa,False,clovercaby,t3_t9gwhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/t9gwhu/wolf_hunting_has_killed_23_yellowstone_wolves/,Wolf hunting has killed 23 Yellowstone wolves this season,/r/yellowstone/comments/t9gwhu/wolf_hunting_has_killed_23_yellowstone_wolves/i0prvfa/,1,r/yellowstone,0,1

"There is also a big difference between eliminating wolf hunting (some on this thread are advocating for that, but the people on the ground in Yellowstone are generally not) and supporting a harvest while reinstating the quota system that accounts for the value the Yellowstone wolves have specifically as scientific subjects and their positive economic impact on the local tourism economy. The Yellowstone scientists have decried this year's numbers. As of the end of February, 8% of the wolves hunted in the entire state of Montana were wolves who had spent over 95% of their lives inside Yellowstone National Park, and were hunted in an area representing .6% of the state.

"A sustainable, ethical harvest is supported by wildlife biologists, conservationists, and both parties (when those involved are familiar with hunting). However, this year the state of Montana chose to not engage in a management strategy, but an express elimination strategy. The problem this year was that as of the end of February, 8% of the wolves hunted in the entire state of Montana were wolves who spent over 95% of their lives inside Yellowstone National Park, and were hunted in an area that makes up .6% of the state. The harvest of these wolves sets back research, as many of those hunted wolves were collared and even when they are not, the severe disruption to pack dynamics that has already been seen this year has already limited the late winter study that Yellowstone biologists do every March. These animals are also worth literally millions of dollars in tourism: people come from all over the world to Gardiner, MT in the winter to wolf watch. They spend money on tours, hotels, restaurants, etc. The Yellowstone wolves are worth far more alive than dead. That also makes them more of a target for some of the hunters who are wolf haters: a Yellowstone wolf is one that will be missed, and is therefore a bigger trophy. I am emotional about this issue because the people who are supposed to represent this state and ensure an ethical, sustainable hunt are not doing their jobs, and are not listening to their constituents. I am pro-wolf hunting. It is an important management tool, and as someone pointed out in another thread, humans are part of the ecosystem too, and have been for a long time. We were historically the bison's biggest predator. But eliminating predators will lead to bigger issues with overgrazing, chronic wasting disease, young wolves without older pack members to teach them to hunt properly (which leads to an increase in depredations). Control actions taken on wolves who are harassing or in too close proximity to livestock are one thing.

"Yes. Problem is winter access is quite restricted to the tour operators.   There is a lottery for one daily pass for a non guided snowmobile group.  No idea on odds and what you might do different 

Most winter trips are set up to go from entrance to geyser basin or to the canyon.  Not many opportunities to do other trips as the roads are snow covered and facilities outside geyser basin are still closed.  

You could take a trip into the Snow lodge and then do your own skiing, hiking, snowshoeing from that lodge or take trips set up for the guests.  
However you are still paying for the trip into the park with one of the tour operators. 
Btw the snow lodge just closed for the season and they are shortly ending tours while they plow the roads ‚Äî so when park reopens in April you can drive all the roads and do your own thing( within park rules üòâ) and then you don‚Äôt need the tours 

However the guides know the activities of the animals and where good spots to visit, etc.  so sometimes it pays to get a tour until you make the connections.

"We spent 8 days in Yellowstone in late May 2021. It was cold, which we expected, it sleeted, AND there were two huge snowstorms, one of which closed traffic coming into the park for several hours ( we were staying the park so were unaffected by this). So, I advise bringing lots of layers, along with your cold weather gear. BTW it was GLORIOUS. No huge crowds, baby animals everywhere, thrilling views.

If I would've talked about how this is something I put my heart and soul into, something that took me years to accomplish, and I only want to share my story with other Yellowstone-minded folks, it would only start more arguments. They'd argue my trailer has no place here, and we'd debate over the community's description and our differring interpretations of it. They'd say I'm just trying to make money, and I'd point out the ebook costs less than a cheeseburger and I half my profit with a charity for medically fragile children and PTSD sufferers (Heart of the Horse Therapy Ranch in Clovis, CA, check em out). And I'll likely never make the money back that I put in.
I'd lose these arguments, because there's no winning with pools of piranhas, and they'd likely rather hate review my book, blindly, when they could've just thought ""eh, not interested"" and scrolled on and continued living their life in the first place.

"Since you're new to hiking, here are a couple of basic suggestions: 
1) avoid cotton clothing. When wet (rain, snow, sweat, falling in creek) it will suck the heat out of you and can cause chafing
2) plan on 3-4 layers of clothing each day. Base layer = wicking fabric to take moisture away from your skin. Then (depending on how cold you tend to get) 1-2 mid layers. Even in mid-June I will take a long-sleeve thermal shirt and a fleece over it. Since I run hot, my fleece is a vest, but my wife wears a full pullover. Then, a top layer shell--preferably waterproof or at least water resistant. The idea is you can take off/don one or more layers to adapt to the potentially drastic changes in weather conditions at different times or elevations.
3) Google ""10 hiking essentials"" or something similar for recommendations on what to take hiking & decide what your trip might require
4) have a blast!

"Bring snacks and water bottles.  There are a lot of water refill stations throughout the park but it's good to have a few full ones on hand.  Keep a first aid kit and bear spray with you.

Personally I'd recommend hiking boots unless you are just going to be sticking to paths that are paved or wooden (for example the paths around Mammoth Hot Springs).  You do a lot of walking at the park, even just to and from parking spots, and I've found that hiking boots make a huge difference in how your feet feel at the end of the day.  Good quality socks do as well.

You can download an official app that has a map and some other info like where to find bathrooms and gas stations.  Be sure to download it for offline use first because depending on your carrier you will get either very limited service or no service whatsoever when you're in the park.

"It's really not a good idea, bringing furry buddies into the Park.

The restrictions are tight. Which means you'll be leaving your pet locked in the car A LOT. You'll be distracted by thinking about their comfort, and cutting your experiences short. It's not a great compromise, it's a lose-lose, really.

Plus, even the slightest lapse in attention or control often leads to tragedy.

Just last fall (and this wasn't the only incident last year even) a young woman's dog got away from her at thermal parking lot. The dog died, and the last I heard (from November) she'd spent more than a month in a medically induced coma.

‚ÄúBear bells may be a popular item to put on your backpack, but they don‚Äôt effectively warn a bear you‚Äôre in the area. Bears won‚Äôt hear the bells until you‚Äôre too close. Yelling, clapping, and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.‚Äù

"I have hiked the CDT through Yellowstone, but it isn't really the best stretch of trail that region has to offer. Instead i would recommend looking at the CDT Big Sky cutoff alternate. That takes you along some much more interesting stretches of trail in Yellowstone.

Alternatively, you could create your own route by connecting some of the trails. An option that would take you through much of the park (and many beautiful sections) is  Slough Creek to Pebble Creek then hook up with the Thunderer (tiny road walk to connect them). Then take Cache Creek out to the Lamar River Trail, down to the Thoroughfare and out through the south of the park.

"Such a fun project!

I know you are trying to narrow it down, but I feel bad for the coyote being left off the list! As someone who has worked as a guide in the park, people love to learn about how to tell the difference between coyotes and wolves, so a page comparing the two could be really great. 

For the birds, I would say stick to the ones that kids and novices are most likely to see- the raven, sandhill crane, bald eagle, and osprey. (Though a harlequin duck or mountain bluebird for color would be nice). People, especially kids, love to repeat-identify what they are coloring with what they have seen in real life. It all depends on what you are trying to achieve. Do you want to introduce people to the more obscure wildlife, or do you want to reinforce the connection to the animals they are most likely to see. 

I personally would include a salmon fly over any of the insects listed above, since the hatch is such a big recognized event by locals and a truly special time for anyone into fishing. I would also say the Mormon cricket is more of a standout insect for the region.

"You will want to pack for winter weather as the weather will be all over the place, plenty of chance of snow or rain and generally cold. I was there the second and third week of June in 2020 and we had many days of light rain, one day of over 2"" of snow and several warmer days. Same advice goes for pretty much every month of the summer. It's either hard winter or there's a chance of snow.

Edit: that sounds a little bleak. I have camped in the area months over the course of the past 15 years and don't recall a day of being ""rained out"", mostly just light rain that comes and goes, vs the day ending downpours we get in Florida.

Same advice for any cold weather: layers, waterproof, good sturdy shoes, avoid cotton. I really like to carry a rain jacket all the time, as they are light and great to take the chill off on a windy overlook. Plan on being outside all day.

Pack a lunch, pack drinks, pack snacks. I prefer a reusable water bottle and it's easy to find somewhere to fill up, but, I still like to carry a few gallons in a collapsible bladder or just plain old bottled gallons.

I am all for population control of animals, and in some areas it does seem like their population is getting out of hand. Not to mention we are hyperfocused on one small ecosystem here.

Because all the roads except Mammoth to the Northeast Entrance will be closed, and people can usually manage a straight road for themselves. Visitation being so low, and the inability to access the majority of the park discourages tours from trying to save slots for this time of year.

Make sure to check out the road report for Yellowstone. This year the park plans multiple road construction projects that will greatly impact travel times. Gardiner provides more access to wildlife, While West offers easier access to Thermal attractions and Lake Yellowstone. Breaking up the trip to enjoy different parts of the park would be my recommendation.

I followed the turquoise bracelet of Forrest Fenn. The visual solve fits amazingly with the subtle hints from just book and clues in the poem. Disregard the solve, just really focus on the rock. It‚Äôs an amazing site to see, even in person. Did Forrest Fenn have a part in sculpting the images found on this rock?

"Taking you at your word that you are ready for the distance and conditions, you should look into Thorofare. You could start at the highway between Moran and Dubois and hike via wilderness land into Yellowstone NP and up to the Nine Mile Trailhead if you want a really long trip. You can also start at the Heart Lake Trailhead, hike down to the heart of Thorofare, and then hike out to the Nine Mile Trailhead. I did Thorofare last summer (from Nine Mile, down to the park boundary, and back) and it was one of the most amazing Yellowstone trips of my life. This is a great video about the Nine Mile-to-Heart Lake route: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS2YrhBwV3c

Anything before June would be impossible due to stream crossings. July will still be challenging (and buggy). Later in the season you would be sharing anything south of the boundary with hunters. August is the sweet spot for Thorofare.

Another cool option for a long trip would be to start at the Phantom Fumarole trailhead, hike across the plateau to the Falls River crossing, hike to Union Falls, hike to Bechler Canyon, make a side trip to Shoshone Geyser Basin, and hike out via Lone Star Geyser to Old Faithful.

">is there enough to do to make an 8 day trip

Absolutely, yes. I just spent the same length of time there and never found myself bored with the park. We did drive through some of the same locations several days, but most of the fun of Yellowstone is the ever changing wildlife spotting opportunities. Every time we drove in to the park, we saw different animals in different locations. A couple days we did do a snow coach tour: one to the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone and one to Old Faithful. 

As far as sun exposure: if you‚Äôre hoping to get out and hike a lot, then Yellowstone most likely isn‚Äôt the park for you. There were a few days that were cloudy, but when the suns out it‚Äôs extremely bright. Now if you plan on driving yourself through the northern part of the park, or taking a snow coach tour, it will be bright, but your exposure would be limited mostly to whatever isn‚Äôt filtered through the car/coach windows. The tours do stop frequently at many of the close-to-road attractions, but getting out and walking with the guides isn‚Äôt mandatory. A few people on my Grand Canyon tour only got out for the main attraction and not at all for the smaller spots.

"If you're thinking 2-6 miles, then in Yellowstone, I'd say Terraced Falls.  Beautiful cascading falls the whole way down to the main attraction, Terraced Falls.  It's away from the crowds, too.  Before you venture out on Grassy Lake Road, check with the rangers for conditions.  It might still be snow-covered and impassable.  

In the Tetons, Taggart Lake gives incredible views of the mountains and makes a great loop (either one or a figure-8).  This is a busier trail, though.  I'd suggest an early morning start after watching the sun rise on the Tetons from one of the popular pull-offs along the road.  

Bear spray?  ABSOLUTELY.  Chances are you won't need it.  But why put yourself in a situation where you might need it and not have it?

"Keep in mind that camping means the bathroom is outside and not necessarily super close. It's also generally coldest right before sunrise so getting up in the morning is often harder than staying warm at night! If your family and the 2 year old have plenty of camping experience, great. But if this would be the first camping trip, I might wait until later in the season or when they're older. If things don't go well there will likely not be the option to check into a motel because everything will already be sold out.

Most campgrounds in the park also do not have showers, though most have running water.

"So many of the answers depend on your level of experience and knowledge in questionable conditions.  If you're coming from Florida and have only seen a few snow flurries once, Yellowstone will be dangerous for you in October.  If you're a seasoned winter veteran with experience driving in, dressing for, and preparing for large amounts of snow, it will be much more manageable.  

I was in the park in late September.  It was my favorite time of year to be there so far.  But my buddy and I were prepared.  We were fully self-sufficient, not needing to rely on stores or restaurants other than an occasional fuel-up.  Our last day there, most stores were closing for the season.  

You mentioned Old Faithful.  Are you focusing mostly on the drive-up attractions?  Or are you hoping to hike?  If so, what is your fitness level and are you familiar with life at high elevation?  

Don't underestimate the size of the park.  Drives between popular places can take hours.  Bison jams, road closures, or pulling off to observe wildlife will add indeterminate time.  Carry bear spray and know how to use it.

"You generally are not going to need a 4-Season tent for late May camping in Yellowstone. You‚Äôre better off getting better sleeping pads and sleeping bags to keep warm. (When choosing a sleeping bag remember men and unisex temperature ratings are based on the lower comfort limit so a 20 degree men‚Äôs bag will not keep a cold sleeper warm at 20 degrees) I do recommend a tent with a full coverage rainfly. Lows in the 20s and 30s at night is pretty common throughout the summer in Yellowstone. May can be tricky as nights in the teens can still happen as well as snowstorms. (It can snow any month in Yellowstone but May snow is still fairly common especially at the higher elevations)

If your kids aren‚Äôt used to camping it may be better to wait until they have some experience especially until you know better how they handle cooler temperatures. 

A big thing you need to keep in mind with Yellowstone and kids is that the boardwalks frequently have no railings and you will be responsible for keeping your kids safe. End of May is when the park starts to get really busy I recommend avoiding the boardwalks at peak times as that will make it easier for your kids to see things and so they don‚Äôt get knocked over by people walking backwards to take a picture/selfie. 

Yellowstone is also a lot of walking, even if you stick to only the boardwalks you can still be walking miles make sure to get your kids and yourself ready for that amount of walking so they don‚Äôt get tired too quickly especially if you‚Äôre dealing with a big elevation change. The upper geyser basin at least when I can connect it to Biscut Basin is over 6miles of trails if I remember correctly.(the connecting trails are closed to bear management until Memorial Day weekend) 

Do consider taking your kids to the Grizzly and Wolf discovery center in West Yellowstone, MT if you do go. It can be a good way to let your kids see and learn about wildlife. 

If you‚Äôre looking for an easy ‚Äúhike‚Äù consider Wraith Falls it‚Äôs maybe a mile and you get to see a waterfall. It‚Äôs just a bit past Mammoth on the way to Lamar Valley.

"Oooh! I just took my 5 and 8 year old in late September. We had some cold nights (into the low 20s) and got snowed on and sleeted on several times in the tent. We have a giant Big Agnes Tensleep 6 for the 4 of us for car camping - it's overkill and indeed so big that it's probably colder than a 4-person 3-season tent.

But my point is that you layer the hell up. And then you're fine. Wear long underwear and fleece pants, a hat, stay in your sweater, etc. The biggest issue for us was that my son's sleeping bag (which was mine as a kid) was probably not very warm overall, and we were wrapping him in an extra fleece blanket we brought, which didn't stay, so eventually on a few cold nights I layered up a lot and swapped with him. 

So, it wasn't perfect, but it was overall not a major issue. If it had been cold on more nights I would have felt worse about the situation. Indeed, coming back east we were going to camp in the Bighorns and stopped short because at elevation the forecast was much colder than down low, and we wanted a warmer night after some cold in Yellowstone.

If you have a 4-season tent? I think your family's body heat will go a long way. A major question is just how many cold nights you'll be in - if it's every night for 3 weeks that might be rough.

For me the biggest question (in your situation) is how the 2-year old will do, generally. Still, I think if you bundle them up they won't be the worst of your worries.

And I hate to say this but perhaps find a commercial venture to sell you firewood just outside the park. The park wood is utter shit.

"One of our biggest snow storms of this winter was in early October -- all of Yellowstone and the surrounding area got BURIED.

Second year in a row for an early October snow storm.  A few years ago we had snow on the first day of summer.  

Park accomodations book early for the entire season and there is no such thing as all inclusive at the in park lodging.....you can find some amazing luxury (billionaires) lodging outside of the park entrances near West (Big Sky) or Gardiner (Paradise Valley) that will include various options for tours or activities if you don't mind spending up to several thousands per night.

A really cool spot with a lot of history, hot springs, horse back riding and more without being crazy expensive is the Chico Hot Springs in Paradise Valley.   The Mountain Sky Guest Ranch is also nearby.  Both book up fairly early for the entire season.

It is best to stay in the park - not many options in October. Most locations closed already.

Yellowstone is configured as a figure 8 with an upper and lower loop. You could stay in mammoth for the upper loop and then old faithful for bottom loop. More days the better.

Grand Teton is just to the south - hopefully you can add that to your trip. Jackson has a wide range of dining and lodging options including a four seasons.

You could easily spend a day at each of these points:

* Yellowstone Lake (Fishing Bridge) and Hayden Valley
* West Thumb and/or Lewis Lake area

* Roosevelt
* Norris area (more thermal features, park ranger museum)
* Another day in Mammoth
* Grizzly and Wolf Discovery center in West Yellowstone (outside the park, but honestly this might be worth kicking up towards the top of your list)
