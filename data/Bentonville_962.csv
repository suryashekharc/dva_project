"WTF. I was on board with you until you said Azul sucks. That place is my favorite, but I wouldnt consider it authentic. Its more so authentic inspired, but with a twist of fancy creativity and high quality foods. They also just opened their second location in Bentonville, but its a local company, not a chain.

I havent tried Local Lime yet, but it seems to be the same idea as Azul. They only have locations in Rogers and Little Rock, so not really a chain, and it seems high quality authentic inspired, but they add a lot of cheese to everything. Being lactose intolerant, its hard for me to justify going somewhere that I have to take half the ingredients off any dish.

Taqueria Real Jacona I only ordered during the pandemic through food apps. I really liked one location, but the other was pretty bad. Unfortunately, I dont remember which was the good one.

Taqueria Guanajuato #1 is good, especially their Birria, but they dont really have any flair or anything unique to stand out.

El Senor de los tacos in Springdale was kind of on the same page. Authentic and good, but lacking creativity. Also, if you order to-go, they give you stryofoam plates covered in tin foil, and if you eat in, its chaotic and cramped. Good food, bad experience.

"Bro whuuuttt people saying yeyos are crazy. I’ve had friends work there and they definitely don’t bring in “most of their meat from their own live stock” they use Sysco 😂 also the owner is rude af. I went a few times. Restaurant smelled like nasty disgusting mop water and every time I went after that it still smelled like that. Then once a group of us ordered ahead of time. Big order over 20 ppl the girl messed up one order and the owner just cussed her out in front of us. Then when I asked for more salsa he freaking nagged at me like wtf! Anywho most Mexican food here sucks ass and don’t get me started on white ppl culturally appropriating our Mexican food and calling it Mexican,  or tex mex, or the new shit called ark-mex like WTF. They want our food but not us…. Any way, My personal favorite is real jacona in Rogers over the bentonville one but I still like the bentonville one. They use nice high quality meat. I’ve rarely ever gotten any fat pieces or those hard to chew nerve prices that you get with out restaurants that cheap out on meat. Then I’d say it’s el señor de los tacos especially worth it for $1 on tuesdays.

"Honestly the responses to this post really highlight that we still have terrible taste in mexican food around here. There's SO much good mexican food between the tacquerias and food trucks. I'm gonna break it down as best I can.

Food Truck De El Chefe in rogers is my absolute favorite place for Birria and LA style street mexican food. he does a lot of authentic stuff but he also does LA style stuff that's delicious.

King Burrito is my go to for high value, big portions, traditional mexican with tex-mex options. They have all the authentic stuff, but they also will cover it in cheese sauce if you order it that way. 

Las Palmas in downtown rogers and Las Fajitas on 14th in bentonville are more tex mex than anything but they're the best tex mex around here by a lot.

Rolling Taco food truck on 8th in bentonville, they close early but they've got some of the best mexican food in NWA. Better than Yeyo's and way cheaper.

Yeyo's is great but it's expensive because they raise their own livestock and grow their own vegetables. The yeyo's in Downtown rogers has a full indoor restaurant with a mezcal bar if you wanna go a little deeper into the experience.

Tacqueria Real Jacona in Bentonville is good but there's definitely more unique spots. 

El Cunado in Rogers is great as well, lots of traditional north mexican food. 

IF you go a little further and venture into Springdale-- Tacqueria Guanajuato #1 and #2 are both on Thompson (the main drag, highway 71) and they're both great. #2 has a full service bar with liquor, but the kitchen isn't as strong as #1 which only serves beer.  They're within a couple blocks of eachother. Their carnitas is the best I've had in NWA.

Don Tomi Tacos is super fire for specifically street tacos.

Don Pedro's Carnitas is one of the best taco tuesday spots in NWA. 

In Fayetteville, Tula is great for upscale traditional oaxacan food. Mr. Taco Loco is great if you want cheap eats and drinks, avoid the regular chicken-- it's flavorless. The tinga however is a great chipotle flavored shredded chicken. La Media Luna is an awesome modernized tex mex/mexican fusion restuarant ran by a super amazing chef. 


Places to avoid: Acambaro, Maria's are both super low quality, super poor service served in oversized dirty dining rooms. Almost everything comes from a can or package specifically from Sysco. Their food is almost identical and It's never good. People will recommend it around here because they're unaware of what real mexican food is, or they have really shitty taste. Both are almost always simultaneously true.  La Huerta in Fayetteville is similar. Chuy's, Azul Tequila, Torchy's, Local Lime basically any of the big chain tex mex spots suck too.

"Full article:

State Treasurer Dennis Milligan has stripped about $125 million out of money market accounts managed by New York-based BlackRock, his spokeswoman said this week.

The state treasury invests roughly $6 billion in state funds.

""Once we began to see BlackRock's active global political activity (handpicking companies that aligned with their ESG beliefs and beliefs we feel most Arkansans are opposed to), we began divesting and were fully divested by March 1,"" Milligan spokeswoman Stacy Peterson said in a written statement.

She said ESG refers to environmental, social and governance practices.

Asked for examples of how BlackRock handpicks companies that aligned with certain beliefs that the treasurer's office believe most Arkansans are opposed to, Peterson said, ""What I meant by this is corporations such as BlackRock are taking public money and playing politics with it (i.e. investing in clean energy and more importantly, divesting from fossil fuel producing companies).

""This practice directly affects Arkansas's economy.""

A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment this week about the state treasurer's decision to not invest state funds in money accounts managed by BlackRock.

Milligan, a Republican from Benton, has served as state treasurer since 2015. He has filed to run for state auditor in this year's election.

He said in a written statement that ""additionally, prior to the Russian invasion, we verified we had no direct Russian investments and divested of any associated securities that had a tie to Russia.""

Peterson said the treasurer's office didn't previously have any associated securities with a tie to Russia.

Two months ago, Republican West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore announced the West Virginia Board of Treasury Investments will no longer use a BlackRock Inc. investment fund as part of its banking transactions. Moore said the decision was based on recent reports that BlackRock has urged companies to embrace ""net zero"" investment strategies that would harm the coal, oil and natural gas industries, while increasing investments in Chinese companies that subvert national interests and damage West Virginia's manufacturing base and job market.

Last week, state Rep. Mark Lowery, R-Maumelle, tweeted that ""I congratulate Treasurer Dennis Milligan in disinvesting Arkansas from any BlackRock investments after revelation of their ties to the Communist Chinese military"" and Lowery pledged to continue that disinvestment if elected state treasurer in this year's election.

Peterson said this week that Milligan made his own decision to no longer invest in money market accounts managed by BlackRock.

A month ago, Lowery tweeted that ""as the next Arkansas State Treasurer"" he pledges to block any state investments, including pension funds through BlackRock. In the Republican primary for treasurer, he is vying with state Sen. Mat Pitsch, R-Fort Smith. The winner will take on Little Rock's Pam Whitaker in the general election.

Two of state government's retirement

systems have nearly $1.4 billion managed by BlackRock, according to officials for the two systems.

Peterson said in her written statement that ""We have not had any instrument that would have been invested directly through BlackRock since Treasurer Milligan has been in office.

""The only exceptions I am aware of are two BlackRock money market funds that we opened, one in August of 2019 and the other in July 2020,"" she said in her written statement.

""At that time (2019) we were restructuring our short-term portfolio (specifically our commercial paper investments) to become more liquid, so we opened that first money market account with BlackRock. (This was one of several money market accounts that we opened at that time to place money.),"" according to Peterson.

""At that time (July 2019), we put in $415 million in a BlackRock money market account,"" she said. ""Then, after pandemic relief money started to come in, we opened another BlackRock money market account in July 2020 with $970 million we got from the feds that month.

""When we divested on March 1, 2022, we had $125 million in the first BlackRock money market account (the one opened in August 2019), and $195,000 in the other account (opened in July 2020),"" Peterson said.

The average ending monthly balance, since inception, for the first BlackRock money market account opened in August 2019 was $294.2 million, she said. The average ending monthly balance for the second one opened in July 2020 was $497.4 million, she said.

There was no money lost in these accounts, Peterson said.

Throughout the course of that time between August 2019 and February 2022, ""we had fluctuations in these accounts ranging from $1.2 billion at the highest to $1,700 at the lowest,"" she said. ""Because these accounts operate similar to checking accounts, there was money flowing in and out of these on a daily basis.""

The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System is invested in two funds managed by BlackRock -- a passive global stock index fund valued around $997 million and a fixed-income fund valued around $276 million -- said Clint Rhoden, executive director for the teacher retirement system.

The system's investments are valued at about $21.3 billion, he said.

""The ATRS Board makes investment decisions based upon recommendations from the ATRS investment consultants,"" Rhoden said this week in a written statement. ""ATRS does not have a ESG investing mandate and the ATRS investment policy is designed to maximize results for the participants in a prudent and fiduciary manner.""

Robyn Smith, executive secretary of the
Robyn Smith, executive secretary of the Arkansas State Highway Employees Retirement System, said the highway employees retirement system has about $119 million invested in stocks and bonds through BlackRock.

The system's investments are valued at about $1.587 billion, she said.

""ASHERS does not have an ESG investing mandate, but ESG is considered as part of our investment process,"" Smith said in a written statement.

Asked whether Milligan plans to try to eliminate the teacher retirement system and highway employees retirement system's investments managed through BlackRock as a trustee on the boards of the two systems, Peterson said ""not that I'm aware of.

She said Milligan trusts the leadership of the boards to initiate that discussion when they feel the timing is right.",t2_1v5jokzw,Verifyonce,0,1647700615.0,0,t1_i1a905i,i1a905i,False,Verifyonce,t3_thwcqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/bentonville/comments/thwcqy/arkansas_state_treasurer_yanks_about_125m_out_of/,Arkansas state treasurer yanks about $125M out of accounts managed by BlackRock,/r/bentonville/comments/thwcqy/arkansas_state_treasurer_yanks_about_125m_out_of/i1a905i/,8,r/bentonville,0,8

"Have been here for 7 years, and even before covid and the development boom, the traffic was very high around 6.30 -8AM. I guess it is mostly due to kids being dropped off at school and then people heading to office. 

Yes, people here are in general very kind, especially allowing others to merge and being polite at parking lots.. over the years though, I have noticed a few more aggressive merges, mostly on cars having out of state tags.

Regarding the cops, it helps that they are relatively well funded and most schools always have 1 cop car parked throughout the day. I have been pulled over a couple of times (one was definitely my fault), and each time the officers here have been nothing but polite.

Hopefully, it will continue to remain the same or become better with the new influx of people to this area.",t2_oq3xrhl,CyclicMoth,0,1646764116.0,0,t1_hzvaei7,hzvaei7,True,Pineapp1eFinesse,t3_t9hhee,https://www.reddit.com/r/bentonville/comments/t9hhee/ive_lived_here_for_a_year_and_this_morning_was_my/,I've lived here for a year and this morning was my first time being out and about around 7-8am.

"To put it simply: The vibe sucks, the work is mediocre and the attitude of the people is very edgy. 

He has a very popular shop because they're one of the cheapest around and when he opened there weren't a lot of options, but take a look at the pictures they publish of their work. Seek out the lower reviews on their pages, also. To be blunt, if a lot of cheap people who literally don't know any better didn't send their friends there it wouldn't be open. Anyone who's seen good work is generally disgusted by what they're putting out.

It's a shoddy shop in a rundown strip mall, the owner is a tough guy ^tm and at any given time there's one artist worth a damn in there. They've butchered tattoos and piercings on too many of my friends over the years(proudly and defensively, no less) and almost nobody I know into those things would go there or reccomend it.

"I recently moved to Bentonville and bought a house and love the area. Everyone I've interacted with has been very nice and welcoming. 

I chose here for the mountain biking and because I work remotely, so I really don't have a need to leave my immediate area and there are enough good restaurants and bars for me to be happy with the smaller size of Bentonville. The cost of living here is also quite a bit less than where I came from, so that was just an added bonus. 

The housing market sucks anywhere that's desirable to live. You'll need at least enough cash on hand to offer over listing. The process for me wasn't particularly that bad, maybe 5-6 offers before finally getting one accepted. I did not make an all cash offer, for the record.

"Hey. We live in tulsa now and bike a lot and spend a few days a month in NWA usually. Both areas have good things going on. So we aren’t working and are considering a move to NWA. 

It is much quieter in the Bentonville area, less helicopters, sirens and traffic. Nice restaurants and small town feel as we are familiar with a few NWA locals already. We look for housing up around Bella vista as the houses are lower priced, and the new bike trails are spurring the market as is development in the area from Walmart. I think you find all of the amenities in NWA as tulsa however perhaps more spread out. NWA has perhaps closer access to out door activities like rafting and nice streams and lakes.

Tulsa is also developing fast and has grown a lot in our 20+ years here. Downtown is popping and the nightlife is for sure more plentiful than NWA. Real estate in tulsa is also pricey but has a larger market, you’ll also find work more easily. The music seen here is pretty bright with several small venues and access to larger activities downtown. There are many many parks and paved trails, a super nice new park on riverside called the gathering place. Keystone and Skiatook are close lakes that are nice. 

It’s sort of a challenging decision, but it’s only two hours drive between and the road is decent with 80mph speed for part of it. 

Also Fayetteville area is neat with similar trade offs.

Edit to say someone mentioned tornadoes, while definitely more frequent it’s not been so concerning, but maybe if you’d have a strong fear of them you’ll not like the storm tracking anxiety.",t2_hvl1q,One-monkey,0,1645975159.0,0,t1_hynhclo,hynhclo,True,Electrical_Canary566,t3_t2mudl,https://www.reddit.com/r/bentonville/comments/t2mudl/nw_arkansas_or_tulsa_move_for_young_couple/,NW Arkansas or Tulsa move for young couple?,/r/bentonville/comments/t2mudl/nw_arkansas_or_tulsa_move_for_young_couple/hynhclo/,5,r/bentonville,0,5

"We grew up in Muskogee. Spent many weekends in Tulsa. Still have family there and travel there every so often for kids sports. 

I’m very happy with Bentonville and NWA in general. Growth has been non stop for past 20 years. Schools are great (esp in Bentonville). Both my kids were born here. Tulsa I’m sure has many positives as well but NWA doesn’t seem to have the crime and other negatives that Tulsa might have. 

No regrets. 

I will say my wife has been sending me Zillow listings for owasso and other Tulsa areas outside the metro proper. You can get a bit more house there and seems like now that the kids are growing up she’s starting to think about Tulsa as an option. 

Still no regrets and honestly you can probably make a great life in either place.

"When you visited Bentonville with your fiance, did you drive down towards Fayetteville to really illustrate how large the area is as a whole? I know when we were first considering the area, my mother didn't understand that NWA was more than just Fayetteville. She had been to Fayetteville a few years before we started considering the move, but she didn't really see any of Springdale, Rogers, and Bentonville until I kept mentioning the area to her. Even then, she didn't really get it until we came up on a scouting trip.

All that said, yeah, the overall population (F+S+R+B) is about half maybe of the Tulsa metro? Tulsa definitely has some pros. My cousin lives there with his wife and twins and is very happy. Meanwhile we like NWA. 

I'd say part of the reason we prefer NWA is that Tulsa was a little too much like Fort Worth and Oklahoma City to us in that it just felt like a really sprawling, all interstate, generic city. I know there is more to it than that, but NWA just felt more relaxed? 

Cons to NWA? Yeah...housing is nuts. A house in our subdivision sold in less than 24 hours a couple weeks ago. And it had a TON of viewings...we saw the cars!

"Not as if this phenomenon is unique to NWA ; go anywhere and ask about the local weather and they'll sing a similar song about how unpredictable the weather is. Maybe the real issue is an increased atmospheric volatility, especially around fall /spring when changing weather patterns, the mixing of warm and cold air masses increases, and mixing of the Jetstream. the baseline winter temperature outside of Arctic intrusions has gone up. Look at the pressure swings from high to low during February to April and again from October through December. It's an observable pattern, although there is a disconnect between describing climate and specific weather events.

Everybody is always trying to predict weather events using climate averages and it just doesn't work. Or they just claim that the only thing you can predict is the unpredictability of the weather here, but that's just a scapegoat argument. By and large, NWA generally fits the climate description (annual highs and lows, distribution of heat through year according to solar exposure, ~ 48 inches of rain per year, et al (but the granularity isn't the same.. Maybe it used to rain 0.5 inches 96 days per year, now maybe it rains 24 days per year at an average intensity of 2 in per event.))",t2_dte8p,jabbrwok,0,1645720991.0,0,t1_hy9dm5u,hy9dm5u,True,trishben,t3_t0ehis,https://www.reddit.com/r/bentonville/comments/t0ehis/nwa_weather/,NWA weather,/r/bentonville/comments/t0ehis/nwa_weather/hy9dm5u/,10,r/bentonville,0,10

"In my opinion, at 15 dollars a hour you will want to stay away from Bentonville, Rogers etc as a place to live and generally hang out.  Everything will be too expensive and not worth it.  I would look further south.

Springdale is a great option in that price range, culturally it has a higher Hispanic population and tends to be more industrial so lower paying jobs... and better cost of living.  You could easily live in some of the border cities to Springdale that was mentioned such as Tontitown, Elm Springs.

Fayetteville is a college town so cheap apartments can be found, you could also look out towards Farmington which is kind of west of Fayetteville.. it should be more affordable.

"Urban is definitely relatively here! IMO, Bentonville and Rogers blend together, tho both have great “downtown” areas. Both have their pros and cons, but are altogether pretty great.

"To play devil’s advocate. Prices are rising on everything. All for profit companies raise prices when they know they can. Taxes have increased, building supplies have increased in price, employment has been fluctuating which cost companies money to find new hires and train. Real estate is all about location and convenience. The closer to attractions and high paying jobs the more rent they can charge and the more value a property can have. It sucks if you get priced out but it is happening everywhere. It happens in cycles. It is expensive to be poor (or poorer than where the jobs are located). You have to live further away, have reliable transportation, bring your own food because you can’t afford restaurants.

"Short answer: yes, there is almost always something to ride.

Winter: freeze/thaw is probably your biggest enemy but if you go early enough while things are frozen there will be tons to ride. As you'd imagine there are certain areas that are prone to drying out faster than others but it's pretty easy to pick up on. One thing to note is that Slaughter Pen and Back 40 will not close their trails when conditions are bad, but Coler will.


Summer: if you're a morning person like I am, they aren't bad at all if you ask me. I don't know why anyone would want to ride midday when the heat index is pushing 100 but plenty do. In general I think people tend to exaggerate how bad summers are here.


Bike: I'd say it's highly unlikely it's too much bike for here, but impossible to say without knowing your bike and riding level/style.


Also don't even bother checking Trailforks for conditions. Each section has a trail condition page on facebook for updates fyi. You'd probably want to follow each of SP, Coler, Handcut, and the Back 40 pages.",t2_isub8ng7,sdfkjsldkfj,0,1645148323.0,0,t1_hxe1o03,hxe1o03,True,ihateredditapp,t3_sv2s2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/bentonville/comments/sv2s2o/are_people_able_to_mountain_bike_year_round_in/,"Are people able to mountain bike year round in Bentonville?

In winter, yes we have cold snaps, but they are usually short lived. 2 weeks ago we got a couple cold days where we got 6-9"" of snow, but within a few days, temps were back up into the 50's and sunny. So extreme cold doesn't usually last very long.

In summer, we get a little hot and humid, but not so extreme that it prevents folks from getting out there typically. I mean, I guess it could depend on what you are comfortable with.

"We’re up in Bella Vista and the woods around our house are filled to the brim with ticks. I was helping a friend move to their new Bella Vista house and their lot was still grassy and unfinished, I had 4 nymph lone star ticks on my legs after we finished. I was wearing shorts and no repellant, which was my mistake.

If your backyard is enclosed, far away from the forest, and doesn’t have much interaction with deer, squirrels, or other woodland mammals then you might be fine but it’s absolutely a good idea to do regular full body tick checks to ensure ticks don’t attach unexpectedly after you or your children come inside. Ticks love warm, wet places so pay special attention to armpits and crotches, they can hide in there.

If you have ticks in the area they can smell it when you exhale CO2 and will even search you out; they can come from yards and yards away through grass or whatever. They don’t, however, like crossing hot dry barriers like roads or gravel, so I’ve read that some people have had success putting a 4 foot gravel barrier around their yard and then the ticks don’t walk across and enter your grass. You can also spread some poison throughout your yard but I’ve never done that myself.

 If you catch the ticks before they attach or before they’ve been attached for a long time they have a lower chance of giving you any illness. Any grassy area can have ticks, so once the weather heats up you need to watch out or could get some really scary or annoying tick borne disease (including alpha gal syndrome, which functionally makes you allergic to meats from mammals for potentially the rest of your life). 

However, with precautions you can be totally fine. If you have dogs put them on a medication that makes their blood poisonous to ticks and fleas, like  Bravecto. Picaridin is a very effective tick and mosquito repellant, kind of like deet, but has basically no scent after it’s dried and won’t dissolve plastics and hurt clothing like deet can. If you have clothes that up use outside often (to, for example, mow the lawn or hike) you can treat them or spray them with permethrin, so if ticks try to climb up your shoes or pants they’ll be killed in seconds. My work boots are sprayed with permethrin every other week or so and I’ve never had ticks climb up from the grass or leaves over those boots, it’s a very effective barrier.

With a bit of work to avoid and prevent tick bites you can be just fine. When I’ve taken the above precautions I’ve never had an issue, you just need to get in the habit.

">“We could use that. That’s a lot of money,” Sample said, adding that he’d like to see that money go towards giving Arkansas State Police troopers a raise.

Instead of paying police even more money it would be nice if that money were to go towards the many miles of dirt roads that are still all over Bentonville/Benton county.  We basically have one of the richest companies in the world here but yet the roads are atrocious... and it's been that way for some 2 decades now.  

And yes, the way Arkansas does taxes for auto/RV purchases is disgusting.  I know so many people who make vehicle purchases (both rich and poor), who don't understand that when they go get their tags they have to pay thousands of dollars in taxes.  If you try to pay with a Credit Card because many don't have that amount of liquid cash sitting around Arkansas further tacks on a percentage fee on the payment which can add a considerable amount.  

Will that ever change?  Not when you have people like Senator Bill Sample in control that are more focused on taking money from people and giving it law enforcement.

"If you have health insurance, it’s just a regular doctor office visit (e.g., if you have a copay, and they are in network, that’s what you’ll pay). Try to go to a doctor who specializes in it. I went to Dr. Karas (yes, \*that\* Dr. Karas) the first time and for my renewal. They give you the signed document and instructions on what to do next. When time renew, I had heard the requirements were a lot stricter, so was really worried about it. PTSD is the only approved mental health issue. I do have PTSD, but have more anxiety and depression than that.  Dr. Karas approved again. Don’t get me wrong, he didn’t lie. What I’m trying to get across is that he asks appropriate questions and validates your belief that it might help you. He was thrilled to know I don’t use Klonopin as much now.  


Then $50.00 to the state to send in the application. If you do it online, you can log into that account to watch for approval. Once approved, they send a card in the mail. In the meantime, you can print it from the website, but you might have to format it to the proper size.

Any of the local dispensaries (I know of four) are really friendly and most are knowledgeable. You’ll learn which growers (“brands”) you prefer for which type of product. And, between the four, you can usually find a good deal if you’re looking for a particular item.

"Yes. I'll have mine my second year soon. I have several reasons (unfortunately) that qualify. If you have a PCP or MD that has diagnosed you already with one of the already listed  18 qualifying conditions then that's easier. You do have to provide the paperwork stating said condition from within a years date to give them or they can get the info for you with your consent. I have PTSD that qualified me, specifically. However, those conditions do not limit you. ARcannabis' doctors can determine at their own discretion what qualifies.
Step one: pay 200.00 to www.arcannabisclinic.com 
Two: provide a state issued license or ID
Three: get your paperwork on your own or through them
Four: If you need them to diagnose you for anything then it will cost you another 100.00. It's over the phone and doesn't take more than 5 minutes tops. The appointments are very flexible from morning to night Monday-Saturday.
You DO get your money back if you do not qualify.
Five: you then have to get your certification letter from ARcannabis to submit to the Dpt of Health. They review everything and give you a print out until your card comes in the mail. As soon as they approve it and you can print it, you can use it. DoH charges you 50.00 for their review and the license. 

No matter what you're spending 250.00 but through their doctors you'll spend 350.00 total. That's before you get any kind of product. I think I covered all of the important stuff. They are very helpful and professional. You can ask them anything and they do their best to make sure you understand everything.

"My brother goes to a high school in Bentonville and said that when the students tried to start an Asian cultural club, the school shut that down and made them call it the POC club instead. Idk something about that irked me. 

Back in the big city in the Midwest that we’re from, we had Latino club, Asian club, African American club, etc at our HS. They were truly beautiful. Every club had their respective month to host a school wide event sharing the beauty, pride, and foods that came from the different cultures. It felt so bizarre to me that the high school discouraged that. (And yes my school also had a German club lol) 

My brother said that one of the district school representatives came to the Bentonville school to say that it was the first time they had had anything like this.

Just kidding 
I (23,f) moved here with my family from a diverse populated city. Most of my friends back home were POC. I felt a huge culture shock when I got here. Heard racial jokes I had never ever gotten back at home. (Im Asian btw) 
No one really means any offense and they’re just trying to crack jokes but it just makes me miss home because I don’t really see many POC around here and it reminds me that I’m different. 

If you’re like me then honestly you might not like it here. But if you’re open to change and more adaptable then you’ll be okay. There’s a large Hispanic population towards Rogers. I wish there was more culture represented such as black, Asian, etc.. 

I definitely see that the area is trying to grow and is especially progressive when it comes to LGBTQ. Racially though it’s extremely different (from what I was used to anyways), and I think I’m too set in my ways to feel that comfortable with this environment.

There are plenty of amenities to this area and diversity is certainly better than when I was a kid.

"I understand your frustration. Especially now with how the pandemic has affected the food service industry.

Way back in the mid-1990's I worked in as a waiter in a bar & grill. You couldn't earn a living wage even with tips. If people bothered to tip at all.

Sometimes we'd get people from other countries who wouldn't tip because its not part of their culture. They assumed it was the restaurants responsibility to pay their workers a living wage. Not forcing them to rely on the generosity of customers.

It got so bad that it forced me to find another career. I hope you find something that treats you better and pays you what you're worth.

I found this short video that explains where ""Tipping"" came from:

"I'm a mixed race male that grew up here in Bentonville. My father (Black) started working for Walmart in 1982 when the totality of Black associates at the Home Office could sit around a single table in the cafeteria. I graduated from Bentonville in 2003, and worked at the home office from 2010-2020. I will say if you want to find your tribe, you will find your tribe. There are a myriad of organizations and affiliation groups for Blank professionals both within Walmart and as part of the larger community. AABRG the African American Associate Resource Group is a great starting point at Walmart. Once you're there seek out the Office of Diversify and Inclusion for even more chances to engage. 
Yes you will see a lot of MAGA hats, t-shirts, and bumper stickers. But if this bothers you, you will need to disabuse yourself of the notion that conservative equals racist. My experience living here my whole life is that Bentonville is not an inherently racist town. There are definitely racists here, but then again, there are racists everywhere. If you've grown up somewhere predominantly Black and you want to mostly socialize with black people once you're here, you can find that, but if up willing to open up to other groups there are strong communities of many different demographics living in this town.

"Just my 2 cents, people here who say there is no young scene or culture are the same people who sit around all day complaining about how terrible everything is.  The reality is you will meet people of all types while working at Walmart and it will be up to you to be friendly and trustworthy and then you will find you will be invited to all sorts of crazy things... you just have to open your mind a bit.

I've lived in major cities like DC.. will this place have clubs with music acts running every night like in DC??.. no.. but be honest how often do you hit those places in the city?  Unless you are a party animal you aren't hitting the clubs every night.  Music acts large and small do come here it's the frequency that is less.  For example a quick search shows Jasper Logan and Baang coming to Georges on Feb 9th.. no idea who they are but Georges in Fayetteville is a great small venue format.  JJ's had Snoop and Ice Cube recently, The Walmart Amp will have bigger shows, they had Trippie Redd in August.  And if you need that big city vibe you can get to Tulsa from here in less than 2 hours, KC in about 3 hours.. spend a night there and then come home where it's safe. :)

Full disclaimer I am white, but I will say that I worked with a Black VP in my office who I deeply respected.  He made the decision to move to Atlanta which I didn't understand, we had a conversation one day about it and he said the problems he had were not with the adults, but rather the kids in school.  His kids were having a hard time in school and he decided that he needed to relocate them out of this area and into an area that better fit the demographic.

"Hi! You might also cross post to r/Fayetteville as this sub isn’t as active and seems to skew a bit older as well. Bentonville/Rogers/Springdale/Fayetteville are all clustered together, but each city has different style and things to offer. With the university based in Fayetteville, it definitely runs younger, more diverse, and more liberal at heart than the surrounding areas.

I posted because while I don’t have demographics in common with you, I did recently move here for work from Kansas City. Before that, I was in Dallas and Seattle. All have more diverse populations and more black culture to offer. That said, because of the work opportunities here, NWA does have a lot more diversity than you’d expect.  I’ve been pleasantly surprised by all the area has to offer compared to some of the other places I’ve lived, and it’s truly beautiful. 

If you accept the job (and I hope you do!) I would definitely join some of the Walmart groups so that you can meet other young, black professionals, particularly since we aren’t in the office full time. I’ve been at restaurants, dog parks and breweries that were having meet ups, and I know Walmart is working to make the workplace more inclusive.

"44yr old white lesbian lady here. 🙋 NWA is actually kind of a big area and the level of racism truly depends on which town you're in. We did have several decent sized BLM protests, which I was pretty proud of for AR. Fayetteville and Springdale are the most diverse towns we have in this neck of the woods. Rogers has a diverse population but is lacking true diversity. And most of the other comments I've read are true too. The smaller towns are more racist. The more natives in a town, the more racist, imo. I've lived in this area for 20 years and have lived from Fayetteville all the way up to Pea Ridge.  I'm also a Wal-Martian from way back and I'm pretty sure things have changed a bit as far as company culture. Hopefully they still have the people groups.. you really should ask about that. That really was a big help for me. I had just divorced and started my first same sex relationship the same time I started at the Home Office and the Pride group made me feel like less of a freak. I didn't know any other parents like me and that group cemented my comfort level at work. Bentonville has changed ALOT - over the last decade especially. Its downtown vibe has gotten pretty cool and I'm guessing by your age you'll be looking for an apartment. Tons of apartment complexes, most owned by Lindsey. WM's getting you fresh out of college, I'm betting!! Honestly Fayetteville would probably feel more comfortable with the UofA and constant influx of young adults. If you decide to do the drive you'll need a car with decent gas mileage! That's really probably the main thing. Do you live in Bentonville and deal with the crap traffic in town or do you drive in and deal with gas and Interstate 49? But take the opportunity! Use WM and if you like it here, stay. Raise a family or get a cat or a dog. If you don't, use it on your resume and move to a city that feels more you. It looks great on a resume tho. 😉🤞 Good luck!",t2_bk4ad8v,krfesle,1,1643836416.0,0,t1_hvbv0a2,hvbv0a2,True,Lxgic_,t3_sirhiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bentonville/comments/sirhiv/thinking_of_moving_here/,Thinking of moving here,/r/bentonville/comments/sirhiv/thinking_of_moving_here/hvbv0a2/,-1,r/bentonville,0,-1
"This was my experience growing up in the area, I went to Pea Ridge and have friends that went to Bentonville. Neither school observed it when we were in elementary school, but BV did when we were in HS, while Pea Ridge Never did. 

I very distinctly remember checking the days off list from school as a kid and it not being there, despite my friends in sunday school in Rogers not having school that day. When asked why this was, there not being ***any*** black kids in the school district was the answer given by the adults in my life at the time. I knew that was a lie though because there were 3 black students in the district when I went to school in Pea Ridge, they were the siblings of one of my best friends. They were special needs though, so I always assumed the school acted like they didn't exist since they couldn't challenge it (nor would my friend's mom because she adopted/fostered them for the state assistance because she was disabled herself) and there were no other black students, hence the ""enough"" wording. The fascist attitude that pervades the area really shines through when think back on that... When I caught up with a different elementary school friend who moved to Bentonville, and asked if she got MLK day off, she reported the same thing. My ex-wife who grew up in Bentonville reported the same thing for her early years when she was in public school in BV but got it off at the Art's school in Rogers.",t2_fwu08,xerox13ster,0,1643835844.0,0,t1_hvbte1s,hvbte1s,False,Lxgic_,t3_sirhiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bentonville/comments/sirhiv/thinking_of_moving_here/,Thinking of moving here,/r/bentonville/comments/sirhiv/thinking_of_moving_here/hvbte1s/,-4,r/bentonville,0,-4

As for entertainment options, they are somewhat limited unless you are into golf, mountain biking or recreational alcoholism. However, Fayetteville is a college town of moderate size, and is only about a 20 minute drive south.

"I'm going to be straight up honest with you the area is still pretty racist.

There's diversity, but Bentonville is still at its heart old small town, old money, old country, KluKluxKlan Southern.

There is no black culture that I'm aware of, most schools didn't observe MLK day because there were not enough black students.

Even after the ""progress"" we've made in diversity and acceptance, I still got stared at by people on the street for being trans for the past three years.

I'm ten years older than you, but I have plenty of fun. I think most folks who move into the area are late twenties to late thirties, so maybe older than you are looking for.

>I would just like some input on what bentonville has to offer

After the past decade or so of growth, it's basically a town entirely peopled with young professionals. Not everyone stays (Bentonville is very transient, but towards Fayetteville it's more long-term). We personally love the area and plan on staying long-term.

"I grew up in NWA and it's become so much more modernized while still keeping a great balance with nature that every time I think about moving away I can't find a better place.

The good:

This area is still growing, housing is not out of reach (yet), lots of opportunities, beautiful parks for hiking, biking, walking etc. There's even a newer dog park I discovered called Osage park that has a beautiful walking trail, archery area, food trucks, cherry blossom trees, a pavilion for live music. This area just keeps growing and a lot of it is fueled by Walmart money and other corps like Tyson and JB hunt. It does not have big city presence yet, but we have things like the Walmart AMP which has had big names like Travis Scott and activities like Top Golf. You have beaver lake, waterfalls, the elk river in MO or white river to kayak or float. One of our most popular hiking option is Devils Den which also has a beautiful little waterfall and walkway underneath it. Our closest amusement park is in Branson Mo, which is typically a drive under 2 hours away. We have casinos about an hour away. I haven't had a big issue with ticks and never seen a chigger in the 21 years I've lived here, but we have a lot of deer in the more wooded areas and those properties do have a tick problem. Don't roll in the forested area grass and buy flea and tick medicine for pets that you take on hikes.

The bad:

Our airport in Bentonville is better than we used to have but flying out isn't as cheap as other places. Our public transportation is almost non existent, we have a bus route but I rarely see it and it's not very accessible, you're going to need a car or a bike if you're fortunate enough to  live close enough to work. House and land prices are going up as the area becomes more valuable. You can see that the reddit for our towns here aren't big or widely used. Meetup is pretty dead here, there's no online community that's popular for this area as far as I am aware. Fayetteville is better for socialites, Bentonville is full of big money corporate folks and while people are nice there are definitely some big ego'd assholes or snobby people that I've come across. The rest of Arkansas is not great. We are apparently the Meth capital of the states, and it becomes more apparent the more South or East you go from NWA. We have a very very small homeless population, and unless you try looking for trouble or shady areas it's hard to encounter it in my experience. Overall NWA is a gem compared to the rest of the state and surrounding areas and it'll just keep getting better, like the fact that Bentonville is going to get a medical school soon.",t2_665e5bpz,IslandofEros,0,1643252948.0,0,t1_hue1llo,hue1llo,True,LAPG3,t3_sbt3iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bentonville/comments/sbt3iw/can_some_locals_chime_in/,Can some locals chime in?,/r/bentonville/comments/sbt3iw/can_some_locals_chime_in/hue1llo/,2,r/bentonville,0,2

"Re chiggers; I grew up in Arkansas and although chiggers are prevalent, they do not bother me any more than a day or so. The itch quickly fades away.  But I know people who've moved here from other areas that were never around them before and say the bites can itch for weeks.  But not everyone.  Some people don't even itch from the bites.

They are tiny bugs that get on you, inject an enzyme into your skin to liquify the flesh, eat that and then fall off, usually within 30 minutes or so. They do not burrow under your skin, etc. And AFAIK, do not carry diseases like Lyme, RMSP or alpha-gal, which ticks are known to carry.

I find the people in the city of Fayetteville to be more ""Southern"" and less standoffish, than Bentonville folk.  Somewhat fewer transplants, too.

"On the housing front there really is an over inflation that is not commensurate with the long term land availability, developer capacity or demand.

Check out [trailsoffroad.com](https://trailsoffroad.com) which is a handy tool to find tracks. For the best stuff you'll need to head towards Madison County (or even further towards the Jasper/Ponca area) but there is plenty of stuff in Benton or Washington counties as well.
