"To be honest I was just naming red states, I was too lazy to look up the ones that are claiming they have a homelessness decline, but I'm assuming some are saying that because it seems like every time I'm forced to watch Fox ~~News~~ Fake/ News, I hear them saying something like, ""california is a failed state, just look at the homeless problem compared to this red state"" but it is fox news saying it sooo yeah.....

The ways to solve homelessness cost money, but unfortunately most the time states choose the lest expensive option(jail), so it just a never ending cycle. Fortunately California has recently been trying harder to end homelessness, it involves, temporarily housing, alot of counseling, sometimes rehab, alot of scocial services to help with things like jobs, transportation, financial assistance and so on. 

Homeless people are still people, we are no better than they are. OP if you read this reach out the the most normal one, maybe try to help him or her out in a way (dont give them cash, maybe some food, an old tent your not using, dog food if they have a dog, alot of them do) and tell them you live at (point at your house) and tell them you live their with your husband and your retired disabled father (that way they think 2 men live with you, but also think someones always at your house) and ask them to look out for your house.

"There is a whole load that goes into that statement though. I know ai'm not some military analyst expert or anything but-

1. They are (by revised estimates) at minimum a major power (not a peer or near peer). This means what they are showing with their economic strength and their effectiveness in Ukraine is far from what we expected if them. It would still be wise to treat Russia as a near-peer from a cautionary standpoint but it looks more and more like they have fallen out of the near peer slot. Still, we don't want to fight a war that *could* be very costly either in dollars or lives and that we wouldn't really get anything out of. We can go stomp around in the sands for oil for a few decades but what would we get from defeating Russia? Angry Russians who would happily employ guerilla tactics against our occupying troops constantly.

2. MAD is a final resort. We don't even want to toe that line. We did that in the 80s and by all accounts, it sucked. We don't want to be destroyed and Putin may be plenty happy to rule over radioactive ashes. We're not entirely sure and we don't really want to find out the hard way.

3. Why poke the bear? They are showing that they are only a major power right now but they are most likely a sleeping giant. When they get rolling they are likely to be a powerhouse. Granted they are not nearly a powerhouse like the US is. 

4. The US has not stopped rolling since WW2. The US spends more every single year on our military industrial complex than most other nations combined. US: $780B  China: $250B. India: $73B. Russia: $62B. After seeing all of this shit go down, European countries are going to really ramp up their military expenditures. Germany is poised to quickly and effectively outspend Russia on their military. Many Russian neighbors are going to/starting to scramble to get into NATO. Most other countries do not have the decades of corruption that Russia has apparently been ravaged by.

Just because we very well could whoop them easily and quickly, it still wouldn't be worth it and we would most definitely be the major hitters of WW3. NATO without the US could still very likely crush Russia even if they were fully awake. But we don't want to also somehow drag China and whoever else into all of this. War is bad for our current world economy. For a small example of this, look at airline times, routes, costs, and destinations. Some big losers just got their asses handed to them thanks to Putin.

"Entitled to nothing, but expect royal treatment at every establishment they go too. Every service worker I know locally has stories about zonies.
I have seen them cordon of part of the beaches like literally blocking off public property for their own use. I have seen them build moorings in the sand for their own boats on the bayside (super illegal, I pay the city for mine) being drunk, rude, terrible music, trashy style. 

Hating them comes from 9-14 years ago when locals still lived in the beach areas. Zonies love pb in the summer. There was this huge, probably irrational hate against them for taking over the city and acting like d-bags. (You only notice the poorly behaved ones) now that pb and mb don‚Äôt really have an established group of long term residents.

CA plates in the belly of East County, not mad, just disappointed anybody could be that fucking stupid.  Granted, morning after St Pattys day...but I doubt an out of towner would be that God damn dumb.  They'll drive slow, but not lethally dangerous.

"According to this guy the main issue with the homeless is that they came from broken families with one parent in prison and one on drugs and the kids have no role models and are fending for themselves by the time they are 11 and often run away to get away from abuse or abject neglect. Many of them were also ""raised"" in foster care and molested by one of their foster parents, and again they run away.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzdHQUKYS3Q
If you find the video interesting, watch the guy's own youtube channel where he does long interviews with homeless people. It is very interesting and very sad. 

Messed up people procreate and have messed up kids, and those kids very often wind up homeless and with serious issues and that self medicate with drugs to deal with their lives.

This is one of the reasons I'm 100% in favor of allowing women the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy but also 100% in favor of the gov't funding the entire thing and having no restrictions at all on her right to have that procedure.

"Hello,
I‚Äôm sorry to hear about what you‚Äôre experiencing. I am a homeless outreach worker in downtown San Diego and I know agencies across the city that can assist. What I would recommend is calling the SDPD Homeless Outreach Team (HOT). They are police, but they are non-enforcement. They offer people shelter, detox and other programs that they might be interested in. However, they cannot force anyone to receive help, all they can do if offer the resources. If they are interested in a resource or a shelter, they will get in contact with the appropriate programs to assist them. Also, there is no guarantee that the person will be able to get into that program that same day due to availability. I struggle pretty much every day trying to get people into shelter because the bed availability runs out quick from all of the agencies that are referring people. Also, keep in mind that most programs and shelters are in downtown and most people living on the beach do not want to stay in downtown because the environment is worse. Call 619-446-1010 to leave a message for SDPD HOT.",t2_b01dr63l,SGEM_,0,1648266203.0,0,t1_i25jm7y,i25jm7y,True,Future-Worldliness-3,t3_tnpywq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/tnpywq/how_to_get_rid_of_the_drugshomelessness_on_the/,How to get rid of the drugs/homelessness on the street?,/r/sandiego/comments/tnpywq/how_to_get_rid_of_the_drugshomelessness_on_the/i25jm7y/,1,r/sandiego,0,1

"Molson Coors is not a ""Small brewery in Kentucky"".  


It's like 10 barrel the small branding was purchased by the huge corporate giant (like green flash was)...  it's just another front for them.  


IN this case they thought they were cleaver and intentionally went about designing the packaging to cause confusion in the marketplace.  


Their low end ""shit beer"" damaged the local Stone‚Ñ¢ brand's reputation by having people buy it, drink it and then have reason to go around badmouthing ""Stone‚Ñ¢"".  


Trust me, some business and marketing asshat over at corporate dreamed this up and sold the idea to the higher ups... they decided to roll the dice on it because stone and other quality craft brewers were eating away at their market.

"It's amazing to me how so many people out there have so little control over themselves and their emotions.

I had a similar incident happen to me a few days ago with some small-dicked fuckhead in a lifted truck. He even got in front of me and then tried to brake check me.

Funny actually, with these incidents it's ALWAYS been some hot-headed jackass in a lifted truck that think's he's badass. A year or two Before this recent incident, I had another one where for some reason another lifted truck was AGGRESSIVELY tailgating me as I pulled off the freeway. Mere inches from my bumper.

"Just want to add in that as a first responder in the county, I'd say approximately 50-60% of our 911 calls involve the homeless.

Often they lie about how critical their ""medical emergency"" is to get a faster response. Most of the time they just want a free ride to the hospital. Some even use 911 to get around the city, going from hospital to hospital. And we always have to take them due to San Diego's terrible EMS policies, even if they admit they have no medical complaint and just want a ride.

This directly impacts you because our 911 system is constantly swamped with these low acuity calls, which directly impacts response times for people who actually need emergency medical attention. We go level 0 (no ambulances in the entire county) almost weekly now and the huge homeless population here contributes significantly to that.

"**Free Virtual Talk - European Tapestries (1400-1700)**

March 31, 2022 / 11 a.m. to noon

""From 1400 through 1700, tapestries were popular in the courts and churches of Europe. Medieval and Renaissance rulers and church leaders lavished vast sums of money on tapestries which were woven from the rich materials and minerals of the old and new world. Considered a principal part of the flamboyant magnificence expected of the period, tapestries were produced using high/low-warp looms with many weavers taking a considerable amount of time to create. Join us for this docent-led talk to explore the fascinating art of tapestry.""",t2_bhu2b,MsMargo,0,1648255444.0,0,t1_i24yjkb,i24yjkb,True,MsMargo,t3_to9sbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/to9sbn/timken_museum_virtual_talk_on_european_tapestries/,Timken Museum Virtual Talk on European Tapestries - Mar 31st FREE!,/r/sandiego/comments/to9sbn/timken_museum_virtual_talk_on_european_tapestries/i24yjkb/,2,r/sandiego,0,2
"Well said, I made the mistake of telling a homeless guy to back the fuck up because he was scaring my dog while yelling at another homeless person. I was locking my bike up in front of a store and had my dog with me, the guy turned to me and when I saw the look in his eyes, I knew I had made a huge mistake. 

I'm a big guy, 6'1"" and 220lbs, and I grew up poor and had to defend myself or fight growing up, and that attitude of ""don't let anyone intimidate or take advantage of you ever"" is hard for me to let go of as an adult. 

This guy attacked me without hesitation, while screaming ""I have nothing to lose! I will fucking kill you!""  Over and over. Immediately I realized that if I engaged in a fight with him that something really terrible might happen. Luckily I was able to pick up my bike and swing it at him and hold him back just by holding my bike up so he couldn't reach me, but I also had my dog and she was going apeshit. If I had a gun I would have shot the guy for fear of my life. 

Some other homeless people and the people who work at the red and white market in oceanside came running up and new the guy, calmed him down and everything.

I've participated in the Point in Time Count for the past 7 years they've done it, one of the questions we ask is where did you sleep last night. This year, 9 out of the 15 people we counted were in jail last night. 

It's a revolving door so this strategy clearly isn't working, but why are you spreading the false narrative that 7 out of 180 accepted shelter when your primary source is FOX of all places? Even Fox argues in court that no one should take their stories as actual news, it's entertainment, which is why they didn't name any one and just said ""the city"".

My friend lived in a luxury building in Oakland that had less than 50% occupancy. When his last was renewed he paid the same rate with 3 months free rent and $2000 in rental credits.  They were desperate to keep him in there. 

Keep in mind that SF has houses, with in laws, luxury and regular apartments as well as public housing.  Many single family homes house multiple generations.

"Absolutely spot on. My husband is from east coast, I'm from midwest. We met in LA and moved to SD right before housing madness took off. I'm kicking my own a#% for not buying then. We make a great combined income but I still feel priced out of the real estate I'm interested in with the pricing increases and bidding wars. I refuse to take on a 1.3 or more mortgage to live in a place with perfect weather and great food. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. So we are in works to buy a new build in my home state for \~700k at 2700 sq feet, 4 beds, an office, a loft, and a flex space. We will be happy with our daughter in a safe area with great public schools (yay for no private school tuition) and a decent metro nearby with good food (maybe not LA or SD quality but good enough). That mortgage will allow us to maintain our lifestyle and not feel pressured to work or lose everything. Gas is also 2.50/gallon cheaper there right now, groceries are cheaper, and so is state income tax.

My landlord also tried to raise our rent from 3800 to 4200 this year, luckily was able to negotiate to 4k. I feel lucky to have negotiated that for a 1700 sq ft place. Just absolute insanity.

Nothing on PulsePoint. Not seeing any Sheriff ~~or Border Patrol~~ helicopters in the area either.

East County public safety repeater - police and border patrol seem to be looking for someone in the area. Just tuned in but I heard someone mention going up the *truck trail*.

**Possible** scenario based on what I‚Äôm piecing together: traffic stop where someone took off on foot. Person *might* be armed.

Keep in mind I came in late and I‚Äôm trying to piece it together between East-County wide police comms. I could be mixing stuff up. Figured I‚Äôd share with the caveat this is super preliminary and could be wrong.

"Blinds are not very efficient since they're already in your house so heat has already gotten in.

Maybe some awnings would be better, but still costs $$$.

It's better to just have dual pane glass windows that prevent heat from entering, yet allow light in, but that's even more $$$$.

I think one of the most cost effective options in the long run is to install a whole house fan and run that on a timer in the evenings to cool down the house and early morning to ""pre-cool"" the house for the hot day.  But again that costs $$.

Or just use a window air conditioning unit in your bedroom, stay in there, close the door and don't air condition the rest of the house.

"I have lived downtown for about 5 years now. I‚Äôve loved it but now I‚Äôm over it. The homeless encampment have been getting insane. There‚Äôs one across the street from my house now that keeps getting bigger and bigger. It always used to be a site for homeless but it was always only one or two and the cops would move them along after a day or so. But now since September/November the cops stopped doing that and it‚Äôs just insane. They have a fucking GENERATOR and lights and a couch and bed and all kinds of shit. 100,000% they‚Äôre just getting comfortable and settled in. They have 0 desire to improve their lives. They only want to make their current situation more comfortable. They run the generator late at night too and it‚Äôs annoying as fuck. Not to mention the same stories you‚Äôve shared of fights and needles and shit and piss smell everywhere. Open drug use, dealing, etc. I mean, there‚Äôs a Fuckin ‚Äúice cream truck‚Äù that comes by every night around 10pm. Music on and everything! üòÇüòÇüòÇ must be good ice cream! 

Anyway. I‚Äôm done with it. I spoke to the police and they basically told me they will not do anything about it. As much as I enjoy living in this part of the city, I‚Äôm going to look at places east like Santee or Lakeside. The #1 reason being that those cities don‚Äôt allow homeless. Simple as that. Sounds fucked up ‚Äúnot allowing homeless‚Äù but the fact is that their lifestyle and their choices are directly affecting my happiness and ability to live comfortably and have peace at home. 

And just to put things into perspective. I used to be homeless. I moved to San Diego with nothing like an idiot. I lived in my Mitsubishi Gallant after I drove here when I was 19. Now I‚Äôm 26, married, just had my first child this month, and I‚Äôm having success with my career. I do have empathy for the homeless but I‚Äôm at the point where I just don‚Äôt want it in my face anymore. And it will never change. It‚Äôs not going to change unless there‚Äôs a major political shift somehow and California becomes more Floridian. Or all of San Diego become more ‚ÄúEast-County-minded‚Äù regarding homeless. Which, obviously I highly highly doubt.  But it‚Äôs possible. I mean, communities like Encinitas and Del Mar and Carlsbad don‚Äôt allow homelessness. You can‚Äôt even sleep in your car there! And those places are considered liberal, I think. Anyway idk much about politics, it‚Äôs just an observation. 

So ya. There‚Äôs my two cents. Good luck! Sounds shitty but maybe try to do things that make them less comfortable outside your balcony? Set up a sprinkler every hour or so to spray water. Or maybe play music aloud that they probably won‚Äôt like. Idk. The police, the city, the county, the state‚Ä¶.

Refineries:

\- CA has a special blend of gas only produced in CA by aging refineries  
\- No new refineries have been built in 30 years  
\- Refineries go down with unplanned maintenance (things break) and supply is impacted

"I work in a lab with several other groups. My group focuses on mental health factors like self esteem and it‚Äôs relationship to justice involvement and efficacy to resist drugs. Our recent research that we are working on has a sample of 216 participants that identify with justice involvement. We did not screen for homelessness. Unfortunately. However, I can ask some of the other groups in the lab because their research may have screened for homelessness. I can try to get that data among their participants.  
However, here is some other research outside of our lab that may give you the answer you are looking for.

This is my own bias showing, but throughout my education and research, it is assumed that the two have a relationship based on replicated research. 
However, you can argue that there are multiple factors that do impact homelessness and substance abuse disorder and mental health.
