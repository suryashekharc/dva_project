My question is do you do any home evaluations? I had a PE come out to a home I just bought for an assessment regarding structural walls vs partition walls that we wanted to remove.

There are also weird things going on with the second floor joists around the chimney (one of those old kitchen chimneys that is non-useable now).

That and I am looking to have some plans potentially drawn up bc I might be pulling permits now...wasn't going to on the advice of a few people around here that are in the trades...but starting to think it might be a good idea.

"Agreed. Speed enforcement is lackadaisical in Lakewood. 

But, more importantly than active enforcement. Is passive enforcement. That is, the road itself forces you to slow down through design elements.

It's my \*strong\* belief that school zones should not start with painted lines, but instead a ""speed hump"" or a ""speed table"" that rated for at most 25 mph. Forcing drivers to go slow. \*And\* that the entirety of the school zone should be paved in brick, which is uncomfortable to drive on faster than 25mph. 

Yes, I know that these features would make school zones permanent. But what would you rather have? Cars flying down streets? Or cars being reminded periodically to go slow in town \*and\* for kids (and everyone) to be safer?

"We rent the top two floors of a 3-story and while it’s not the noisiest place I’ve lived, it’s certainly not noisproof in any way. Thankfully we have great neighbors below us but every closed door rattles the house and we can usually hear muffled talking. But when I’m in the basement doing laundry i can hear just about every word of our neighbors conversation above me as if i was in the room. And our floors creak like you wouldn’t believe which is to be expected for a 100+ year old building with original floors. Our neighbors have mentioned the sound is very loud for them but thankfully they don’t seem to be fazed by it.

We use the 3rd floor as our bedroom areas to mitigate noise from below, but keep in mind that the 3rd floors in Lakewood homes were basically attics, never meant to be lived in. That’s not to say some landlords haven’t gone to great lengths to modernize that space, but in ours, getting heat/air up there is a never-ending battle.  

If you are adverse to noise in a shared space my recommendation is to get a top floor apartment but still expect at least a moderate amount of noise. If your space includes a 3rd floor level, definitely ask a lot of questions about climate up there or even better, when you do a tour, make sure to really assess that area and take off your jacket to see how warm it is…oh, and also make friends with your downstairs neighbors if possible.

"I grew up in Lakewood and was a teenager when this happened, I'm very surprised I have absolutely no recollection of this, in fact I don't even remember this store at all. Definitely a blind spot in my childhood memories I guess. 

Anyway, this is a few days late but 100 percent up my alley so I wanted to chime in - 

You can always email libraries, archives, historical societies, etc and request information, just include all the important details (description of the event, the date, location, etc) and ask for scans of any relevant newspaper clippings. Most of the time you will be able to get a few documents sent over to you no problem. 

CPL almost certainly has microfilm scans of 1997 Plain Dealers, I'd suggest contacting them if you want more than a copy paste of the article. I have emailed them a number of times for old Cleveland Press clippings and they  are always super nice and helpful and send their findings over pretty quickly.

The Lakewood Sun Post probably published an article about this, but I'm not sure where their archives would be or how accessible they would be to someone out of state. 

I have accounts with two paid newspaper archive sites (newspapers.com and newspaperarchive.com) and neither have any article about this fire. (Wasn't expecting anything, but worth a check nonetheless). 

I also have access to the Plain Dealer archives mentioned above and found a follow up article from 2000 that I thought you might be interested in - 

> AQUATIC RETAILERS CHARGED IN'97 FIRE LAKEWOOD BUILDING BURNED TO GROUND
August 5, 2000 | Plain Dealer, The (Cleveland, OH)

> The owners of the Undersea World aquarium store have been charged with insurance fraud and arson in the July 1997 fire that destroyed their store, two other businesses and 16 apartments.

> On Thursday night, a Cuyahoga County grand jury indicted Wayne C. Francis, 35, of Cleveland on one count of insurance fraud and 34 counts of arson, while Leonard A. Ferrante, 63, of Cleveland was indicted on one count of insurance fraud. The two were arrested later that night and were in County Jail yesterday.

> Prosecutor Mark Mahoney said Francis and Ferrante owed $32,000 the day their store burned down. ""Their business was heavily in debt and the primary motive was financial gain through the insurance proceeds,"" Mahoney said.

> The two were to collect $200,000 in insurance money, he said.

> Dozens of tenants at Detroit and Ethel avenues were displaced by the fire. At the aquarium store, hundreds of fish perished while local firefighters were able to rescue dozens of reptiles and amphibians.

> At the time of the incident, Francis said he had lost more than $100,000 worth of fish he kept in 400 aquariums.

> About 60 firefighters battled the fire for eight hours, but in the end, the three-level building had to be demolished. One person was treated for smoke inhalation.

> Friendly Mini-Mart owner Tony Eadeh, whose store was destroyed in the blaze, rebuilt next door to the now empty lot. Recently, a Denny's restaurant tried to move into the vacant property but was rebuffed by residents and council members.

Friendly Mini Mart moved west across Ethel, which  a couple of years ago turned into Caps N Corks.

Where Friendly Mini Mart was on the east corner, all that was torn down.  An IHOP was there for a min.  Now its a mexican restaurant, Cozumel.

"Slow driver here.  I frequently drive E-W through Lakewood.

On Clifton, the lights seem to be timed so that maintaining an average speed of around 30mph will hit all greens.  So, I typically do 30 to avoid stop and go.  I make a point to drive in the right lane when I'm doing this to be considerate and allow passing.

On Lake, there are bumpy sections that I slow down for, and the lights don't seem to be timed in any useful way, so there tends to be a lot of variation in speed.  As on Clifton I like to try to make the lights, so when I'm approaching a red light from a distance I'll max out around 25-30mph and coast instead of rushing up to the red and stopping.  I usually don't have a chance to get up to the speed limit except between Warren and Webb.

On Franklin, the houses are built so close to the road that you don't see traffic coming from the side streets until they are nearly at the stop bar.  I've had enough near misses with people attempting a rolling right turn that I usually drive slower to leave more time to react.  On top of that, traffic usually makes driving faster not worth it.  You're pretty much guaranteed to get hung up by the high school during school hours.  During rush hour, there are lots of people on the side streets near Warren and Bunts trying to go straight across Franklin (presumably to avoid traffic on these major streets), and they often dart across at the smallest break in traffic.  With these hazards I just drive a little slower.

On Riverside I like to do the speed limit when I can.  Still, there are a few intersections and bends that you have to slow down for, so once you get up to speed you're not likely to be able to maintain it for very long.  There's not much point to gunning it only to have to slow down soon, so slower and easier is usually the way it goes.

I get the speeds they promise/I pay for.  I don't see dips in bandwidth at peak hours like I would with AT&T.  AT&T's equipment burned-out a pretty nice router; Cox's equipment has never done anything damaging to our router.  Cox hasn't hurt my equipment nor given subpar service so far.

My wife and I decided to try out AT&T one year to try and consolidate our bills a little.  Cox pulled one annoying thing some years prior so it seemed ok.  Every month of being with AT&T was something negative.  The first half of this year AT&T was just plain random with if there was service at all.

I see people in the literal street walking because they can't use the sidewalks. Not to mention the USPS people and the other delivery. Yes, this is a big storm but even when 1 inch falls it's  insane that people don't try to  make their jobs or their neighbors lives a bit easier and would rather  just sit on their thumbs in Browns pajama pants.

"DETAILS:

\*Sorry for poor audio quality and camera angles, I was the only other person around, and being a young woman I was worried for my own safety by moving closer.

\*The man was already in the car by the time I got there. so I am not witness to the entire incident.

Everything I could hear:

Man yelling ""I cant breathe"" and ""help me"" repeatedly.

Man: ""My name is Edward \[inaudible\]"" (I believe he said Edward, I could be wrong)

Officer 1: ""That means you lied earlier about your name?""

Man: ""No, my name is Edward \[inaudible\]""

...

Man: ""Oww, you hurt my \[inaudible\]""

Officer 2: ""Well if you'd sit still and stop being a jackass it probably wouldn't hurt so much""

\[inaudible yelling\]

....

I later called the LPD and spoke to Officer Shead, who said he was supervising the shift. The whole conversation he had a lighthearted tone to his voice, was laughing in a conversational way. I described what I witnessed and told him word for word what I had heard, and expressed that I was concerned for the mans safety. He told me the man was ""safe"" in custody at the police dept. He then explained that the man was ""causing a scene"" and ""being difficult"" at the hospital, so the staff called the police. I told him that I didn't doubt that he was being difficult, but that doesn't justify the actions and words of the officers. He said he agreed and that they would look at the bodycam footage. He did not ask for any additional info from me. I told him the numbers on the police cars, and which officer was the one who swore at the man. He told me he was the supervisor and and reiterated that they would look into the situation, I asked for his name and we hung up.

I am upset and disgusted by the ways these officers chose to handle this situation. It was a complete abuse of power, and I am posting this because they need to know that they will be held accountable for their actions.

If anyone knows who the man being arrested was, feel free to message me.

"Fortunately or unfortunately, energy efficiency does not make ""economic sense"". You have to do it because you want your house to be comfortable and/or you want to use less energy, but the energy efficiency gains are not going to pay for the project. If they did we'd all be living in well insulated homes. 

We also have a drafty Lakewood century home and have done some intermediate sealing and insulating improvements (rim joist attic air sealing + blown cellulose in the attic). It absolutely helps, but it is still drafty. 

I would recommend first air sealing you home so the conditioned air doesn't escape. This will take the form of new windows, new doors, weatherstripping, outlet gaskets, just sealing the million leaks in your air envelope. After the house is actually not losing too much air should you insulate. I've heard it explained as wearing a cable knit sweater or a wind breaker. Sure the wind breaker doesn't have any insulation, but it is warmer in most situations because your heat isn't escaping

We had a comprehensive energy audit done by Energy Smart Ohio, who I highly recommend. They took a bunch of measurements, did a blower door, some thermal imaging, and modeled the energy usage of our home. They estimated it would take ~$10-15K worth of spray foam to get our house where we wanted it. It didn't make sense for us so we bought space heaters and started planning a home renovation.",t2_kaszr,agiantamongmolecules,0,1610218415.0,0,t1_gioi6bk,gioi6bk,True,cbrian13,t3_jvt0sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakewood/comments/jvt0sz/home_energy_assessment_new_insulation/,Home energy assessment / new insulation,/r/lakewood/comments/jvt0sz/home_energy_assessment_new_insulation/gioi6bk/,2,r/lakewood,0,2

"There's a lot of info out there on the web on home efficiency and insulation, so you can do a ton of research if you're so inclined. For example, I used this and found it useful in helping me know what to google: [https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/publications/pubdocs/DIY\_Guide\_2016.pdf?1fd9-89ac](https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/publications/pubdocs/DIY_Guide_2016.pdf?1fd9-89ac)

&#x200B;

It kind of comes down to budget, and how long you're going to be in the house. Drafts make you feel cold, but insulation will help you heat and cool the whole building. So, if your main complaint is that you can't heat/cool the building to a set point, focus on insulation. If your main complaint is that you feel drafts, focus on air sealing and windows/doors.  


Of course, windows and doors are really expensive, and there are a lot of shady companies in that trade for some reason. We've had pretty good luck with Integrity Windows, (also in Lakewood) as they were way less sketchy than all the other companies we got quote from, and very competitive on price.  


I was lucky in that my house came with new-ish windows and doors, so I was able to add some caulking to the seams around the windows to reduce drafts, and the panes do an OK job keeping the drafts out and the warm in.  Next, I air sealed around the basement rim joists. Basically what's shown here: [https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/insulate-basement-rim-joists/](https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/insulate-basement-rim-joists/) It was super easy to do, and I think made a big improvement.  


Finally, I had celluose blown in to attic. This fixed the issue where in the summers, the second floor would be hotter than the outside (not ideal.) I paid Berry Insulation to do this- you can DIY it, but it sucks.  They're local and familiar with the dominion credit so they know how to take advantage of it to get a good return on the investment.  


I was lucky enough that my exterior walls were apparently already insulated when a previous owner put vinyl siding on the house, so that didn't need done.   


If this is your forever home, I'd start with the small stuff (basement air seal, sealing window fixtures, insulation in the attaic) and see how big an improvement it is. If it's not good enough, then you're looking at spending more money with windows, doors, and blown in insulation in the walls.  


As someone else said, before you get anything blown in, make sure there's no knob and tube in that area.

"Hey there. Similar situation here in Lakewood. My 1919 house has no insulation what so ever, so yes the upstairs will get very cold in the winter and hot in the summer. I've been in the house about 2 years and have dealt with the no insulation thing at first, but this year I was ready to get it blow in for the attic. Had a few companies come over during the summer for quotes. Was all set to do it until I started doing research on knob and tube wiring and insulation. I would first make sure you don't have that before getting any insulation because that could be a fire hazard. If Dominion came over for the energy assessment, they should have flagged that. Companies that are affiliated with them for the rebates won't do the work unless you get the wiring updated/replaced, so make sure of that first. If that is not an issue, then you should be good to go for the insulation. 

As for replacing doors/windows, we replaced 2 of our older doors and got new storm doors installed. This definitely makes a difference. Our windows are about 10-15 years old so we haven't replaced any of those. But if you have original windows/doors, I would think replacing them would help your situation. I would say get those done first then get the insulation. In the meantime you can get window units for the upstairs for the summer and space heaters for the winter if it's unbearable. Or try closing registers downstairs when you sleep. If you plan on being in the house for 10 years, it would probably be worth it IMO.",t2_e9end5m,cutsandcheese,0,1605641627.0,0,t1_gcn3ws9,gcn3ws9,True,cbrian13,t3_jvt0sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakewood/comments/jvt0sz/home_energy_assessment_new_insulation/,Home energy assessment / new insulation,/r/lakewood/comments/jvt0sz/home_energy_assessment_new_insulation/gcn3ws9/,3,r/lakewood,0,3
"Almost always, upgrading windows for a better R-value is not worth the cost. I ran some numbers and in our climate upgrading from an r-value of 1 to 5 in your window will save ~$2-$7.50 per year per window (savings depends on your natural gas provider... there's a recent thread in /r/cleveland about changing it, that will honestly save you more than any efficiency updates). That's assuming that you have literally the worst windows and are upgrading to top of the line.

**edit**  
What replacing windows can do though is fix air gaps and leakages in the frame itself. That will be a much bigger savings than the window itself, but can be done without replacing the actual window. If you go that route though you generally have to tear off trim, siding, drywall, or all of the above and if you're going to do that anyway might as well go the whole way and replace the window too.",t2_7mo5v,ASOT550,0,1605641277.0,0,t1_gcn35vx,gcn35vx,True,cbrian13,t3_jvt0sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakewood/comments/jvt0sz/home_energy_assessment_new_insulation/,Home energy assessment / new insulation,/r/lakewood/comments/jvt0sz/home_energy_assessment_new_insulation/gcn35vx/,6,r/lakewood,0,6

Definitely check out all of the wonderful parks. I love that Lakewood Park is just a quick walk down the street. Check out the Cleveland Metro Parks website for a complete list of their parks and activities.

"Along with the what the other commenters said about the food and parks, the bike culture is huge down here!! You can ride your bike everywhere. I’ve noticed everyone is always so friendly and accepting (obviously you get people who aren’t everywhere). But it really is a great place to be! 

The truck park that someone else mentioned is a lot of fun (but it does get packed during peak hours like they said). We love edgewater and Lakewood park. Also, if you have a dog, there is a huge dog beach at edgewater, and there is a dog park down in the metro parks on the west side of Lakewood!

During not peak hours, the Lakewood Truck Park (outdoor bar and food truckery) is a good time, but it can get packed and unreasonable. As another commenter said, there certainly is a lot to do, so I won't go into all the other specifics, but this is a place where you can continuously explore and find new cool things every year.

"I live on the east side again but lived on the boarder of lakewood for 10 years. I have the privilege of knowing about both sides of town and even more. If you like Hispanic food you'll be pleased. There's a large Hispanic population on the west side . North East OH is a melting pot of cultures which i love  . Also a Lakewood has a large LGBTQ community  . There's plenty to do almost too much . Lots of nice bars ,restaurants, shops,arcade on Madison and Detroit. Your like 5 min from Edgewater Park/Beach which is really nice . Drive down 5min into Cleveland and hit up the West 65th district for more food and drinks . West 25th is a nice area ,I like Town Hall ,ABC ,Ohio City Burrito. 5 more min down to Tremont area Bourbon Street Barrel Room and Edisons Pizza are to die for . North of Tremont 5min to the Flats tou have the IMPOV and several restaurants and bars . 5min from there you'll hit downtown ,stadiums , Rock Hall Of Fame, Science Center ,Casinos, Insomnia Cookies ,more restaurants.We love riding the motorized scooters that are around and we ride them and restaurant and bar hop from downtown to the flats to west 25th to Tremont and back. It's getting cold now so outside dinning and entertainment is shutting down. The area is really alive during the summer and there is so much more to do .

"Free? Not all that much aside from the Metroparks. I can tell you where else is worth a visit though.

Sidequest has tabletop games that are free to play so long as you buy a beer or something, they also have a pretty good Nerds Who Drink quiz night that is especially popular in the winter. Just avoid that jumped up prick with the beard.

Too many bars and restaurants to count. Make sure you check out Griffin Cider House down by Birdtown for gin night, 16 bit on any nights except Friday and Saturday, Cleveland Curiosities, and karaoke night at Casey Jones Tavern is always something to behold.

Over on the East side of Cleveland is Skidmark Garage which has woodwork and motorcycle workshops which they rent for a fee and they occasionally do wood or metal working classes if you want to learn something new. They also have a bi-weekly comedy night that is currently closed.

There are plenty of theaters in the area, Beck has classes, so if you want to learn to tap dance or play an instrument that's there. And if you feel dramatic you could audition for a role. Same goes for Cleveland Public Theater and Near West. Capitol Theater is a great spot to catch some more obscure cinema.

Also there are loads of good museums, Great Lakes Science Center is a fav, but the art museum is also a must do. 

But of course, a lot of inside stuff is questionable at the moment, especially the theaters, and some or all of the above may or may not be happening.

He’s a vet and he’s a bit odd but not harmful at all. Sleeps in his car. Use to hang out over by mahalls but I guess he moved over there. Always kind and quiet.

"Can't agree on the duplex comments. There are many examples of duplex decay, where out of town landlords just keep collecting the $$ and do not maintain the property. It's especially noticeable when there are many of them on a street. Plus, many of the duplex renters are short-timers who tend to have less invested in their residency- financially and from a neighborhood building standpoint. Meaning they act like shites because they are short-timers.",t2_tpd6d5p,The_Kielbasa_Kid,0,1602246149.0,0,t1_g87k3df,g87k3df,False,jfurd1337,t3_j59tvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakewood/comments/j59tvy/wife_and_i_are_looking_to_move_to_lakewood/,Wife and I are Looking to Move to Lakewood!,/r/lakewood/comments/j59tvy/wife_and_i_are_looking_to_move_to_lakewood/g87k3df/,1,r/lakewood,0,1
