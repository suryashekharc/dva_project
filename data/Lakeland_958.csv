Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

I don't have a mobile mechanic. So I know this isn't specifically what you're looking for but Elite Automotive in North Lakeland is fantastic. They have 100% of my business. I've gone there several times expecting to spend 1-2 grand and came out spending around $100. The last time I was there they fixed my car for free. Not saying that everyone is going to have the exact same experience but they are honest and do good work. I've also had a couple of major repairs with them and they've done it right.

"Yeah I understand that stance, I’ve bought a little guide book, read a ton of blogs and watched a million YouTube videos to see it done by an actual person. I know there’s a Florida foraging community that holds classes but I don’t think it’s anywhere close to local. I’m not even thinking about mushrooms right now (even tho chanterelles are super tempting) and I’m not even going to take a chance with anything that has a poisonous lookalike, like elderberry.

i need someone to tell me what's what, and then reinforce that information several times - especially with plants because they're all the same to me - in order for me to actually learn.

"It depends on what you're looking for. I've found honey mushrooms, passionfruit, and goldenrod at Loyce E. Harpe park, oyster mushrooms and grapefruit at Circle B, pawpaws at the Lakeland Highlands Scrub, persimmons at Marshall Hampton... Instead of looking for places to forage, try looking at what's in season and finding the ecosystems those foods grow.

I'd caution you about foraging at Circle B. They're spending a ton of time and resources restoring ecosystems and habitats out there, and gathering is not allowed. The same is true in other state parks like Colt Creek. Just be careful! There can be fines for gathering some things. Nobody's going to hassle you over mushrooms or common plants!

"i've had to call a few times since january. each time i call, i ask ""what day is my trash pick up day?"" ""what day is today?""   


the answer is ""friday"" and ""monday"" but i also get a little nugget of info:

""there arent any notes here about why the driver didnt pick up in your neighborhood.""  


i dont think so much as a labor shortage, i think it's the drivers they actually have just skipping over areas. the hours are 6am-6pm. they're obviously not doing that. they need to be removed and replaced from the pool of laborers in the county. before my trash if it wasnt picked up friday, it would be picked up saturday morning and that's fine. but now im looking at a few days after in my area.  


as for ""who does it"" i actually prefer the county doing it. we have county trucks pick up in our neighborhood. i grew up in central lakeland with county trucks picking up the trash. something happened between then and now that there's two different entities but both being governed by our government that one isnt doing it's job.   


i dont know if anyone remembers how even worse off we were when bfi was doing out pick up, and during hte hurricane in 2017 they abandoned their contract. i'd had to call often because i would have a can out there for 2 weeks, before the MONTH after the 2017 hurricane. 

we even had a down tree on a powerline cutting power off to hundreds of families and blocking the only road into two parts of the neighborhood that was down for a week. it took neighbors chopping it apart to get things going. this was lakeland electric's doing though. which is just more bizarre, because we're on lakeland electric grid, but we have to deal with incorporated/unincorporated bullshit. just do the job we some how pay to do.",t2_3irq41o0,THE_DARK_ONE_508,0,1645037157.0,0,t1_hx7f9hy,hx7f9hy,True,brokerrobtampa,t3_stx87s,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakeland/comments/stx87s/this_trash_situation_has_gone_on_too_long/,This trash situation has gone on too long...,/r/lakeland/comments/stx87s/this_trash_situation_has_gone_on_too_long/hx7f9hy/,1,r/lakeland,0,1

">While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.”  
The owner of the house went outside and said to them, “No, my friends, don’t be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don’t do this outrageous thing. Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don’t do such an outrageous thing.”  
But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.  
When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. He said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.  
When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.

"Guys / gals - this is directly aimed at me. I would only ask you read the whole thing - then downvote me. 

 I'm a lifelong polk county resident, 30+ of those years in Lakeland, a reddit member for over ten years (8 or 9 on this account) and would like to reply.

First (and foremost) - I'm sorry I broke the rules of the sub. I did review them first and it didn't appear to be breaking any of them. I sincerely apologize. 

Second - there seems to be some misconception that I was trying to rip people off / steal data / scam / turn people's houses into cell towers. 

As I mentioned (privately) to the mod(s) - that the best I can hope for at this point is to break even. The only people that would likely benifit was anyone intrested and the public. This is why I didn't think this would qualify as  ""business solitation prohibited"".

In my now deleted post, I agreed with a poster who said anyone intrested should be leery of ANYONE messing with their internet. I expressly said that additional conversations would need to be had and I wanted all parties to be comfortable. 

As for a scam - it's not, and, beyond being willing to wear a sandwich board at the corner on N Fl Ave and 92 that says ""I'm a liar and a theif - Grady, please arrest me."" if I said anything untrue - I have nothing else to offer. 

Finally - as for wanting to turn people's houses into cell towers, the thing I was looking to put up looks like a small PVC pipe, as high as my hip and and about as big around as a quarter.

Again, I'm am sorry. For those who took the time to read this, I appreciate it and I'm prepared to accept my humiliation now...

PS - to the mods, as I mentioned privately, I do appreciate your efforts as well.

PPS - If you didn't see it, it's gone now, and that's for the best. I cross-posted it in Winter Haven, but I deleted that on my own.

"On 12.05.2021 Antonio ""Tony"" Smiley was hit by a van and killed. The van never stopped and his family is devastated. No parent should have to bury a child. I've known Tony's sister for years. Their family is a close family and this is hurting them horribly. If you know anything please contact LPD, his mom Sara Smiley, his sister Candra Smiley or myself and I'll make sure it gets too the right people. You can stay anonymous and submit a tip to heartland crime stoppers, we just  want Tony's killer to face justice. 


This happened on 1st street nw in the Kathleen area. Sadly Tony want the only one to lose his life on that stretch of road. 2 months before Tony was his a 19 year old named  Einlanzer Gore was also hit and killed. The driver stopped in that case. Tony's mom Sara and Einlanzer Gore's family have been working together to make that stretch of road safer. I will link the abc action news story as well as the change petition.

Antenna's are quick to get, but it's usually another $150 for the wire, lightning arrester and decent antenna 5.8 or 8 Dbi depending on the location.

"Helium is a crypto-backed IoT communications network. OP is trying to find new sites to install their radios of which a portion of the profits will be shared with the host. These radios can earn a few hundred dollars a month currently, but the profits are rapidly falling.

I think this would be fine if it were a commercial MNO network like Verizon, At&T, or other private provider looking to build a tower but Helium is explicitly made for the consumer.

"Medical Marijuana Treatment Clinics of Florida (MMTC). They have an office off S FL Ave, $300 initial visit. I *think* they can diagnose as they have a doctor on staff, but if you've already got any qualifying diagnosis with another doc just bring your records & it's easier. Once they submit your info to the state agency, you get yourself set up on the Medical Marijuana Use Registry website & pay $75 to process the license. You'll get an email in roughly a week that you're good, the dispensaries can then look you up in the system until your physical license gets mailed. You've got to renew every 6 months, so MMTC will keep you set up on schedule and it's $100 for every renewal appointment.

We took him out for a year because of the pandemic (wife was working from home) he's now behind in daycare (and they're not really doing much to corral him in to learn - and we're telling him to listen to his teachers and trying to work with him at home). he really only wants to play - and i think that has a lot to do with him being out of daycare for so long because he's not experienced with ""ok, we're learning now."" also, fun thing, he's just gone back to school after being home from school with covid. we're vax'd and boostered and take every precaution when out in public if we have to be there. he was ""the only one that had covid"" which i find very hard to believe.

"There is only a waitlist for Charter/Magnet schools. For your child to get in to the public elem/middle/HS in your zone, there is no waitlist, you just have to go to the school and enroll the student with 2 forms of ID and proof of residency. If you want your child to attend a school that you are not zoned for, and it is public (not charter/magnet), then you have to apply for a zone transfer and wait until it is approved. Then you can follow the above method to get them registered. For VPK, you have to apply for VPK during the open enrollment period for free VPK, and you have your choice of where you'd like for them to go. I believe that does have an enrollment structure, and is different at every school EXCEPT charter/magnet - they follow the same open enrollment as the elem.

Because this will have effects within our school libraries regardless.

And here's the kicker: They were backordered on their regular filters at the time, so they used a replacement brand. On my way home, I lost oil pressure and managed to get parked safely. Called them right away. Within 20 minutes, the manager used his personal vehicle to pick up a filter from Advance, drove to me and replaced everything in the parking lot. No questions asked, no issues, and super friendly and apologetic the whole time.

"fuck tower hill.out of the blue in march 2021 under threat of canceling our home ownership policy we had to get a new roof in 60 days. we scrambled to find a roofer, a down payment, got a loan, and i was laid off.  it was replaced before that period was over. they canceled our policy anyway. they had no intention of keeping the policy.

now im 6k more in debt i probably didnt need.

on top of that, when we were first signed up, we had complete imbeciles working with our account. they would ask for information for something that they had plenty of time to ask for, but after asking it was far too late when they would get the results. like on a wednesday at 4:45pm, ""i need you to get this from your bank. our guy found you needed it monday. we need it thursday morning or we have to start over and we cant cover you.""

this was the kind of thing where i had a job where i could easily chase this information down during work hours and not disturb my work day. they were contacting my wife, and there was more of a delay getting this to me. we asked them to start including me in the conversation or sending messages to me directly. we kept getting this ""we need it now!"" and not including me in these messages kind of shit, and i flat out called them and said ""get this imbecile off our account and get us someone that isnt a moron."" and they did. then things were fine with the new person. but as insurance companies go - you dont stick with one rep, you're tossed in a pool and a bunch of people dig at your account. and we'd ended up with numerous shit heads since.

we have insurance through state farm now, and though it was wonky at first, we're fine. the shit for brains that cancelled our policy at tower hill expected us to renew with her anyway AT INCREASED RATES, and rather than that happen we strung her along while we were working with state farm and ghosted.

midflorida i had when i was younger but it turns out it was inconvenient because it was opened when i went off to college, but the city i went to didnt have a midfla in sight(""yeah! we have branches there!"" lie). so the account was eventually closed. i opened a new one when we were saving for a house, then it turned into my tertiary bank account. they were charging for not having a minimum balance - where we'd signed up for a no minimum account during one of their sign up drives. it was 5 bucks a pop. i would pay back into the account to reach the minimum and then i'd find i was charged another 5 dollars. it turned into me owing them money for an account that was a back up account that was intended not to watch. i will never again have an account with mid florida as long as i live.  


publix credit union does have a minimum, but it's for savings only (and it's 2 dollars). if you get a savings account and a checking account you can get a third account for a second savings account. this is good. the catch is you cant withdraw from that third account more than 5x a month.

"Yeah T-Mobile sucked for me about 5 or 6 years ago, crazy that they haven't gotten any better with all the acquisitions. Now they're 3 sucky companies under one umbrella, hah. 

Verizon has the best call quality, but you can't go wrong with AT&T either. My SO and I have Cricket, uses AT&T's towers but the rate is much cheaper + unlimited data and free HBO Max. T-Mobile has a lot of dead spots around the county, especially Auburndale and Eagle Lake. You might consider switching to a better carrier if you travel a lot. Forget any service if you travel Bradley Junction towards Manatee county.

"You're sort of all over the place here.  

Your first example is up for debate.  There are places that allow doctor-assisted suicide, and there's both a moral and medical discussion to be had.  And everything after the word ""because"" may or may not be relevant.  Phrasing it as a declarative sentence doesn't make it true.  There are plenty of instances where there are valid reasons to end one's life.  Is it moral?  I'd argue that, yes, it is sometimes moral.

Your second example is loopy.  But I think your point here is that you're equating abortion with an unnecessary procedure.  Is it?

And of course, the old chestnut about ending a child's life.  Anti-choice individuals have been making that argument since they were tricked into believing abortion wasn't a medical decision, so there's plenty of literature that both supports and counters that statement.  I won't bore everyone with repeating that here.

The last bit is, of course, missing the forest for the trees.  Legality is not morality.  Particularly in this litigious, vengeful society we've constructed.  So you'd have to ignore all that to begin to believe that violent crimes that kill a pregnant woman are a counter-argument to abortion.  You don't *really* believe that, do you?

And for the record, legality isn't medicinal either.  But you already know that.  

So basically, you're drawing these lines between only-related-if-you-squint items to abortion as some sort of intellectual justification that abortion after 15 weeks shouldn't exist.  But you should probably strengthen your argument if you want to convince anyone.  Or, if you see it as strictly a moral issue, say so and stand by that conviction.
