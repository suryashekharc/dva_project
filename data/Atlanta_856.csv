In another of my comments I made on this post I mentioned being stopped with a set of lock picks. It’s also legal and has been proven in court as not evidence of a potential crime. 

But you also have to accept that some cops simply don’t care and will detain you until they are tired of holding you. 

So again legal but understand the risks.

Finally I wasn’t trying to convince the OP of anything. He seems like he was just looking for encouragement.

"It can be a deterrent if someone looks up and sees a camera and decides to move on. Basically a principle of security is the criminal is going to look for an easy mark. You can't really stop the crime, but you can make it more difficult. So a fence, that's an obstacle. Bars on the window, that's another obstacle. Lighting (cheapest way to increase security) that's another hindrance. Every layer which makes it more difficult or dangerous for the criminal, the more secure your location is.

"This is great advice. I love West End and Westview too. There's nice neighbors there and the historic  housing stock is nice. It's definitely increased in price since I lived in Castleberry, but that was quite a while ago. I also like Capitol View and have thought hard about that neighborhood. Wotj my experience in Grant Park in the 2000s (which was only minor crime) and Castleberry in the 2010s (which was pure lawlessness 😂), I think I'd be fine with any roughness that may (or may not) exist in Capitol View in the 2020s. 

I also like Adair Park, Sylvan Hills, all the way down to East Point and College Park, too, except for the airport noise. It seems like a slightly slower pace down there, not as much hustle and bustle and few hipsters. That will probably change a lot. I don't need to be in a trendy neighborhood.

We were priced out of EAV when we were looking three years ago.  Since then, that whole area is popping off especially the parts of Memorial adjacent to EAV.  We ""settled"" on Summerhill and in the three years we've been here it's gone bananas to the point where us three years ago would have been priced out.  Point being, if you've got the money to be competitive on a house in EAV you've got the money to buy into Pittsburgh or West End or some other similar neighborhood where prices are lower.  If you make the right choice in a few years you'll be in a place you like and on the right side of the crazy appreciation.

"The house was near EAV. Nothing particularly special about it besides the interior paint in my opinion. We loved it because it had a flat yard but it was by far the smallest house in the neighborhood.

From what the seller's agent was telling us about the type of offers she was receiving, she gathered that it was an out of state investor looking to rent it out. She actually received 16 conventional offers and 3 cash offers. The house was on the market for only 3 days. I don't have $500K+ cash sitting around to buy a home and the average buyer probably doesn't either.

It's certainly a sellers market but unless you are looking to leave the city altogether or move deep into the burbs it's not worth the hassle of competing for a new home. I think houses are selling at values based purely on speculation rather than demand. Opposite of the current car market. Compared to other homes in our current area that have recently sold, our house which we bought 3 years ago, has jumped over 40% in value in that time frame.

"Oh that's got to be frustrating 😔 Have you been shopping for long? Was there anything particularly unique about the house that might make it extra competitive? (Location, layout, maybe some unique factor)? 

Are you sure this wasn't a seller just not wanting to work with someone who makes such offers? Maybe the seller wants their house to go to someone who they see as not an investor, and they are assuming that type of offer was an investor offer? 

Just a thought/brainstorm. Not trying to be antagonistic. 

I have thoughts about selling as well, as my home price has doubled since I bought several years ago. But I am on the fence about which offers I might consider. 

Part of me would want to sell to a first time home buyer who is trying to buy with a conventional loan, as this house is my first house. It was also the first house of the owner before me. So it's been a ""first house"" for 22 years now. And I think it's received a lot of pride of ownership over the years because of that.  

Part of me would love to get an offer like yours, although my house likely would not receive such an offer 😂. But maybe one more proportional to its value, who knows. It's a nice house on an East Cobb cul-de-sac with all other houses on the cul-de-sac being longtime homeowners (of 20-30 years). It is quiet, safe, nature-y, kinda boring 😂

I would also feel pressured to take the highest offer so that I could have more for rolling it into the next house, which 90% confidence would not be in metro Atlanta if my permanent remote approval comes through. (Atlanta's not a bad city to me. I have just been here for several decades now).

But I also worry about buying in a market that is also competitive, from what I have heard (""front range-ish"": Denver, Colorado Springs, or Ft. Collins, but also ABQ, Taos, or Santa Fe). Not sure what I'd even be able to get or if people would consider me as someone who'd be an ""outsider"" with a conventional loan offer.",t2_d03u9g6y,Conasauga42,0,1648218653.0,0,t1_i22hywo,i22hywo,False,AutoModerator,t3_tni4va,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tni4va/ratlanta_random_daily_discussion_march_25_2022/,"/r/Atlanta Random Daily Discussion - March 25, 2022",/r/Atlanta/comments/tni4va/ratlanta_random_daily_discussion_march_25_2022/i22hywo/,1,r/Atlanta,0,1

"Cameras that track license plates do not stop crime directly. They make it easier to track a vehicle that may agave been part of a crime where hopefully the authorities can catch the criminal before more crime occurs. All we have to do is let a private company track our every movement. 

There are lots of concerns about the accuracy of their ML models and how they have pointed the finger at the wrong person who had to be cuffed and hauled into jail before it was found that their SUV had the same plate number as an out of state motorcycle involved in a crime. The thing that concerns me the most is that I don’t think these companies will stop at a police state. Once you have data on everyone’s movements you can make billions on creating advertising profiles. Having a real world trace on everyone is vastly more valuable than knowing what websites they frequent.

For all the people DMing me that I’m a conspiracy theorist, let me ask you a question. Why are venture capitalists pumping almost half a billion dollars into just one company doing license plate tracking? Are they just happy to spend money to help police stop petty theft? If they are putting that much in how much are they going levying to get out? They have local governments and HOAs paying them to put up cameras to collect tons of data on the movements of people.

"Have you driven a Model 3?  It’s a bare bones car meant to bring cost of EV ownership down from the Model S.

">Can I explore any abandoned places legally?

Absolutely yes!

The easiest legal way to explore abandoned places is to obtain permission from the property owner. Explain your goals and intended purpose for exploring the area such as capturing historical records, filming a documentary, or whatever your plans include. Share copies of any training, certifications, credentials, liability insurance and related documentation demonstrating you are prepared, serious and have a legitimate reason to request access to the location.

You might even ask the owner to meet you at the location as they might be able to provide more details about the site than you simply observing alone.

Curious: What kind of locations are you seeking? What is your reason for exploring these locations?",t2_z8sf7,robot_ankles,0,1648171815.0,0,t1_i20dabt,i20dabt,True,mosherox333,t3_tn6z74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tn6z74/can_i_explore_any_abandoned_places_legally/,Can I explore any abandoned places legally?,/r/Atlanta/comments/tn6z74/can_i_explore_any_abandoned_places_legally/i20dabt/,5,r/Atlanta,0,5

"You’re not wrong, I just don’t see that as much of a benefit. An oil change is a once a year $40 affair. Brakes are also a non-issue. How often are people out there changing their brakes? I typically get 50-75K miles out of a good set of pads.  
  
I get EVs require less maintenance, but it’s not like we’re back in the days of constant tune-ups every 3K miles.  A regular car can make it to 100K with annual oil changes, a single brake job, and a couple of filters.

"It's not like EVs came out yesterday.  We've had Nissan Leafs and Tesla Model Ss being driven for over a decade.  The fact is that more mechanically simple systems (i.e. electric motors) are less likely to fail or need maintenance than more complex systems (like ICE engines and especially transmissions) and that solid state electronics are generally less likely to fail or need maintenance than mechanical systems.

Of course the stuff common with ICE cars (axles, suspension, brakes, etc.) will still need similar service intervals.  Actually I think that tires require more frequent replacement due to the weight/torque and brakes require less replacement because of the regenerative braking.

Check out this Model S with 424,000 miles on the clock: [https://insideevs.com/news/554187/424000-mile-tesla-models-review/](https://insideevs.com/news/554187/424000-mile-tesla-models-review/)  


He got a battery replacement at 250,000 miles and the front motor failed after 380,000 miles with no specific maintenance.  Obviously, batteries are the biggest concern, but there's really no maintenance you can do, just drive them until the capacity is insufficient which should be over 10 years (unless you're already on the edge of your range needs when new).  I think there really needs to be an aftermarket for replacement batteries.  I was really tempted to buy a cheap Nissan Leaf (like $3,000 for a 2012 with 70,000 miles last year), but the few aftermarket battery companies are in Europe.",t2_4nkjf,i_speak_the_truf,0,1648152790.0,0,t1_i1z4aei,i1z4aei,False,DukeOfGeek,t3_tmpr79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tmpr79/anybody_know_of_an_auto_repair_shop_specializing/,Anybody know of an Auto Repair shop specializing in EV?,/r/Atlanta/comments/tmpr79/anybody_know_of_an_auto_repair_shop_specializing/i1z4aei/,3,r/Atlanta,0,3

"I guess we’ll see but it really won’t take much to adapt. Major OEMs have already rolled out training, tools, and spare parts supply chains (lol @ Tesla). Everything is already in place to support these vehicles. All it takes is an independent shop seeing the biz opportunity and making the investment. In the short term, EVs only make up a small percentage of total car sales and most all EVs on the road today are still under some kind of warranty with the OEM. I think you’ll see a lot more independent EV shops open up over the next 5 years as the market grows.

"Is it with the same bank? In that case you’d probably be fine because they know where it came from and own them paper trail. In my situation, I deposited my inheritance check into my credit union account because I could do so in a branch. My other accounts are online only banks and I didn’t want to have to mail the check and mobile deposit is limited. So I deposited the check and transferred the balance to my higher interest savings account. 

My savings account needed to verify with the credit union that the money came from there and how long I’ve had the account. Thankfully the credit union was great and got on a call with me and the savings account bank and talked it out.

But man, it would have sucked if it fell apart a few days outs because of some weird money laundering prevention rules.

"BottleRocket has been broken into something like 4 times in the past two months by the same guy.  Busts open the doors and steals the booze to sell it.  Cops won't haul him in, or they do and he's back out in days.  And Josh doesn't own the building to put in doors with bars.  

The parking permit program is needed but they messed it up.  They allocated way too much of it to metered parking and told the residents that they would just need to walk a few more blocks than they were used to in order to get home.  That went over like a lead balloon.  So, a resident getting off work at 11pm is supposed to walk home, tired and not as alert, in an area that's arguably less safe at night?  Honestly, this neighborhood is so small that I would advocate that anyone with a parking permit should be able to park in a metered spot, as well.

With a psychiatrist once you're diagnosed, you can do telehealth appts and they will manage your prescription with your pharmacy—i only have to see her every 3 months so it has been a lot less of a nightmare.

"This is good news. Thanks for sharing. I will see if I can work around the paywall that the site is giving me.

Atlanta has a strong and diverse economy with a lot of good talent, thanks in part to how many great universities are here, as well as all the Fortune 500 HQs that are here. 

We have also been a boom town for 50 years, which means we have a wide variety of age when it comes to the age of our buildings. This translates into affordability for the older homes and lower rent for the older commercial spaces. Obviously, some of that is increasing rapidly, particularly in hot inner Atlanta areas. Some neighborhoods are not affordable for many people now, sadly, with the ~$300/monthly rent increases that have been reported anecdotally. 

But overall, we have a lot of varying neighborhoods that appeal to a wide range of budgets, when we consider all the suburban areas. Atlanta has no natural feature to box us in, either (like an ocean, swamp lands, or steep mountains).

We outcompete most other major cities in the southeast by miles, imho. I think Houston is the only real competitor at our level in the southeast. Every other metro is much much smaller (places like Birmingham, Jacksonville, Tampa, Charlotte, or New Orleans) unless people are looking specifically for a ""smaller"" metro or something that is more niche in another area.",t2_d03u9g6y,Conasauga42,0,1648138981.0,0,t1_i1y4toc,i1y4toc,False,AutoModerator,t3_tm1zuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tm1zuy/ratlanta_random_daily_discussion_march_24_2022/,"/r/Atlanta Random Daily Discussion - March 24, 2022",/r/Atlanta/comments/tm1zuy/ratlanta_random_daily_discussion_march_24_2022/i1y4toc/,2,r/Atlanta,0,2

"Yeah I know, I am also a DIYer. But my point is - and I feel like y'all aren't really hearing me - is that if you can't DIY it then find a good shop, and it just happens that the maker of the vehicle will have top-tier service. 

Your example of an AC compressor, which I have also DIY'd, is a perfect example of the disconnect here. People who can't do it themselves have to have someone else do it. The car manufacturer won't have to wait for parts, they won't have a tech screw it up as badly -- I have seen certified indie techs fuck up BADLY. All of this costs a little premium. 

One of my friends is a certified Lexus tech here in town. If I bought a used Lexus I would take it to him because he knows his shit, and if I wasn't familiar with his shop I would just go to the dealer. We took my gf's Toyota to an indie shop and they kept fucking it up. This kind of thing matters. 

>yet the dealership jacks up the price because ""they know the car"". Bullshit. 

I disagree. Anyway...

OP is going on about how they got a flashy new job and their boss told them to avoid the dealer but I wouldn't take law advice from a mechanic??

"As someone who fixes his own Mercedes and loves it, I disagree, I think they are ripping people off. The parts themselves are already expensive as is, but often the labor for these repairs is something that isn't that hard to do. I very rarely let other people do work on my car, but one time I needed to replace the A/C compressor. At a dealership this would have cost 2,000+ dollars. I just paid a freelance mechanic to do it for 350 total including parts. I could have done it myself easily, I just didn't feel like it and didn't want to drive somewhere to discharge the refrigerant. I've also done so many other repairs that aren't really any different than working on a Honda or Toyota, yet the dealership jacks up the price because ""they know the car"". Bullshit. In fact the repairs themselves on my Mercedes have often been easier to do than they were on the Hondas I've worked on because the engineering is top notch. So that's even less of an excuse to charge a ton of money for labor.

Cars are often, cars. Mercedes, BMW, etc know they can make a lot of money off of people because they are viewed as high status cars. So people with a lot of money are conned into thinking they need to spend oodles for the right service, and they'll pay it because for someone who makes a shit ton of money, a 2k repair isn't that big of a deal. Not to mention they sell fluids at literally twice the price, when they have internal documents saying you can just use after-market brands with the same efficacy.

These are quality vehicles and have a good reputation for a reason, but don't be fooled. The man who taught me to fix cars once said to me ""think of the average mechanic, do they seem like rocket-scientists to you? No, exactly. Then you can learn to fix a car.""

"Had a bit of a headache from the shelves yesterday and it really slowed me down. My wife found a blog post from a carpenter that she got the idea for the pantry from and so I made it basically the same. Well, they decided to do a U shape to their shelves to maximize space utilization, which I actually like. The problem is though, they used 2x2s for theirs and 2x2s suck ass and split whenever and wherever they want. 

I was hitting my head against the wall trying to figure out how to get the dimensions and the same style without using shitty 2x2s. Against my better judgement though, I tried to use them and yep they split and broke. Ended up just saying fuck it and changed the dimensions about an inch and use a 2x4 instead. Looks great and is more stable. Fuck 2x2s.

"I’ve heard fantastic things about many of these companies, and also horrible things about the same ones. And several large local companies aren’t mentioned here at all. FWIW here’s my rant as a mover in Atlanta. 
They all vary wildly since labor is a rotating door.   This is the same everywhere. It all comes down to company responsiveness and accountability. 
Get 2-3 IN PERSON quotes (not virtual, not Zoom, not a phone convo) from companies you’ve heard of. With an actual inventory jotted down. You wouldn’t hire a painter over FaceTime. Don’t let someone touch all your shit and charge you big money without a detailed quote. 
Your quote will be an hourly estimate for a sunny day with nothing impeding the movers (other neighbors blocking parking, hogging the elevator, unfinished prep that the customer intended to do). Then do a quick Google search and obviously read reviews. Look for most recent since the team that sucked 10 months ago probably got fired 9 months ago. 
Every company has some rules, some are law and some are company policy. No liquids, no jewelry, no plants, no hastily bagged goods, no unboxed electronics (an old quilt is not adequate protection for your 55” TV). Some movers will move pianos, some don’t. Some charge more or less on certain days or early/after hours moves. Some take credit cards, some don’t. Some will move your hoarder uncle’s shit, some will walk away. 
Real estate is moving fast, the hard labor almost never matches the wages and the moving industry attracts many people who do it as a last chance job or entry level job. The best company in Atlanta could have a shit crew on the road because it’s a Saturday in June and they over booked. 
With all that being said, hire local, avoid van lines and brokers (they get their cut and sub out the job to local teams or truck owner/operators), actually meet the company rep in person and clearly ask what they will NOT do. Some new mover shouldn’t mount your nice TV or connect water lines to your $4000 fridge. They are there to move stuff and not scratch anything. Get everything in writing, and if the people who show up have a different name than the company you signed up with, don’t let them touch your shit. You may never see it again. Yes this happens. 
Source— been in the moving industry for a very long time. Have supervised both outstanding crews and horrible crews that obviously lied about their prior experience. Most complaints or discrepancies are from improper expectations set by both sides. Either the customer doesn’t understand the time it takes to prep and prevent damage, or the company does not gather an adequate inventory to make proper timing or manpower recommendations (bait and switch, then hold cargo hostage for a higher amount, sometimes intentionally but often not.)",t2_eiwhz,ZalinskyAuto,0,1648093781.0,0,t1_i1w12kw,i1w12kw,True,astro7900,t3_tk7g97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tk7g97/best_moving_companies_in_atlanta/,Best Moving Companies in Atlanta,/r/Atlanta/comments/tk7g97/best_moving_companies_in_atlanta/i1w12kw/,2,r/Atlanta,0,2

"Yeah, I live in on Peters St, right where Peters and Walker come together.  However, my place is tucked behind another building so I am not visible from the street and am closer to the tracks.  But, I have witnessed a lot of craziness coming out of Escobar and CRU, etc.  And the blatant lawlessness with regards to traffic and parking - illegal paid parking lots, illegal valets, illegal nightclubs.

Just yesterday I went out for a walk around 5pm and there was a drug bust across the street.  The police SUV had a GIANT glass jar of bud just on the hood.

I still love it here.  Mostly because there's a LOT of community involvement.  I attend the monthly CHNA meetings and there are a lot of folks who attend and speak up.  The City activated it's parking plan for the neighborhood which was supposed to include both residential permits with the new meters, only they only activated the meters without having the permitting process in place.  And the residential parking zones made no sense.  Everything was basically metered or no-parking (safety).  The neighborhood made enough noise they had to hit the pause button on it and covered up the meters and signage.  The rep from the city who came to speak to CHNA indicated the parking plan was modelled after Midtown, which is a VERY different neighborhood.  Midtown has single-family homes and high-rises and lots of parking decks.

"A couple (purely) opinions that may or may not interest you:

one is better off cellaring (storing) wine that is extremely good for the price-point now, and that you’ve personally confirmed is awesome-tasting now. Cellar those in multiples of 6,8,12.

Space out when you open them and see how they change. 10 years is an outside on <many> most wines. 
Other words, I’d rather store 10 of the same $30 bottles and drink them through the curve than store 2 btls of $150 wine. Even for many Cabs, the Oak will be so pronounced in relationship to the fruit and acid at year 12 that the wine is not subjectively as good to me as it was at year 8. But, if I’ve tried one at year 8 and seen it’s starting to go down the curve, I can avoid getting to year 12 by…drinking it!

If I have one bottle of Premier Cru Bordeaux at $150 and I store it for 10 years, it’s a crapshoot. That bottle may be corked, might’ve gotten cooked before I got it, etc.

The other thing about cellaring really expensive wine is that there’s always an abundance of Big Reds in the 5-7 year old category at $50 - $150 that is available at area wine merchants in quantity right now. Buy 1, but ask them how much they have on hand. Lay it down for a week (to account for the trip-home bottle shock) and try it. If it’s awesome go back to that store and buy the rest and store it for the rest of its potential, which you’ve just assessed at year 7.

Also, one of the things about wine fridges rather than a cellar or even a temp controlled closet is the vibration.

"So there are various Arabic styles to shawarmas. Most of what you’ll find online are Lebanese or Israeli. Iraqi and Kurdish shawarma is very different. 

I’ll give you three options and the recipe for Laffa bread. My suggestion is to enjoy these on the hottest day of the year, sit next to a hot grill to simulate, while wearing the same clothes for the last four days and smelling of burnt gun powder, diesel fuel, and stale sweat. Drink some Ripit alongside. Sprinkle everything with a small amount of fine, alkaline, dust, too, for that final touch of authenticity. 

Laffa (flat bread):

-	1 cup water
-	3-4 tbsp olive oil
-	~2 cups flour
-	1/4 cup powdered milk
-	sugar
-	Yeast
-	1.5 tsp salt (1tsp isn't enough and 2 is slightly too much)
-	2 tsp sugar

Mix hot water, sugar, a tbsp of olive oil, and a couple tbsp flour in a cup, top with yeast. Set for ten minutes while yeast works. The key things with this recipe is hungry yeast and gluten.
Place 1.5 cups flour, salt, and 2 tbsp of olive oil in bowl. Pour active yeast mixture into flour. I like to use a Danish whisk here, but form into a shaggy dough. It's gonna be a sticky mess, but resist the urge to add more flour at this point.
Whisk and beat until the dough starts to become more stretchy, that gluten. Then start slowly incorporating more flour until it resembles a more traditional dough. And continue to beat it with your hands after. You want a good amount of stretch, way more than regular bread.
Seasame seeds and garlic powder are good additions here.
A little oily is good. Oil/cover/warm place until dough doubles. Hot and humid is great, I put mine in my car.
Break into chunks. You can make about 5 8-inch diameter pieces. Roll out, not much flour needed because the dough is oily
Here's the pivotal part: ungreased hot pan, with a lid. Temp medium/high, maybe a touch below. Toss bread on hot pan, cover. This steams it and gives it more stretch. It'll bubble up like crazy, flip when needed. 
Olive oil or butter between, cover. If you're going to use them later, put into an airtight bag when it's still warm. Gallon ziplocks are perfect for this. It will remain nice and pliable for later.

Lamb Shawarma:

-	1 tsp black peppercorns
-	5 cloves
-	½ tsp cardamom pods
-	tsp fenugreek seeds
-	1 tsp fennel seeds
-	1 tbsp cumin seeds
-	1 star anise
-	½ a cinnamon stick
-	½ a nutmeg, grated
-	¼ tsp ground ginger
-	1 tbsp sweet paprika
-	1 tbsp sumac
-	¾ tbsp sea salt
-	.9 ozfresh ginger, grated
-	3 garlic cloves, crushed
-	1/2 bunch chopped coriander, stems and leaves
-	4 tbsp lemon juice
-	1/2 cup olive oil
-	1 whole lamb leg, bone in, about 5-7lbs

Pop peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, fenugreek, fennel, cumin, star anise and cinnamon in a cast-iron pan set over medium-high heat and dry-roast them for a minute or two, until the spices begin to pop and release their aromas, taking care not to burn them. Add the nutmeg, ground ginger and paprika, and toss for a few more seconds to heat through, then transfer to a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Process the spices into powder. Transfer to a medium bowl, and stir in the sumac, salt, fresh ginger, garlic, cilantro, lemon juice and oil, and stir to combine.

Use a small sharp knife and score the leg of lamb in a few places, making half-inch-deep slits through the fat and meat. Put the lamb in a large roasting pan and rub the marinade all over it, using your hands to massage the meat. Turn the lamb fat-side up, cover the pan with aluminum foil and place it aside for a couple of hours, or preferably, rest it overnight in the refrigerator.

Heat oven to 350. Remove the foil, and roast for approximately 4 1/2 hours, or until the meat is completely tender. After 30 minutes of roasting, add about a cup of boiling water to the pan, and use this liquid to baste the meat every hour or so. (Add more water, as needed, making sure there is always a little in the bottom of the pan.) After 90 minutes or so, cover the lamb with aluminum foil to prevent the spices from burning. Once the lamb is done, remove it from the oven, and leave to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving and serving.

Note: I like to use my tall smoker to do this. I suspend the leg of lamb from a string over the water pan and use a medium bed of coals to cooked it over indirect heat. You can do similar with a grill and indirect heat with careful temperature management. 

Iraqi (Kurdish, really) Beef Shawarma:

This is going to be very different than what you’re accustomed to. 

Ingredients

-	4.5lbs of beef (flank, ribeye, or flap steak)
-	3 tsp salt 
-	1 tsp salt
-	6 cardamom pods
-	1 tsp nutmeg
-	8 whole cloves
-	1/4 cinnamon stick
-	1 tsp sumac 
-	olive oil

Freeze the meat for two hours, then use a very sharp knife to slice it as thinly as possible. 

Follow the spice roasting procedure from above for the cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. Then add the remainder of the nutmeg and the sumac. Cool as described in the lamb recipe. 

Add a dash of olive oil to the pan along with the salt and simmer the beef. Once the water cooks out of it add a cup or so more of water. When that liquid has reduced by 50%  add the spice mixture and simmer until reduced completely. 

Serve on the Laffa with copious amounts of tomato, cucumber, chopped parsley, and diced onion. 

Chicken Shawarma:

Ingredients

-	1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts (2 large breasts)
-	1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs (4 large thighs)
-	6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil divided
-	2 tsp cumin
-	2 tsp paprika
-	1 tsp allspice
-	3/4 tsp turmeric
-	1/4 tsp garlic powder
-	1/4 tsp cinnamon
-	1 pinch cayenne
-	Salt and black pepper


Prepare Marinade
Slice the chicken breasts into 5-6 strips each and the thighs into 3-4 strips each. Place them in a marinating dish or large plastic zipper bag.

Follow the stride prep from the lamb recipe and add to the olive oil to form a pasty slurry. 

Pour the spice marinade over the chicken pieces. Stir with a spoon till all the chicken pieces are evenly coated in the marinade.

Cover the marinating dish with plastic wrap, or close the zipper bag. Place chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinate overnight.

Skewer the strips with wooden or metal  skewers and alternate strips of breast with thigh. Grill evenly on both sides. When done, remove from grill and let cook slightly. Then cut the meat of the skewers finely from top to bottom, Gaucho style. Mix chicken thoroughly and serve over Laffa bread. 

Couple of notes:

Time and fresh spices are going to take all of these recipes from good to amazing. A little bit of extra effort on the front end will pay dividends. 

Serve with fresh made [Jajeek](https://www.food.com/recipe/yogurt-salad-jajeek-443878) and [Pickled Vegetables](https://meemiskitchen.com/2019/12/18/lebanese-pickle-arabic-pickle-lebanese-pickled-vegetables/) or store bought Giardinera and pickled radishes and you’ll be set.

I can’t claim how absolutely authentic these recipes are. But myself and a couple of buddies who spent time in Iraq and Kurdistan some years ago spent several weekends trying to put together all these flavors we remembered. Research online and then tinkering is how we put it all together. The chicken is probably the weakest recipe of the lot.

">Folks who conceal need a permit with a background check

Yep, the *exact same background check* you have to submit every time you purchase a firearm. 

... In fact, concealed permits actually allowed you to *skip* that background check when buying more guns - Sort of a ""take it once and you're good forever"" deal, as long as you keep paying your annual fee.

The only other requirements were being fingerprinted, and paying that annual fee to the court. Doing away with CCW permits is mostly a formality.
