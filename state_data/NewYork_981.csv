"I'm not nor ever been a liberal Democrat, however, it's refreshing to see classic liberal ideals still exist. 
Both parties, especially in our state, have catered more and more to minor or fringe interests within their parties, and it's bad for New York as a whole.
Everyone either gives up or accepts whatever their party puts forth, even when they dislike the candidate, and 3rd party candidates have little chance of attracting voters to cross party lines.
The answer lies in the local Assembly and Senate races. If all the districts outside of the NYC metro area were vocal and active, making sure their district representatives actually represented them, not party bosses or leaders, or anyone else, we might actually get somewhere.

While at first glance it might seem what you would expect, but doing some digging into the individual counties you can find some unexpected stats like how many votes Trump received In Nassau, Kings and Queens counties.

These aren’t “conservative” counties, but people underestimate just how many they are, even in NYC proper. It’s insane how many people live down there.

Certainly bail is more punitive to minorities, who have less money. That's unfair. But at the same time, you can't wipe your poop on someone and go home the next day.

"Sooo the Buffalo Billion is a mixed of projects including several highly successful ones.

* 43North has not only created Buffalo’s first unicorn startup, but has created over 1,200 local jobs and is CASH POSITIVE. That’s right, a economic program that at one point will be self sufficient. That’s because 43North gets a 5% stake in winning companies. This has actually helped grow Buffalo’s tech scene (might want to look up recent numbers)
* Advanced Manufacturing Institute has already ran out of space and is attracting companies as far as California. They’re also a front runner for a $100 million grant to create a tech hub.
* Workforce Development Center - built in the heart of Buffalo’s impoverished Eastside
* Main Street Grants for small business owners 
* Work training programs at city high schools
* UB’s Genomics Institute has already created 600 spin off jobs

Then you have money going towards infrastructure projects.

Soooo in short, this article didn’t do enough research on the Buffalo Billion and we can learn a lot from it.

Less Tesla type projects and more workforce development, skills training, university partnerships, investments in startups, and grants to small business owners.

The issue is that NYS wasn’t investing money in economic development upstate at all. Investing in things like healthcare and public housing sounds great, but isn’t sustainable without growing jobs that grow the population.

Kind of funny that Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany are all growing in population again. While I think we need to be smarter with state money on what we invest in, we still need to invest in growing the economy.

"Apparently the Chinese students wrote a letter saying they were being “crucified for a crime they did not commit”. Were they denying that anything was going on over there or saying they feel like she was attacking them as an ethnic group though they had nothing to do with her brothers detention personally. 

Tbh I’m a little confused by the article, it says the girl was sharing a story about her brothers detention and 40 students felt they were being attacked and blamed? 

Is this just an East Asian version of “talking about racism makes me feel uncomfortable and thus is racist” or is there a context of what was said that’s missing.

"Genocide doesn't always include mass executions. Its the purposeful erasure of a culture/ethnicity and that's literally what China is doing.  

https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml
n the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

* Killing members of the group    
* Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;    
* Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;    
* Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;    
* Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.    

Uyghur genocide:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_genocide

* Mass internment without legal process, torture and enslavement
* forced sterilization, forced separation of children from parents to kill cultural heritage, mass rape and sexual torture, abortion

">Also, the basic laws of thermodynamics have something to say about any system that claims to be over 100% efficient.

The term is ""Coefficient of Performance"" or COP.  You are correct that the system cannot actually be 100+% efficient, that's basic thermo.

The 3-400% efficiency numbers are comparing the heating output inside your home to the electricity you're putting into the system, but the electricity isn't the only energy input - you're grabbing that heat from outside and bringing it in.

So it isn't ""1000W of electrical input = 3-4000W heat output"" it's ""moving 3-4000W of heat from outside to inside using 1000W of electrical power"".  


Efficiency drops off at really low temperatures, so you'll want to have some form of backup heating, but the tech has gotten better to the point where you can still get a COP of around 2 or so at 0 degrees F with an air-source heatpump.  Absolute worst case the COP drops to 1 and you effectively have resistive electric heat.

"Again the reason you want to use heat to generate electricity to generate heat is because you can use the electricity to collect more energy. A truck carrying gas to gas stations does not use more gas than they carry in the tanker. Mining equipment used to mine coal does not use more energy than can be extracted from the mine. 

You seem to grasp this as you argue later that that the problem is when temperatures are too low to make it worth it to use a heat pump. While we are not Virginia we are also not Antarctica. Our average high is in the mid 30s and average lows are in the 20s. Will it make sense to use natural gas for the 20 days of the year when it is too cold? Sure. But the great thing about a heat pump system is that it is also an air conditioner. If you are getting an air conditioner why not one that doubles as a heat pump for the average winter day? 

I don’t think every house needs to be converted today. Gas is going to be around for a long time. New construction could still use natural gas, but why not also look into geothermal? That way your heat pump is working in 50 - 60 degree temperatures whether it is -25 or 90.

"Calm down guy. You're not educating anyone here. I know we're talking about moving, and you can move yourself up on over to someone else's inbox talking like that.

I think our starting assumption points here are off. You're talking about what's possible on like a 40 degree day. And what you're talking about already exists. We burn natural gas to generate electricity. What I'm talking about are days in the negatives. In the scenario I thought you were referencing, heat pumps don't work. So why would they work any better if you localized the equipment? What's interesting about these machines is their balance point between capacity and load is right around freezing coincidentally. Every degree below ~34F you go the more heat your home needs than your machine can keep up with.

"I understand that. I've been doing this since you were still learning how to convert F to C in junior high. What all of you don't seem to be understanding, what I hoped you would without me saying it is, gas is already being used to power our homes. So aside form the marginal loss in power due to voltage drop in the wire's resistance, you're not doing anything special here. You're just localizing the costs, the maintenance, the infrastructure of such a component. This makes the system less ecologically sound if that's your goal.

Efficiency nerds sometime lose the big picture here. Total output matters. Don't tell me what it can do on a 60 degree day. Don't even tell me what it can do on a 30 degree day. This isn't Virginia. I need to know what it can do when it's cold as hell.

"No that still doesn't make sense. Moving heat is not ""easier"" than generating heat on this planet. The heat stored in the C-C bonds of gas molecules was already 'generated' over billions of years.

"well the thing is a heat pump doesn't generate the heat from electricity , it just moves it around. so if you looked at electrical energy in vs usable heat out , is would be something like 400% efficient. ofc this isn't true efficiency , just the efficiency for heating a space (the thing we care about) . it just means that to make the building warmer we make the outside a little colder.  

&#x200B;

the simplest system that would accomplish the same type of thing is putting a big block of metal in a hot spring for a while then moving it inside your house as a source of heat. the only energy you needed to exert was moving the hunk of hot metal inside your house , but you pretty much just stole a bunch of energy from the spring. thus you ended up with much more usable energy then you put in.

This makes no sense. The more instances of power conversion you include in a system, the less efficient it becomes. When you light a match 100% of the heat it generates goes in to the volume of space it's in.

"That is correct. With heat pumps you aren't turning electrical energy into heat (with the exception of waste heat from the compressor that can be captured) but instead you are concentrating heat energy from outside and moving it inside. For that reason it is actually more efficient to burn natural gas to generate electricity to run a heat pump than it is to burn the natural gas directly to heat your home. Although the colder it is the harder the heat pump has to work so things even out around 14 - 24F and natural gas starts to become more efficient (with current technology). Heat pumps can still work below this temperature, just not as efficient as natural gas and past a certain point not as efficient as resistive heating even.

"It reminds me a lot of Kamala Harris's student loan forgiveness plan she proposed during the 2020 democratic primary. You could have up to $20,000 of debt forgiven if you were a Pell Grant recipient who operated a small business in a disadvantaged community for 3 years. So you had to have a family poor enough to qualify for Pell grants and well-connected/wealthy enough to get money to start a business. Not only that, but you had to make it last for 3 years AND it had to operate in a disadvantaged community. If you were able to keep a business operating for that long, why would you need student loan forgiveness?

">She's too much like Cuomo and hasn't done enough to separate herself from his policies.

I didn't like Cuomo because he's a corrupt raging Narcisist and a sleezebag, his policy overall was Center-Left which is appropriate for a state as large as New York in my opinion. Hochul is not nearly as slimy as Cuomo. That's a net-positive from the jump. It's also very early to really judge her on policy given she's only been in office a few months. 

&#x200B;

>Covid response policies

She's relaxed the majority of the COVID restrictions at this point, are you saying she didn't lift them soon enough?

&#x200B;

>the ""catch and release"" bail reform

This was passed by the legislature YEARS before she assumed the governorship. I'm not sure why you're implying that Hochul owns this policy. She has also [publicly stated](https://www.post-journal.com/news/page-one/2022/02/hochul-addresses-furor-over-bail-reform-law/) that she's collecting data surrounding bail reform to measure its impact on rising crime. This takes a bit of time. Knee-jerk reactions based of ""feelings"" is objectively a bad way to do things.

"I personally break it down like this


NYC Metro Area(anything south of I-84) Newburgh, Middletown, White Plains, NYC and Long Island ect..  The area is one of the most unique places in North America. Its hard to fathom big it actually is, cities like Orlando, Dallas, Philadelphia,Nashville ect feel small in comparison(to me they feel like suburbs with some tall buildings). You'll never be bored there's so much to do it can be overwhelming, I'd recommend research and plan activities ahead of time for sure but I'd also take a day or two just to wander and see what the city brings to you. Best way around the city is the subway, driving is a nightmare and surface transportation is a bitch and expensive. Great food everywhere and rude people everywhere. Long Island has some good food, nice beaches and nice fishing. Fire Island is always a party. As a whole this area is a must to visit in ny imo

Hudson Valley: Poughkeepsie, Kingston, Woodstock, Hudson, Catskill 
Very beautiful area situated between the Hudson River and Catskill mountains. With the exception of Kingston and Poughkeepsie this area feels pseudo rural its odd in a good way. You'll find a lot of art and farms in this area, its great for hiking fishing and hunting if that's your thing. Definitely cool place but I wouldn't necessarily go out of your way to check this area out

Cap District: Albany, Schenectady, Troy, Gloversville, Saratoga, Chatham 
Pound for pound the coolest area in NY. Bunch of museums and historical sites in Albany, you can have a couple of event filled days there and spend very little! Troy and Saratoga are both great walkable cities with a very lively bar and music scene. Saratoga race track is always a party. There's a bunch of things to do outdoors sns brewery in Nassau does live events at the barn during the summer, Saratoga Spa State park and Thacher Park are beautiful. Definitely a must if you're visiting NY for the first time. The cap district is a decently balanced mix of upstate and downstate 


North County: Glens Falls, Plattsburgh, Watertown, Old Forge
If you love Camping, Hunting, Fishing,Hiking and skiing/snowboarding this is a must the Adirondacks are incredibly beautiful and rich with wildlife. Its definitely a cool area but if you're not into the outdoors there's no point of going there. Its vastly empty 

Central New York ""CNY"": St Johnsville, Utica,  Rome,Oneida, Richfield Springs 
Honestly the worst part of the state, this is where ""rust belt syndrome"" picks up its run down. Its a taste of the deep south in NY. Food in this area is pretty good but there's not a lot as far as entertainment, the bar/brewery is decent but its a car centric hell hole with virtually zero public transportation so its hard to enjoy. There is one reason I'd recommend going to this area and its the Herkimer Diamond mines.

"I think I heard your neck snap from how fast you pivoted.

First your point of the FDA doesn't know anything compared to your well informed drug dealer. The studies done for those two drugs are for the purpose of being approved by the strictest drug approving agency in the world, done by some of the smartest researchers, doctors, and pharmacists. You consider them ""a handful"" of studies? There is quite literally no better possible way to produce accurate information. You are arguing against the gold standard we used for billions of doses of medications across the modern world. 



But let's just say you didn't know all that. Don't you think it's a little unfair to say something costs 32k when patients get complete coverage via their insurance coupled with the manufacturer? Even medicaid covers this drug. You would rather parents of an 8 year old pay money they don't have to a random dealer for their child rather than get free, regulated, dose controlled, readily available forms.

Even your ""full flower profile"" point doesn't make sense. Why does Epidiolex only contain CBD? It's because the other endocannabinoids either have no effect, or a negative effect (this is the minority to be fair) on lowering the seizure threshold. Not even accounting for all the side effects you're now forcing the child experience from the THC and other endocannabinoids. 

Lastly, the dosing for Epidiolex has a narrow theraputic range, especially in children. Inconsistent dosing due to the product being an unregulated, and unmeasured can precipitate seizures by desensitizing the patient (this is why the medication is always tapered up and down like most epilepsy medicine).

Obviously I agree that the actions taken by the FDA in the past are gross and irresponsible. But we live in 2022 not 1930. If they are taking steps to improve medicine and access to these things in a responsible way, then we should support and push for more of it.

"A handful of studies, vs widespread use, over the course of decades...


You understand isolates are nowhere near as effective as whole flower, or extracts?  Science just learned this, even though terp chasers have know this for decades.

I can go to my dealer and say ""I need some that will relax me, and some other to help with concentration and focus""

Dealer provides exactly that.

So, where, exactly, does the FDA know and talk abouy which strains are beneficial for which uses?

Also, Donabinol is $113 for 60 doses.  It's far more cost effective to just use flower, or edible.  And, has far fewer side effects, because potheads and dealers have figured out THC by itself makes people prone to paranoia.  Epidiolex is 32K/yr.  Just... grow it, and make edibles, or smoke it.  Again, more cost effective, therapuetic treatments can be more closely catered to individual needs, and additional strains (With differing CBD/THC ratios, along with different terp profiles).

All I could send them was proof that I was employed as well as bank statements that show that I was being payed by my employer. Im genuinely scared right now because I havent worked since then after getting into college and am flat broke. If they dont deem those document sufficient Im going to have pay back almost 15k or more.

"Once you qualify for Medicaid you have it for 12 months, regardless of income. You still need to report changes in income but it should not effect your coverage.

The reason for this 12 month protection is to prevent the exact dilemma you’re going through.

Your income will only matter when your plan is up for renewal.

If your income is $40k at renewal, you might not qualify for Medicaid but you’ll still qualify for massive subsidies. 

Of course, double check this with your insurance company.

"That’s because most stadiums are surrounded by parking lots.

Buffalo literally has acres of blighted land just outside of downtown. This land isn’t generating any income for the city.

If we’re going to spend $1 billion for a stadium, then let’s put it we’re it will have the greatest impact where it can be the bookend for a greater mixed use, mixed income neighborhood with expanded transit access.

Most of those stadiums studied are surrounded by parking lots. Of course there’s no economic benefit.

It doesn’t have to be that way. If an urban stadium is built it has to be on the condition that:

* Transit is expanded (the proposed Metrorail expansion to the airport runs right near the proposed downtown stadium site in Buffalo)
* No surface parking lots. Only parking garages with first floor retail
* Retail and hotels fronting the stadium

That’s how you make a vibrant stadium district.

Otherwise it’s going to take 50 years for Buffalo to fill out this blighted land.

"> At least that way we can revitalize a whole section of the city especially if we make it part of a larger plan with mixed use and mixed income transit oriented development.

This lie has been parroted over and over for generations and each time a city, town, county and state allows itself to be swindled. With all eye-opening documentaries and articles written about stadium grifts I'm shocked that people still allow themselves to fall victim to these claims. These stadiums need to be funded 100% privately. Not only for the stadium, land itself, but everything that goes in to making the stadium work.

"The study they did found that the stadium would need $600 million in renovations, but would only be good for 20 years.

"The Bills pay $20 million in state income tax per year. Josh Allen alone is worth $4 million. 

Assuming the stadium is designed to last 40 years, that’s $800 million in income tax paid to the state.

Meanwhile, if no new stadium is built, the Bills will likely be sold. No Bills = no costs, but no Bills also = no income tax revenue.

Definitely need better profit sharing. Right now the Bills only spend $600,000 in rent per year.

That needs to be increased to $4 million. That way we can at least pay for the inevitable upgrades in 20 years without having yo dig deeper into the public budget.

Ticket sales and concessions sale sharing would also go a long way. The Bills generate $6 million in ticket sales during each normal home game and $12 million for playoff games. That’s $60 million per year and Erie County only sees 1% of it currently.

The other piece of the puzzle is filling the stadium the rest of the year. There needs to be better management to ensure the stadium is being used when the Bills aren’t playing.

"There are a few misconceptions you seem to have here. 

First, your compensation would not be going down as far as you are concerned. You're getting far more than you already receive, even if not all of it is directly from your employer. If you value your insurance at $30k, then your total net compensation would be $50k - (your income x 0.04), so likely around $46k assuming you currently make ~$100k in salary, meaning you're netting an additional $16k in value per year. 

Second, how would this health insurance be worse than your private insurance? Not only would you not have to worry about finding an in-network doctor, but you also don't need to worry about a deductible. 

As for out-of-state healthcare, it would likely work the same way it already does for private insurers, where they would be treated as out of network and you pay extra for them. Or, since NY has such a large population, it may be able to negotiate deals with larger healthcare providers nationally, and most providers regionally so that they are treated as in-network. As an added bonus, the state could require ER doctors to take the state insurance to avoid the current scam where basically none of them are in-network so that they can make more money since you don't really have a choice when you go to the ER.

All the complaints you seem to have are either entirely unfounded or are issues that are shared by private insurance. 

As I've already explained, union workers have every reason to get on board with universal healthcare. As you yourself said, that healthcare is part of your negotiated compensation. Wouldn't you rather have been able to negotiate for an additional $30k and still have health insurance that's actually better than what you're currently getting?",t2_7ahbc,mankiller27,0,1646323449.0,0,t1_hz73c63,hz73c63,False,WithCheezMrSquidward,t3_shvy5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/newyork/comments/shvy5t/call_your_state_repsenator_if_you_want_them_to/,Call your State Rep/Senator if you want them to support the newly proposed New York Health Act for Single Payer healthcare,/r/newyork/comments/shvy5t/call_your_state_repsenator_if_you_want_them_to/hz73c63/,0,r/newyork,0,0

">We could have had a lot more than 1 million dead. 

Keyword, ""could."" People love to keep throwing that out there as if it was CERTAINLY going to happen if we did nothing. 

Doing nothing is 100% an option for the government. YOU want some protection for yourself, by all means, do what you need to do. If you want them to do something, present guidelines and strategies to mitigate individual risks. Do not force measures others that can and WILL affect them physically, emotionally, and monetarily. 

>The same people complaining about mandate would be complaining about overwhelmed hospitals and dead family members instead

Can we stop with the what-ifs? If there was a big demand for hospitals, people would have jumped onto the opportunity to profit off making more of them, and that just did not happen. NY spent a total of $320,000,000 on emergency hospitals which ended up treating a combined total of ZERO patients. That is a severe misuse of government funding, all because people were terrified of such a minor risk.

There's a lot more to society than trying to protect everyone from a virus. Economies cannot be shut down, and people can't be told to put their lives on hold without causing rippling consequences.

"(Disclaimer) I was never a fan of Governor Cuomo. But, I unlike a lot of people here I believe in facts. The presentation of the facts concluding a full impartial investigation. With that said. He said he did nothing wrong. He said he did nothing criminally wrong. Furthermore, he denied all accusations against him throughout the course of all investigations. All the accusers changed their stories multiple times and no one questioned it accept the guy being accused and his legal team. The basis of their cases were circumstantial evidence based on hearsay. All that said, I disagree with his TV ad at this point and feel it's way too soon. On the other hand, If it were me, I'd want to prove my innocence just not with a TV ad. I would have waited until all investigations were over and then filed defamation and libel suits against all accusers and their enablers.

"[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

We're in the ballpark of 10,000 deaths daily worldwide that have been reported as due to the coronavirus, and about 150,000 deaths daily.

[https://www.medindia.net/patients/calculators/world-death-clock.asp](https://www.medindia.net/patients/calculators/world-death-clock.asp)

So, only 6% or so of global deaths. No big deal.

Of course, there's also this:

[https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death)

In 2019-2020 the #3 COD was COPD, coming in at um.. 6%.

But I guess it depends on where you look:

[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)

This is supposedly 2020 data, and Covid came in in 3rd place in the US.

Perhaps one of the points is.. this is more easily preventable than heart disease or cancer. 

But man, it's hard to find the exact info you're looking for. Like, here's NY cause of death status that are only from 2014-2017.

[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/newyork/newyork.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/newyork/newyork.htm)

In 2017 the leading cause of death was heart disease at 44,000. I can't find how many deaths exactly in NY were covid related in just 2021, but our total is in the 67,000 range. So.. I guess a week ago sending kids home with covid tests so they can all test before coming back to class and we can get some good statistics was a great idea, and cutting out masks on Wednesday is now a great idea?

The virus is many times smaller than the filtering capabilities of most of these masks. And the loose footing surgical ones with those big gaps on the sides?

"You're so dramatic.  Viruses happen.  We did a LOT for a long time.  Did you want to shut down for the next 10 years?  Hide under our mattresses?  Wear masks for..... how long exactly?  There was NO science behind masking kids up at school at all.  None.  Its just Covid theater which everyone is quite tired of.

We're done.  You keep wearing your mask and/or hazmat suit.  The rest of us are past it.  ""Sucking things up for a brief period""?  Its been 2+ years.

Agree but the fear is real in some of these people. Some never went outside. Some never took their masks down.

"Reasonable is sucking things up for a brief period and dealing with very minor inconveniences so that we can get everyone safely back to where we started. Instead because of all the screeching toddlers who confused being asked to wear a piece of cloth on their face for oppression, we have to settle for a world where the disease is so prevalent and evolved that it will never go away.
