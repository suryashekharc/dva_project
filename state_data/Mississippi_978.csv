"100% spot on. When you see people like Tate or Hines-Smith get elected, you know it's a huge uphill battle. I have some family that are hardcore Republicans, and it's mindboggling the mental-gymnastics they'll go through when they talk about politics. 

Them: I vote Republican because I want smaller government and value freedom!

Me: Cool! So, when you voted for Trump and he added trillions to the deficit, banned bump stocks, expanded background checks, renewed the Patriot Act, and refused to pardon Assange, you must have been really pissed at him.

Them: Well Obama.....yada yada yada

And, to be fair - so many people are like that when it comes to politics. When you call out the BS of their party, you end up getting a retort of ""Well Obama...."" or ""Well Trump..."" and the entire time I'm thinking it must be rough to have to defend the actions of someone you ""support"" by excusing their actions because it was the same thing that someone you ""don't support"" did. 

From my experience, it's really difficult to talk politics with conservatives. You and I have had some exchanges on here, and while we disagree on solutions, we mostly agree on what we see as existing problems. And, I think that's a big part of changing the culture - getting people to recognize that a problem exists first. Once they understand that there is a problem, then fight it out over a solution (one that doesn't end up hurting any individual).

When it comes to this state, it's remarkably frustrating. Tater is in over his head so much, and has just coasted by his entire career without ever accomplishing a single thing. Like with the MM Initiative - even though the overwhelming majority of the state voted for it, he dug his heels in because he's worried about his status in the GOP and thinking he's gonna hitch his wagon to Trump for greener pastures. When, truthfully, any advisor for Trump would most likely tell him to stay clear of someone with a room temperature IQ like Tater. 

I honestly don't know of any solution other than changes at local levels. I think investing resources and energies at those levels will have more success than higher levels (such as governor - even though Hood came really close). Get folks into supervisory positions, into mayoral elections, auditor positions, etc.., and start taking those steps one at a time.

Maybe not Tate but basically Tate with a different coat of paint. There is a cultural problem in this state that prevents meaningful progress in any way. Maybe it's religion, mixed with overall poverty, brain drain, and a toxic dose of right-wing rage media keeping voters here in a perpetual state of panic and anger at anyone who doesn't keep the status quo (and the politicians who benefit from that mindset). I dunno. But I do know nothing is going to change for the better in this state until the hearts and minds of the people who vote here change.

"It’s not that I don’t agree with you. I don’t think spanking kids is good parenting. There are times though when you use other methods but they have no affect. The real problem isn’t “spanking your kids is bad” but the problem is that people don’t know the proper when and how to use spanking as a disciplinary measure.

1.) Don’t use spanking as the only form of punishment, it should be a very last resort. And I mean literally a very very last resort. 

2.) Don’t hit your kid hard enough to actually hurt them. The point isn’t to physically harm them, if you were to hit another person that hard (or yourself) and it would hurt, then you’re not disciplining them, you’re abusing them.

3.) You don’t have to spank them every single time. Sometimes just telling them that they are going to get a spanking if they continue to be bad will be enough to make them stop. Yes I know it’s because of the “fear and anxiety” of being spanked previously, but that’s the same method we use to prevent them from doing things such as touching a hot stove top. The fear of burning their hand is what is used to prevent them from placing their hand on it and when/if they do, then they will have actual trauma added to it as well. 

I don’t like spanking my children. The problem is sometimes they just do not listen, ever. I used to tell people they must be bad parents if they can’t control their children until I had my own and quickly realized that sometimes there is no controlling them. You can say whatever you want to them and they will not listen to you. You can take whatever away from them and they won’t care. You can put them in time-out and unless you are standing right behind them staring at them as well, they will try to find a way out of it without you knowing. 

I will say that time-out (standing in a corner facing the wall) works best in my experience with my own kids. Having to sit still for longer than 10 seconds will drive any child crazy and they almost instantly regret whatever they did.",t2_fwdmyg5e,DonksterWasTaken,0,1648146736.0,0,t1_i1youp4,i1youp4,False,ThatGuy_79_1,t3_tku6gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/tku6gz/with_domestic_violence_so_high_in_mississippi_we/,With domestic violence so high in Mississippi we should be trying more things to protect women and children!

"So, overexciting the child's amygala by invoking anxiety & stress via physical punishment isn't really hurting them, because you're not beating the child with a 2x4? If this spanking is so harmless, why is this final tool in your parenting handbook the one that's 100% effective?

>Sometimes you just have to do what is necessary

There it is, right there. You're teaching the child physical punishment is necessary, the same way your mom taught you, and the same way your child may one day teach their peers, significant others, or your grandchildren.

Just because you aren't beating then with an extension cord doesn't mean you aren't causing them mental anguish; all studies have shown this leads to further behavioral problems as well as increased anxiety & stress.",t2_4k7rhopi,dp662,0,1648093530.0,0,t1_i1w0lvw,i1w0lvw,False,ThatGuy_79_1,t3_tku6gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/tku6gz/with_domestic_violence_so_high_in_mississippi_we/,With domestic violence so high in Mississippi we should be trying more things to protect women and children!

"I was spanked as a child and don’t feel the need to spank mine except under certain circumstances. They only get spanked if they continuously disobey me after I’ve punished them through other means (taking stuff away, time-out, etc). 

Also spanking your kid doesn’t mean smacking the shit out of them. You’re not actually trying to hurt your child. Everybody here thinks that “spanking = hitting them as hard as you can” and that’s not spanking, that’s physical abuse. I got whooped with a 2x4 with holes in it so my mom could “swing it faster”. Switches, spoons, shoes, belts, if it could be swung, my butt was the target. 

Some children are unruly and won’t listen because measly threats like “i’ll take your game system away” doesn’t mean shit to them and they won’t care. My mom would take my stuff away and I didn’t give a crap, I’d just do something else. She made me read an entire book in one sitting one time, about 200 pages (I don’t usually like reading) and turns out, I really liked the book, went and got the entire series after I finished the first one and read the rest. What did I learn? That I liked that book… not that I shouldn’t have done whatever I did initially that got me in trouble.

Nowhere does it talk about inuring ones self under the self defense portion of the article. You are literally making shit up.

Regarding self defense it clearly states:

>They also found that people were **more likely to be injured after threatening attackers with guns than they were if they had called the police or run away.**

This is the statement. They are comparing the 3 options because those are 3 distinctly different options and when compared to any other individual response - responding with a gun increases the responders chance of injury by 43-58% because that's how numbers work. Also take note how it never mentions self inflicted injuries under the self defense section where the graph is located so where did you get that from?

"Thank you for the link.

So, let's examine what the topic is, and that's the use of guns in self-defense. The linked source doesn't say that the use of guns during a self defense event increases the chances in self-injury. Instead, the source indicates:

1. States with more guns have more gun related homicides. 
2. Having a gun in the home increases the chances of having a gun related incident. 
3. People with guns are more likely to commit suicide by guns. 

Getting that out of the way, they do provide a chart that claims those that use guns for self-defense are injured 4.1% of the time. That means 95.9% of the time, they are not injured. The statistics they provide goes against their entire argument. I get it - the site you linked is a ""left of center"" and a ""pro gun control"" site, but they pretty much shot themselves in the foot with this (pun intended).",t2_128lzk,meridianomrebel,0,1648047819.0,0,t1_i1swvyp,i1swvyp,False,ThatGuy_79_1,t3_tku6gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/tku6gz/with_domestic_violence_so_high_in_mississippi_we/,With domestic violence so high in Mississippi we should be trying more things to protect women and children!

"> This misperception stems largely from a study published in 1995 by criminologists Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, who asked 5,000 Americans if they, or other household members, had ever used their guns in the past year for self-defense. Based on the responses they received, the criminologists estimated that guns are used for self defense in the United States more than 2.5 million times a year. But other researchers argue that the survey was ambiguous and likely over-estimated defensive gun use; more recent studies have found that guns are only rarely used for self-defense. In 2015, David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, and Sara Solnick, an economist at the University of Vermont, analyzed national government surveys involving more than 14,000 people and reported that guns are used for self-protection in less than 1 percent of all crimes that take place in the presence of a victim

"Want to hear something funny? I worked there from 2012 to 2014 before I got the job I have now which is fully remote. I was making a 50 mile commute one-way every day from where I was living. 

There is a vanpool service out there that I joined and it was working well. Until my bosses said I needed to quit the van pool because they needed me there extra hours and it was ""hurting the project timeline"" when I'd have to get back on the van pool to go home. So I asked for a raise to compensate for the extra gas and mileage on my car. They literally laughed at me and said not a chance. Keep in mind the average gas prices in Jan 2014 was $3.13/gal. 

Oh and I do the same work I did at Stennis now, except fully remotely and at 3x the pay. And it's been years since I had to work a significant amount of overtime hours (which because I'm salary I don't get paid for).

">Here’s how it works, according to several House Republicans who spoke with Mississippi Today:
>
>The weekly closed-door Republican caucus meetings are usually the first place rank-and-file House Republicans are informed of details about major policies that Gunn and a handful of other House leaders determine privately. In the caucus meetings, Gunn asks the group of Republicans for support. Caucus members who feel they can’t support the bill in question are asked to speak privately about their positions with the relevant committee chairmen — Gunn appointees who are the speaker’s closest allies. 
>
>If members still feel they can’t support the bill after speaking with the chairman, the member will often be sent to speak with Gunn in a private meeting. Gunn can be forceful in those meetings, several House Republicans said, often demanding support and leaving little room for conversation or pushback.
>
>Rank-and-file members often feel forced to vote for a policy they may not personally support or feel their district would support over fear Gunn or other House leaders will retaliate against them.
>
>Mississippi speakers of the House have long used similar tactics to garner support on any given bill, and the bottom line for Republican representatives is simple: Not getting in line with the speaker’s wishes could lose them power and influence for their constituents back home, and in the worst cases, it could earn them a Republican primary challenger in the next election.
>
>Gunn has convened these closed-door House Republican Caucus meetings since he became speaker in 2012. The meetings are typically called via private group text message and are never announced publicly. They are never open to the public.
>
>The House Republican Caucus, boasting 77 members, makes up 63% of the entire Mississippi House of Representatives. A quorum of the House, according to legislative rules, is 50%. The caucus has the numbers to pass any bill they want without a single Democratic or independent vote, making these private caucus discussions critical to the policymaking process.

>
>Gunn’s staff, when questioned by Mississippi Today, reiterated several times this session that the House Republican Caucus is not obligated to adhere to the Open Meetings Act because it is not a “public body.”
>
>House leaders have used that interpretation to bar the public from the caucus meetings. During the March 14 caucus meeting regarding the tax bill, two journalists were barred entry.
>
>A top Senate Republican leader, granted anonymity to speak candidly, put it this way:
>
>“Take a look at votes in the House and the Senate. In the Senate, we have Republicans who are voting how they want to or how they think their districts would vote — even if it goes against what Senate leadership wants. That’s the way lawmaking should be. We may lose some votes, but that’s the way it goes. Everyone can go back to their districts and genuinely explain why they voted the way they did. But take a look at the House votes. They’re always in line with what leadership wants. You think every single House Republican really agrees with the speaker on every bill he wants passed? Funny how that works.”

Think of it as an elimination diet. After the anomalies continue to stack and thus eliminate variables the most probable cause is left standing. That's how critical thinking works.

"...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN LOUISIANA INTO SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI... CORRECTED MRGL RISK LINE

...SUMMARY... A substantial severe weather event -- including potential for significant tornadoes -- remains evident over the Lower Mississippi Valley/central Gulf Coast region Tuesday.

...Synopsis... A upper trough and expansive area of highly amplified cyclonic flow will shift gradually eastward across the central U.S. Tuesday, as a closed low likely evolves over the Mid Missouri Valley area with time.

At the surface, a low is forecast to move across the Missouri vicinity through the day, with a trailing cold front forecast to reach the Mississippi Delta region during the afternoon. Late in the period, the low should reside over the Illinois vicinity, with the cold front extend southward across Kentucky/Tennessee/Alabama to the Florida Panhandle.

...Lower Mississippi/central Gulf Coast States... A regional severe-weather outbreak -- including potential for several tornadoes (a few potentially significant) remains evident for Tuesday. Severe storms -- including tornado risk -- will likely be ongoing at the start of the period across the Sabine River Valley area of east Texas/western Louisiana, as a surface cold front moves steadily eastward.

As southerly flow ahead of the front continues to advect high theta-e air northward from the Gulf, limited heating will allow destabilization to occur through the morning and into the afternoon. At this time, it appears that in addition to storms occurring ahead of the advancing front, pre-frontal cellular convection will also evolve through late morning/afternoon. With strong low-level southerly flow (50 to 70 kt at 850mb) in place, and 70 to 90 kt mid-level westerlies overspreading the region, shear very favorable for strong updraft rotation and low-level mesocyclones will exist. As such, potential for strong tornadoes will exist with the evolving supercell storms ahead of the front. Additionally, tornadoes (along with damaging winds and hail) will be likely with storms shifting eastward in tandem with the cold front. Into the evening and overnight, severe risk -- including potential for tornadoes and damaging winds -- will continue. While diminishing somewhat later in the period, threat will likely spread across southern Alabama and into the Florida Panhandle.",t2_yu1sf,SemiLazyGamer,0,1647789231.0,0,t1_i1etd7h,i1etd7h,True,SemiLazyGamer,t3_tin756,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/tin756/be_prepared_for_tuesday_moderate_risk_of_severe/,Be prepared for Tuesday; moderate risk of severe weather predicted,/r/mississippi/comments/tin756/be_prepared_for_tuesday_moderate_risk_of_severe/i1etd7h/,8,r/mississippi,0,8

No, the government's position would be more like, *""It's your bridge and your responsibility to fix it. And if you damage our ditch or road while working on your bridge then you have to fix that too.""*

Looking at the pictures I would *guess* that it was built by a former landowner. Mainly because there are no guardrails, but then there aren't needed guardrails on the highway either.

"St Martin right north of Ocean Springs, most of it did not flood in Katrina. Houses are cheaper, close to Biloxi and Downtown Ocean Springs. And you don't have to pay city tax.

Other then that, stay close to the interstate to avoid hurricanes. But honestly it's not that bad. You get lots of warning before one. 


There is lots of outdoor activities. Kayaking, sailing, boating, fishing, running, biking, kite boarding, adult rec leagues, and there is even a national park in Ocean Springs.

The housing market is really good. Just don't move to downtown Ocean Springs. Their market is crazy. There is a 900 sqft house listed for 370k that went under contract in less then 2 days. And don't move near any of the bases. Those areas are pretty sketch. 

There is some sight seeing. You got museums, we have the schooner walk on sails, Betsy Ann River boat, tiki boat, and art exhibits. 

The coast has a drinking culture. Pretty much everything is a bar. Clothing store, home store, coffee shop, aquarium, art openings, biking groups. Lots of drinking. One of the coasts favorite outdoor activities is drinking outside.


There is some fun kayaking, and groups that plan events. Launching your kayak from the beach is a lot of fun! You can kayak to deer island.

The beach is not crystal blue because of the barrier islands. But it's not that bad. It's still fun. 

It can get really hot in the summer. But it's not all the time. You can always go swimming when that happens. The casinos open their pools to the public during the summer for a fee.


There is some great night life in Dowtown Ocean Springs and Dowtown Bay St Louis. Biloxi also has some fun bars. Not too much in Gulfport, there used to be more but a lot of them went under.

If you like sailing try to join a yacht club. You can take out the clubs boats. And you can go to all the clubs on the coast form New Orleans to Pensacola.

"You need to get better at quoting your own sources, dude. Your number is way off.

>California receives the highest total amount of federal funding at **$43.61 billion**. California, however, only receives net federal funding of **$12 per resident**.

How much did Mississippi receive per person? $6,880. California has 13X (thirteen times) the population that we do, so that's why they got a larger piece of the pie overall. Another thing to consider, this is 2022 data (a little odd since we're not even halfway through the year yet) so this reflects a lot of pandemic money influx and stimulus monies. It's better to look at pre-pandemic data. Don't worry, I've done my homework:

"I have known a few people that moved here from CO.  Every one of them  moved back within a year.

One of the reasons why most of the people in live in MS are from MS is because adapting to the climate is almost impossible if you didn't grow up in it.     It is a subtropical climate and it will feel like it for 9-10 months out of the year.

There are certainly outdoor activities.   But you will be trying to do them when it's 100+ degrees and over 85% humidity much of the year.    

As far as hurricanes, the more powerful ones can still be category 1 or 2 when they reach central MS.    And during hurricane season we always have one or two hit the coast.

"I actually did the opposite; MS to CO.  I haven't been back to MS in a while, but I can answer a couple of these.

\- You can do all those things you listed.  Obviously, the hikes will be much flatter than you're used to.  Sightseeing will be limited in MS, but you're close to NO.

\- The main thing to be wary of with house prices is flood insurance.  On the extreme end, it can double a mortgage.  It will be worse the closer you are to the water.

\- Not sure about the VA hospital, but I'm sure there are a number of vets down there, so there's got to be something.  Again, NO is somewhat close and I'm sure has something.

\- Yes, hurricanes are a serious concern and, to be brutally honest, one of the main reasons I would never move there.  Pretty much the whole area is a 'flood zone' due to potential storm surge, hence the high flood insurance rates.  And regardless of your personal views on climate change, hurricanes do seem to be getting worse, so it's a matter of 'when' not 'if' you place gets decimated in a storm.

Anyhow, I don't mean to be doom-and-gloom.  It is a wonderful area, and I hope you find a good place.  As you said, housing prices are quite good.  Just be careful to consider insurance and HOA fees, as that can also be a 'hidden cost' when you're house-hunting.

I believe the crime rate in Jackson is much more complicated than these trivial pictures being painted, but your argument here is what was being pulled apart earlier. 

Jackson, by a wide margin, is what sets the crime rate in MS. It is not a state-wide problem. 

Murder is a life problem. It is a problem for all human kind. But excluding Jackson, it is more a problem in MS than anywhere else.

"You seem to take the most radical, hyperbolic position towards anybody who has a different stance than you.  Its a very cynical way of looking at the world.

On the dems are the worst party ever created narrative you have, whats your view on FDR?  He was arguably the most socialist president in the history of our country, but often regarded as one the best.  He led the US through the Great Depression with his socialist policies, and was elected overwhelmingly to 4 consecutive terms by what is referred to as ""The Greatest Generation"".  Of course now his policies would cause him to be labeled, and he was by some at the time, a dictator.  No way he would get the 95% of the MS vote today, but for some reason MS felt like those policies benefitted the poor in MS.  Do you feel like ""the greatest generation"" title need some revisiting?

"First off, don't put words in my mouth.  You don't know me or what I like.  And I absolutely don't disagree that healthy mothers are great and help raise healthy children.

I like self sustainability.  If you can't take care of yourself and your offspring, don't get pregnant.  We spend plenty of tax dollars giving out free contraceptives, use that.  We spend plenty of tax dollars on educational resources.  Know the risks and prepare before you get pregnant.

And what I really don't like is the government forcing people  who have no interest to fund it.  If it is that near and dear to your heart to see these women cared for, go start a charity.  Give them your money.  Spend less time whining on reddit and more time fundraising.  But don't force me to pay for it.

"The spending shows that some states have better scores on less money and some states have scores as bad with more spending, you can’t just go by spending as the only metric. It’s not so much about the level of spending as much as a family dynamic that encourages students to learn. 

My comment toward sex ed was actually in jest based on the poor performance of students, was not saying it shouldn’t be taught. Should have been more clear with that. 

Seeing as “welfare” in one form another has been around since the 30’s I would say you are in the long term gamble as opposed to not having a welfare system. Now to clarify I don’t want to just shut off welfare but instead create an economy where welfare isn’t needed. I also understand that ideal is not possible with current policies from Democrats or Republicans in any state or federal legislature. 

Money invested into systems that have a good return are worth it. Expanding college level trade schools for better access as opposed to liberal arts degrees that don’t have any economic demand, putting vocational classes back into high schools and expanding those programs. Improving MS infrastructure to attract more businesses into the state. These programs return on investment, paying people to sit at home has zero return.

McConnell wasn’t born rich but his wife sure was! She was left an estate of almost 59 million on her mothers passing.

"Two things can be true. There are lots of things that can increase inflation. Walmart would just pass the cost onto the consumer, hence the tax issue reappearing. Also, you know what counties currently have low inflation rates? Iran, Vietnam and Indonesia are leading the pack, should we emulate their economic models as a result? The EU’s inflation rate is several points lower than ours but they have pretty generous social programs which means they did less to bail out people and businesses during the pandemic. I think one thing we lose site of in these arguments is the fact that sometimes you only have bad options and the question is what is the least bad of the bad options. Maybe less monetary stimulus would have been better but then we would have seen more businesses fail and more people out on the streets.

"I responded above. 

I don’t think you are un-Christian or doubt your desire to help someone truly in need.  And I’m sorry you got scammed by the woman.

I think you are just very unaware of the unfortunate reality of what’s it’s like without housing these days.   As someone pointed out, it’s not all addicts and those with mental health disorders.  There are the working poor, that may have fallen on hard times and are struggling with homelessness.  A large segment of Americans are one or two missed paychecks from living in their car. 

Everything that you  thought was suspicious sounded to me like a family experiencing homelessness. 

 Working van? That is shelter and transportation.  They wouldn’t sell it.  Its vital. 

Dad “hiding” in the van to make them look fatherless? Could be at a job. (Plus you say he’s sometimes visible so doesn’t sound like he’s trying to alway make them look fatherless). 

They drive “home?”  You don’t know that.  They may be driving to a spot where they can sleep. (If they are in fact living in the van, they can’t just park it anywhere.)

Not out in the rain? i would imagine it sucks to beg in the rain. I would skip that too.

"The rich and poor do not pay the same amount. Because they are the highest consumers, the people that are shelling out the most for gas right now are average business owners -- some of the loudest and whiniest people around. You can argue that many taxes are ""regressive"" grocery taxes, vehicle registration fees, etc. but no one is bitching about those, or trying to temporarily suspend them. It's just another hot button topic.

The rich have the luxury of living 30+ minutes outside of where they work, and love driving to the coast or those god-forsaken shithole white trash magnets up north Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge, while the poor can only afford to drive short distances. 

The actual cost of fuel is the real problem, and temporarily suspending a gas tax is just more feel-good bullshit. Why not put price-controls in place? Oh no holy shit, we can't do that, that would be sOhShulLizM!!! Dat mite hert mah good buddy werkin' off shore!!! Wah.

"The law prohibits public schools, community colleges, and universities from compelling students “to personally affirm, adopt or adhere to” any of these tenets: “(a) That any sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin is inherently superior or inferior; or (b) That individuals should be adversely treated on the basis of their sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin.”

You can still teach that evil white slave owners were democrats.

That after they lost the war of northern aggression, they conspired to deprive freed slaves of civil rights.

That they initiated and practiced Jim Crow.

That they opposed civil rights.  That LBJ was a member of the kkk.  That democrats killed civil rights workers.

It prohibits teachers from teaching African Americans are superior to whites athletically.  It doesn’t prohibit teaching that there are more African American athletes in the NFL and NBA.

"I can only answer for myself, and my answer is this - because pointless gestures meant to appease his potential voters is ALL he does. Failing infrastructure and a massive exodus of teachers from the state are key issues that need to be addressed immediately. Low wages, the recently-killed attempt to extend Medicaid past two months post-childbirth. Things that would make Mississippi a better state for everyone all fall to the wayside in favor of playing politics in an attempt to secure a re-election. I personally disagree with his handling of Covid restrictions, but that’s far too divisive of a subject for me to get into. 


Upon reading the details of senate bill 2113, it does state that colleges are included. Those opposed to it tend to see this and similar bills as an attempt to white-wash history and downplay or downright ignore atrocities committed before/during the civil war and the civil rights movement. You can look to instances of other states attempting to ban materials related to such events, along with the mayor of Ridgeland attempting to remove LGBTQ+ books from city libraries by withholding funds. I’m…not trying to deflect, just pointing out similarities. At this point I’ve used up my entire lunch break and rambled enough. I hope some of that can at least clear up my perspective and why I’m so often frustrated with Mississippi legislation.
