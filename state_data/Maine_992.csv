"It's a common issue with this industry. We have a lot of people come in and apply at our company who we just cannot use. Most recently I had someone who just got their cdl and had never driven alone or on the road. He had epilepsy and managed it with pot. Could barely hold a conversation. I can't put them into a truck and send them down the road. 

It's nice when your laborers can drive themselves, but we hire plenty of people without licenses and will even give them a ride home or help coordinate rides. Then there are others who only show up 3 days a week. We had one guy who never showed up on Friday or Monday and usually was ""sick"" every single Monday. Then he suggested we work 6days a week, as if he would show up on the weekends. 

It helps you if you help your employees and pay a liviable wage. Everyone has their own life problems and appointments etc. It's how you handle it. If you know you have an appt coming up, say something.  Don't wait and send a text at 11pm after agreeing at 5pm you'll be on site by 6am. Or just not show up and wait until we have to call and ask where you are to say ""oh I have an appt"".

I have 3 kids, 7, 11 and 14 and many things to keep track of so I understand personal lives. Most of these guys don't even have children. But a heads up helps. Especially if we have 13 trucks of hottop hauling to us and we are all of a sudden short a guy or 2 that we REALLY need, it makes everyone elses jobs harder. I'm 5'4 and when I'm loading paver I have to walk on my tippy toes, for miles to see inside the paver. We've since welded a step on for the short women we are. 

We do work with dirigo slipform too. However I would not put up an add like this. Because it does sound like they would be miserable to deal with. People who don't work in construction do not realize what it's really like.

"This. I had plenty of friends work construction, and this sounds about right. The ones who could show up on time and follow directions stayed on. The ones who were always late kept getting fired.

The ONLY thing I don't understand is: ""cannot talk and work at the same time."" I don't like to chit chat at work, I find it fucking annoying, because I'm there to work, not be buddies. But maybe they mean something else, like being able to take direction and report critical information about a site they're working. Like I said, I don't understand what that's referring to.

Note: I noticed someone below bitching about folks taking unemployment in the off season and referring to it as ""gaming the system."" No, that's how unemployment system WORKS. We pay into it, we get it back when we're laid off. My father worked in furniture and fencing companies all his life, it was common to have seasonal disruptions to the work and have to lay off workers for a few weeks or months until they could start producing again. Finding another job in Maine is fucking hard as hell, especially if your main job is returning in three or four months and you just need a temporary gig.

Employers pay into a fund for unemployment.

Certain industries like construction or landscaping, obviously lay people off in the winter because plants don't grow and concrete doesn't set in freezing conditions. 

That fund that employers pay into, provides compensation to workers in those fields that the rest of us rely on for the rest of the year.

Unemployment is paid for by employers, not the general public.

Personally, I work for an engineering firm, I don't get laid off in the winter but if my employer didn't pay into this system, there'd be no one to do the work we hire folks to do in warmer months.

I would find proof, perhaps maine.gov? I would suggest department of education, but I honestly think they just cover public schools (k-12). There must be a college systems board that the issue can be escalated to. 

Either look it up yourself or ask your classmate where to find federal and accreditation rules/laws. Print that complete section out (it should be from a .gov or .org).

Personally, I feel like if you're doing well enough, your grades are being recorded, and you're passing, you should take it as an easy (independent) class. 


I've had 2 classes where the instructors were about as active as the one you describe and it was frustrating for sure. I had to Google a lot of information myself due to lack of responses or extremely vague responses. I also included the lack of involvement in the course evaluations. 


Ultimately, you are paying for the course and your instructors time, I would review the handbook provided by your school (should be located on their website, probably a pdf file).

"> i dont really care that they make money they should thats the point of a business.

So you're OK with extremely rich people exploiting you for any sum of money because ""that's the point of a business,"" but you want the state to eliminate the gas tax and destroy its own roads to...save you 30 cents a gallon? What do you think the point of a government is? 

And what would stop the oil companies from simply raising the gas price an extra 30 cents and pocketing that as profit, too? They already know the market will support that price, and as you say, the point of a business is to make money, so eliminating the gas tax would just be destroying our own roads for no reason. 

You'll pay the same price at the pump and double your vehicle maintenance costs banging it around shitty roads, while oil company execs get richer.

It's always fun to blame foreigners, but OPEC accounts for about 14% of US crude imports, and roughly half of our crude is produced domestically, so...no.

"I agree. The market is the cause of the problem; the market will eventually solve it. If a vast percentage of these homes are going to AirBnBs and Vrbos (and I think that notion is vastly overstated), either tourism will rise to support them or it won't. If it does, that's money that stays in Maine and increases everyone's capability to afford homes; if it doesn't, those homes will be back on the market, maybe at lower rates.

Otherwise, supply has to rise to meet demand. Developers will start building more homes. (There are reasons they don't, some articulated here, but the biggest reason is that there hasn't been demand.) That means more jobs, and higher-paying jobs, which increases everyone's ability to afford a home.

Maine had it good for a long time. A few years ago, north of Portland, you could get waterfront in the 200s, less if you were willing to fix up. It wasn't a situation that was going to last forever.

"I'm not your dweeb, spanky!

But you're approaching this from a very urban-centric view, which is kind of wild for how absolutely rural Maine still is. Our ""urban"" areas generally comprise less than 40,000 people (a lot less). 

When we have these arguments we're often talking about a few blocks of real estate. There is A. LOT. of Maine ripe for development. Portland gets all the attention but it's already spilling out to the bedroom communities around Portland (try and tell me Scarborough, Westbrook or South Portland have anemic development).

"Goober? You watch your mouth, dweeb!

The fact is that high end development addresses a need - more houses are more houses in the end. High end condos on the east end in Portland help the housing market in the end. Basically, any and all new residential construction should go through, regardless of zoning or local objections. It all helps (obviously, $500k houses help more than $1MM). 

But you can't force people to do what you want, the rage against expensive housing seems self-defeating to me. Anytime you allow a mechanism for obstruction (parking, traffic, neighborhood character), it's going to be used to oppose development. The only people who can fight that NIMBY norm? Deep pockets...which means expensive construction.

Cheap housing is made less competitive by every local control effort, ordinance, or restriction basically.

Edit: an anecdote. I work with a good guy, has a family and a couple multi family affordable buildings. Bangor pushing an ordinance to allow tenement/room rentals to bypass hotel & BnB laws. 

It benefits housing, makes more available and improves housing affordability.

It also creates flophouses around people's children and families. He opposes because it materially worsens his family's life.


The NIMBY is being rational. His life is made much worse by the poor shitty addicts flooding the neighborhood.

I’ve been priced out of homes in the town I grew up in and found out that my neighbors are rent to own not outright buyers. So some firm is making money off them when for the last few people who lived there owned it. I know Inn owners in northern NH who can’t get workers because all the places to live turned into air BnBs. I’m not from Maine but I want to buy a house as a first time home buyer because jobs situation took my wife to mid costal Maine and I’d like live closer to where she works but the fact is I can’t really find homes to buy or rent in NH or Maine because this stuff is happening.,t2_506qw,shenanighenz,0,1648231468.0,0,t1_i23eqac,i23eqac,False,Themustanggang,t3_tnq0d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/tnq0d6/i_think_first_time_home_buyers_should_have_more/,I think First time home buyers should have more protections in Maine,/r/Maine/comments/tnq0d6/i_think_first_time_home_buyers_should_have_more/i23eqac/,5,r/Maine,0,5

The ethos of a free market is based on the competitive  market model, and one of the many conditions for that market at that no consumer and no seller can influence prices - all parties are ""price takers"" and the price outcome is purely the product of an equilibrium in supply and demand. 

Hedge funds, speculators, Air BnB buyers and corporations are NOT price takers. They do affect prices and are not ""price takers"". They have purchased 1 out of 4 homes in some markets last year, this enormously affects the supply and prices.

"There is an easy answer to this problem, I’ve said it before and will say it again.

State wide residential property tax, with a huge homestead exemption like $500,000.  So if your primary residence is in Maine and your home is valued at $500,000 or less there is no impact of this tax on you.

If you own a second home in Maine that would be subject to the tax. All seasonal and second home would be effected. 

Use this extra money to help lower or eliminate income tax to those making $150,000 or less.

">What this proposal would do, in effect, is make registering to vote as an undocumented immigrant, easier and with less stipulations, than a Maine citizen resident.

Yes, of course it would.  It would indeed make it easier to register to vote in Portland municipal elections than registering as a 'normal' voter in Maine who votes on everything/all levels of elections, as there would be fewer requirements to register.  I am not disputing that.

I was simply pointing out that you were misinterpreting things when you said Portland is waiving a residency requirement.  Portland is not waiving residency requirements.  You will still need to be a Portland resident to vote in Portland municipal elections.

"I don't think it should be an argument, just common sense.


If you want the right to vote in a country, you should be a citizen.

Comparing how other countries interact with one another really has nothing to do with us, each country (state/territory/county/whatever wording you wish) has its own rules, laws, and ways it conducts it's businesses. Nobody is binding you to this country, if you disagree with the way we as nation conducts itself, you are free to leave and become a citizen of another country (which will also be a process and you would have to meet the certain requirements of).


To freely roam from one place to another, like within the US for example, hurts the full-time citizens. Think about it, a census is done every 10 years, that census aids in dictating where funding is allocated to (there are probably more deciding factors, I'm no genius here). If we suddenly get 10,000 more citizens (number pulled out my ass, for example purposes) that becomes 10,000 more people using our roads and resources that haven't been budgeted (accounted) for. Those 10,000 people are now forcing us to stretch what we did budget for among the already existing population and the new unaccounted for residents. Now if we're considering just moving throughout the states, where did these 10,000 come from? Wherever they left, those funds are still being allocated to, they do not follow the person. 

Maybe what I'm saying makes no sense, feel free to tell me. I am slightly sick, so not 100% sure I said any of that correctly.

Personally, I see the loss of resources during tourist season in my small town. The grocery stores can't keep up with the amount of people that come here. It's a small town (rough population of 3500). When tourists are less likely to swarm here, (ignoring covids effect of the supply chain here) the stores are able to keep the shelves stocked well. When tourists come here it becomes a disaster. The shelves can get cleaned out easily. The local grocery store is perfectly capable of supplying the local population of 3500, but when you add tourists into the mix, resources and space (it is a small store) become very limited.",t2_i27l7og6,Serendipitous_159,0,1648226906.0,0,t1_i233020,i233020,False,Zorrothegayblade207,t3_tm2bia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/tm2bia/portland_could_be_1st_in_state_to_allow/,Portland could be 1st in state to allow noncitizen and undocumented residents to vote,/r/Maine/comments/tm2bia/portland_could_be_1st_in_state_to_allow/i233020/,1,r/Maine,0,1

"I feel pretty confident that if someone is already struggling to pay their rent every month, adding $20 to the bill isn't going to help. 

Moreover, it doesn't require having ""intimate knowledge of every single person’s financial situation"" to understand basic math. If you have the money to pay your 1/3 of your rent 3 times per month, you have the money to pay 3/3 of your rent 1 time per month.

Loans can be genuinely helpful over longer time-scales. I have the money to pay for my house over 360 monthly payments, whereas I do not have the money to pay for it in one payment, so a mortgage is – or at least can be – mutually beneficial. The lender makes some money from my interest, and I get to live in a house even though I don't have the money to pay for it up front. We both materially benefit from this arrangement.

There is no material benefit for a renter paying an extra $20 per month to split one payment into three.

"I am claiming that.

You don't really seem to have researched the issue thoroughly or read any of the statutes governing voting in Maine, or the section governing voter registration in the city charter.

I'll break it down for you:

the current charter says voters must register via the State system.

The

the state system says you must produce an id and a proof of residence.

[https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/pdf/voterregcard20.pdf](https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/pdf/voterregcard20.pdf)

The proposal says:

""City officials must enact implementing ordinances to create procedures to carry out this section, including but not limited to ordinances ensuring that:

Voter registration forms allow municipal voter registration without no questions about immigration or citizenship status;""

Undocumented immigrants have no form of ID, so asking them for ID would constitute a form of ""question about immigration or citizenship status"".

Producing some bill or envelope with a name and address and without any corresponding ID seems very suspect to me, and does not really convince me you've ""established residency""

And I find it highly presumptuous to move to another country and demand the ability to make laws and govern its citizens, instantly. I don't really care how many groceries you buy or children you have in the schools.

Why would you be opposed to limiting the vote to lawful permanent residents? That seems to address the question of ID and residency. Remember, the imperative is on you to convince citizens why they shouldn't care about who votes in their elections, rather than have citizens convince you why there should be restrictions on who is allowed to vote in their elections.",t2_hamvj476,hypegnotic,0,1648219839.0,0,t1_i22kw2o,i22kw2o,False,Zorrothegayblade207,t3_tm2bia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/tm2bia/portland_could_be_1st_in_state_to_allow/,Portland could be 1st in state to allow noncitizen and undocumented residents to vote,/r/Maine/comments/tm2bia/portland_could_be_1st_in_state_to_allow/i22kw2o/,-1,r/Maine,0,-1

"Surely you aren't claiming that Portland is trying to allow people without a Portland address to vote Portland elections?

'Residency' in my comments mean literal residence in the city in question, it's not about duration of presence. If you've lived in the city for three weeks but you moved here and are not a visitor you're a resident. 

You know, someone who is a part of the community, whose children would go to that city's schools, who works in the area, who buys their groceries locally.

I don't understand what you're fixation on residency is in this context, unless you think I was talking about 'residency' as it pertains to the Federal immigration and naturalization process. As I've mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the city of Portland doesn't deal with immigration, neither they nor I are referring to the Federal immigration requirements for years lived in the US when we use the term 'residency' in this discussion of CITY policy.

"Except this proposal has no residency requirement, so it doesn't distinguish between long term members of the community, and people who may or may not actually be residents of Portland.

Restricting the vote to lawful permanent residents would be one thing; but the proposal is opening the vote to anybody who happens to be able to produce something as flimsy as an envelope with a name. I have followed the process since the beginning, and have attended many of the subcommittee meetings, and they are against restricting the vote to lawful permanent residents because it is the opinion of the non-elected, volunteer lawyer who wrote the proposal that ""it would be too complicated"" to verify lawful status. Hence, no status requirement.

1 in 7 single family homes sold in 2021 in the US were sold to investment companies.  They are buying them sight unseen for over the asking price because they can pay cash.  A  normal person taking out a mortgage and needing a home inspection or appraisal can't compete.

I've been following the housing crisis for ages.. but last week I saw a great story on 60 Minutes  about it.   This incredibly arrogant CANADIAN investment company talking about how no one wants the ""responsibility of owning a house"" and that they are ""happy to rent"" a place at twice the going rate.  They own huge swathes of the US south.  Especially in Texas.

It's honestly beginning to feel like every dystopian post apocalyptic movie ever around here.

"This post reminds me of when I took my drivers test the first time, he had me take a turn onto a two-lane one-way road.

He didn't say anything at the time, let me keep on doing the test and at the end said while I did well he had to fail me for turning into the wrong lane on that one-way street. It sucked but whatever, I was able to schedule another test a few weeks later.


The next time around I had a different instructor but he ended up taking me on pretty much the same route, came across the same turn and I went right into the potholes which bounced us all around. The instructor told me that time, while it was correct to enter that lane when there is obvious issues with the road it would have been more prudent to go into the other lane.

"Credit to Maine Bike Works for this information. The Saco Drive-in is a treasure and we should exhaust every option we can to try to preserve it.

...


If you love having a local drive-in as much as we do, please considering signing the following online petition asking the new owners of the Saco Drive-In (the national Hale Trailer Brake & Wheel) to reconsider their plans to demolish the 2nd oldest drive-in in the country to build their newest location. 

https://chng.it/8jqcQ89MZ6

Yes, it's a private property that the new owners can do what they want with, but once it's gone, it's gone so why not investigate all available options before the wrecking ball starts to swing?

Upon hearing of the sale, the City of Saco offered to swap the land out for another suitable parcel to Hale to park their trailers on that doesn't house such a historic and beloved symbol of the town and run it through the Parks and Rec department, but Hale has yet to take them up on the offer.

After signing the petition above, you may want to follow along with the discussions on this FB group as rumors have it that the attention the sale has gotten in the last few days is pushing the new owners demolition plans forward from a year or two away to imminently before more of the public find out about it:

Commissioner Washburn's response was unclear. She said something like a utility bill, or whatever people use. The fact that you can't establish residency in Maine without documents unattainable by undocumented immigrants, does not matter

The commissioner let some random lawyer who spoke up at a meeting literally dictate all the ideas in the proposal to her, because the first proposal she wrote would not have ""protected"" undocumented immigrants who voted, in the proper ways.

"No need to be rude, I think we're missing each other.  Lets get back to the basics:  
You said: *""the proposed says that Undocumented (illegal) immigrants would be able to vote, and* ***explicitly waives documentation and residency requirements****""*  
I'm not being ignorant, the word undocumented nor illegal is anywhere in the proposed amendment.  I completely understand the argument that not asking questions about citizenship will undoubtedly lead to undocumented people registering to vote.  While the first half is wrong, the second part is truly egregious, to which I replied:  


*""The proposal waives questions on immigration or citizen status, but not residency. You'll still need to prove you're a resident of Portland to vote in Portland.""*  
This is accurate.  If the proposal passed, a person still needs to prove they **reside** in Portland, but not that they're a **citizen of America**.  Residing somewhere is not the same as being a citizen; you're confusing those terms.

 *It also doesn't say anywhere that undocumented people would be allowed to vote either- that seems to be BDN's intentional misinterpretation for clicks.""*  
This was to the first part and doesn't matter.. and while I absolutely concede that **""undocumented"" or ""illegal"" people will be able to register to vote more easily**, I stand by every word of this statement.  The proposal does not say anywhere that undocumented people will be allowed to vote, probably because that term and sentence would be too unclear to be used.    
The second half of your post explaining how it violates state law I comprehend entirely.  While I do think believe temporary and permanent residents having a right to vote in local matters has its merits, I am not trying to debate that it or this proposal would be currently legal under state law.

I'm not as familiar with Caribou as I should be, but I do know it's not that far to Houlton (an hour and change), and I'm pretty sure the Hannaford's is bigger and has more of a selection.  It's not great, but better than nothing.  Also, once the border reopens to casual traffic, there's a co-op in Florenceville-Bristol and big supermarkets in Woodstock.  Plus, farmers' markets are always good for seasonal stuff and you might even pick up some plants to grow your own.  Better there than in any of the chains; they're more likely to be acclimated to the climate.

"Who detests their country? Even if we have not made good on it, the idea and promise of what America could be is something I think most people can get behind.  

I don't place much value on citizenship for sure, it has no reflection on the individual other than where you fall out of the womb.  People who wrap more than that up in it usually do so because its one of the few things they can put value in in order to boost their own esteem, but it's as worthless as any other ""un-earned"" reward.  The only people who ascribe more value to it than that do so because they have a deep ""need"" to.

Could you cite me a scholar who believes citizenship arose to prevent domination by the strongest?  Because the greeks who created it were pretty clear on why they were doing it and wrote about it at length, and it was most assuredly not that line of shit you are trying to sell as those ""weakest members"" of society were excluded from it entirely.  I swear the historical shit some people will ""revise"" to make that yoke chaffe less never fails to amaze me.  I mean does making that shit up or buying into something that is obviously false actually help?  Man, that would make it worse for me I think.

"This brought back so many memories. I also did not want to drive, and my mother always said that I couldn't get my license without having a job anyway. I lived in a town of 500 people, in a valley, far from anything (Weld). My argument was that I couldn't get a job without getting my license (arranging around her schedule as a nurse was impossible, since she worked nights). 

Eventually I put in the paperwork to take my test, I think I was 20, 21? State defaulted me to Mexico because of where I lived. I drove in Farmington / Wilton. I had NEVER driven in Mexico. Mom didn't want to let me practice, so la de da, off I went. Mexico has a lot of one way streets, that are 2 lanes with no traffic. Some of them were even unmarked. So I go where the instructor tells me, make my left, boom, fail, I was in the right lane of a one way street. Second test, also Mexico, still no practice here (thanks mom). I can't remember what I failed that time, but I feel it was also one way related. This guy lets me know I can request where to take my test, and suggested I go to Farmington. 

So third test, that's what I do. Passed fine, I recall parallel parking between 2 cars on a hill, probably on Front Street. That was the one thing I had a lot of practice on because my dad was a mechanic and I practiced around the parked cars in the driveway (it was huge, big enough for 2 cars wide, 3 cars long, 3 wide if you reallllly needed to).",t2_j7r7o,asahiyuy,0,1648170848.0,0,t1_i20b539,i20b539,True,ohwowathrowaway-,t3_tn7gnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/tn7gnm/my_experience_with_our_states_road_test_was_kind/,My experience with our state's road test was kind of confusing.

"i'm sorry you detest your own country and existence so as to place no value on citizenship and what it entails, but i don't agree with that feeling at all.

citizenship is a valid and necessary concept; i am not an anarchist, nor do i believe most people are. many scholars believe citizenship arose in order to prevent domination by the strongest; it gave the weakest members of society a mechanism to be stronger as a whole. and literally everything is arbitrary, but for the value we give it. I happen to put a lot of value on democracy, and believe citizenship is a necessary component of successful democracy. but go off, if it makes you feel good.

bottom line, you should respect people who value their rights as citizens. you really don't know what you're talking about or doing.

"Lol, my worldview would keep you up at night, but let me assure you, there is nothing ""American Centric"" about it.  Saying that every country in the world does it the same way as though that makes it ok is something I for sure don't ascribe to.  You are going to put your back out trying the gymnastics to turn my disdain from this into some kind of ""American Centric"" slight against me. 

""Citizenship"" is nothing more than gatekeeping the individual behind some bullshint line some asshole drew on a map long before they were born in order to protect the status quo and those who are in power.  From its origin with the Greeks, where it was limited only to those men who owned property, not women, slaves or the poor; it came over in almost the exact form to here.  We have since passed laws to open it up trying to make good on that whole ""everyone is equal"" pitch, but it is still serving the same fundamental service where it and other methods of limiting voting is used as a club against what is predominantly the poorest parts of society.  

The whole idea of how we do things is insanity, you can have a individual who lives in a community, pays taxes, works, raises kids, owns property, is a valued member of that society for decades in some cases... But they can not throw a nearly meaningless vote in some bullshit dog and pony city council meeting because of where they were born?  Ya, that makes sense... Not.  Shit your pants over some talking head spoon fed ""fear of non citizens making laws in your home country"" if you want, but not only is that not a thing this would not lead to that anyway.

"Oh man this brought back a bad memory. I took my drivers test in Bath and she had me parallel park behind one car in front of BIW, like I could have just pulled in behind it. So many angry honks. So much teen anxiety.

Edited to add: Failed that one. I was trying to inch past a snowbank at a stop sign and she thought I was just going for it. I don’t think I knew anyone who passed on the first try.

"You don’t seem to know how immigration in the US works. There are a lot of long term visas and not all of them grant you permanent status. Someone can live here for decades without the right of citizenship. There are cases of sons of immigrants deported after they turn 21 because they can’t maintain citizenship.

Also the paying 500k for a VISA is something that the US does. It’s the one of only two kinds of greencard that is not employed based. The other is high skilled individuals.

I’m on one kind of skilled individual visa, O1. Your government literally want me here. I’ve been in the US for almost a decade now but I still can’t vote. I pay taxes, I’m not a business owner but I’m in charge of hiring other people, so I’m literally creating more jobs, my children go to school, and I still can’t vote. 

Your idea of what an immigrant is is wrong.

Edit: I don’t know for Americans but for me it would be super easy to get a work visa to Canada.

"This is the extent of the mechanism for registering to vote:

""Voter registration forms allow municipal voter registration without no \[SIC\] questions about immigration or citizenship status;""

It says nothing about who qualifies to receive a form.

There are no requirements regarding residency or taxpaying or anything.

The way it is written, you can get a form, that says what exactly?? What does the form say??? What documents are required????

THERE IS NOTHING REQUIRED AS THE PROPOSAL STANDS.

Anyone who says they're a portland resident, gets a form! And an official document saying they're a registered voter!

It's lunacy
