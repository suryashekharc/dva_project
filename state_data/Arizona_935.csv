"They're definitely a type of [*undulatus*](https://whatsthiscloud.com/cloud-varieties/undulatus/) cloud, but it's difficult to determine the height, so they could either be really thin [altocumulus clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altocumulus_undulatus_cloud) or [cirrocumulus clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrocumulus_undulatus).  I'm leaning more toward altocumulus because of how much space there is between the rows of clouds.

The rows themselves are caused by wind shear.  In other words, sharp changes in wind direction with height cause the clouds to arrange themselves in rows.  With undulatus clouds, the rows are arranged in a manner that is perpendicular to the wind flow aloft. There is an upper-level ridge building into the area, which would cause an abrupt change in wind direction aloft, which could further explain the presence of these clouds.",t2_4b11q,giantspeck,0,1648278629.0,0,t1_i261csw,i261csw,True,LSUTGR1,t3_to9npc,https://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/to9npc/it_doesnt_take_much_to_find_the_inspiration/,"It doesn't take much to find the inspiration behind our state flag, especially today.",/r/arizona/comments/to9npc/it_doesnt_take_much_to_find_the_inspiration/i261csw/,1,r/arizona,0,1

To any casual observer these trails are not normal, and if you pay attention they appear in patterns certain days/weeks at a time regardless of atmospheric conditions. Past evidence suggests aluminum, barium, and strontium. See Mt Shasta research. Though there’s recently been a change to the color/consistency/dispersion rate.

"Phoenix Zoo is good, especially for kids since they provide a lot of educational content and it is laid out well. You can also hit the Desert Botanical Gardens just down the street and make a whole day out of it.

**Rule 10. No fundraising, self-promotion, or spam**

We consider spam not just anything directly promotional, but also anything intended to generate interest for a business, cause, website, or effort when the original poster is not a regular member of the community. Since this forum is “About Arizona, By Arizona” we also consider accounts that mass-post links across Reddit to be spam.  

We do not allow any fund raising links or posts asking for money. We also do not allow posts of referral code and similar promotions as businesses have used those as advertising ploys.  

If you have rarely (or never) posted in the sub before and your first post is promotional, it will likely be removed as spam. The guideline we use is no more than 1 in 10 posts someone makes should be about their own content.

any statistics on these claims?

...

don't worry I do. 

* A study found that in places that lane splitting was legal only 0.4% of motorcycle accidents involved lane splitting.

from 2005 - 2009 when lane splitting was only legal in California. [source](https://www.ots.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/67/2019/06/Motorcycle-Lane-Splitting-and-Safety-2015.pdf)

* California had significantly less motorcycle rear-end crashes than the national average.

* California had less motorcycle deaths, despite being denser than most places

* Its also been found that ""lane splitting riders were less likely to suffer head injury (9 vs 17 percent), torso injury (19 vs 29 percent) and fatal injury (1.2 vs 3 percent)""

"the point is to increase safety and reduce traffic. Being hit from behind is extremely dangerous for bikes and often kills motorcyclists, filtering allows bikes to reduce that risk by being between cars. 

it also allows us to move to the front where we are most visible, again a huge advantage in safety terms. Also with motorcycle being more capable of acceleration when the light turns green we are not in anybodies way. This means there are no negative effects for the cars either.

This is either fear mongering, or science denying and neither should be tolerated.

"AZ law is that your DL expires at age **65** and requires renewal each five years thereafter.  Also your motorcycle endorsement expires and you are required to retest rules of road and road test.  This adequately addresses aging drivers. 

You could argue for periodic road test requirements for people age 72\~75 plus.   

Two interviews were cited in the article:  

1) A Lyft driver claiming people don't understand the rules of the road.  How many of the poor drivers she sees are snowbirds licensed in other states?  My east valley community traffic volume roughly doubles during snowbird season.  Most of the traffic violations, speeding, and aggressive driving I witness occurs during snowbird season.  **US Rules of the Road** are largely uniform across the country and the rest of the world.  Probably the last significant Rules of the Road change was adoption of *Turn on Red* in the 1970's by Eastern states, Western states allowed this prior.

2) Maria Wojtczak, the **owner** of DrivingMBA has a conflict of interest.

"Hate to say it, but southern AZ counties are corrupt as hell when it comes to drugs and politics. These guys sound like cartel guys, they usually get a pass, and the judge gets a fancy house. I'm surprised they got any time at all.

  
When I worked for a PD in AZ, (won't say where) we had a case where a cartel mule had multiple bales of marijuana in the open bed of his pickup, and a submachine gun lying openly on the seat next to him. Judge dismissed the case as an ""illegal search"" with everything in plain view, and the mule making threats of physical harm against the officer.

The initial case was for theft of alcohol from a convenience store after they refused to sell to him after hours. He physically threatened the clerk, then shoved her and took the alcohol and walked out with it.

2) power grid is pretty, been here for 12 years, only lost power like 2 times, max was a couple hours 
3) haboobs (dust storms) are kinda rare but may happen durring Monsoon season...anywhere from mid June through Sept.
4) lots of hiking. Any hill, like South Mountain or especially the mogollon rim.
5) id say Glendale is kinda sketch...north west phoenix.

"**Bisbee 1,000** - October. You race through a historic mining town built on the side of mountains, and run up 1,000 stairs throughout the race. Beautiful, lots of art.  About 7 miles I think.

**Mesa Half** - one of the fastest in the country. Feb each year. Very well organized, good swag, great race finish expo too. 

**Arizona Rock n Roll** - the biggest half of the year. MLK weekend each year. 

[**Aravaipa Races**](https://www.aravaiparunning.com/) has something going on every couple of weeks. All trail runs. Summer races are at night. Bounces around all over the state.  Beautiful locations. The distances vary, and a single race event usually has 3-4 options between a 5-10k, 20-30k, 50k, 50 mile, 100k and/or 100 mile. Whiskey Basin races around Watson Lake are beautiful,  did the half last year. 

**Pat's Run** is in April. It's 4.2 miles and honors Pat Tillman. It's massive. You can usually finish before the final starting corrals are even released. 

The **Tucson marathon races** are in December. It's great to watch the sun rise over the mountains as you head downhill. 

**Man Against Horse** - 12.5M, 25M, 50M. Prescott, AZ, October. A human vs horses trail race. 

**Sedona races** - Superbowl weekend, Saturday. Tough 5k, and the half bombs downhill then back up. tough races but pretty.

"So wild. 

I have always wondered if tunnels form in certain areas because of what is under the ground. Like are the following underground water paths that create an electrical charge. It seems so random, but I think about this because I was next to a tree that got hit by lightening, out camping in the grand canyon many moons ago. It was the weirdest experience. The hair on my arms and neck stood up, there was almost a greenish tint and then lightening struck a tree we were staing next too. No thunder, no rain, but we were at the front end of a storm coming across the canyon. The ground definitely was charged before the strike. So I have always wondered if the ground was creating a charge for the tornadoes to follow.

It seems so weird that the funnels would hop scotch like that.

**Rule 10. No fundraising, self-promotion, or spam**

We consider spam not just anything directly promotional, but also anything intended to generate interest for a business, cause, website, or effort when the original poster is not a regular member of the community. Since this forum is “About Arizona, By Arizona” we also consider accounts that mass-post links across Reddit to be spam.  

We do not allow any fund raising links or posts asking for money. We also do not allow posts of referral code and similar promotions as businesses have used those as advertising ploys.

"So they’re holding a country hostage with pricing because of an attempt of a greener movement due to climate change? If that’s the stance that the opposing believe, why would they not be bothered that people who align with the same views as them are also screwing them over directly in the process by price gouging for not getting their way?

That in itself sounds like a problem yet people are in favor of it.

I’m not the most politically educated individual but if this is the true sentiment of what people think, I think they should really reevaluate the way they think that this stuff works.

Also, oil companies get government land for pennies, thus not really giving the state much of anything and then take a majority of the profits and end up costing all of us tax payers to pay the loss.

And with the exception of a handful of private charter schools, schools in this state can't afford to put in artificial turf.  In northern states such as Minnesota that have regular rain and cooler temperatures, grass just grows.  Football fields don't to be watered nearly as often to keep the turf green.

"ROFLMAO, I just looked up houses in LHC and that is NOT affordable. Even compared to Show Low / Lakeside its expensive. I can find houses in the east valley for much less, and I'm sure there's cheap around Tucson too because the metro areas have suburbs. I actually just looked and in Tucson itself the homes are cheaper when doing 1:1 comparisons. 

Now go to the Midwest and houses are much cheaper. Back east (the South and the far north) you can get a home in a nice town surrounded by forest for far less still.  

Flagstaff has been expensive for decades, back when Californians discovered it and moved there in droves. It became East SF back in the 90s.

"The noise is definitely a plus for me too. I legit can't sleep without the noise now since I've had it for a decade. It LASTS with very little maintenance (removing the filters to shake off the dust, which I do like, once or twice a year). 

And no, it isn't a swamp cooler like the one you linked, with the tradeoff being that you need to connect an exhaust hose to a fixture that you set in your window to blow the hot air out. Very easy to set up, btw, but obviously now it has to sit near a window. Mine is next to my desk in the corner of my room, so it is out of the way. 

I can understand going with a more affordable unit, but let me say, I got mine when I was 17 because my dad never let me turn the house AC to a comfortable temperature for my room, which was sun facing and above the garage, and I've never looked back.

"Honestly, the noise is a plus for me, it helps me fall asleep. If a fan or something advertises itself as silent I'll usually skip it for something that doesn't claim to be quiet or silent.

That being said, I ended up buying [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Arctic-Air-Pure-Chill/439527009) cheap-o $30 small evaporative AC on the recommendation of someone else. The plan is to figure out how I like the technology, if I feel like the cheapness of the product is limiting me, but it otherwise seems legit OR if the thing breaks then I'll invest in a proper full set. If for whatever reason evaporative cooling doesn't seem like the greatest option then I'm only out $30 which isn't nearly as big a deal as the $300 models I'm seeing elsewhere, and then I'll invest in something else that will cool my room - probably the one you linked since it doesn't look like it's an evaporative cooler, no?
