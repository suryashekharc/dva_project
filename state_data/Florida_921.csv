">So glad I have a choice in her schooling. I want my kid in a Christian school and thankfully we have had just that. As an educator who has taught from title 1 to public to charter to private schools I hope to NEVER not have a choice in her schooling.

As someone who went to private Catholic schools practically from birth until age 18, the education was highly damaging to me and many other students. One of my classmates sadly ended up homeless and committed suicide, while another attempted suicide shortly after graduation. My Catholic high school was also later revealed to have, in no uncertain terms:

1. Fired my theology teacher - a good, upstanding Christian man with a wife and young children who relied on his income - for blowing the whistle on a predatory priest.
2. Harbored said predatory priest, who went after teenage girls at my high school; denied; deflected; and did everything in their power to shield and defend said predator.
3. Was revealed to have harbored another predatory priest who had molested young boys. This priest had daily contact and no supervision with the school's students, myself included.

This is not counting the fierce and horrific bullying I endured in Catholic elementary and middle school(s), as well as abuse and neglect from teachers, and even the school principal - a nun - that resulted in overt symptoms of PTSD and trauma by age 9. I was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), and my 3rd grade teacher tried to force medication on me.

The school principal, in turn, threatened to cane me with a bladed ruler for ""bad behavior"", and then proceeded to shame and threaten me into silence ""so as not to tattle-tale to my parents"".

This is also not even touching the iceberg of how woefully unprepared I was for the reality of sex, drugs, and dating in college, given that private Catholic schools advocate ""abstinence-only education""; hire religious zealot Pam Stenzel to slut-shame girls at school; and much more. The Catholic private education directly led me to being taken advantage by predatory men.

All of suffering I endured being raised in Catholic private schools - and all of the pain, to the point of attempting or even succeeding at suicide, for my classmates - had me vow to always advocate for parents to strongly consider public schools for their children, including my future kids as well. I want to make sure another child never again has to suffer in the private school system.",t2_k11a2,Obversa,0,1648281749.0,0,t1_i264ve1,i264ve1,False,Candy_and_Violence,t3_to957o,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/to957o/gov_ron_desantis_rfl_announces_bill_allowing/,Gov.

That's nice for statistics for a population and all, but as a single individual I have specific allergies and they're better down here. They're not basically the same. I've gone from 6-8 weeks of annual misery to about a week and half tops of mild symptoms. It's not really up for debate.

Na, there aren‚Äôt alligators, don‚Äôt be ridiculous.  That‚Äôs only in the swamp.

"> I‚Äôm now convinced that Florida is operating a legal child trafficking scheme.

I understand your frustration, but the adoption process isn't a child trafficking scheme.  I would recommend that you *consider* fostering.  It gives you an inside understanding of the process and will possibly  increase your probability to adopt.  I say this, because several kids I've seen adopted, who were removed from their parents, were adopted by their foster parents.  

I'm not saying fostering is the normal path to adoption, it isn't supposed to be; but when parental rights are terminated, there's usually a ""game plan"" for the child already.  If there is a foster parent willing to adopt, or a relative willing to be a permanent guardian, the children will likely go to them.  It is a significant factor in deciding what is in the best interest of the child.  Kids usually aren't just removed from their parents and put up for adoption without a plan.  This is a common misconception.  

BTW, I said fostering isn't a normal path to adoption, and that's with good reason.  Fostering is supposed to be a support mechanism to allow the children to be cared for, while the parents get their act together; it's not a ""try-and-buy"" mechanism.  If the parents get their act together, they get their kid back; that's in the best interest of the child, even if you love the kid and think your home is a better environment.",t2_776flhud,dark-copper,0,1648243324.0,0,t1_i247vjw,i247vjw,False,ra3ra31010,t3_tn9ckg,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tn9ckg/the_problem_is_poverty_florida_removing_more_kids/,‚ÄòThe problem is poverty‚Äô: Florida removing more kids from poor families over alleged ‚Äòneglect‚Äô,/r/florida/comments/tn9ckg/the_problem_is_poverty_florida_removing_more_kids/i247vjw/,2,r/florida,0,2

"The NASDAQ temporarily halted trading on Monday, Feb 28th, which was only two trading days after the initial invasion.  As an institutional investor, like the FL Retirement System, you can‚Äôt just sell stocks like you can by making a few taps on your Robinhood app. First, there has to be a buyer in the market for ‚Äúhundreds of millions Russian assets.‚Äù Take a look at this article from Bloomberg for more context. Secondly, with the Russian Stock Exchange finally opening after being closed since the beginning of the war, the NAV on many ADRs are way off, even if the US markets were to lift the restrictions. 

Crist making a statement via Twitter, along with other Dems, after the market has halted trading since Feb 28th is meaningless and for semantics

"Yes it's common to get mold in Florida. Especially if you leave your windows open or they are old/not properly sealed. We have a lot of humidity in the air.

Typically having a working AC running should be enough to prevent mold in most places but some housing may not be properly ventilated and of course you want to make sure you have an extractor going when showering and possibly after if you know your house is prone to mold.

Also many leases in my experience will have clauses stating that you must notify the landlord in case of mold.

"they endanger children more than help. 

Florida DCF is setting new records taking children from impoverished homes in its history. Taking children from families simply for the family being unable to afford food 

So rather than helping families keep their kids, they take them and put them somewhere more unsafe - but with money 

Also, Florida DCF has the most calls to check in and not removing children from homes that they should be removed from, then the kids end up dead

Florida DCF is horrible. So instead of acknowledging this, or helping impoverished families, you‚Äôre normalizing it and advocating for more families to help with forced rehoming. Nice. 

you‚Äôre happy with the system and Florida DCF? Good for you. I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs broken and failing those living in Florida while enabling oppression and even neglect, abuse, or death. The answer is not accommodating for additional forced rehoming, and there‚Äôs no accountability for their fuck ups

"The video is pretty striking for its length, stability and resolution. Many accident videos are blurry, shaky and end very quickly.  This one is in 720p and shows not only what happened, but also how everyone was situated before the ride even started and it lingers on the aftermath, the screaming, people asking to be let out of the ride immediately, the nervous looks, employees arguing over whether he was checked. People don't know what to do or how to react and I don't blame them. Nobody really tries to save the kid because it's clear to everyone he is gone. We know instinctually that is not survivable not only because he fell, but that he was propelled by the forces involved. 

For those who have viewed similar accident videos, the lack of quality in the typical video almost kind of obscures the reality. That is not the case with this video, as you can see the pool of blood emerging from beneath him. I do not recommend seeking it out unless you've got a tough constitution.

From a legal perspective, though, the company will surely have to reckon with this video.

"We already f‚Äôd up by building 90% of our land as single family car dependent suburbs. Therefore everyone has to drive. What need to do is redevelop areas with higher density and more mixed use buildings. It doesn‚Äôt have to be high rises. It can be as little as allowing backyard apartments and corner stores or small offices on residential street. People need more options to live closer to work or at least in a place where they don‚Äôt have to get into a car. I should also mention that nothing will solve traffic completely. Traffic is a symptom of high amounts of economic activity. What it would do is give people options. You don‚Äôt want to sit in traffic? That‚Äôs fine! You should have the option for a comfortable walk, bike ride, public transit ride, etc. But those options aren‚Äôt available in most places right now, so naturally most people drive and deal with the traffic. 

If you spend a week in any of the downtown areas east of I-95 you can literally watch this happen in real time. Those areas are denser and have a much more diverse mix of uses. As a result people in those areas are able to live closer to where they work to the point that they can ride a bike, electric scooter, moped, bus, or train to get to and from. Those are all people who aren‚Äôt clogging the roads with a car. 

And it spans across socioeconomic scales as well. In my area a common scene on any given weekday is an office worker in business casual and a briefcase riding their bike a few miles to their office, an immigrant restaurant employee in their smocks riding their electric scooter to work, and a construction worker getting off of trirail and getting picked up in his bosses pickup truck. If you only live, work, and hang out only in the suburbs, you would never see this or understand how it works. You only see traffic, gridlock, and people that poor sap walking on a tiny sidewalk in the blazing sun. So, we already have great case studies in our backyard of what to do. The question is will we do anything about it?",t2_c36o2ad0,lofibeatsforstudying,0,1648220963.0,0,t1_i22np52,i22np52,True,Viparita-Karani,t3_tncyr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tncyr2/south_florida_transportation_and_gridlock/,South Florida transportation and gridlock?,/r/florida/comments/tncyr2/south_florida_transportation_and_gridlock/i22np52/,2,r/florida,0,2

As far as taxes go, 2020 was last year. 2021 taxes are not due yet so you cannot refer to them in any meaningful way.

"Your article points out that Florida has a high number of deaths among the children in families that have already been put in the system.
Some of these deaths are in foster care.
Most are when DCF has decided to leave the children in the home but check in from time to time.
In other words, the problem from the article is that foster care is not being used enough, not that it's being used too much.
The article compares Florida to Virginia and Mississippi where juvenile hall and group homes are used.  Florida doesn't use either nearly as much.
There have been multiple reforms and overhauls of DCF since the article was written in 2014.  This is a problem that all sides sincerely want to fix.

To preface this, I‚Äôm not in the Miami area but I also noticed your post hasn‚Äôt gotten any comments in the last two days. I also did not learn how to drive until I was 18 so as a fellow adult learner I can relate to your plight. If you can, my suggestion is to find some quieter neighborhoods towards the western side of Miami (my understanding is that the area is more traffic quiet). Do you have friends/family that you can sit shotgun or drive you out there (I believe that‚Äôs a requirement with a permit anyways)? When I learned how to drive, I started in the suburbs. On the occasion when a car came down the road, I just pulled over and put my hazards on so they could pass me. If you really need a parking lot, I would definitely check the back of local mall parking lots either in the morning 7-9am or in the evening between 8-10pm.

"Planned Developments AKA Planned Unit Developments

These subdivisions used to be large, multi-acre parcels owned by a farmer or rancher who eventually got bought out by a big corporate developer like KB Home, Taylor Morrison, or Pulte.

These greedy developers hired a former government planner like me to assess the maximum density they could get away with through a PD/PUD (Planned Development/Planned Unit Development) rezoning application instead of the conventual zoning (usually agricultural or very low density residential, ie 0.5 unit/acre or less).

By the time of the 2008 housing crisis, almost all new development in Florida was done through PD/PUD special zoning because of how inflexible the existing zoning codes are.  Local zoning boards and county commissions are all too eager to approve them since changing the zoning code is too controversial, but they still need to appease the developers that can legally bribe them through campaign donations.",t2_frb8o,Rek-n,0,1648190027.0,0,t1_i21a4ch,i21a4ch,True,FrustratedIncorp,t3_tmel0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tmel0j/why_does_florida_have_so_many_gated_communities/,Why Does Florida Have So Many Gated Communities and Subdivisions?,/r/florida/comments/tmel0j/why_does_florida_have_so_many_gated_communities/i21a4ch/,1,r/florida,0,1

"You're asserting that I am claiming that the public should have the right to know your address, as a former police officer. They shouldn't, of course not. No reasonable person thinks they should.

However, defendants should have the right to know the identity of the person who arrested them -- in fact, the state and federal Constitution grants defendants that right in the form of the confrontation clause of the 6th Amendment (and in the confrontation clause in our state Constitution, found in Article 1, Section 16(a)), which also allows them (or their attorneys) to cross examine witnesses. Effectively doing that requires that they know the officer's name in order to collect evidence favorable to them (for example, if an officer has a history of wrongful arrests or lying on the stand, that is relevant information at trial for impeaching them on the basis of their credibility).

Being that police officers have an abiding interest in keeping their addresses out of public view due to the work they perform, and those accused of a crime have a Constitutional right to confront witnesses and effectively cross-examine them at trial, the only satisfactory solution is to make it easier for police officers to keep their addresses out of the public record, not to deny public access to the names of police officers.",t2_1hpvnq5u,I-Am-Uncreative,0,1648171663.0,0,t1_i20cy21,i20cy21,False,RingloVale,t3_tk66x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tk66x9/marsys_law_in_florida_are_police_victims_volusia/,"Marsy‚Äôs Law in Florida: Are police victims?

"most answers here are garbage; sure, maybe it has something to do with ‚Äúinternalized racism/classism/etc‚Äù, but it‚Äôs just a way that large housing manufacturers can make people want to buy, since being a separate area with some form of controlled access, a community forms naturally. My gated community has PLENTY of Hispanics and blacks, me being one of them! It‚Äôs just appealing to the people with the funds to get a cheap Morgage. You just gotta go live at one that doesn‚Äôt exist near a city, because those are the expensive ones. Rural and country subdivision homes aren‚Äôt as expensive as you‚Äôd think.

Anyway I‚Äôm talking out of my ass, because I‚Äôm just 17 and this is my parents home. weeee

Edit: I‚Äôve felt confident about what I‚Äôve said because I like talking about real estate to my parents, since I don‚Äôt want them to worry about it all themselves. I also asked, and our house was 230k, now our neighbors‚Äô houses are 380k. The key to get a cheap house in a gated community/ subdivision is to get there early, as far as I‚Äôm aware. HOA‚Äôs aren‚Äôt a big deal either, just don‚Äôt forget to mow, we‚Äôve not had complaints so far.
