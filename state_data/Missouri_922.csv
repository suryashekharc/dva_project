Like I said, the us pays 30% more per student for education than Canada yet paid teachers 20% less.  That’s massive!  You cannot possibly support the us teachers union given that stat with a straight face!   Canada is doing it right, the us system is a corrupt beaurocratic wasteful mess.

That is very different than your original source article. Which is basically a policing organization.

"Teachers unions are the #3 and #1 biggest most powerful unions in the US.  Canada pays teachers 20% more and spend 30% less per student.  Tell me again how teachers unions are helping anyone other than teachers union leaders?  They sure aren’t helping the teachers.  UAW fucked Detroit, the steelworkers union killed us steel production, it’s a hit list of fucked industries.  Everything unions touch turns to shit, but hey, who cares of the dumb union stooges lose their jobs as long as the unions can move on to another company once they bleed the first one dry, right?  As long as the dues are flowing, fuck the idiot members.  I mean the UAW destroyed Detroit and now hope Tesla employees are so fucking dumb they will follow suit?  Seriously?
 
If you make a product (your labor) and don’t like the price on the market, then the answer is to improvise the product or sell for a lower price.  Unions artificially inflating labor costs have killed every industry they gained a foothold in.  I may be the best buggy whip maker on the planet, but if cars killed the demand for buggy whips then it’s time for me to develop a new skill.  That’s how the free market tells you it’s time to move on.  Using unions to force people to pay more than a service is worth is just not sustainable.
 
Cops cannot readily switch jobs because most places require they live in the community they serve.  That makes sense for a union, it’s a monopoly and due to the restriction of employment a union is needed.  Google fiber installers can work for any of dozens of companies, so this is just a union pushing for more income.  Period.

"Yes I’ll sell my labor at the agreed price!  Wait as second, no I won’t, but since nobody else will pay the rate I feel I am entitled to I will band together with others and will prevent Google from paying rates other people are willing to sell for until they agree to my new rate!   Excellent!
 
Unions had a purpose when we didn’t have cars, internet, labor laws and <5% unemployment.  Now unions destroyed Detroit, have U.S. teachers paid less than anywhere else in the world despite the US paying more per student for education than all but a few counties, a steel industry that’s almost dead and they are grasping at the big names in tech just to keep that sweet sweet dues drip flowing.  Trade unions are cool, so are unions where the market is a monopoly (government unions) the rest just exist to extort and screw the workers in the long run.  Despite their racist beginnings (formed to keep out minorities from stealing white people’s jobs by accepting lower wages) I fully agree labor unions were needed when Upton Sinclair wrote “The Jungle”, but those days are long gone.  I’m sure the UAW workers in Detroit are thrilled for the higher salaries they got right up until they went on unemployment.  If what you do is in high demand and low supply it will have a high salary.  If it doesn’t, it won’t.  being paid less than you want is how the market tells you that you need to offer a different/better product.  If companies are banding together to fix an artificial price (something that labor unions are solely allowed to do…) then labor laws will punish them, that didn’t exist in the uptown Sinclair days but exists now which means unions aren’t as needed.
 
Imagine if a car company lobbied for laws setting a minimum price for a 4-door car:  it would screw a new automaker looking to enter the market by selling a cheaper product and screw the consumer by forcing higher prices.  That’s what this is.  Either price fixing is bad, or it isnt.  It’s illegal for any other product , except labor who spends $millions on lobbying to ensure they are the only group exempt from the RICO laws that stop everyone else from doing it.  But hey, if it gets me a bigger paycheck what do I care, amiright?  I can act like I’m a fucking freedom fighter AND demand more than the market says I’m worth, it’s like a win-win!  I can post in Reddit about how morally superior I am wile also demanding more money than I’m worth and nobody would dare to call a spade a spade and say it’s just greed.

"TL:DR I don't think the power of AM radio is as effective at shaping small town political beliefs as much as the engrained institutions that have changed their positions to more radical ones and policies that ignore rural needs

&#x200B;

Forcing a point of view down someone's throat that they don't already have a good incentive to buy into is not very effective. 

In some ways, the main-stream media is responsible for the extreme shift in conservative attitudes. CNN were the first to broadcast news around the clock, but they found that sensationalism sells. And easy form of reporting is to sell fear, and MSN, CNN, ABC, CBS are great at that. It's hard not to watch a day of it and not feel like your world is always under attack. If it's not the weather, it's some nut in North Korea with nukes. If it's not that, it's some smart ponzi schemer who knows ten ways to rob you in two minutes. 

Mainstream news is quick to point out how technology will save us. Green energy, smart devices, etc. Small towns Missouri rely primarily on agriculture. When they think about tech companies, they can't help consider how Monsanto and John Deere ('no right to repair') have figured out ways to take a greater share of what they work for. Why believe in science when technology only screws over your family?

The inefficient government they see is the same we all see, but Fox tells them that's the fault of programs that don't directly benefit them (e.g. funding for Arts and Sciences, NASA, etc.) and they eat it up. If NASA spends tens of millions on a satellite, or if Congress allots money to repair the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, they have to ask what good it does them and who has their interest in mind.  


Small towns were always held together by churches. Sometime along the 1990's/early 2000's, small-town churches moved away from friendly sermons to looking for enemies. In a small town, that apparently sells. It seems easier to collectively hate than collectively forgive and find middle ground. Maybe this is the fault of mega-churches, or corrupt religious institutions like Liberty University, Falwell, etc.

If Fox News does anything, it reinforces their beliefs. Yes, they rely stoking paranoia and fear through a stream of lies that they wholeheartedly admit are lies, but again- it only reinforces the limited choices their corrupt institutions and the people who exploit them offer.",t2_25rusot1,Normal_Total,0,1648261094.0,0,t1_i25a3vo,i25a3vo,True,Putrid-Presentation5,t3_tno6dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tno6dn/internet_and_radio_in_rural_missouri_areas/,Internet and radio in rural Missouri areas.,/r/missouri/comments/tno6dn/internet_and_radio_in_rural_missouri_areas/i25a3vo/,1,r/missouri,0,1

"This is a long one so I'm going to summarize.

Any argument that takes the form of 'the fetus is a burden to the mom', I'm throwing out because as I've mentioned, children are afforded legal protections despite the obvious burdens that they impose on their parents.

Any argument that takes the form of 'this burden is different, because the burden is imposed directly on the mother's internal organs', I'm also throwing out because the mother consented to this as a possibility when choosing to have sex.

The silly tapeworm argument doesn't deserve any legitimacy, because human fetuses are obviously not tapeworms.

The rate of women dying of childbirth is incredibly low. I've already cited the number. It's 24 out of 100,000. So if killing someone in self defense applies when talking about things with extremely low risk, then you could murder your neighbor because there's a chance he might spread covid to you. Not to mention again that the mother consented to the possibility of pregnancy when choosing to have sex. Her choices created this scenario, not the fetus', so arguably the fetus has a better self defense case against the mother than the mother does against the fetus. So there's just no coherent way to apply a self-defense argument to this discussion, and any further self-defense based arguments are thrown out.

So after throwing all that out, do you have any arguments left? It doesn't appear so. My takeaway from this conversation is exactly as I described above, a fetus ten minutes from being born is morally identical to a baby ten minutes after being born, therefore abortion should be considered murder. It's that simple.

>You've managed to contradict all of your articulated principles in this comment.

Not at all, if I ultimately had my way I'd abolish the state pretty much entirely. Since we *don't* live in a world where the state is pretty much entirely abolished, I choose to be pragmatic. If legalizing murder came up for a vote, would I vote for it? Obviously not. Does that mean I support big government? No, it just means that I'm willing to work within the existing system, in the hopes that someday we can create a libertarian society.

So given that government, despite it's flaws, is the current system for enforcing laws, I believe that a ban on abortion should be one of those laws. There's no contradiction here, it's simply a recognition that there's a difference between my perfect world I'd like to live in vs. the existing world.",t2_1aogogfi,Anon-Ymous929,0,1648245345.0,0,t1_i24cjmc,i24cjmc,False,CelestineCrystal,t3_tllrf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tllrf0/tell_your_legislator_no_abortion_bans_in_missouri/,Tell Your Legislator: No Abortion Bans in Missouri,/r/missouri/comments/tllrf0/tell_your_legislator_no_abortion_bans_in_missouri/i24cjmc/,1,r/missouri,0,1

"Yeah, 93.3 and some smaller sister stations are owned by Rick and Tracy Ellis, a local couple (STL/St. Charles Co.) who made their fortune in 'luxury real estate'. They used to have an infomercial-type show that ran on their 'now' competitor 97.1 FM for years and also distributed a glossy magazine promoting their realtor business at those freebie publications racks found at the entrances/exits of the major local supermarkets.

 Their content was all quite apolitical and neutral until after the 2020 election when Tracy in particular started injecting political commentary into a show that was ostensibly to promote buying and selling houses. The bosses at 97.1 didn't approve of her getting on a political soapbox. She in turn felt that her freedom of speech was being stifled, 'cancelled' or whatever so she and hubby quit and bought a group of stations to broadcast 'real deal, non-RINO conservatism'.

"Internet in rural Missouri is still pretty bad. Like in Moniteau County a few years ago schools tried to introduce tablets so students could get more used to technology and do homework that way to be more convenient. But it ended up with everyone being at the library nonstop because it was basically the only way to get wifi in order to do homework for a lot of those students. 

A lot of “traditional” mediums do tend to be more conservative. Like I was in Barnes And Noble a few months ago and most of their “new” or “featured” sections were all books that were just conservative schlock.

Dems everywhere (not just Missouri) need to realize how under utilized mediums like radio are for broadcasting a message to an audience. I saw a listening report last year or so saying two-thirds of Gen Z still listen to the radio in the car.

"Pre-Edit: I ended up ranting when responding to your comment. My bad 😅

I grew up in rural Missouri, moved to KC, then to STL, and then moved back to rural Missouri. It is not an easy task to be openly left-leaning while everyone around you is strictly conservative. Older people who were always conservative and their younger kids who don’t know any different aren’t going to be swayed. You’re the ‘outcast’ if you’re not gun-ho Republican. 

I think younger adults in rural areas are a lot less strictly conservative than the quickly aging older demographic, but because of being outnumbered they aren’t very open about it. If you are, you’re quickly shut down and ignored. 

It’s still a sea of ignorant red, but there’s more and more blue (& educated red) all the time. 

The Dems are a long way off from competing with Fox News on cable and they probably know trying to go about it that way is a lost cause to try and persuade the older generations. Older generations are the main radio demo too so same does for radio shows. 

The best way for them to go about it is to focus on the younger generation with YouTube newscasts and with podcasts like NPR. 

Cable and radio has been so big because of the long standing shiftiness of rural internet. Companies like Fidelity have been in rural communities for ages and that’s all people know about so they’re paying $40 for 6mbps, $100 for 30mbps if they’re willing to pay.

"A couple of reasons:

Unlike conservatives, Democrats and liberals for the most part don't seek out media to validate beliefs and opinions they already hold.  Part of why the conservative talk radio echo chamber works so well is because those talking heads say things they know their audience wants to hear.

Another reason is that it's not a very effective way to reach a more liberal target audience.  Even in rural areas, Democrat-friendly voters aren't listening to terrestrial talk radio of any kind.  Rather, they're on Audible or streaming podcasts on platforms like Spotify if they aren't listening to music.

">I didn't bring it up. You said that people with genetic anomalies have deformed bodies, which is why they are diagnosed with genetic anomalies. I simply corrected that objectively wrong statement. Obviously some genetic anomalies create physical effects, but some don't. Since you're trying to defend your definition that women are people who have XX chromosomes, it's very important that not all people who have some other combination of chromosomes have atypical bodies. Many people with abnormal chromosomes never discover it, or live large parts of their lives not knowing they have a genetic anomaly.

I didn't say they were only diagnosed because of deformed bodies you can physically see. I said it can be internal too (obviously). Plus it's not even the topic lol.

Not at all. You're just not getting it. People with these DSD should be able to identity with a sex since their chromosomes don't match up with their reproductive system. A hermaphradite for example has both systems and their chromosomes don't match up. I'm not talking about crossdresser's being able to identity. This is why I said earlier it's not good to compare to average person.

The first comes down to who's funding. Democrats love or hate them get lots more funding from small individual donors. Republicans are awash in dark money. Often donated by fascist oligarchs. Who own a lot of media properties. Who often target their businesses highly partisanly. I highly doubt you could get them to ever carry a centrist show let alone anything remotely to the left. Individual small donors generally give their funds in support of policy or candidates. Not purchasing or building radio stations in the back woods to deprogram rural rubes. That might be a mistake. But it was what the money was donated for. And diverting it to some scheme like that would not please many of the donors. If you have a radio station and would like to donate time for left wing programs to be heard. I think all this would be for it. And if you're interested in starting a fund to either buy airtime or build radio stations to provide other outlets and other views. I think a lot of people would be open to that too. But Democrats can't count on fascists to push their viewpoints out of self-interest. Republican views and policy align much better with the fascist than Democrats.

"You're right, conservatives really do need to hear more moderate voices, and especially in rural areas, they listen to a LOT of talk radio.

The short answer is over the past 40 years the right have been systematically walled off from the rest of the plurality by their media, making it a very hard market to break into.

People on the right side of the spectrum tend to be authoritarian personalities- they listen to their perceived authorities and little else. So the content and the format would have to be both non-threatening and familiar- and for a subgroup who have been taught to think and say ""mainstream media = fake news,"" that is a tall order.

Sponsorship could help make it possible, but that's tough too. Most radio sponsors nowadays are likely to support right-leaning content because of one issue: taxes.

A lot of business owners are single-issue voters who dwell on tax cuts.  They affiliate with politics that advocate limited-to-no non-military spending. It's arguable whether small businesses actually benefit much from tax-cutting plans that focus on big businesses, but thanks to authoritarian personalities, it can be and has largely become an ideological alignment. 

In more urban areas there in fact is left-leaning talk content on the radio dial- it comes from community radio stations. But they feature socially progressive topics which would probably not be of much interest to conservative rural populations, in fact much of it would probably turn them off.

Incorrect. Swyer syndrome people are born with the failure of the sex glands developing. That's deformed. Other disorders, born with none at all and some disorders both reproductive systems. Turner syndrome (what you brought up too) can have a variety of medical deformities such as skeletal malformations (why they are all short), heart anomalies, and kidney abnormalities...etc. You don't have to physically see it for it to be a deformity, it can be internal.

These rare disorders people suffer from in their sexual reproduction system, only those people (not turner disorder) should be able to identity with what they want. I don't really care if this is controversial, it's not in the real world only on reddit and twitter. Most people don't have your sentiment in the real world.

While this is contextually varying the underlying fact is still age/maturity which does exist and the line is ambiguous but clustered (similar to your proxy of judges providing a correct sentence). Don't worry I see the irony lol. If a group reaches adulthood between 17-21yrs the fact that there is variability doesn't mean that the whole concept of adulthood destroys the reality of womanhood.

It explicitly identifies the female sex, not subjective identity. It explicitly identifies an adult. Adult while ranging in application is a description of a reality that exists. There is a small range of likely years to make the cutoff but there isn't a dispute on whether the range of adulthood exists.

She is totally correct in her position that it isn't her job. Her personal bias could interfere however if done correctly it shouldn't. That's up to a person's judgement on whether another's bias can be constrained.

You are right I just don't like the answer because I see it as weak willed for someone to skip over a statement of reality.

I believe a woman is a real category of humanity not subject to personal identification. I see this as the truth. Culturally this is in dispute.

">Everything in the above paragraph is based around the language or social conventions of fetuses vs. children, but what you haven’t given me is an actual logical/moral difference between fetuses and children.

I most certainly have. One my of my earliest arguments was about the violation of bodily autonomy, which constitutes a threat to life and health, posed by fetuses. While it is possible for a child to pose a life threat to their parent, it is far and away less probable than a fetus. Furthermore, fetuses are functionally indistinct from a parasite. We don't offer protections to tapeworms because despite their non-consensual invasion of women's bodily autonomy. The only reason to differentiate here is preferential anthropocentrism, which is another arbitrary moral supposition. Fetuses are parasites of the human species. They demand nourishment from other human bodies to survive which is the second moral distinction. A fetus is fully dependent on the organs of another. A child is not. If any person asserted control over your internal organs against your will, you would be fully within your rights to end their lives in self-defense. What *you* haven't given me is a justification why fetuses are morally superior to all people to justify extra rights for themselves and reduced rights for women.

>This thing doesn’t have the right to use my body for one second longer, kill it and take it out of me.”

That is the nature of a right. You don't lose the right to your life and body because someone else needs your life and body. 

>And on the other hand we have a baby, ten minutes after being born, now has legal protections that prevent the mother from ripping its limbs apart and throwing it in the garbage can despite the many burdens that the baby imposes upon the mother. She’s legally required to feed and care for the child.

Exactly. The child does not pose a threat to her life and health and is not asserting non-consensual and potentially lethal impositions on her bodily autonomy. 

>What happened in those 20 minutes which shift the moral value of the human being so dramatically?

Birth, which is the end of the conditional imposition on women's bodily autonomy. There is no longer a self-defense basis to terminate a fetus.

> Birth is a big deal obviously but it’s not like the baby experiences 9 months of development in the 45 seconds of passing through the birth canal. The baby is well developed and ready to be born long earlier.

Irrelevant. I don't care if your child is 30 years post birth, no one has the right to violate your bodily autonomy and pose a threat to your life and health without your consent. The rights of any person end where the rights of another begin. The rights of non-people like fetuses don't exist at all. 

>That’s what I need, is a logical explanation for why one of these two creatures is a lump of cells that can be terminated at will, and the other one is a human person, and the change legally and morally happens almost instantly?

See above. In addition, 1/4 pregnancies miscarry. Women's bodies terminate these pregnancies autonomously all the time. There is no difference between the fetuses terminated in this manner or by abortion. Children don't spontaneously implode as a result of their mother's bodily functions. Fetuses do.

>I’m a supporter of self defense obviously, but abortion just doesn’t apply.

The basis for self-defense is a belief in a threat to your life or health. It most definitely applies.

>If you have a fourteen year old son and he points a gun at you, now you are in a self defense situation. Birth on the other hand has a 99,976 out of 100,000 chance of the mother surviving

Pregnancy and child birth constitute the greatest disease burden affecting women globally. More women die from pregnancy and childbirth than being shot by their children by orders of magnitude. As long as any chance of disability or death exists, which it does in all pregnancies, self-defense is justified. What's more, even the non-life threatening imposition on bodily autonomy is cause for termination. This is why self-defense is justifiable for rape that isn't necessarily life threatening. 

>That would be like me murdering my neighbor because there’s a small chance he might get COVID and spread it to me.

No, that would be like you killing someone pointing an gun at you without you knowing if it was loaded. It could be completely harmless. You are still justified in protecting your body.

>So again we aren’t talking about superior rights

There is no question we are. Any person who did anything similar to what a fetus does would be subject to immediate termination. If I forcibly subdued you against your will and commandeered your kidney for my own health, you would be justified in killing me. Fetuses require extra rights to justify this position. 

>You have a legal obligation to feed the children you’ve created, and (in places where abortion is illegal) you have a legal obligation to loan your womb to fetuses you’ve created.

Feeding children doesn't require the loaning of bodily organs without consent. If women can be forced by the government to submit their bodies to popular will, then men can as well. Men can be forcibly sterilized to prevent unwanted pregnancy. The government can forcibly vaccinate you to prevent you from spreading deadly diseases rather than merely incentivizing you. Government power over individual bodily agency is not justifiable in any situation. Government does not get bigger than biopower. it is the ultimate power to give to the state.

>Okay so you don’t like big government when it “tells women what to do with their bodies” but you do like big government and you believe they will be very successful at outlawing guns, redistributing wealth, regulating the economy without being corrupted by big business, and so on and so on.

The state has many functions. Controlling our internal organs, bodily functions, reproductive cycles, personal medical decisions, and whether or not we are allowed to live should not be one of those functions. We have places like Missouri where the state wants to make it illegal for women to abort life threatening, non-viable pregnancies. They literally want to mandate women die for a fetus that will never come to term. 

It's very clear the government isn't proficient at outlawing guns, particularly because they can't due to the Second Amendment. Taxation is an essential function of the state. There doesn't exist any functional state without taxation. Indeed, taxation would be necessary to enforce an abortion ban, provide for the millions of additional unwanted children, expand the child services sector that would collapse as a result, prosecute women and doctors for receiving or performing abortions, imprisoning the women and doctors who are convicted, provide for the orphan children of the convicted doctors and women, provide for the orphans of mothers who died preventable deaths from pregnancy and birth, and then deal with the millions of transient adults who were raised in a collapsed foster care system. As far as regulating the economy without regulatory capture, this could be done if Americans dropped their obsession with governing women's bodies. This single issue keeps people voting against campaign finance overhauls situated in political coalitions that support abortion rights. Unlimited corporate money or even all private campaign contributions must be eliminated from politics in order to ensure politicians are competing for votes, not money. These changes are universally opposed by the government mandated birth coalitions.

The one thing you've failed to do is provide any sort of pragmatic reasoning for banning abortion and that is because there isn't any. It benefits no one except those who will merely feel better. Every nation that bans abortion suffers and doesn't prevent abortion. Abortion bans service one purpose - to punish women because we know they don't stop abortions.

>I’m actually a libertarian, I offered you my support for legalized abortion, and you didn’t take it.

If you believe government should be making personal medical decision for women, you aren't a libertarian. Either you beleive government should have authority over our bodies or not. If your principles are contingent on irrelevant issues going your way, you don't have any principles. This isn't surprising given the fantasy world in which libertarians live. There is a reason no libertarian state has ever succeeded.

>So just be aware that I’m not going to take ‘but government is ineffective’ arguments from you seriously anymore.

Wow a libertarian arguing government is effective and that government should have ultimate control over our bodies and lives. Is there any reason this doesn't discredit you entirely and I should stop taking you seriously?

"Our country was founded on the principles of informed debate by people who actually seek to listen and understand each other, and then reaching agreement through compromise.  It was felt that this was the best way to get to the heart of matters and to come up with the best solutions.  Kind of a brainstorming model with a diverse group of people who had the best interest of the country and the public in mind.  A belief that a diverse group could argue and learn from each other, develop better ideas, and craft better policy than any one special interest by themselves.

Now, the GOP wishes to turn America into an authoritarian, winner takes all, nation which sure looks a lot like that old Despotism video the Encyclopedia Britannica produced back in the late 1940's that warned of allowing a nation to drift off course in the same manner as Germany under Hitler.

""There's the problem with history, it keeps repeating itself."" -- Clarence Darrow.

Folks would do well to learn about Darrow.  He was a heck of an intellect and a man unafraid to stand up for freedom from religion and the rights of the individual ahead of the mob-think that tends to be fueled by partisan politics and white Christian nationalists 100 years ago.

"Remember when Missourians passed ""Clean Missouri"" in an attempt to do something about partisan gerrymandering?  And remember when Missouri's Republican politicians freaked out because they can't win on their ideas and policies, they need gerrymandering, voter suppression, and the politics of emotion to maintain their hold?

Yes, I know these are federal congressional seats, but the legislature has done the same exact thing to the entire states Senate and House districts in order to gain that super-majority that protects all Republican officeholders from accountability.

I point this out a lot, but in Missouri, the citizens can not petition for recall of an elected official.  Our states politicians decided a while back that the only body that can hold a state office holder accountable is the legislature.  Meaning if you want to protect your partisan state office holders, you need to control the state legislature.

On a federal level, we have easily seen the effects of a legislative body that refuses to hold a member of their own party accountable for criminal activity in office.

Seems to me these days we are moving more and more toward one party rule and less and less toward accountability for the office holders of that party.

Personally I think there are two ways to create districts. 1.  Work on making them as competitive as possible.  This would force candidates to be more centrist and willing to compromise and work from the center. 2. If not that then as random as possible. Divide your state population by the number of districts. Start at on side and start blocking out ten thousand residents together until you get to the other side and then knit those together from one side to the other until done.  Or just let a computer do it with the resident data. No more crazy districts,t2_2pema16j,SyntheticED,0,1648211957.0,0,t1_i223dlf,i223dlf,False,flug32,t3_tnek2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tnek2d/breaking_missouri_senate_approves_new/,BREAKING: Missouri Senate Approves New Congressional Districts - meet all our new gerry-monsters,/r/missouri/comments/tnek2d/breaking_missouri_senate_approves_new/i223dlf/,1,r/missouri,0,1

"> ST. LOUIS — The number of people who live in the city of St. Louis fell below 300,000 in 2021 and the metropolitan area also saw a decline in population as the region for the first time recorded more deaths than births. That puts it among just a handful of large urban areas hit by outmigration and a negative birth rate.

> The numbers, though estimates, reinforce concerns about stagnant growth in a region that appears poised to be overtaken in the coming years by fast-growing metro areas such as Orlando, Florida, and Charlotte, North Carolina.

> As of July 1, the Census Bureau estimated that just 293,310 people resided in the region’s core city of St. Louis, down from the 301,578 people counted in the 2020 census.

"This is missing the point. His claim is inherently comparative: what he’s saying is that “you’re softer on child porn crime than another type of judge that we would want to confirm for this position.” He is using that as the premise for his conclusion: “she is SOFTER on crime.” That’s the whole thing he is trying to demonstrate In this process. They are questioning a Supreme Court candidate. That is the context, so it should be evaluated in that way. 


“Prosecutors sometimes recommend sentences below the guidelines, too. Hawley failed to prove that Jackson is any more lenient than federal judges on average.”



This is the full summary of their fact-check ruling:

“Hawley said Jackson ""gave child porn offenders sentences below the guidelines and below what the prosecutors were requesting"" showing she is ""soft on child pornography offenders.""

Hawley’s claim has an element of truth: Jackson’s sentences were below the guidelines and below the prosecutors’ recommendations.

But Jackson’s approach to sentencing in child pornography cases did not significantly differ from that of other judges, data show. A comprehensive federal study found that for these crimes, sentences are shorter than what the guidelines suggest more than two-thirds of the time.

"**[Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#/media/File:The_Gerry-Mander_Edit.png)** 
 
 >In representative democracies, Gerrymandering (, originally ) refers to political manipulation of electoral district boundaries with the intent of creating undue advantage for a party, group, or socio-economic class within the constituency. Two principal tactics are used in gerrymandering: ""cracking"" (i. e. diluting the voting power of the opposing party's supporters across many districts) and ""packing"" (concentrating the opposing party's voting power in one district to reduce their voting power in other districts).

"\#1. They don't have a whole lot of pull in this process.  #2. I think they were just pretty happy to keep the 6/2 map rather than going to a 7/1 map.  #3. One reason this type of gerrymandering is popular is that both sides get something.  Usually the Reps in the safe districts are relatively happy with the situation as long as they stay safe - and that includes the D & R reps.   There is a sense in which you are happier with two safe seats than 4 for which you have a fighting chance and (maybe!) on average you win two of them.

The public, though, is clearly better served by *competitive districts* and *representative districts* \- meaning, if the state is 60/40 r/D then the  representation should average 60/40 over time, as well - not become polarized, as it inevitably does, at 70/30 or 75/25.  Which is about where we are in MO.

Every voter realizes that is *not fair representation*.

When elections are *competitive* it means that the electeds really have to listen to voters and fight for their opportunity to represent the district.  When a district is not competitive the electeds are *far* more likely to start working on behalf of their own interests rather than voters' interests.  That leads to everything from corruption and graft to highly polarized representation - far more left or right or whatever than the district as a whole.",t2_364c8,flug32,0,1648199521.0,0,t1_i21ldv3,i21ldv3,False,flug32,t3_tnek2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tnek2d/breaking_missouri_senate_approves_new/,BREAKING: Missouri Senate Approves New Congressional Districts - meet all our new gerry-monsters,/r/missouri/comments/tnek2d/breaking_missouri_senate_approves_new/i21ldv3/,42,r/missouri,2,42

"""Mostly false"" is really far too soft on this.  ""Complete and utter bullshit"" is more like it.

In fact it is even *beyond* bullshit in the sense that Hawley is consciously promoting an extremely divisive and insidious type of lie.

Hawley is deliberately pandering to the QAnon conspiracy bullshit contingent, in a transparent attempt to get them all whipped up about their nothingburger.

And no, I don't mean that child porn, child abduction, and so on are nothingburgers.  What is a nothingburger is the QAnon/right-wing conspiracy theory insistence that they are somehow the only ones special enough to care about these issues and nobody else does.   When the opposite is in fact true.  Their [nutso antics designed to prove that they are somehow the most concerned about child trafficking and such don't actually help the situation - they actually make it worse](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/qanon-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-extremism).

The whole QAnon scheme is designed to drive otherwise sane people into extremism while doing nothing at all in a practical sense to stop or even slow child trafficking.

And Hawley's whole grandstanding scenario at these hearings is designed, and *only* designed, to play directly into this mindset.  Somehow this federal judge is part of the international cabal that are all working together in coordination to let child abusers and child pornographers off the hook, and true QAnon believers like Josh Hawley are the only ones daring and brave enough to rush out of the trenches and try to save everyone.

The thing is, Hawley is (deep down inside somewhere) a smart guy, a lawyer, and he knows full well this is all a giant steaming pile of BS.

And not just BS, but BS that is designed to divide our country - to rip it apart by sowing distrust and planting insidious lies in place of the truth.

**TL;DR:** This isn't just wibbly-wobbly minor league wrongness.  Hawley is deliberately feeding extremely destructive and divisive conspiracy theories that are leading his own followers into ever more extremist ways of thinking.

"Looking at the new districts, District 2 has the most clearly monstrous gerrymandered shape - the dreaded Pacman-der. It's preparing to eat the state of Illinois for breakfast.

District 3 in a close second place - the wily Long-nosed Elephant-mander.

District 4 a close third, with the gelatinous Amoeba-mander.  Beware: It's preparing to ENVELOPE and DEVOUR our state capitol . . .

District 8 has a giant hole in its head - the ever spooky Headless Horse-mander.

It's not really the shape per-se that is the root of the evil here - it's the unfairness in representation: How a roughly 60/40 Republican/Democratic split in the state's electorate can turn into a 75/25 split in elected representation.

Still, we've got some pretty ugly gerrymonsters going this time around.   Maybe they should become our state mascot.",t2_364c8,flug32,0,1648182719.0,0,t1_i20zo65,i20zo65,False,RageAgainstTheSurge,t3_tncmb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tncmb0/jack_suntrup_on_twitter_map_approved_on/,"Jack Suntrup on Twitter ""Map approved on bipartisan 22-10 vote, heads back to House.""",/r/missouri/comments/tncmb0/jack_suntrup_on_twitter_map_approved_on/i20zo65/,9,r/missouri,0,9
"Here is my quickndirty analysis of the map that just passed, vs the 2010 map and the one the House passed earlier this session:

* [Map the MO Senate just passed](https://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills221/amendpdf/4875S05.01F.pdf) \- presumably the final 2020 map but not quite finally approved yet (fuzzy scanned PDF but you can get the gist of it if you look carefully)
* [Map the MO House passed early this year](https://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills221/maps/Map.4875H.02P.pdf) (""Perfected"" version, meaning the map as finally passed by the House and sent over to the Senate)
* [2010 Missouri Congressional District maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri%27s_congressional_districts) (the present map)

The Senate ultra-conservatives wanted to split up District 5 (KC area) to give the state and 7/1 Republican/Democratic split rather than the current 6/2 split.  I assume that is possible to do somehow - but that's not the map they passed.

That's one good thing I guess!

Their main concern seems to have been shoring up District 2 (Wagner) which is the closest we have seen to an actually competitive race in the state in recent years.

District by district:

**#1. (Bush)** Even more concentrated on St Louis City & the north and other presumably Democratic areas of St Louis County.  Looks to be about 80/20 D/R, so a great example of a ""packed"" district.  If anything, this is even more packed than before.

**#2. (Wagner)** This was clearly their biggest target as the closest to a competitive district.  It looks like they have trimmed off as much of the Democrat-leaning sections of St Louis County as they can, and even switched Jefferson County (north half) out for St Francois County.  Both highly Republican! you say. But St Francois is about 6% better than Jefferson, at 73% R (vs ""just"" 66%).   So it looks to me like they are just doing what they can to give D2 a more comfortable R margin.  Added Franklin, Washington, part of Iron Counties - all pretty rural, Republican, and part of that same obvious strategy.

**#3. (Luetkemeyer)** Grabs a bit of Taney County (outside of Branson), Crawford County (Cuba, Bourbon), and gives up the ""lower horn"" it previously had encircling the STL metro area to the south.

The biggest strategy they have to execute in central Missouri is to split up Jefferson City and Columbia.  You put those two together and it starts to look a bit like a Democratic stronghold in Central MO - or at least a somewhat competitive district.  But #3 gets Jefferson City and the east half of Boone County (not including Columbia) and that solves that problem.

**#4. (Hartzler)** The most obvious change here is they have carved up Boone County so that only Columbia is in this district, and Columbia is at the end of a long ""tentacle"" that just helps make it obvious what the gerrymander is here.

This district also gets a big chunk of eastern Jackson County (Blue Springs-ish and east) as well as Lafayette & Saline Counties which were previously part of District 5 (Cleaver).

**#5. (Cleaver)** This is the district the ultra-right-wingers would like to dissolve.  Instead it looks to me like it might be packed a bit more solidly D - maybe 60-65% percent D whereas it has been 55-60%?

This is the west half of Jackson County now, and then the ""Kansas City"" part of Clay County.  So more big city/urban (Kansas City & Independence) and inner-ring suburb than before, and no large rural counties at all.

It loses rural Ray, Lafayette, and Saline Counties, and more rural-ish parts of eastern Jackson County and rural-ish parts of Clay County.

**#6. (Graves)**  This is even more solidly the ""North of the Missouri River"" district  now.

It loses the strange claw it had down into the Blue Springs area, though it retains a fair but of rural NE Jackson County.  Picks up Ray, Randolph, Audrain, and Lincoln Counties - all very rural counties just north of the MO River.

So even more large and rural and than before - though it does include St Joseph and a good chunk of KC northland.

**#7. (Long)**  Gains Dade County, loses Polk (Bolivar), gains more of Webster County (though not all?), loses Taney County east of Branson.

**#8. (Jason Smith)** Gains the rest of Jefferson County (outskirts of STL area) and gives up St Francois, Washington, and part of Iron Counties to District 2.  Loses Crawford County, which goes to #3.

All those shifts are part of the scheme to strengthen District 2 (Wagner).  And maybe this district has lost some population?

**TL;DR:** Still ~~8/2~~ 6/2 Republican/Democrat but even more packed & cracked than before.  Both Democratic districts look to be a fair bit more packed than before. The one district that was threatening to become slightly competitive has been fixed to make it solid Republican.

"> Sure it does. Fetuses aren't children. You don't say you have children when you're pregnant with your first. You ""have one on the way."" We don't have funerals for miscarriages. We celebrate birthdays, not conception days.

Everything in the above paragraph is based around the language or social conventions of fetuses vs. children, but what you haven’t given me is an actual logical/moral difference between fetuses and children.

So we have a fetus, ten minutes away from being born, has his/her own unique DNA, has all the functioning human body parts like arms, legs, lungs, heartbeat, etc., could have survived outside the womb months ago already, and yet we’re still giving the mother a legal right to say at any moment “That’s it! This thing doesn’t have the right to use my body for one second longer, kill it and take it out of me.”

And on the other hand we have a baby, ten minutes after being born, now has legal protections that prevent the mother from ripping its limbs apart and throwing it in the garbage can despite the many burdens that the baby imposes upon the mother. She’s legally required to feed and care for the child.

What happened in those 20 minutes which shift the moral value of the human being so dramatically? A change in location? Birth is a big deal obviously but it’s not like the baby experiences 9 months of development in the 45 seconds of passing through the birth canal. The baby is well developed and ready to be born long earlier.

That’s what I need, is a logical explanation for why one of these two creatures is a lump of cells that can be terminated at will, and the other one is a human person, and the change legally and morally happens almost instantly?

> If my child poses a threat to my life, I have a right to self defense. People don't lose their right to life or liberty because they conceive. Fetuses do not have superior rights.

I’m a supporter of self defense obviously, but abortion just doesn’t apply. If you have a fourteen year old son and he points a gun at you, now you are in a self defense situation. Birth on the other hand has a 99,976 out of 100,000 chance of the mother surviving. That would be like me murdering my neighbor because there’s a small chance he might get COVID and spread it to me. So again we aren’t talking about superior rights, we’re just putting fetuses in the same legal category as children. You have a legal obligation to feed the children you’ve created, and (in places where abortion is illegal) you have a legal obligation to loan your womb to fetuses you’ve created.

> Here's a better deal. Abortion stays legal. And we don't do those other things that would make us a failed state. Except drugs. I'm good with legal drugs. Definitely not good with being Zimbabwe.

Okay so you don’t like big government when it “tells women what to do with their bodies” but you do like big government and you believe they will be very successful at outlawing guns, redistributing wealth, regulating the economy without being corrupted by big business, and so on and so on.

">If you can't murder your children just because they create a burden on you, then the same argument does not work for fetuses,

Sure it does. Fetuses aren't children. You don't say you have children when you're pregnant with your first. You ""have one on the way."" We don't have funerals for miscarriages. We celebrate birthdays, not conception days. 

>because everyone recognizes that creating fetuses and children (which happens to be the same thing)

Can you provide two definitions that are identical? Or is this your personal definition which isn't based on prior consensus or etymology?

>To say that it would justify their termination even more is completely insane.

Why do you think it's insane that we should be able to defend ourselves from people we believe pose a threat to our lives, health, bodies, or property?

>This is plain false, because again all we're doing is legally treating a fetus the same as any other of your children.

If my child poses a threat to my life, I have a right to self defense. People don't lose their right to life or liberty because they conceive. Fetuses do not have superior rights.

>Ah, the libertarian argument. Everything the government tries to do, it sucks at.

The government is extremely effective at any things. Governments have shown they are extremely ineffective at banning women from asserting bodily autonomy to the point of encouraging its assertion even more. 

If you ban abortion in America, women will get more of them in protest or simply due to the externalities of such policy paradigms.

>Tell you what, if that's the deal you're offering me, that we legalize abortion and at the same time we have the government stop doing pretty much everything else it is doing, like fighting drugs and wars and poverty and education and making us pay taxes and so on, I'll take that deal.

"“In most cases, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s sentences were below the guidelines and below the prosecutors’ recommendations.

But Jackson’s approach to sentencing in child pornography cases did not differ significantly from that of other judges, data show. A federal study found that in more than two-thirds of these cases, judges issue sentences below federal guidelines.

For cases that included both possession of child pornography and attemped or actual sexual abuse of a minor, Jackson generally agreed with prosecutors’ recommendations.

In addition to sentencing people to prison, Jackson’s decisions included long periods of supervised release, generally for 10 years after serving time, and in one case for 20 years.”

"I knew him from another life aka careers we both aren’t in anymore. I never talked politics to him during that era (nor he to me, he wasn’t feeling that call to action yet but did have ideas about community investment). What stood out to me was how despite my role being one that could have been viewed as unimportant, he went out of his way to learn my name, learn about my family and job and was always kind. When I encountered him next in a more senior role, he was just as kind but also took time to ask me about my changing goals and we had mutual friends by this point so he would greet me if we saw each other out and about. It wasn’t just a work thing. We both lost family members in the pandemic and he reached out to me to be kind, even though neither of us were in the jobs we used to be. He didn’t have to and it was really meaningful. We’ve talked politics since and I’m very aligned to his politics but more than that, I’m really shocked at how good a person he is when no one is watching.

"They're required to be Missouri residents by law, but there are apparently numerous loopholes.  They get away with claiming that places they don't actually live are their Missouri residences.

Blunt used his campaign headquarters in Springfield during one election cycle with no repurcussions. Then he ""rented"" a condo in Branson from a donor.

Hawley has claimed his Missouri residence is ""under construction"" for about four years now and uses his sisters address as his.

Both most likely violated voter registration laws with these tricks. Either that or they voted in Virginia where they reside.

">Already done. This is even in federal law. Has it been born? If yes, person. If no, not person.

It is of course possible for laws to be wrong though. Slavery was at one time decided by Federal law. Segregation was at one time decided by Federal law. 'It's already been decided by Federal law' is only ever used as an argument by the people who happen to agree with the current law, but it is a meaningless argument in terms of morality.

>I'm not uncertain. Even if I was, no person has a right to the life, health, and body of another. If a fetus is a person, it justifies their termination even more.

If you can't murder your children just because they create a burden on you, then the same argument does not work for fetuses, because everyone recognizes that creating fetuses and children (which happens to be the same thing) is entirely under your control. To say that it would justify their termination even more is completely insane.

>We'd have to give fetuses rights in excess of all born persons to justify banning abortion.

This is plain false, because again all we're doing is legally treating a fetus the same as any other of your children.

>Case studies have found bans can result in even higher abortion rates.

Ah, the libertarian argument. Everything the government tries to do, it sucks at.

Tell you what, if that's the deal you're offering me, that we legalize abortion and at the same time we have the government stop doing pretty much everything else it is doing, like fighting drugs and wars and poverty and education and making us pay taxes and so on, I'll take that deal.",t2_1aogogfi,Anon-Ymous929,0,1648164223.0,0,t1_i1zwb5h,i1zwb5h,False,CelestineCrystal,t3_tllrf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tllrf0/tell_your_legislator_no_abortion_bans_in_missouri/,Tell Your Legislator: No Abortion Bans in Missouri,/r/missouri/comments/tllrf0/tell_your_legislator_no_abortion_bans_in_missouri/i1zwb5h/,0,r/missouri,0,0

">But rather than putting the burden of proof on me, shouldn't you be the one confirming that an entity is not a person before you rip them into pieces?

Already done. This is even in federal law. Has it been born? If yes, person. If no, not person.

>It seems like the default should be to not kill when we're uncertain.

I'm not uncertain. Even if I was, no person has a right to the life, health, and body of another. If a fetus is a person, it justifies their termination even more.

>Anytime you are told that a group of people aren't actually people, that should be a red flag that something horrible is happening.

Not referring to a group of people that are actually people. I'm referring to potential people that may never be born. Personhood is a consequence of live birth. Ironically, classifying fetuses as people makes them culpable for medical threats to women's lives and justifies their termination in self defense. We'd have to give fetuses rights in excess of all born persons to justify banning abortion.

Not to mention banning abortion does virtually nothing to stop abortions. Case studies have found bans can result in even higher abortion rates. There is no pragmatic reason to ban abortion. All the outcomes are worse. More abortion, more unsafe abortion, more strain on public systems, more impoverished women and families, etc. All for what? So you can feel good. No thanks.

You know what stops abortion? Ensuring that families have the resources to plan pregnancy and raise children. Do that if you care so much. Comprehensive sex education. Publicly funded contraception.

">So now all vertebrates are people? Stange development.

Well obviously if you look at the arms you can probably tell how they look different from other vertebrate arms, or if you tested the DNA you'd find 23 pairs of chromosomes which is consistent with human DNA, and so on. But rather than putting the burden of proof on me, shouldn't you be the one confirming that an entity is not a person before you rip them into pieces? It seems like the default should be to *not* kill when we're uncertain.

>Who could I shoot in the face that has no name and has never been born?

Well I wouldn't recommend firing a gun at a pregnant woman's belly, but my point is that this is a justification used for many of histories atrocities. If you take a race of people and stick them in a concentration camp and take away their names and their individuality and so on, that doesn't make it ok to kill them does it?

"Ok, but again, “unborn rights” comes into play when there’s an actual person able to assume right of a person in there. That still goes back to the fetal viability and born alive principles we’ve talked about. If fetuses can’t survive outside the womb before ~26 weeks, what rights do they truly have? I don’t mean to be crass in saying that. But if you’re concerned with solidifying our legal definitions of babies/fetuses, I think it needs to be based on medical bases above all else if it’s going to be used to deny women rights too. 

Also sure, maybe we’ll get to that point. But there’s more to eliminating abortion as a concept than that. Who’s going to care for the children once they’re born? Hospitals? Former abortion clinics? Will the govt control all adoption centers or will they be reliant on private funding? Who acts as their legal guardian?

"Yeah I get that. However, as I'm sure you've seen and heard before, anti-abortion advocates aren't exactly always a calm, rational bunch either. In the same way they freak out over any expansion of abortion access, imagine the fear for abortion advocates feel now with the very real possibility that Roe could get overturned in next few months/years.

And sure, we could better define abortion laws, but there's a very fine line between making things more practically possible/beneficial for women seeking those abortions, and placing an undue burden on them. It's often not just that fetal viability point. It's the location of abortion clinics, the number of them, if they're well funded, if they are forced to go through unnecessary procedures to try and dissuade them from having abortions, etc. I'm not medically proficient enough to say whether or not three months still fits into the overall medical understanding of fetal viability, given that the current standard now is 22ish weeks, but if there's support from the medical community behind it, sure go for it.

"I mean if he was operating a fully regulated abortion clinic and going about procedures the right way, no Gosnell wouldn't have been convicted. The fetuses were still before that point of viability outside the womb. The murder charge/criminal element came from him going far above and beyond what any reasonable medical professional would do to inflict harm on the women receiving abortions, as evidenced by the fishing bait thing you brought up and the general way in which he ran the store. At the moment he killed them, the fetal viability didn't change. If the babies would've been born naturally at that moment, they still would've had that 5% chance of survival outside the womb. Even things like heartbeats and circulatory functions develop by about 16 weeks, still well before that viability point.

But like I said, I don't think Gosnell should be held up as representative of the dangers of providing abortion procedures. In that area, I'm more concerned about what ends women will go to if abortions are well and truly banned or even severely restricted, like to the order of the 2-day period you spoke of with what may be set as the standard for life.

"Did you competely miss them passing the ACA? They've gone about as far as they can without gaining a larger majority in congress. Another thing you missed (which is unsurprising given the rest of this conversation), they didn't pass making it optional, the courts made it optional. Meanwhile Biden had been trying to work within the existing legal framework by extending enrollment periods and ensuring benefits are as generous as possible. Want more than that? Vote in more dems.

It's clear you don't care, but you should probably know that 1) children don't exist in the womb, rather they are independent beings and 2) women's healthcare includes more than abortion access.

When canvassing how many of those republicans you met were elected officials? You may have missed that legislation is made by elected officials, not by individual voters. If elected republicans are still voting against right to work out doesn't matter whether the people voting for them support it or not.

"Hey man, anything to bring the temperature down a little bit. 

And yeah I get that it's a tough needle to thread, given the competing definitions of ""life"". A sticking point for me is the level of self-awareness that living creatures can achieve. Like yeah, cells replicating their own DNA are living in that sense, but if we try and say that any proto-human life in that replication stage, or any animal life for that matter, is automatically conferred conscious personhood with rights is tricky. Which ultimately gets into other fringe-cases of people born into vegetative states and things like that, but I think you bringing up the Kermit Gosnell case provided clarification for me. 

I took a look, as I hadn't heard of him before, and the standard by which he was convicted of murder in those cases was the ""born alive rule"", something we codified in 2002 that defines someone as ""alive"" as ""the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of that member, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion"" (with their definition of ""person"" being any infant homo sapien who is born alive under that other definition). [Studies done](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1410689#t=abstract) on babies born around the time Gosnell would've been performing those abortions show that, even if he didn't kill them, there's only a 5% chance they would've survived, and a 3% chance they would've survived without extreme complications. To me, that means it's not a matter of the baby's location in Gosnell's case, rather it's more a legal quibble that he induced the births but then still chose to kill them. That's where the murder charge comes from. 

Beyond that, I don't think Gosnell could/should be held up as anything more than a depraved dude who ran an unregulated abortion clinic committing horrible acts. Yes, late-term abortions can be even more potentially traumatic than earlier abortions. But there's more of a difference between abortions at 2 days-22 weeks than an abortion at 22-26 weeks. 

I hear what you mean when you're not really anti-abortion. But in the end of the day, I don't think there's much moral/ethical framework we can put on the abortion procedure that doesn't negatively impact a woman's right to privacy and to make their own decisions re: their body. Trying to go too deep into the rabbit hole of fetal personhood/rights doesn't do too much other than make an already hard choice for women even more difficult, or in some cases impossible. Even someone born in a vegetative state is still a person legally because they were ""born alive"", with all the rights associated therein.",t2_xl6o9,kjj34,0,1648143071.0,0,t1_i1yfhg6,i1yfhg6,False,CelestineCrystal,t3_tllrf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tllrf0/tell_your_legislator_no_abortion_bans_in_missouri/,Tell Your Legislator: No Abortion Bans in Missouri,/r/missouri/comments/tllrf0/tell_your_legislator_no_abortion_bans_in_missouri/i1yfhg6/,3,r/missouri,0,3

"Honestly, knowing the rats nest of ties would be useless. The information is already there for those interested. Making it slightly easier to access isn't going to get too many people to pay more attention to it. The problem in the first place is that our politicians have the ties not who they're tied to. 
  
Corporations as they currently exist need to be abolished. And then redefined narrowly. Corporations should exist for one singular purpose. Not massively vertically integrated behemoths. Further, corporations shouldn't own other corporations. Nor should anyone on the board or management of one have similar input on another. They could invest sure. But should be made to choose only one to guide. People can lobby as individuals in the interest of a corporation they're a member of if they like. But corporations themselves should not have paid lobbyists. And politicians should never entertain them. And most importantly. The public good must be placed above the bottom line. No more of this getting fined for doing wrong is just a tax on doing business. If a company consistently goes against the common or public good. Union busting, selling deadly products, deceptive practices. They should face some sort of corporate death sentence. Their assets redistributed sold off and the company gone.

"Supply and demand my friend. LM22 adds no new supply (they add 144 micro licenses, only 96 of which can grow a maximum of 250 plants, meaning all 96 together will harvest less per year than Flora does in one month), we only have 60 current growers for 175,000 patients, if we open up the adult use market will have over 1,000,000 million customers and no additional supply, it will drive prices through the roof, which is why they designed it that way. As an FYI, Colorado has over 700 cultivators, Oklahoma has over 8500, we have a small fraction of that.

A lot of people have a misconception that legalization will open up the market, but with LM22 that's not true, it specifically limits the market to the current industry. In theory DHSS, after the 2 year waiting period this law would require, could start issuing more macro licenses, however that would still mean we're 3-4 years out from any new supply being added. A free, fair, and open market is what we want, and LM22 does not give us that.

"I appreciate actual intelligent response. Instead of emotional people assuming things and trying to dunk. Thank you. 

No, I don't think it's clear one way or the other and am really not anti abortion. I think we need to have more discussion on it certainly. I do feel that logically, technically, scientifically it is a life once it begins replicating it's own DNA. Certainly that can have legal implications that I'm even not a fan of, but it's a fact. I do believe in women's rights to their bodies as a libertarian, however I'm not sure where the legal line should be drawn. Clearly there's a differences between a woman's right and the babies rights. I don't think the answer will ever be clear on that regard. But it is worth talking about.  Now, my personal opinion is that later term abortions are pretty clearly fucked up morally.

 If you're not familiar, look up Kermit Gosnell. This guy was a former abortion physician who got in trouble for inducing labor, then killing the babies.  That raised an interesting question for me ethically. Does the location of the baby matter? What difference does it make whether it's inside the womb or outside when it's terminated?

"Fair, I understand where you're coming from with that. My main thing against using that as a standard for abortion restrictions is that A.) Saying things like sperm, eggs, and fertilized embryos are ""alive"" is a different determination than fetal viability, and B). That two-day window occurs well ahead of the point that most women even know they're pregnant, to the order of about 3-4 weeks too early, making it exceedingly difficult for anyone to terminate that pregnancy even if they were allowed to. Did those things factor into your determination at all?
