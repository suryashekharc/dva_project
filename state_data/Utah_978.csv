"The history of speed limits is genuinely fascinating.  Speeds used to have day and night speed limits, specifically because the day speed was faster than headlights could see at night.

Like I said, I'm not going to convert anyone on the internet with logic and science.  If nothing else, the last 2 years have taught us all that people will do what they want for whatever reason they want, and they won't listen to logic or science.

Our speed policy is basically a balancing act between human stupidity and safety.  There are much more logical ways to do speed limits and driving, but humans are not logical.  They're illogical, and driven by emotions; you're kind of proving that point for me.

FWIW, you can take any car on a track and play around.  You don't have to have a supercar.  You can track day in a 1985 Honda Civic as long as it has functioning safety features.  I specifically had a superbike because I got the racing bug after getting a ticket and going to traffic school and learning about the basic science behind vehicles.  Traffic school was mostly useless, but they had an SCCA rep talk to us and that's how I got into racing.  I don't think I ever went above 70mph in my daily driver on a race course.  The point I am trying to make is that the highway is not the place to be getting anyone's jollies with speed.  I understand the thrill of going fast, I really do.  It's just not worth it in almost all cases.

Populist are not all just Trump voters. Populism by definition is a movement that supports the average citizen. The most notable goal being to lessen income inequality and the economic impacts on the poor. In a country where income inequality has gotten increasingly worse the last few years due to the unaffordability of housing and now the unaffordability of staple goods like gas and food it‚Äôs no wonder that populism is rising in popularity across both sides of the isle. Saying that the populist shift is all due to Trumpers is really ignoring the real issues leading to the popularity of this ideology. You can expect either party that embraces this ideology more in the next election cycle to sweep elections nationwide.

"How is it a bad argument?  You said in a previous reply:

> ""This isn't about kindness, this is about fairness.""

So you're discounting people's thoughts of the other implications of the bill in order to put all of the weight on the fairness of the situation.  Someone else brings up other inequalities and suddenly those are bad arguments.  

A bad argument would be something more akin to your other reply:

> ""Oh no they can‚Äôt dominate female school records:( shut up they‚Äôre fine

Where you make a strawman that this bill solves a problem in which female school records are endangered enough to require legislative time and literal law making in order to prevent a situation which has not in any way occurred.  

You also further indicate that ""they're fine"" when there are academic peer reviewed papers demonstrating that [transgender adolescents are significantly more at-risk for suicide and mental health problems then cis adolescents in their same age group.](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/144/5/e20191183/38246/Suicidality-Disparities-Between-Transgender-and)

So in summation we have a law that is being passed, singling out objectively higher at-risk and endangered kids, with the sole intent of isolating them and telling them they're not allowed to be a part of activities other kids get to enjoy, all while solving a problem that has not been demonstratably shown to exist.

Just want to make sure I understand this correctly. 

A man who believes he is a woman has brain patterns that match that of a woman. 

His biological sex is male, but believes his gender is female. But his brain patterns line up with women. What is a women exactly? What is a man?

This still implies that one‚Äôs gender identity is generally affected by their sex and not socially constructed. To tie it to the opposite sex implies the opposite sex generally have similar brain patterns and the current sex also generally have similar brain patterns to each other.

"I'm not at all happy about the process.  But this was a power play in action.  

The side with a clear majority of votes felt the other side of the compromise was moving the needle too much their way and dragging their feet too long.  The negotiations had already gone on for two years and was heading to a third year.  It's very rare to see political compromises drag on for three years and be successful.  Frankly, the political minorities here (moderate Cox and the left social groups) misplayed what little hand they had.

>why not do it right instead of substituting bill language at 10:00 of the final day of the session?

They counted up the votes, realized they were close to a 2/3rds majority, they were motivated by emotion, and they were tired of waiting.

After they pushed their literal 11th hour bill through, four things pushed the momentum further their way: 1) the social groups stopped negotiating, 2) Lia Thomas made huge social media rounds after a dominating win in the female 500 meter championship, 3) Republican caucus night, and 4) a promise to indemnify school districts against lawsuits.  Those four combined got *15* more state senators and reps to switch.  Even the soft-spoken and stubborn moderates switched votes in favor of a ban.

"It's because no road is designed for speeds in excess of 80mph.  Anything above 55-65mph and you're driving blind at night, without external light like on a freeway.  Hence why speed limits tend to be lower in wildlife areas.  The human body cannot react fast enough to stop or even avoid a crash at speeds above 65mph with even the most modern of headlights.

There's more that goes into designing a road than simply asking if a car can go X speed.  Road design is actually quite fascinating.  I'm not arguing, and I can't make anyone learn something if they don't want to.  I know your post isn't about the excessive speeding, but it stands out as a giant red flag to ignore anything else because the poster clearly doesn't know what they're talking about.  If this were focused on effective communication, you'd either move the speeding thing to the end so people don't discount whatever else you're saying, or remove it entirely.

To make a similarly silly sounding argument: your rationifor speeding is similar to what the anti maskers we're saying during COVID.

Excessive speeding is a sign of either an ignorant or uncaring person.  It cracks me up how people will pretend to care about whatever cause, then drive 90mph in a 65mph zone.  It's like they either can't fathom why the speed limit is what it is, or they're too selfish to think about it.  I promise very little in life is worth the risk.  Even in modern cars, your chances of walking away from a wreck at anything above 80mph are very slim.  It turns out thousands of pounds of steel and other materials hurtling through the world at blind speeds isn't that smart.

Rules exist for reasons, and that reason is usually safety and the functioning of society.

Just because a car can mechanically travel at high rates of speed does not mean they should in daily driving.  There is a lot more that goes into safely racing than simply going fast.  Breaking ability, tire traction, driver reaction, driver distraction, and so many more factors go into driving fast for real.  My race bike could go 212mph safely on a straight away, but that was because it could safely go from 200mph+ in about 400 feet to enter a turn at a safe speed. I don't think anyone is going to argue that you should be driving that fast on an open road, no matter what car you're driving.

Further, in most instances excessive speeding won't save you that much time.  In your example, driving 90mph+ for 90 miles might shave about 25 minutes off your travel time.  Is 25 minutes really worth risking ending your life or the life of someone else?  How about killing your loved ones and having to live with that all because you were feeling a bit impatient?  Is a little bit of an adrenaline rush worth it?  If anyone feels the need to speed they should go do it on a track.  They'll have more fun, and be better drivers for it after that learning the mechanics of how vehicles actually work at speed.",t2_3vje2535,Aioeyu,0,1648269616.0,0,t1_i25peg8,i25peg8,False,ChiefAoki,t3_to5k6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/to5k6t/driving_from_slc_to_moab_this_summer_read_this/,Driving from SLC to Moab this Summer?

"They‚Äôre children. Notice I didn‚Äôt even say If I was for or against in my first comment but you and the other commenter immediately freaked out. That is how I know it‚Äôs hate and not actual concern for the girls participating. This is just a fight for you. They are 4 children that are facing an entire state of people telling them they can‚Äôt participate. Apparently me showing empathy for their situation is really offensive and awful for you. Take a step back and think about that. You can be against something and still be a decent fucking human being. 

Also since now I‚Äôm really worked up at your blatant bigotry: The thing I‚Äôve really noticed about people in this state and with right wing politics is that they want to discriminate without any repercussions. Notice the person above used the word ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. But if a kid from a weird local religion were to be left out of something it would be the end of the fucking world. Normal is subjective. And yes, it is unkind AND unfair to leave children out of sports. That‚Äôs my opinion as a human being and as a parent. And I‚Äôm a woman who participated extensively in high school sports. There are lots of work arounds. Let them compete and don‚Äôt record their times.

"Speed limits exist for a reason.  That reason isn't to make driving less fun.  Roads are designed with a specific speed in mind, with a margin of error because engineers know people will ignore the speed limit.

They aren't a buzz kill suggestion, but an engineered design choice.

If you want to drive fast on an open road, go learn to race for real at a sports car club.  I don't think I've sped more than a few mph in my life since I learned about road engineering and raced actual cars and motorcycles.  Nothing, and I mean nothing, on an open road compares to dragging your knee on the ground at 100+mph on a motorcycle, or hitting 200mph on the straight always.

"They are planning to revert to the committee compromise if/when they lose in court so i don't see what time was saved here. If it was going to take a little bit more time to get it right, why not do it right instead of substituting bill language at 10:00 of the final day of the session? I can't pull up my copies of the original text version vs version four right now so I can't speak to more specifics on changes to the bill at this moment. 

From the governor's letter explaining his veto:

""While it is not unusual to have legislators propose changes to bills, it is unusual to have major overhauls proposed at the last minute on significant policy issues that had been the subject of so much negotiation. It is even rarer to have these pass, especially with no communication with those who had been negotiating the issue.

"It's also the lives of all the biologically female athletes here. Imagine working your ass off your whole life to get into the Olympics or even just a scholarship to university. Then a trans woman easily beats you in everything, takes state, gets the scholarship etc and poof goes your planned livelihood. Is that the biggest problem on earth? No. Can biological women find other ways to be happy or use athletic talent? Sure they can. Can trans women do that too and still find peace and community in other areas of their life, outside of athletics? Yep. 

This issue is so much more nuanced than people think. Usually situations like this are not dichotomous decisions. There may be a better solution no one has thought of yet that can satisfy both the trans women and the biologically weaker females. 

In case it isn't well known..  males and females are biologically different in many aspects. When doing CrossFit my husband ALWAYS burned more calories than me no matter how hard I tried or how long I went. The male and female CrossFit competitors never competed against the opposite sex even the burliest built female I'd ever personally met could not compete with any of the males who trained as much as she did. When scuba diving, men use oxygen faster than women if they're at the same level of expertise (using oxygen too fast is bad). I'll gladly let my husband burn more calories and lose weight fast while I get to stay scuba diving longer... It's a fair trade. Each sex has it's pros and cons. 

Trans women athletes that do the same training as a biological female will beat the biological female. Of course that does depend on how early the trans women transitioned. If they transitioned before puberty they're probably on par with their female peers and should be allowed to compete. But seriously, what is stopping trans women who transitioned in adulthood from competing? Anyone seen that South Park episode? Heck even Dave Chappelle touches on this issue.

Even though it makes my heart hurt for those trans women who's self esteem is taking a hit from this, and if the reverse decision was made the biological females fear around competing against trans women would also make me sad for them, i do have to agree with other posts that point out-- there are bigger issues than this. Can we all agree that the priority list should go something like this: 

1. GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS
2. Wars, crimes against humanity
3. Poverty
4. Human trafficking
5. Mental health (including queer community issues solutions such as this one)
6. A lot of other things

Luckily there are enough humans on earth to work on all these solutions at the same time. But real and fast change comes from legislation.. so I would love to see Utah start caring more about global warming. While smaller branches of government work on this issue. Or even resolve this issue at a school level. If there are some schools that allow it and some that don't, great people can choose their school based on that. I obviously don't know the solution. But i wish people would recognize both sides of the argument are valid.",t2_38jkfd1h,11dmeggers,1,1648252589.0,0,t1_i24sm3q,i24sm3q,False,HomelessRodeo,t3_tnyjux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/tnyjux/utah_house_overrides_governors_veto_of/,Utah House overrides governor's veto of transgender sports ban,/r/Utah/comments/tnyjux/utah_house_overrides_governors_veto_of/i24sm3q/,5,r/Utah,0,5

>In 1857, Mormon convert Robert Dockery Covington was dispatched by church leaders to Utah's Virgin River Basin to lead a ""cotton mission"" because of his experience on Mississippi plantations.

>Not as well known is historical evidence that Covington, a revered figure in Utah history who died in 1902, and his fellow Washington County settlers included former slave owners, drivers and Rebel sympathizers during the Civil War. Settler Albert Washington Collins enjoyed recounting how he raped and used lethal violence on disobedient blacks and celebrated Confederate battlefield victories, according to a narrative by fellow settler George Hicks.

>""It puts the skids to this happy fantasy that [Utah's Dixie has] no connection to the Confederacy,"" Utah historian Will Bagley said. ""The name Dixie reflects the sympathy that the southern Utah and the Mormon people felt for the Confederacy.""

Let's not pretend that racism isn't rampant in Utah by ignoring the history of the word Dixie. South means south. Dixie means the confederacy.

"The tie is the people that moved there and felt there was a similar split between N. and S. Utah as the northern and southern states in the US. There's a relationship there, but now they're separate terms. I doubt anyone in S. Utah considers themselves to be part of ""the south"" as the term is used today, but they probably consider themselves to be in Dixie Utah.

It's quite similar to the borrowed naming in the original colonies, like New Hampshire (not part of Hampshire, England), New York (not part of York, England), etc. They're names given to regions by people who moved there and have since taken on new meaning.

Dixie Utah means southern Utah and has connotations of being warm. That's about it as far as the meaning of the term goes. There's nothing racist about it, especially since it has become a distinct term.

"I never found the term Dixie offensive, although I always cringed at how prominent the name was used in Southern Utah and how the community wanted that name to represent itself instead of more proper names like St George or Mojave Desert, etc. Like I thought it was a quaint little nickname for the area but weird to use it on things that extend beyond the community (like DSU)

HOWEVER, when the DSU name controversy came about and everyone was claiming that it was ""merely our heritage as cotton growers,"" I learned a lot about how Dixie College really branded itself as the confederacy. They used confederate colors, called their yearbook The Confederate, used ""Rebels"" as the mascot, had mock slave auctions, put statues of confederate leaders on campus.. seriously WTF.. why in the hell is this college in Utah, named after a separate geographical area, taking on all the worst parts of that culture as its brand?

"> doesn't mean it associates with the south..

Well, it does. The whole point of calling the region ""Dixie"" was in reference _to_ the south. But just because there's a connection with the south doesn't mean they see themselves as _part_ of the south, and there's certainly no relation to slavery.

The term was mostly used, AFAIK, because the region felt separate from the surrounding areas (physically separate from Arizona and N. Utah, culturally separate from Las Vegas), much like the south feels separate from the north by the Mason-Dixon line, and many of the people there were originally from the south and brought some of their culture with them. Some of them were in favor of the Confederacy, but I highly doubt it was anywhere close to a majority.

I think they used it because that region is warm, physically separate from the rest of Utah, and the people there idealized life in the south (meaning the culture, not the wealth from slavery). And to this day, I think it's just a carryover from that feeling of being a distinct region of our state.",t2_r62aul9,one_is_the_loneliest,0,1648224929.0,0,t1_i22xugt,i22xugt,False,Insultikarp,t3_tnm57i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/tnm57i/utah_makes_juneteenth_a_state_holiday/,Utah makes Juneteenth a state holiday,/r/Utah/comments/tnm57i/utah_makes_juneteenth_a_state_holiday/i22xugt/,7,r/Utah,0,7

"I don't really see anything racist about the name, though it does have a strong connection to cotton growing. ""Dixie"" means ""southern US,"" so ""Dixie Utah"" means ""southern Utah."" Just like ""the south"" is separated from ""the north"" by the Mason-Dixon line, so is southern Utah separated from northern Utah culturally and geographically.

I wouldn't mind changing the name, but I think the decision should come from the people who live there. I don't see that term as racist, and I don't think anyone who grew up in Utah sees it that way either. AFAIK, its original intent was as an idealistic look back at the southern lifestyle, which has nothing (directly) to do with slavery, and I think the residents there want to keep the term to highlight that they're culturally different from those in northern Utah.

I don't have a horse in this race. I don't see the term ""Dixie"" as racist, nor do I have any tie to the region, I just think we have more important things to worry about in this state.

But you can't dehumanize children. There are way too many programs out there where qualified mental health professionals are nowhere to be found, and it's just a bunch of assholes who enjoy their power over young people.

If you're a parent with a troubled teen, look elsewhere for help if you hear the words ""tough love"" too much. Also beware if they don't have any policies to make sure one person can't be alone with your kid. Stories of abuse, sexual and otherwise, are sadly common.

"For myself 'The Utah Way"" means all sorts of things in different areas. HOWEVER, pretty self explanatory Utah's state officials does what ever they want when ever they want however they feel is necessary without a damn care about anyone else especially the homeless and low income people! The entire world is / was in a pandemic the CDC issues an eviction ban to prevent the spread of this deadly virus Utah being the only state in the country that didn't follow the rules or regulations concerning covid 19 Kirk Cullimore Jr being the only eviction attorney for landlords/ property managers in the country that physically had a family thrown out in the streets while all 3 members had just tested positive for covid this was during the beginning of this pandemic dec 2020 thru June of 2021 the only attorney/ Senator that partnered up with workforce services created a SLUSH FUND and with every eviction he gets with tenants living in a government subsidized apartment he and the property manager get a fat check from this slush fund and you know why? To help him and the property manager recover financially from the pandemic.... This happened to me and my 18 yr old twins. The property manager for Lakeview apts in Tooele filed eviction against me because my government pua check was delayed why was it delayed? The pua program was extended with funds so workforce services made everyone already receiving these benefits REAPPLY FOR THE EXTENDED FUNDING this property manager told me she wasn't allowed to look at my proof once my benefits were approved again, by logging into jobs.utah.gov shows every single this about my pua the property manager said she wasn't allowed to look at my proof. Simply waiting for my check in the mail my gov check 17 days late the first time this entire pandemic because my gov check was delayed so the property manager for the government subsidized apartment where I was living filed eviction 17 days late during an eviction ban during a worldy pandemic. Paul Smith the executive director for the uaa made a statement on the uaa website and I quote ""no tenant living in a government subsidized apartment in the state of Utah can be evicted for non payment of rent in fact the property manager has to work with that tenant's "" end quote. I have mr Smith addmiting to me thru an email that he indeed made that statement in the beginning of the pandemic. Guess it doesn't apply to me though even tho I was living in a government subsidized apartment on section 42 and was only waiting for my check to arrive in the mail. She filed we go to court Jan 22 2021 3rd district in Tooele ruled there was nothing the court could do until moritorium expired. ( I served property manager a signed copy of the CDC declaration moritorium she filed eviction the very next day ) 9 days later on Feb 1 I finally get my pua check tried paying what I owed to the property manager $1500 she refused my money and said she isn't allowed to talk to me... Obviously by this statement they had a plan for me the plan being to bank off of an eviction from me and hundreds of other families. Evicting low income families during an eviction ban and during a deadly worldly pandemic this attorney/UTAH SENATOR doesn't follow any rules and regulations concerning covid passing bills that clearly only benefit his law firm THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF HOW A SENATOR SHOULD BE read the senators oath for the people by the people of the people.. does this sound like an oath taken by a senator yet throws my twins and I out in the streets while we had just tested positive for covid we were fully vaccinated by the way.. I wasn't trying to stay for free I contacted Cullimore Jr and Ashley begged him to let me pay however much he wanted just so we could remain in the apt just while we were sick homeless because of Mr Cullimore Jrs debt collecting he put an eviction on my credit BEFORE EVEN GOING TO COURT BEFORE HAVING A JUDGEMENT  I have 30 denial emails denying me for 1 reason only for having a recent eviction it's illegal to put a mark on someone's credit before having a judgement expect for the Cullimore law office of course I begged him and big shot senator said nope not a good enough reason and had us physically thrown out 2 days later we were sick as hell sick as hell then this property manager never returned our calls / emails never called us back to arrange for us to get our things she threw everything we owned in the dumpster while we were in my car out in a field in the heat sick as hell with this deadly virus we lost everything damn it the court condoned this funny even to this day court is held over the phone as they put it cuz of fear of covid and yet allowed us to be physically thrown out in the streets while we had covid protect yourselves but to hell with my kids and me right Utah? Cullimore Jr partners up with the same Gov agency that was the cause of my check being late which caused me to be late with rent our lives destroyed I'm still homeless to this day we lost everything we worked so damn hard for and now they want $8 grand ... The only state in this country that allows an attorney and a senator be so shallow to personally gain financially during a worldly pandemic by doing the opposite of what the CDC had issued to prevent the spread of covid to save lives the only state that says they care but ignore this circus of a show that the Cullimore law office preforms such cruelty and unfairness Cullimore Jr simply minipulates the law into his favor passes bills that only benefit his law firm causing a major majority of the homeless issue in Utah I can go on and on just send the firing squad the next time a family is 17 days late with rent because their gov check was delayed during a pandemic I hate I have so much anger against all who are apart of this shit we didn't deserve this how dare you I hate Utah if I could I'd move the fuck out this state God state my ass more like crookes in suets... Greedy liars that's the Utah way ..  how dare you take our fucking lives like this during a fucking time when people were dying from a worldy deadly virus this has nothing to do with PAYING rent on time straight up sabatoged just so you can personally gain financially that's the Utah way... Turn the other cheek that's the Utah way. Destroy families during a time when a deadly pandemic is happening that's the Utah way being fake as hell two face fucking chumps that's the Utah way.. let's see how any of you act being sick as fuck with covid in your car with your kids in the heat let's see any of you lose every fucking thing you worked so hard for the past 5 yrs all because my gov check was late thanks workforce services Cullimore Jr you fucking crooks and to the property manager fuck you to bitch thats the fucking Utah way",t2_il1id9hr,HeartScary5249,0,1648185216.0,0,t1_i213mah,i213mah,True,Electrical_Sugar2560,t3_tmy9hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/tmy9hj/what_does_the_utah_way_mean_to_you/,"What does ""The Utah Way"" mean to you?",/r/Utah/comments/tmy9hj/what_does_the_utah_way_mean_to_you/i213mah/,1,r/Utah,0,1

It is changing nationwide.  Utah's Republicans in legislature is now more Trumpist than not, and the ratio is growing.  Cox is keeping the moderation in line.  Who knows what happens after Cox...

>We were also on the bandwagon to ban gay marriage in the hardest possible way which ended up making gay marriage legal everywhere.

Again, it's a deep red state.  You just aren't going to see Utah jump all-in on a left position.  Ever.  Abortion is another example where a Utah majority won't accept it.  

But historically we have seen Utah politicians find some softer positions and compromises.  So for abortion, while Idaho and Texas are going for these unusual 6 week bans enforced by civil lawsuits, you won't see Utah do that.  But you will see Utah go for a full state enforced ban except in the case of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.  Utah's responses to culture issues have historically not been full-throated opposition like you see in other states.

>They absolutely could have revoked it fully, but instead had to modify it to add as much difficult regulation as possible, and ensure that they can enrich the fewest number of people possible.

That's not at all what occurred.  HB 3001's original plan (the bill that first superseded Prop 2), enabled *more* delivery end-points than Prop 2, by mixing pharmacies/dispensaries with dispersal at county health departments.  When that didn't work out, they added more pharmacy end points.  As for costs and regulation, Prop 2 was worse.  It required doctors to first try other pain management routes with the patient, and after these hadn't worked, then the doctor could issue a marijuana card.  HB 3001 did away with that and allowed a patient to go straight to a card.  HB3001 and Prop 2 were similar in terms of costs due to private growers, testing, and state regulation (other states have the exact same issue where a tested drug is always more expensive than an untested street drug).  Prop 2 also had some legal messes, such as a weird gap where medical marijuana was legal, then strangely a gap appeared and was fully illegal in all forms for 6 months, then supported legally again.  HB 3001 fixed a bunch of legal oversights of Prop 2.",t2_4gb68,helix400,0,1648163003.0,0,t1_i1zthm7,i1zthm7,False,Electrical_Sugar2560,t3_tmy9hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/tmy9hj/what_does_the_utah_way_mean_to_you/,"What does ""The Utah Way"" mean to you?",/r/Utah/comments/tmy9hj/what_does_the_utah_way_mean_to_you/i1zthm7/,6,r/Utah,0,6

That said, I still think some of your other points should have some context added to them that reduces their impact (not invalidates it, just reduces it)

&#x200B;

>Utah was the first red state with LGBT rights legislation  


We were also on the bandwagon to ban gay marriage in the hardest possible way which ended up making gay marriage legal everywhere.

All that said, that discrimination language still exists. Which is awesome. But then...they ban all trans girls because one exists in the state.

&#x200B;

>Utah modified medical marijuana in such a way that made Republicans comfortable, and sped up the timeline much faster than other states (for example, it went much faster than Louisiana's implementation). Many red states still have full on marijuana bans or are CBD only.

I think this should also be contextualized that they had to. The original language was lighter and already passed. They absolutely could have revoked it fully, but instead had to modify it to add as much difficult regulation as possible, and ensure that they can enrich the fewest number of people possible.

Again, I love that I can legally buy weed now. That's awesome. I hate that I can't burn it for no reason. I hate that it's 3 times more expensive than most other places. All of these things are outcomes of the Republicans putting big government in the way of individual rights.

"A place of ignorance? Buddy, if you can‚Äôt understand the biological differences between a male and a female, you are locked in a fundamentally ignorant closet. 

There is a significant performance difference between males and females in athletics among other things. Lia Thomas is a prime example of a failed male swimmer that is now a winner only because he competed against women in the same damn sport he failed to compete is as a male.

"It means despite being a deep red state, Utah historically has been more resistant to passing deep red bills on culture issues. 

For all of you mad at Utah's laws, go look at what Texas, Idaho, Florida, Kansas, Indiana, and other red states are doing.  Utah isn't like them.  Utah jumps on a blue state legislative idea sooner than red states and does it in a way that has compromise and seeks input from multiple groups.  You just don't see that in other states with a supermajority.  Some people like this kind of compromise, while it angers others.  Past examples:

* Back in 2005 Utah was [the *first* state in the country to give drivers licenses to illegal immigrants](https://www.1law.com/utahs-program-to-license-undocumented-immigrant-drivers-model-for-other-states/)  and still the *only* red state with this.
* In 2010 the Utah Compact was a relatively kinder framework for illegal immigration.  The left-leaning NY Times [spoke fondly of it](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/opinion/05sun1.html?ref=immigration).  
* Utah was the [first red state with LGBT rights legislation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/12/utah-legislature-passes-landmark-lgbt-anti-discrimination-bill-backed-by-mormon-church/)
* Utah modified medical marijuana in such a way that made Republicans comfortable, and sped up the timeline much faster than other states (for example, it went much faster than Louisiana's implementation).  Many red states still have full on marijuana bans or are CBD only.  
* From the recent session, Utah is one of only a handful of states which has made progress utilizing psychedelics to treat patients suffering from mental health issues.   

Edit: I recalled three more.

* Utah was *the first* red state to pass a conversion therapy ban.  But Utah was unique in explicitly detailing that when a medical service provider acts in capacity as a family leader or a religious leader, their medical license isn't threatened. 
* Utah passed a climate change resolution in 2018 which recognizes the consequences of climate change and encourages the reduction of emissions.  I chatted with one of the lobbyists who pushed it, she mentioned she got buy-in through such tactics as rewording ""climate change"" to ""changing climate"", so that it didn't sound liberal.    
* Utah passed a K-12 Critical Race Theory ban, but did it by carefully going through the state school board level and using very neutral and mundane legal language.  The ban didn't mention CRT by name and its cautious neutrality neutered CRT.   

It also shows up in bill processes:  
 
* Behind the scenes chatter killed an anti-vaccine mandate bill, after a couple of attempts were made to weaken the bill during its lifetime. 
* Utah could have passed a blunt transgender sports bill last session, but did not, opting to work to find a solution with more stakeholders.  The process was still ongoing and was slated for 2023, but it got torpedoed by an alternate 11th hour bill that passed by majority but without a 2/3rds majority, and the governor vetoed it.  We'll see tomorrow just how many changes are needed to get a 2/3ds majority.   (The transgender in sports issue has fast become a nationwide issue. 11 states already ban it.  And push for bans have had traction in every red state except Louisiana and Wyoming.  Lia Thomas's recent swimming championship killed any momentum for broad compromise in every red state.)  

This Utah Way could easily die off in the next decade.  Trumpism and populism are becoming stronger nationwide, including Utah.

"No it‚Äôs not just a random historic way to split it. Woman‚Äôs sports was created specifically on the basis of different BIOLOGY and the fact that the *performance gap between males and females is much greater than within each sex*.  So much greater in fact that women stand no chance - ever - competing against biological males. 

You are freaking ignorant about basic facts and yet you are pushing your agenda with some inflated sense of moral superiority. Males and females are two separate distinct biological categories. High school male athletes have better results than female olympic champions. It is a fact. How it makes you or anyone feel is irrelevant. This is why women‚Äôs sports were segregated and not for any other reason.

"Because if the sport weren't split along biological gender lines, women couldn't compete at all.

White people aren't stronger than black people by nature. So of course that's racist.

Being short has pros and cons when dealing in sports. Women have no pros to men. They aren't faster or stronger or smarter. So even this isn't really comparable. The best girl on my school's basketball team is the shortest.

Obese people can choose to become stronger. Sports already empower them by giving them a goal to work towards if they so choose. Women can't choose to become as strong as a man. No matter how hard she works. 

The fact is no matter how hard a biological woman tries, she cannot become as strong as an athletic man.

Testosterone has an effect on the human body and biological women have significantly less testosterone than men. This is scientific fact.

I understand that you may feel like ""it's just high school"" but high school sports make or break it for some kids. I teach those kids. I worked almost every basketball game my school had this year, and there's a major difference between male and female sports.

Some of these girls do not thrive academically and rely on their athletic aptitude to pay for college. Something that could be taken by a transgender woman who is biologically capable of becoming much stronger than the rest of the team. Or she could potentially make a relatively weak team beat out much stronger teams because of just one player potentially hurting an entire team's worth of girls. It's amazing in high school sports how one player changes everything.

I love my transgender students as well. I am a liberal who believes that they should be given equal rights. But I'm willing to acknowledge that this is complicated. I have also always cared about women's rights, and in this regard the two are, in fact, colliding.

I feel like junior high sports or intramural sports should be fine for transgender women, but high school leads in to college pretty fluidly. So the same standards held at the college level should be held in high school. Especially varsity.

This is the policy of the NCAA, and I think this is a good compromise of transgender rights and women's rights.
1. ¬† ¬†A trans male (FTM) student-athlete who has received a medical exception for treatment with testosterone for diagnosed Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria and/or Transsexualism, for purposes of NCAA competition may compete on a men‚Äôs team, but is no longer eligible to compete on a women‚Äôs team without changing that team status to a mixed team.

2. ¬† ¬†A trans female (MTF) student-athlete being treated with testosterone suppression medication for Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria and/or Transsexualism, for the purposes of NCAA competition may continue to compete on a men‚Äôs team but may not compete on a women‚Äôs team without changing it to a mixed team status until completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment.

Realistically high schools should take up the same policy.

"I grew up in Heber Valley in the 80s, haven't resided there for many years but have family still living there and visit often. Housing costs are insane everywhere. So, if your goal is to be near work, bite the bullet and find a place in the HV, it's beautiful and will be much better than wasting your time  commuting (I commuted for several years through Provo Canyon and for a few months down Parleys Canyon before moving to SL County). HV itself is very accessible by biking and walking and there are a lot if nice outdoor activities. Be aware that HV is very small town culturally and the old-timers don't take kindly to all the newcomers and development that's boomed over the last 20 yrs. HV consists of mostly conservative/LDS religious citizens but I personally know there is fun to be had if you have patience and just poke around to find your people. I'd suggest taking an overnight or weekend stay in HV to check it out more thoroughly to see if the pace suits your style (lots of hotel accommodations ir you could see if a house rental is available to really dig your heels in).  Summertime is the tourist season and downtown Heber gets busy with tourists and folks passing through on the highways. There are 4 golf courses I can think of in the area. Wasatch State Park GC is a beautiful course that's a state golf course (tee times go quickly because it us popular). It's in Midway at the base of the mountains and not far from Homestead Resort's golf course. There's also Soldier Hollow and Red Ledges golf courses. Provo River is a renowned fishing spot and there are a lot of hiking opportunities in the nearby mountains. 2 reservoirs nearby give some water recreation options yearround. Winter season seems to be the opposite of what you get on the Wasatch Front - HV either gets all the snow or nothing at all. Local legend says the tribal people  referenced HV as the valley with a hole in the sky because of the unique storm patterns.

"I live in the Provo metro area and visit Heber valley regularly.

Public transit in Heber isn't really a thing. There's a main street where most of the businesses are and the rest is fairly rural.

I've ridden my bike up there a little and its beautiful. There aren't bike lanes (or sidewalks in most areas), but roads are wide and don't see tons of traffic. Riding a bike/motorcycle in the winter would be... hazardous. Its very cold and we get some good snow storms every year.

Commuting from Provo/Orem is a possibility. Housing isn't much better here though. You'd have to drive HW 89 through Provo Canyon to get to work everyday.

And clinicians want you to get to that point...the outcomes are better (or something) You can't drive for a good bit afterward and you feel like your entire body amd brain has been injected with dental novocaine.  I don't find it necessarily pleasant but it isn't unpleasant either...more fascinating if I had to pick a term.

Some people get pretty massive breakthroughs in their sessions. Not me...I am pretty knowledgeable about my issues and where/why they exist.

Yet it has helped my anxiety LOADS. I am in a very early morning career. I am a grown-ass woman who is also afraid of the dark and forn8 years I effing RAN to my car no matter the conditions. Now I walk normally. and along with fight-or-flight symptoms coming back,  It is also one of the triggers to know I need a booster...if I am getting the ""run"" feeling. 

It has helped me massively, but I can't tell you why, exactly. They do like you to be in therapy and schedule the sessions as close before the appointment as possible. There is therapy now while you microdose with ketamine. It is supposed to be very helpful. Especially for people especially who have difficulty going deep into traumatic and or painful issues.
