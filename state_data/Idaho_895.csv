"I think these points largely don't lend weight to your argument.

>There is a sales tax on groceries. (California does not)

True, but California has higher sales taxes due to county and city taxes. That adds up too, especially when you have to make a big purchase.

Sales tax in Boise is 6%. In Oakland it's 10.25%.

Everyone in Idaho gets a $100/person/year rebate. While it's a really low amount at around $4.70/day in spending (iirc), it does mean that a decently thrifty family will have a pretty significant percentage of their grocery bills be untaxed. Granted, it's way low and regressive. 

Also, the states that tax groceries are: Alabama, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia. Not really seeing what makes a grocery tax not conservative.

>There are hardly any limitations on how high property taxes can go. (California does)

Well, that was Howard Jarvis so it's a pretty damn conservative thing that California did back in 1978 when the state was very different politically. You certainly can't cast this as anything resembling a liberal policy. 

Also, Idaho limits the percentage that a municipality can increase its property tax revenue as a share of all revenue to 3%. Idaho also has the homestead exemption, which will likely be raised. 

Other states across the political spectrum don't replicate Prop 13 because it's dumb.

> (private school is very popular in blue coastal cities)

Only in bad/mediocre school districts or places with lotteries when the parents get poor choices. Just like most places. Rich coastal cities just have more people who can pony up $5-40k/kid/year for feeder schools. 

I'd only consider private schooling a conservative viewpoint when framed as either sending your kids to religious schools to instill certain values/teachings in or if it's a market argument for charters.

>Out of wedlock births are dirt common.

As noted, incorrect.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/unmarried/unmarried.htm

>Drug use is very common and popular.

That's everywhere man. I think you'd have a hard time arguing that many drugs like weed, psychedelics, MDMA, etc. aren't far more tolerated socially in California (mostly). I mean, could you imagine someone openly selling mushrooms in Boise? 

>A state income tax exists, and isn't unusually low compared to other states.

This is fair. It is a flat tax basically. 

>The state has never been an economic powerhouse, despite being a ""free market utopia""

"Curious what part of the Bible you think conservatives are upholding? The only thing they have “claim” to is abortion, and even that is made up.

There’s less to suggest the Bible opposes abortion than there is to show the Bible supports slavery, and what little there is (Numbers 5:11 for example) not only suggests abortion is permissible but was used for MILLENNIA to support pre-quickening abortions. Even Catholics didn’t have a definitive stance on this issue until 1869 AD (as in nearly 2 millennia after the death of Christ), a time that “coincided” with paranoia that they were losing political power to Protestants. The modern day American pro life movement was invented as a way to counter Jimmy Carter, and many proponents of it had been well-established pro-choice supporters before hand (Reagan literally decriminalized it in California). The GOP was worried Reagan couldn’t get the religious vote away from Carter, and they needed an issue to unite American Christians behind the GOP. They saw how well Catholics had taken to the abortion issue in the 111 years since Pope Pious IX banned them, and started working with groups such as the National Right to Life Committee to create misinformation videos about abortion that they disseminated to churches across the country.

Prior to Roe v Wade, anti-abortion sentiments in the US centered around the dangers of the procedure. Many early feminists and suffragettes opposed abortion because of the complication rate, and feared men would pressure women into a life threatening procedure to get out of the responsibility of fatherhood. As medicine advanced, and abortion became safer, it became less controversial. By the time Roe v Wade passed in 1973 it had near universal support (save Catholics), with most states having already decriminalized the procedure. Again, Reagan himself decriminalized it 5 years prior to RvW. The point is, it wasn’t a “religious issue” until it was politically convenient for it to be (nearly 7 years after RvW).

If you’re a Christian, Matthew 7:15-20 tells you everything you need to know about the modern conservative “pro-life” movement. Look at the results. It doesn’t decrease abortion. It raises maternal mortality by over 20%, and even that’s an underestimate because it’s just the statistic for pregnancy complications and not the death rate for pregnant women who die from at-home abortions or committing suicide because they feel trapped. These bans don’t save lives, they kill them. If this was about ending abortion and saving lives we’d do what studies have repeatedly shown works: fund better sex education. If this were about “preserving life” our legislature wouldn’t simultaneously be trying to pass bills like HB658, so they can execute prisoners behind a veil of secrecy.

This has nothing to do with religion, and it never has.

Idaho does have a lot of taxes, but it's also small population for a lot of land. When you think of the area covered for roads, snow plows, further school bus trips, land management, wildlife management, ect... 


I would say outside of the topics of Transgender, Legal Marijuana, and Abortion... Most states are not much different to live in in terms of ""which party controls the government"". (Imigration is more federal than state)

There are states that have a really strict amount of regulations, which tends to be the most important thing for the common person, not who is in charge at that moment.

I've lived in 4 states, 3 ""liberal"" and 1 ""conservative"".  To me, there really was no difference in terms of government.

"Agreed. I mainly take issue with the ""foundational"" portion.

I also can't stress this enough: the book is so extensive, contradictory, and inscrutable that pretending like it could be used to prescriptively define a society is laughable. Its a choose your own adventure book, you get to cherry pick verses to support the theology you want and that allows believers to live in 'relative' peace with constantly evolving societies. Roman Christendom looks nothing like Medieval Europe, neither of them look anything like the Puritans and of course modern Christians are a million miles away from any of those societies.  

A huge appeal of conservatism is a vague sense of nostalgia and a distrust of change. You can only maintain that nostalgic worldview if you ignore and simplify massive swaths of history. This isn't just for religion either, a historical understanding of gender, economics, class, race, and philosophy all give lie to the conservative narratives being pushed each generation. 

I just wish any of these fundies could take a collegiate course in Early Christianity, so much of what they take for granted would be shattered.

"I am from North Idaho originally, lived in Colorado for 8 years, Oregon for 4 and am now back in Idaho in the Boise area. If I could pick any of the places I've lived id pick Colorado. I loved the people there and the areas around Denver get 300 days of sun, similar to here and there is soooo much to do. The cost of living is astronomical... But I don't think the housing market is any worse than here. Another draw back to that area is the population, it's busy and things like camping? Expect to reserve a year in advance. Also no big lakes/water. But the mountains are gorgeous, Denver is so fun, reminds me of a bigger Boise.

Oregon is a beautiful State. If you live in the Willamette Valley you get warm/hot summers, very mild to no winter and you are within 45 minutes of the coast and an hour or so to the mountains. Very diverse State, but you only see the sun in the summer.... Get used to gray the rest of the year! The government is very liberal but we lived in the valley and majority of the people are conservative and the Trumpers are there for sure. Cost of living is moderate and housing is going up as it is anywhere but not as bad as here. Education is questionable...

And before you jump ship, there are a lot of us in Idaho that are sane, inclusive people... With a heavy heart I registered as a Republican this year to have a bigger say on who may get elected in our State and at least try to find some moderates to fill House and Senate seats.

"\>The author of that study, Leanor Boulin Johnson, testified in Congress in 1991 about her findings. You can read her comments [here](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED338997.pdf)(skip to page 37). Boulin Johnson's study looked at the responses of 728 officers and 479 spouses from two East Coast police departments in 1983. She said:

\>How these figures compare to the national average is unclear. However, regardless of national data, it is disturbing to note that 40 percent of the officers stated that in the last six months prior to the survey they had gotten out of control and behaved violently against their spouse and children.

\>In 1992, [another study](https://policing.umhistorylabs.lsa.umich.edu/files/original/5528df2d5b5c33cfeaa930146cfe20ccb5cad0cd.pdf) came out that similarly included the 40% figure, but this time, that estimate represented the percentage of officers surveyed who reported ""at least one episode of physical aggression during a martial \[sic\] conflict in the previous year."" The distinction to make here is that the officer who reported the violence wasn't necessarily the perpetrator. That study included the responses of 425 officers, 385 male and 40 female, as well as responses from 115 spouses. Among the male officers, 28% reported committing an assault, while 27% of female officers did and 33% of the spouses.

\>Other studies followed suit.

\>For the purposes of this fact check, the most useful one is likely [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178916301331?via%3Dihub#) study, published by Annelise Mennicke and Katie Ropes in 2016.

"I think, unless you move to a predominantly liberal area you will still find the ""Fox News land"" types. I am in my 40's, and I grew up in Iowa. All my life, until the last two presidential cycles, Iowa was very 50/50 which somewhat kept the extremes of both parties in check. Iowa was special because you could find small rural counties that still voted largely for the Democrats, most of that has flipped over the last two elections however. Iowa is more 55/45 Republican now, which is super sad for me.

I think about moving back a lot. I am drawn to the idea of going back and trying to help slow its change to an all out RED state, before it's to late. I probably will move back in the near future. Iowa isn't for everyone, the humidity in the summer and lack of mountains are deal breakers for some. I love it though, you get used to the humidity (it's only bad July and August, June and September can be very nice there). Also, no there aren't mountains but Iowa is definitely not flat as a board and there is lots to do outdoor recreation wise.

"Hello fellow Boisean turned Seattleite. 

I feel very similar, except the regrets. I moved out once for for 5 years, thought I missed it, and moved back for 3 years. In those 3 years I realized that Boise was not that great, and definitely not as progressive as I had thought when I was growing up. Nature wise it still seemed beautiful, but I knew where everything was and had been mostly everywhere so even the scenery became mundane and stale.

"I'm not liberal, I'm a person who wants to live and let live. That being said have you seen what is happening in Idaho right now where we're defunding the libraries, making the national guard run the prisons because we refuse to pay prison guards enough, and banning abortion.

We have some of the worst education in the nation and we try to blame people who film animal abuse instead of animal abusers.  We give tax breaks to pyramid schemes, call centers and loan sharks while sabotaging state run Medicaid. We run a lottery that says its for the education but actually goes into a ""general fund"" that provides for politicians and their re-election

This should be common sense not to do these things.  Instead its becoming part of a agenda. Its not conservative (although its framed as such), its just downright corrupt most of the time.  The fault lies in the fact that voters will vote for anything that has a (R) in front of it. If there was any real opposition then maybe we would get more sensible people in office who are willing to compromise  and make laws about things Idaho needs (such as paying your god damned prison guards and other essential persons such as EMTs).

I've lived here all my life and things are getting progressively worse and not because of liberals.  Its not due to ""conservatives"" although the people who cause the problems wrap themselves in that cloak. Its due to a corrupt backwards state government that has had no opposition to its policies for decades, the same group of people who promise a ""temporary sales tax increase"" and then make it permanent (looking at you Risch).

Currently they are considering creating a sales tax increase (again). Supposedly it would be the highest in the nation.  They will ""offset"" this by creating a property tax break.  But who does that benefit? People who own lots of land will make off like bandits. The poorest and those who rent their property will suffer the most.  Most of us, even those who own homes will be poorer because of it.

Why isn't this ever highlighted by conservative activists? Or liberal activists for that matter. Nobody cares it seems like.  But I digress, often times I feel like a dog that has been beaten so many times I don't care anymore. Common sense is dead and I feel like we have killed it.

And yes before you say it portland and california have crime. I know. They have lots of people so that is bound to happen.  The more people you have the more crime you have (with the exception of Louisiana and Georgia which has the most crime in the country)

"Been on the planet for 55 years now.  Going on 14 years in ID in two different stints, family reasons both times.  Have lived in 5 states so far.  The only state I have lived in that was worse than Idaho was Utah.  

It depends on your stage in life, financial capacity, and family.  WA is my favorite with MT a close second.  ID is a decent place to retire, but that is about it.  If you have school-age kids, especially daughters, I would recommend WA for educational and employment opportunities.   Many Idahoans move to WA for economic and personal improvement opportunities.  

The first time I moved here I was 10, in the '70s.  In the first 24 hours in the state, I  had a grandparent bring me up to speed on how to hate California and was assaulted at school for my attire.  That was followed by a couple of years of endless bullying.  I got learned to work Idaho style, way too young with low quality and skill standards.

"We spent a week in Maine this summer, I generally very much liked it, but it also really was bizarro would. 

In some ways, very much like North Idaho.  Trees.  Moose.  People wearing flannel.  

Except instead of yelling at doctors about how COVID isn’t real, small townspeople in Maine were debating whether they should rename the main square “Black Lives Matter Square”, or the Main Street “Black Lives Matter Way.”

Also, lakefront property is stupid cheap by Idaho standards.  Like, you can still buy a little cabin on a lake for $250k. They type of thing that would go here for $800k-$1.5M easy. 

There was lots to love about it. 

Four things would keep me from moving there: 

* I literally melted in the humidity
* I like mountains
* I like skiing in snow, not on ice
* I like vast tracts of public lands where I can recreate

How about we take the lesser of two evils concept and throw it right out the fucking window and put someone one who makes decisions in the best interest of all people not a left or right group and definitely not for personal gain. Can we all collectively wake the fuck up and realize that we don't need to pick a left or right side forward is an option instead of stagnating with Left and Right. The majority of politicians whether they're blue or red are actually all on the same side they do what's in their best interest they don't care about the people.

I love the grandiosity and beauty of the Cascades and the PNW, I love that we have public transit that works to the point where my car is typically my last resort option for getting most anywhere. 

I do occasionally have regrets about it, like if I were back home I could be doing more to make it the home I wanted it to be and the home I could be proud of.

I grew up as a Mormon in Idaho Falls and went to BYU-Idaho for undergrad. So I'm happy to have left those parts behind. 

Upstate New York is a pretty good balance of things I find important. The cost of living is much lower here than the big cities, but since Albany is the capital of a pretty blue state it is also pretty blue itself. And I am still close to nature with the Adirondacks and the Catskills.

"Haven't left yet but since I am disabled the last 2 years have been hell for me.

And I've put off more scans and exams than I should have because I was worried about staff not wearing masks. 

We're considering moving to the Bay Area, or at least within driving distance. So expensive, and it'll be very hard for us, but at least I'll be able to go to the doctor safely again. We might just go for a year or two until my various creaky body parts get duct-taped back together a bit better and then reassess. Long-term I'm not sure if we could afford the Bay Area, but I can't afford to not get medical care anymore either.

"The police unions provide cover for abuse. You think that wouldn't make a bunch of pretty decent people behave badly but bear with me. I used to work in the juvenile Justice system for the state of NY (OCFS) and the guard Union was incredibly powerful. Very wealthy and could afford great lawyers. As a result every politician in the state of New York had to have their support to really run a successful campaign. That meant that the director of the facility had to have the approval of the Union to get his job. That meant that all of his assistant directors did as well. It meant that if a recently hired high school graduate complained against their boss their boss stood a very significant risk of losing their job.

I witnessed several times a day (And I mean at least!) guards beating children, often until they bled. I was hired as a guard and I witnessed this and I reported it. The subsequent time in that facility I faced so much opposition that I was constantly at risk of firing. The camera security officer was a friend of mine and he informed me that he was supposed to keep records of all of my behavior to pass along for review so they could fire me. This was illegal since the cameras aren't allowed to be used to surveil the guards, as per the Union. I found it almost impossible to get a promotion though I was ranked in the top 5% in the state for the civil service job that was the next step up. I did get promoted because I found a workaround where my interviewing and hiring process for the next position up was done by another facility where my betrayal of the brotherhood of guards was not known. I got threats, I had groups of people refusing to work with me, and I had people telling me over and over again that I should quit.

Eventually I did quit. It turns out you can't change an evil system like that from the inside.

The police have a union that is much more powerful than the union of those guards. Most of the police you hear about getting fired get rehired because of their union. Their records are scrubbed over and over again. And any good cop who reports a bad cop gets driven out of their department. Good cops don't stay good cops or they don't stay cops.

If we did away with the police unions I could see the police becoming a force for good over the course of a decade or two. They would also have to do away with Grossman's killology course, and certain other practices. They would have to start sending mental health professionals on calls involving mental health. Most domestic disturbances don't require a police presence if there is a mental health professional present.

This is worth looking into. You take for granted that police are a force for good, but the evidence is not there to support that idea. The amount of crimes they solve is within the margin of error and the number of people they shoot who are laying face down on the ground is above 20% of all of the police shootings. Many neighborhoods see them as a violent fascist organization run by a government that hates them, and there isn't any evidence to convince those communities otherwise.",t2_50pn368u,Notdennisthepeasant,0,1648167753.0,0,t1_i2049cz,i2049cz,False,SadElkBoy,t3_tmwjwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/tmwjwp/alleged_sexual_drug_crime_misconduct_what_we_know/,"Alleged sexual, drug crime misconduct: What we know about the FBI investigation of Caldwell Police Department",/r/Idaho/comments/tmwjwp/alleged_sexual_drug_crime_misconduct_what_we_know/i2049cz/,3,r/Idaho,0,3

"Late to this conversation. It’s unfortunate that people are so mislead about water allocation. They read a few sensationalized pieces about water usage and almond production, then create misinformed opinions. What product constitutes the bulk of almond demand? It’s plant based dairy and beef alternative products (eg, milk, yogurt, meat substitutes, cheeses, etc). What happens as a result of the increase in the consumption of these products? Demand for cow products decreases. Do some superficial googling and you can find endless stats about the deficit in dairy milk consumption today due to plant based milks (of which almond is the majority constituent). What uses more water, per serving, almond trees vs. dairy farms, or feeds hard, or cattle pasture? Beef and dairy require many TIMES the water usage that almonds require, while contributing substantially to the release of methane, a major contributor to climate change. One serving of almonds: 23 gallons, while an 8 oz steak requires 900 gallons, and a glass of dairy milk requires 55 gallons. If you’re concerned about water, almonds should rank WAYYY down on the list of priorities. Eggs, pork and chicken use far more water. I’m not saying it’s realistic to replace all of these items with exclusively plant based products. Nor am I claiming there aren’t issues with almonds. I’m only pointing out that if your argument concerns environmental impact and water consumption,you’re on the wrong side of the data. You can’t look at figures on gross usage and conclude, “this is an intolerable environmental liability.” Because the reality is that you still need to feed the world, and plant based products offer a shot at doing that in a more sustainable way than conventional meat and dairy farming. Instead, you have to contextualize usage. What is it replacing? How eco friendly is the replacement? If there are more efficient and conservation oriented alternatives, are they going to be palatable, etc.. it’s easy to be idealistic and complain about water usage, it’s something else entirely to do some research and create an informed opinion. The world has to eat, and plant products like almonds are an increasingly large percentage of international diets, which has a net positive environmental effect when compared to those same calories consumed in animal protein form. Please do some research.

I'm always polite and respectful to officers, but I was unconstitutionally detained and bullied by the Shoshone sheriff in 2016. Just from our interaction I could tell that he was a power-tripping, abusive, and manipulative bully. I told everybody that I knew that he was ""bad on the inside"" and to watch out because they would see some day, either when he shoots some innocent person or makes up charges against them or someone they know.

It turned out it was just that he was raping his stepdaughter...

One of my close friends was raped by a cop from Canyon county. I wouldn't be surprised if they find that the Caldwell Police are as bad as any gang there.

"To be clear, the “6 weeks” deadline is basically meaningless. It’s a red herring to muddy the discussion. 

It’s 6 weeks “gestational age,” calculated from the last day of the prior menstrual cycle. 

It is NOT 6 weeks after conception, and certainly not 6 weeks after a positive test. Women have NO time to make any informed decisions.  

If your last period ended ~4 weeks ago, and you get pregnant just before the next one would start (btw sperm can remain viable for up to a week or so after sex), regardless of the *actual* date of conception you are *already* considered 4 weeks pregnant on the day you conceived. 

It then takes another [~6-12 days before the pregnancy hormone HCG shows up *at all*](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/how_soon_will_a_pregnancy_test_read_positive/article_em.htm ) in urine for a pregnancy test to detect. 

It can take up to 3 weeks after conception for it to reach levels for a *reliable* test result, especially if you have an irregular cycle. 

So because of the rather arbitrary way gestational age is calculated, and because it takes weeks beyond conception to confirm any pregnancy, most women are *already* likely at or beyond 6 weeks at the very earliest possible time they could know.

That makes this a de facto ban on all abortions *regardless* of gestational age.

The “heartbeat” aspect (it’s not a “heartbeat as there is no damn heart yet) is nonsense as well, but it’s not really detectable until 6 weeks either. Both measures are basically irrelevant. 

Going beyond all that - it takes 12 weeks before you can do the newest, fastest genetic testing for potentially fatal birth defects (which insurance might not even cover w/o extenuating circumstances like age or known risk factors). 

This law means that a woman whose fetus has fatal trisomy will be forced to carry it until it dies and threatens her life w/sepsis, or carry it to term for another ~5 months, deal with the physical difficulty and anguish of everyone asking about a doomed pregnancy, pay $8K and risk her life to give birth, and then bury a dead baby anyway within hours or days even though everyone knew months earlier it was never going to survive.",t2_1pny6ssk,ShenmeNamaeSollich,0,1648095387.0,0,t1_i1w3vi7,i1w3vi7,True,Maxcactus,t3_tldzd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/tldzd8/idahos_law_like_texas_would_ban_most_abortions/,"Idaho's law, like Texas, would ban most abortions after about 6 weeks",/r/Idaho/comments/tldzd8/idahos_law_like_texas_would_ban_most_abortions/i1w3vi7/,10,r/Idaho,0,10

And the differential cost is really not that much.

"I'll give some insight as a new resident of Pocatello.

We moved here last summer from Washington, DC for my wife's new job at the University. We have a house in the University neighborhood and love the diversity (friendly neighbors, students here from all over for school, pride/diversity flags, etc). If they are Mormon, I don't know it. I'm sure I've met a Mormon, but it was never brought up. No one has asked us about our religious affiliation, which we have none anyway. When not working we spend most of our time in the outdoors, it's an amazing area for that. I would say if it wasn't for the outdoor opportunities and being in a University area, though, I probably would not live in this town. As a very liberal person, I've never had any issues with any of the residents. We mostly keep to ourselves, however.

I drive for a delivery company that covers a ton of the SE area. Outside of Pocatello it seems pretty freaking depressing. The small ""towns"" are downright sad in my opinion.

"Idaho code 18-310 only provides the possibility of having your gun rights restored after having lost them due to the felony conviction.  As you correctly point out, the code section allows you to ""get your gun rights back.""  You only need to ""get them back,"" or have that right restored, if it was previously taken away, which is what happens automatically in every felony conviction.  Further, I.C. 18-310 does not automatically restore gun rights at a later date.  That restoration must be sought from the court.  18-310 makes it possible for the court to grant such a request, but it is not guaranteed.  The loss of said rights on conviction of a felony or any charge of domestic violence in Idaho is, however, automatic.",t2_3baa74n0,burningmill69,0,1648068312.0,0,t1_i1uf366,i1uf366,False,coolguysteve21,t3_tjgka8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/tjgka8/ammon_bundy_is_a_genuine_threat_to_idaho_and/,Ammon Bundy is a genuine threat to Idaho and needs to be taken more seriously.,/r/Idaho/comments/tjgka8/ammon_bundy_is_a_genuine_threat_to_idaho_and/i1uf366/,1,r/Idaho,0,1
