"I work at NMT and live outside Socorro. 

A vehicle isn't mandatory *in-town* but having some sort of motorized transportation *is* mandatory to be able to get to things not in town. Zenovah's answer is pretty well spot-on: If you want to go out to eat and have something other than the standard trifecta (pizza/burgers/mexican food), you need to get up to Albuquerque. Same with any shopping beyond what you can get at the World's Worst Walmart Supercenter™ (the Socorro Walmart). I ride a motorcycle probably 80 percent of the time for both commuting to work and for getting small amts of groceries/pet supplies/etc from Belen or Los Lunas or Albuquerque. 

Socorro is pretty safe, except for the areas around Hwy 60 on the south edge of town. Granada street and so forth seem to be where the police action is heaviest, per the reports in the weekly local newspaper. We do have a not-insignificant problem with drug addiction here, so we have a problem with petty ""crimes of opportunity"" -- meaning don't leave things unattended or unlocked or they'll disappear to help somebody get their fix. 

Tech students tend to make their own fun. LAN parties, intramural sports teams, clubs, outdoor stuff like rock climbing, hiking, cycling, etc. The Capitol Bar (located on Socorro's Plaza) is open again, and now has an outdoor patio where you can eat as well. Lots of older Techies and staffers hang out there, and there's a microscopic local music scene there where the musically-inclined locals play pretty regularly. The current NMT president resurrected the local movie theater, and it focuses mostly on new releases, but occasionally shows older stuff for money-raising.

As far as ""looking like an outsider,"" not to worry: we have students from literally around the world and across the 50 states. The pace of life here may be slower than you're accustomed to, though.

"People are focusing on the sex and race thing and that is understandable. However, I also object to even segregating people based upon academic majors. On average, a person changes their academic major three times in the course of their undergraduate years.

It's going to be a lot more difficult for students to change majors if they feel like they have to give up on their family (so to speak) to do so.

The downfall of that whole feeling at New Mexico tech was when they started the fraternity there. I fought hard against it my senior year. There was a whole meeting about it, I expect much like this meeting about the segregation. The fraternity tryied to tell us why it was such a good idea and how it would be inclusive to everybody, anyone could join. I, as a woman, stood up and said ""Can I join your fraternity?""

"I lived in Carlsbad for 3 years.  
* The summer gets quite hot. Above 100 most days from may-august iirc. Not much rain, but when it does rain there’s a lot and most streets in town flood because there are only 2 storm drains (one friend flooded her engine). Pretty lightning storms. Winter through spring can get pretty windy and chilly, though rarely gets below 20s. Rarely get snow in town, but can get some up in the mountains that melts by end of the day.  
* I never had any issues with crime, can’t recall my friends having issues either. That’s not to say it isn’t there though. Drugs are an issue, just like anywhere else. Just need to be smart and watch out for yourself.  
* Not sure about insurance price (never switched my plate to NM lol). But I can tell you that SE NM and West TX drivers are some of the worst I’ve ever encountered. You have to be very careful and defensive whenever you drive around. Lots of oilfield guys in big ass trucks and semis that drive aggressively.  
* There’s not much to the town honestly. They have some good family small restaurants, but not much to do there. Blue House Bakery is good. They have a zoo, movie theater, a couple bars. The towns within an hour of Cbad (Hobbs, Artesia, Roswell) are small too. So you pretty much have to drive to El Paso to go to a city (2.5 hrs away). Or ABQ is about 4 hrs away. People say bad stuff about El Paso, but I always enjoyed taking a day to go there and shop or get some good food. I like ABQ even more. They have good museums and food. People talk about crime there too, but again just be smart when you’re there.  
* There are a lot of good places to check out nearby. Carlsbad Caverns NP, Guadalupe Mountains NP, Lincoln NF. Plenty of places to go hiking, camping, off roading. Highly recommend trying out caving, as there are world class caves in the Guadalupe Mountains. You can take ranger guided cave tours at Carlsbad Caverns to get started. ABQ has some cool museums and good restaurants. Petroglyphs National Monument is awesome. I think Santa Fe is kind of over rated. Lots of expensive stuff. But Meow Wolf is a must see. The Turquoise Trail between ABQ and SF is cool. You go through an artsy town called Madrid. Stop by Tinker Town. Chaco Culture National Historical Park is out of the way in NW NM but really awesome. Cloudcroft has some fun hiking and is on the way to White Sands National Monument.  
* Centipedes. I hate them and they sometimes get in your house. Had a couple cockroaches once. Didn’t really have many pests though. You may find a small scorpion every once in a while. Vinegroons are nasty looking but harmless. You’ll probably see lots of millipedes and tarantulas on the highway in the morning. I think I only saw 3 maybe 4 snakes when I was there.  
* I found TDS to be reliable. But I did have issues trying to get money back from them when I was moving and trying to cancel service. Was on the phone for 2 or 3 hours.  
* I had ATT and didn’t really have issues.  
* Not sure about recipes.

"Do you happen to live in Sierra County? I do.  I’ve also lived in Las Cruces and Albuquerque, as well as working in several other NM cities. I have a pretty good handle on the county I live in.

There are approximately 12,000 residents in the entire county (which is the largest land mass county in the state); more than 50% are snowbirds (who don’t vote here) and under 18’s. RARELY is there an election for anything that more than 50% of the remaining populace votes.

I am neither R nor D and the last election results for the county were a direct result on MLG governorship then the actual presidential race. Previously the county voted about 50/50 in most elections as there are many outlanders who move and switch residencies.
Having the answer is NOT the same as knowing the answer. 

Anywho, Sierra County is a good midway point for traveling to other areas/states with it being equidistant between two major airports; people ride bikes (motorcycles and two wheelers) most of the year and most(ly) residents get along.

"**[Gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop)** 
 
 >The Gish gallop is a rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm their opponent by providing an excessive number of arguments with no regard for the accuracy or strength of those arguments. The term was coined in 1994 by anthropologist Eugenie Scott, who named it after American creationist Duane Gish and argued that Gish used the technique frequently when challenging the scientific fact of evolution. It is similar to another debating method called spreading, in which one person speaks extremely fast in an attempt to cause their opponent to fail to respond to all the arguments that have been raised.

"What do I know about Socorro?

I know it's grocery store options are limited. I couldn't find curry. I know they didn't have a lot of things but due to blocking out the experience can't remember specifics. I do remember thinking the processed carb region vs fresh veggie section  was like Costco vs a small time drug dealer.

I know my PCP there was not very good. She was not interested in a rash I developed to the point she didn't even check it (turns out severe lactose and gluten intolerance) additionally she informed me my ears were the cleanest she had ever seen in her time practicing there. When I asked why she worked there she explained it was purely for loan forgiveness and she wouldn't be there otherwise. 

I know my psychiatrist there was a paternalistic dick. Informed him I didn't want kids and he said ""well you don't right now, but what does your husband think?"" Also suggested a medicine to raise my libido to ""make my husband happier"" I'm the one with depression. I want to be happier. 

Other fun facts: 
Pedestrian walk score of fuckin none unless you're on the campus. Tried to walk about one day for coffee and a snack. Cross walks didn't exist in places and others no sidewalks. Excellent. 2/10 walkability. 
Sad related story. Legit saw a woman in a wheelchair just scooting along in traffic as there was no other place for her to be. People honked at her. 

Socorro Electric has one star on Google. That's too generous. They were insufferable asses. Rude. Incompetent. Shout out to the lady I called Blonde Big Hair, who told me over the phone I didn't need a piece of paper work- I drove 40 miles only to be told to come back because I didn't bring it. I then did bring it and was informed I couldn't do what I needed to get done as it was under my husband's name and not mine, we have different last names, this was anathema to her. 

People would ask me what I did for work. When I told them I worked in COVID, they would immediately start railing on about how it's fake. I started telling people I was a housewife. This was 100% accepted. 

I know there is one good bar. If you get a spot outside you can listen to all of the shitty exhaust modifications as they rev up and down the street. Very relaxing. Sometimes strung out people yell at you through the fence.

I went to the one thrift store that's reliably open. I found used undies with literal shit in them. Prices are excellent though, minus the hepatitis risk.  

Overall what I know is that if you are thinking of moving there, you should stop thinking about that. 

The college is excellent. But I did not run into a single person who went there who had intentions of staying. 

But. If you're looking to spend a fun 3 - 5 hours there I suggest the Capitol Bar and a Blake's Burger. 

Sorry sorry. One last hilarious parable. 

I went there for a burger with the works. Heard a Convo between employees panicking about being out of tomatoes. They responded that they would think of something. 

What they thought of was beans. 

I got beans. On my burger. That was their solution.

"Horrible horrible horrible place. I just escaped after a year of living there and you couldn’t pay me to go back. 

I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a more concrete example of “brain drain” in a community. Pretty much everyone of any talent leaves and so the town is left with the dregs. It seemed liked everyone from the power company people, to the county, to the doctors, to the fucking local state farm insurance branch (shout out to Damien Ocampo’s State Farm office) were not only incompetent  but exceedingly rude (this criticism doesn’t extend to the service industry folks, by and large they seemed friendly enough). 

There may be a wal mart and a John brooks but make no mistake, this is a food desert. In the fall there are a couple awesome farm stands to go to but other than that, have fun finding anything healthy without driving to ABQ or Los Lunas. 

The bosque is cool, as is San Lorenzo canyon and the Magdalenas and there are a few good restaurants. The capital bar is really cool and Sofia’s has amazing red Chile. the buckhorn bar (near the bosque) has one of the best burgers I’ve ever had. 

if you’re into biking there are a plethora of farm roads and two-tracks that traverse the green belt along the Rio grande and these are super beautiful. Just make sure you have slime tires and a pump for the goat heads. and look out for all the vicious dogs (people seem to be cool with letting them roam free to maul passerby’s). 

But yeah, that’s pretty much it. Endless fast food chains, No book stores, no drug stores, horrible aggressive drivers (and just aggressive people in general), and nothing to do.

Finally, we’ve never seen a place with such rampant aggression towards women. My partner (who always dresses conservatively) was routinely cat called, honked at, and gawked at in stores. All because she was a girl in her twenties. I don’t think there was a single time that she went to town and didn’t come back with a new horror story. 

I know this extremely negative take on Socorro won’t win me any points here. It’s clear I’m bitter about the place. But our experience was JUST. SO. BAD. Obviously socorro had some positives and we met plenty of kind people but all in all, I can confidently state that Socorro is one of the many butt-hole towns tha pockmark the American southwestern landscape.

As others said also stay out of washes or any drainage even in a campground. Seen more than one tent floor get water soaked.in a small gully in a campsite or someone didn't stake and or.tie down a tent well enough and get blown apart.
Use decent tent stakes also. I am cheap and the longer heavier ones from Harbor Freight work well enough. I use longer stakes at least on the corners depending on weather and soil.
Also the heavy thunderstorms don't reply last long. Like afternoon early evening. Blast though hard and over.fairly quick. Pre drought also get heavy rain over night and.morning but usually not destructive. Put tent on a good non flood spot and full rain fly just enjoy the rain on the tent. Except for now a better winter tent most of ours would be considered cheap but ok. Full rain fly and extra tie down points but nothing special.
Plus it most likely will be hot by June. Make sure campsite has access to water and or carry more than you think you will need.

"I live on the east coast but spend a lot of time in New Mexico (3 months/ year) because of my family here. Not only is New Mexico incredibly different than New York, it’s just completely different than the rest of the country. As someone familiar with both places here are my answers:
1. You absolutely need a car for a decent quality of life. There is public transportation in some cities but relying on it fully would be a hard way to live. This is not a state built for living on public transport. Plus one of the best parts of NM is natural beauty so if you can get out of the city, for which you need a car, you will want to.
2. Yes. Shouldn’t generally face problems. 
3. Compared to NYC, very. 
4. Yes but take some time- maybe visit before moving- to get to know the culture. NM is a majority minority state with a large Native and Latino population, so if you are moving here from out of state I think it’s worth learning about all of the culture, history, and current political issues of the state.

"Can only speak on Albuquerque as I haven’t lived anywhere else in the state. 
1. No, the public transportation is not good at all compared to New York, we have a bus system that is free but you’d have to factor in all the extra time, changing buses, etc which can add a lot of time to a trip that’s 15 mins by car. 
2. Albuquerque is a pretty lgbt friendly city from what I’ve seen so far. Never really seen anything super hateful and most people I know here are pretty accepting. 
3. Again, can only speak on Albuquerque, but recently the housing market has been crazy, for example it took me about 4 months of searching to find an apartment that fit my budget and neighborhood requirements. Rent is pricier in abq than it is in a lot of other places but compared to NY it isn’t bad if you’ve got a professional job.

"So here is the first part of the grift- Govt funds used to pay these asshats: 'The county, which borders Texas and has about 67,000 residents, agreed this year to pay nearly $50,000 to EchoMail, 

The second part of the grift is that a group attached to notorious piece of trash Lin Wood is also fund raising off this in the standard GOP style 'OMFG there wa$ election fraud and we need your help to $top it! Plea$e Donate!'

Imagine being such notorious scammers that you would bring your GOP group to a strong GOP county that voted for trump and scream election fraud to defraud a broke ass county in a broke ass state filled with your own broke ass constituents to sheer you sheep for even more money.

"Yea, a car is needed for the most part. Unless you get lucky and find a job close to where you live. Compared to NY though the public transportation isn’t very good. 

Santa Fe is lgbt friendly as well as the other major cities but really small rural areas of NM not so much. That isn’t to say it’s dangerous, just that you might not be welcomed if you show up in a rainbow flag suit singing show tunes. 

Santa Fe is the cultural art capital as well as being the actual state Capitol. It is expensive to live in Santa Fe compared to other parts of the state but not as expensive as NY. It isn’t easy to get an apartment in Santa Fe but it is very easy to get an apartment in surrounding cities. It can still be done but start looking now. Look at Cerillos and Madrid as well as Los Alamos, and Pojoaque.  Rio Rancho and Albuquerque are also good options and much cheaper then Santa Fe. I don’t know in what part of the state you want to live but if you are interested in art then I assume Santa Fe. 

Yes it is fine that you are monolingual. Knowing Spanish would help but this is America after all where a majority of the population only speak English, you’ll be fine.

Oh pros include lots of open space, beautiful country, cheap living if you chose the right areas, good food, culture and lots of it, diversity, New Mexico is sort of the Wild West, you can do what the fuck you want and people leave you alone. 

Cons. All of the above If you aren’t into that sort of thing. We do have crappy infrastructure and lots of poverty.

"The CBOC system in NW N.M. has been deserted pretty well for over 2 years. There are virtually no in-person appointments, all have been swung to telephone calls which they call telehealth, but are only  useful for prescription renewal.  Other than getting lab draws done I don't know anyone actually stepping foot into clinics.  It's like a ghost town, no cars on the patient parking, but employee parking is full. At this point closing the actual clinic and transferring phone duties to offshore call centers in India would be probably as productive. Personally I have not physically seen a VA physician in over 2 years, just phone calls every 6 months asking how i'm doing and do I have enough pills.  Being over 70 and having a host of old age problems it can be discomforting to after years of actual VA healthcare to again rely on the emergency room for  healthcare again when things go bad. It would probably be better to be swung over to medicaid instead of healthcare for veterans that doesn't exist anymore.

Given you were over 10% of the speed limit, I'm guessing $150 - $200 (probably closer to $200...maybe more?). Realize Texas counties can be slow to process the ticket (personal experience with more than one speeding ticket in Texas). So keep calling back over and over if you have to. Don't give up thinking they forgot about you; they didn't. They're just slow and will want their $$.",t2_egpjv,chilebuzz,0,1647485924.0,0,t1_i0z09ji,i0z09ji,True,7t3ee,t3_tf47nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewMexico/comments/tf47nd/what_to_do_after_getting_the_first_speeding/,What to do after getting the first speeding ticket?

"*really keen on staying the night at cosmic campground and look at the stars*
 
Sadly, this is not a great idea anymore. In hindsight, I think that naming it ""Cosmic Campground"" was a marketing blunder. It now attracts two different kinds of cultures each valuable in their own right but which don't mix well together. The first is the star-gazer crowd that hears the word ""cosmic"" and thinks of bringing their red tinted flashlight and their photography equipment. The second is the hippie crowd that hears the word ""cosmic"" and thinks ""far out, man"" and thinks of playing Bob Marley and doing reefer. 

I used to go. I won't anymore. Not worth the drive to hear someone playing Buffalo Solider at 2AM. I hear occasional reports back from people who still get positive experience there but it seems hit or miss. For one night, to go that far out of the way, seems to me so not worth the effort when there are plenty of places in NM to see the stars.

"I'd like to add that there are several spots along the road where the dune slopes gradually down towards the roadway.

This is because as the dunes are blown across the desert floor, the sand from the downwind side gets blown up and over the crest of the dune. That gives the  backside of the dune a more gradual slope.

At those spots you can easily walk up the gradual rise of the dune on fairly compressed sand.

"Actually I heartily recommend chaotic exploration, lol. The rangers will hand you a map at the gate, and can give much better advice than I regarding specific destinations, but I definitely prefer to just drive around and see where the road takes me! It’s honestly equally beautiful - as many times as I’ve been I still don’t have a favorite spot. I would say be sure to drive in kinda deep - no risk, signs everywhere, and well-patrolled by rangers. I think lots of visitors feel unsure about going further into the park, so tend to cluster near the entrance, so it can be a little crowded.

"You’ll be shocked by how developed the dunes are. You can drive very far in and still be seeing tons of signs, picnic areas, bathrooms, and large parking areas. The roads are actually made of packed sand from the dunes, so they don’t break the scenery of the dunes up like blacktop would, so that’s pretty cool. Good advice above, just wanted to add my input that you can honestly have a very cool experience from your car, and just get out to stick your toes in the sand and snap some photos if you like. I’ve been several times with people who had some mobility issues, and they still loved it. Highly recommend witnessing sunset there if at all possible - the dunes tuning pink is worth seeing irl!

"There is a path to drive through the dunes. Except at the very beginning, as you go in, you'll have dunes on both sides of you, and there are various parking areas. Generally the farther you go in, the less people you have around you that'll be in your photographs. 

The Alkalai Trail is 5 miles round-trip and goes up and down the dunes as well. It's near the amphitheater, so you can drive to it, but you'll get something close to the same thing around the dunes itself. If you go into and walk up the dunes, you'll generally be close to the car due to the various parking areas.

The harder part would be getting up the dunes to get pictures. It can be slippery and for every footstep up, you'll slide down some, but some are more gradual than others. 

Also, even on cooler days, the sun bounces off the Sands, so you need good sun protection and bring lots of water. I'd bring towels to wipe off any sand you get on your feet after you empty out your shoes, and maybe an extra pair of socks, at the least.",t2_7qa39p13,gracefulbluemorning,0,1647071176.0,0,t1_i0cgzig,i0cgzig,True,[deleted],t3_tcavae,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewMexico/comments/tcavae/first_timer_question_about_white_sands/,First timer question about White Sands,/r/NewMexico/comments/tcavae/first_timer_question_about_white_sands/i0cgzig/,15,r/NewMexico,0,15
