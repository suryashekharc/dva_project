"I'm pretty sure OP hasn't been paying attention (since I know OP has not read a single Hawaii State legislative Act or a county ordinance), but the ""powers that be"" have been actively taking actions that increase the cost of living.

It isn't a secret that nearly every single place with a high cost of living is also a place with economic opportunity and high paying jobs. Conversely, the places with the lowest cost of living, like Mississippi, are terrible places to live, have low paying jobs, have poor economic potential, experience bad healthcare, and a have population with a lower standard of living.

The ""powers that be"" have been trying to develop Hawaii's economy. Trying to [increase the percentage of college graduates](http://55by25.org/about/), increase the [number of high tech companies in Hawaii](https://www.htdc.org/), develop the [film industry (which has lots of high paying jobs)](https://filmoffice.hawaii.gov/), develop [Hawaii's energy sector](https://energy.hawaii.gov/), keep [Hawaii's #1 health care ranking](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/health-care), and doing a host of other things that make Hawaii a better place to live, which, incidentally, raises the cost of living.

Of all the islands in the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii has one of the highest standards of living. Let's thank the ""powers that be"" for that.

So yeah, if OP really wants ""the powers that be"" to decrease the cost of living, they should cut the funding of UH and the public school system, kill all the tech companies, destroy the film industry, repeal the renewal energy tax incentives, shut down the Hawaii Health Systems Corporation, de-fund the Department of Health, and otherwise make Hawaii a miserable places to live.

"Heh, you might as well have just called me out, although I don't use the sources you mentioned in your original post.  


>Someone comparing the monarchy to some tyrannical oppressive government

The monarchy was anti-democratic and corrupt.  The system prior to the monarchy was tyrannical and oppressive.  You're wrong for pretending neither of these things aren't true.  


>Excusing US actions because Kamehameha bad

It's not about the US actions being okay, it's about how because the Kingdom was founded on bloodshed and violence and how it's wildly hypocritical to cry foul and continue to do so after so much of the population values our current democratic regime.  It's wildly hypocritical to scream about injustice for a largely bloodless coup while the most venerated person in Hawaiian history is an absolutely piece of shit human being that tortured people and killed hundreds or thousands in his time.  


>Excusing US actions because someone else would have done the same

I guess that's not me.

&#x200B;

>Disparage Keanu Sai because FELON, all the while not even having an inkling into his dissertation/argument

He fucking tried to con poor Hawaiians.  You can't even condemn what he did your bias is so bad.  It was straight thievery.  You sit around screaming foul because people don't want to read a hundred page manifesto but that should only give you the advantage because you can explain it.  If you can't tell other people what the core arguments are and why they are valid, and just have to say, **read it,** then you don't understand what you're talking about or must somewhat accept that it isn't solid enough for you to pass it along in your own words.

&#x200B;

>Mention that Kalakaua “bankrupted” the kingdom

I don't believe you're not mostly familiar with the criticism of Kalakaua financial policies.  I understand why you choose to latch on to the bankrupt thing because you love to harp on something forever if it can't be proven, and proven with the sources you approve of.  I do use the term bankrupt loosely; I don't mean the Kingdom filed for chapter 11.  I mean he was financially devastating for the Kingdom and the Kingdom debt ratio is on record as being bad regardless of whether that fits the literal definition of bankrupt.  He was bad with finances, I dare you to say otherwise.

  
And as far as I know, I'm the only one squawking about Kalakaua's financial recklessness here, so yeah, you could have called me out in your comment.  


  
 

Again, the reason I'm even here saying what I say is because today, in the here and now, Hawaiian activism is actively trying to overturn democracy and hurt academic and scientific achievements.  You can't even walk down in to Pololu valley without an activist telling you that you don't belong down there if you're not Hawaiian.  And there's a huge amount of dishonestly involved to garner sympathy and that's what I'm trying to do, combat the dishonesty that builds the support used to attack science, democracy, and education.

"I don’t think those sources are too prevalent. Perhaps the arguments are more common, especially considering the general hostility to Hawaiian sovereignty on the sub.

I think the sub generally leans moderate liberal. For example, take the comments in this thread. Putting aside the prevalence of the sources or the arguments in the OP, it is absolutely absurd that commenters would argue that the above sources are valid, or by deflecting via pointing out Civil Beat’s biases, or by taking the above sources as seriously as Civil Beat. Obviously right-leaning sources can be intelligent and insightful and of course all sources have some sort leaning one way or another (a banal and obvious point), but it’s pure centrism to even put the above sources and Civil Beat on the same footing or to find some need to take the most misinformed reactionary content seriously just for the sake of looking at any issue from “both sides.” It’s like taking Breitbart at face value.

"You can’t “control” cost of living like you are saying.

Cost is in relationship to supply and demand, both with housing and goods.

Money is a complicated mechanism that is fundamentally broken if the issuing agent is not accountable.

Since COVID it has not been. Remember the COVID relief paycheck? More money in the system. 

Did that money result in more houses being made, or goods being made? Nope. Just paid the bills. Yet those dollars didn’t just vanish.

That means if someone paid rent with that relief fund (as an example) the landlord got through a month. That means they got that much closer to laying off their loan. When they go to a bank, let’s pretend now they can take out a HELOC, which means more money to use. Now imagine they use their HELOC to buy more food or heavens, even apply toward another investment property purchase or even remodeling.

For example, no amount of money should allow people to buy local property X Y Z. There’s no way to enforce that currently.

"Minimum wages don't just linearly scale everything upward though, they have a strong impact on people who were making close to the minimum (""hey, if minimum is now $18, I should be making $22"") and then dissipate as salaries rise.  I couldn't care less what the minimum wage is when negotiating my salary and the owners paying those minimum wage employees have been happy to see their profits keep rising while their labor costs stay flat.

If the rising tide lifted all boats, the minimum wage would be irrelevant, but it doesn't and we all know it.  Entry level employees at my company don't make the same salary they made in 2018 (or 2014 when the last update was passed), but for some reason we pretend that it's not a problem when entry level worker for lower paid positions do.

And frankly all the silly talk about $1000 gas is just failing to answer the basic question: If a person's full time work isn't supporting them, who is?  Parents shouldn't need to house their children into their 30's so the price of a Big Mac stays low.  The government shouldn't need to give fully employed people food stamps so Walmart doesn't have to pay them enough to eat.  No one working full time should be below the poverty line.

"I found the issue: You believe the powers that be want to actually change the system. Once you are at the top of the system you have little incentive to change it. that aside, things you can do to lower COL:

Repealing Jones Act is a start to lowering COL. Localizing production also helps.

Public transportation that isn't this HART rail project would have helped. I don't know if Boring Company tunnels are viable in Hawaii due to the rock... plus ancestor bones... but if it is viable it could solve so very many problems with traffic (and living location by effect).

Energy could be nearly free with mass solar and storage. There could be so much surplus you could subsidize electric for the entire state. But power companies won't want that. 

Taxing real estate several % higher if not owner occupied, and potentially blocking foreign investment would both alleviate the main COL.

Tourism/services is a terrible industry for high wages.. and that is the primary industry.

And the elephant in the room: expanding population out, not up.. need to shift folks away from Honolulu if you want affordable. and that means building in places Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) that Hawaiians absolutely do not want in those rural areas. Hawaii is popular for a reason and people want to move here. If other areas do not expand then COL will just keep rising in the places where people actually live.. and those condos will be rented out because of all the non-owner occupied.. which will just keep inflating costs.",t2_obrjp,PeteSampras_MMO,0,1648251157.0,0,t1_i24pjhf,i24pjhf,True,greenarrow118,t3_tnywiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/tnywiz/if_the_powers_that_be_know_that_col_is_getting/,If the powers that be know that COL is getting out of control why can't they do something about it?,/r/Hawaii/comments/tnywiz/if_the_powers_that_be_know_that_col_is_getting/i24pjhf/,1,r/Hawaii,0,1

"""slightly"" may have been a misnomer I guess.  It's actually a not useful word in this case :)

It's certainly more transmissible, but a decent chunk of that transmissibility is vaccine evasion, which they both have.  

I don't have a number - but it's BA.2 is certainly more transmissible than BA.1.  

And even 30% or 50%-60% more transmissible means.... what, exactly?  Like you can infected from one foot instead of two feet?  Or that it takes 5 minutes of exposure instead of 8?  I see the percentages bandied about, but I haven't seen something concrete into what those numbers translate to.

Bottom line is still true though - it's more contagious, but prior infection with BA.1 does provide quite a bit of protection.  

The numbers for US are weird.

Also, having recently relocated, it seems to me that wages here are significantly suppressed as compared to the same jobs on the mainland. In the seattle area I made $22/hr as a grocery store supervisor. Here, the same job, at the same company, at a store that does almost 3x as much business per day, wants to pay $19/hr.

"I would agree with OP that Hawaii Free press/Andrew Walden, can seem like a dubious source. It's often right or libertarian leaning and citations do show up frequently on Reddit. 

But as a person with my own center to left political leanings, I read the Hawaii Free Press every single day and I have for years. I read it because Andrew Walden is a hell of a newsman. He has sources that nobody else has; he connects the dots the way that few others do. He gets the story early and he mostly gets it right. He doesn't just bring you today's story, he brings you the links to all the stories leading up to today's development. He does it himself. One person. And if he adds his own critique, well it's his site and it's free, and I am more than willing to overlook the sarcasm in exchange for seeing content I might otherwise miss.

Yes, he frequently editorializes, and yes, I often don't agree with him, but hey - it's a real community service to have someone who puts out a comprehensive wrap of all relevant Hawaii state and county news on a daily basis. IMHO nobody else even comes close as an aggregator.

If you know where he's coming from it's easy enough to filter for his biases and you soon realize that this is one person who of his own volition and on his own dime brings us most of what we need to know about Hawaii every day, seven days a week - I'd say give the man his due - A BIG MAHALO. 

You don't have to like it or agree with his commentary to realize it's independent, useful and informative.

Even when I don't agree with HFP,  I marvel at Walden's dedication and the comprehensive nature of his coverage. Call him a rare bird, or an odd bird, or a little wacky at times, and OK, sometimes way off the deep end: but I tell you I read it all the way through every day for the breadth of his sources and the depth of original content and have for long time.

"It is a real challenge because “the powers that be” do not have control of all of the factors of the cost-of-living (COL). If you mean “government” — what goods or services from government do you want to give up or reduce to have lower taxes? There  is no incentive for for-profit businesses to lower prices unless there is a competitor forcing them to do it. It is interesting that here on Maui that Costco consistently has much lower gas prices but other gas stations exist and must be getting enough business to stay open… why? Maybe distance? There is competition but unless you are willing to take advantage it won’t help the your COL.

Housing cost? Rental cost? How much “country” are you willing to pave to create more housing? Are you willing to give up the “American Dream” of a single-family home on a suburban sized lot and accept higher density multi family housing? Even if we deregulate land use today (which can’t happen) it still takes years to build housing even under the fastest of fast-tracks. 

Goods? Hawaii is not suited for manufacturing except for items where this location makes raw material readily available and even then we are competing in a global market. Look at history — Hawaii was once a major producer of sugar. Now sugar has gone because other locations could produce it at a much lower price.  Even when we can compete, it is not for low cost items — have you priced 100% Kona coffee?

There is not much we can do about the COL… maybe the best we can hope is that families will switch to locally grown, healthier diets replacing our fast food addiction… but that takes time which is also a commodity that most are short of these days.

"AirBnB destroyed housing for Hawaii residents. And so did the fact that there is no strict housing regulation in place.

Step 1: If you don’t live and work here, you can’t own property nor housing. If you want to visit, stay at a hotel.

Step 2: Ban AirBnB. It led to the elimination of entire neighborhoods, plus it destroys small local businesses because AirBnB guests barely shop locally - just like cruise ship tourists.

Step 3: Strict price regulations. As we have learned, “the market” regulates nothing. However, strong and fair leadership does.

"Sure, but I’ll just address this one point before I do that. 

>They (universities) only deal with and teach things that are proven with qualitative/quantitative data.

This is objectively wrong. People studying humanities may try to incorporate empirical evidence to support their theories, but they’re mostly dealing with ethereal topics that can’t be empirically proven. For example, there’s no such thing as an objectively “correct” ethical theory, nor can you scientifically prove which sociological theory or philosophical school of thought is “correct”. 

Now then, on to

>political bias in university curriculum 

If you’re asking about specific courses, then you’re being too vague because every university in America has it’s own core curriculum.

If you’re asking about broader fields of study that most American universities cover, then Sociology is the most egregious. It has essentially become a crash course in Identity Politics. 

There are other forms of liberal bias in academia like professors interjecting their personal views/commentary into their lessons. If you like empirical evidence, then I suggest looking into the data on political viewpoints among American professors. I’d post some studies but half the time I post external links my comments are auto-removed.

The rest of your original comment is a great example of the type of bias that is pervasive in academia. It basically boils down to “I’m not biased, it just so happens that all my opinions are objectively correct”.",t2_i7uyp6q9,chunkywizard,0,1648228166.0,0,t1_i2369jn,i2369jn,False,laimonsta,t3_tncyvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/tncyvi/any_one_else_notice_the_over_representation_of/,Any one else notice the over representation of openly biased conservative non academic sources being cited in this sub?,/r/Hawaii/comments/tncyvi/any_one_else_notice_the_over_representation_of/i2369jn/,0,r/Hawaii,0,0

"IMHO unbiased sources are hard to come by since the dawn of the internet, where each one of us has a self edited byline in the comment section. Our  sources many times are no different. Sourcing 
our sources is time consuming and often ignored. 

We are all biased but don’t think we are. Franz Boaz tried to change that paradigm by recognizing cultural relativism, but it didn’t stick. The nuances of ethnocentrism have now been replace by blunt accusations of racism. Science is replaced by politics. Objective research gives way to cultural invention. My team can do no wrong, yours can do no good.

Rant over. My 2 cents: Free Press Hawaii is a cesspool of idiots. Grassroots institute should be called Astroturf Institute (fully funded btw by Koch Brothers Cato Institute. Civil Beat is ok but still mostly a compilation of opinion writers not investigative reporters. 

Conklin I’m not sure about. I have not followed his comments in Civil Beat that OP referenced. I know he likes to stick it to Kanaka Maoli by reminding them they are not indigenous and were the first colonizers of original Marquesan settlers.

"I've not noticed them, but I don't frequent this sub unless it hits home page.

BUT there has been, for quite a few years now, efforts by various groups to co-opt local subs and turn them into right-wing circle jerks.

[Here is a post detailing it on other subreddits](https://np.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/ln1sif/turning_point_usa_and_young_americas_foundation/h21ph7s/).

Basically the pattern I've seen

1) Post a fuck ton of crime news featuring minority suspects. This is low-effort, just go to the local news website, find a few, and submit links. Some subreddits will end up with ""New Posts"" being like half filled with crime stories from 2-3 users.

2) Quickly upvote these posts, and other posts that are obviously alt-right cum tributes. Reddit algorithms at least used to reward posts that quickly attracted upvotes (it seems to have balanced this out a bit now -- I think velocity of upvotes still counts, but there's a 'lag' on it now). This pushes it to the front page.

3) Use sock puppets to troll, disconcert, and waste time/effort/sanity of anyone that tries to dissent. Bullshit asymmetry principle applies here -- the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than is needed to produce it.

4) Trying to point this out will rapidly get sock puppets all exploiting plausible deniability, denying it, and viciously attacking anyone that tries to demonstrate it. The goal is to leave this unchallenged. Upvotes will stand, people will tend to ignore rather than downvote or not participate, people won't want to participate in fear of being downvoted or attacked. The result is the dogpiling by sockpuppets is multipled.

5) All of this culminates in creating a false appearance of a consensus in favor of the alt right. Dissenters become unwelcome, and the sub turns to alt-right circlejerking.

"Pretending right-wingers have a valid argument for a second... what, exactly, is it? With literally no hyperbole, right-wing politicians are openly embracing/courting white supremacists, racists, bigots, and anti-Semites. They're openly using Nazi symbolism and even the fucking salute. The shape of the stage at the last CPAC was a rune used on the collars of SS uniforms. They're not even being subtle. 

When they DO have power, what do they do with it? What do they build? What good do they do the people? What programs to they enact to uplift or protect people? Despite pretending to be for smaller government and against high deficits, *every single Republican regime in decades* has only ballooned the federal deficit. Clinton managed to eliminate it, Obama took a huge bite after Bush ballooned it, then Mango Unchained went right back to the usual bullshit. How can conservatives square objective history of crazy deficit increases with ""spend less?"" 

Why would anyone need to silence any conservative voice? They're fucking stupid and their arguments are almost always in bad faith. Just by letting them talk, people see how stupid they are - which is why they're overwhelmingly unpopular. In over 30 years, the GOP has only managed to win 1 general election. Why is that? Why don't they appeal to *the majority of Americans* and why must they resort to abusing systems like the electoral college and congressional approval to maintain power? It will forever be a mystery!

But please, get a grip.

>young progressives from extremely left-wing mainland universities

Generally, universities aren't left-wing. They only deal with and teach things that are proven with qualitative/quantitative data. There absolutely are left-wing students/lecturers, though?  There are, however, conservative Universities (usually the religious-based ones) that teach non-fact-based curricula - BYU relatively recently started teaching about the real age of the planet and evolution despite it contradicting religious doctrine. 

I also don’t understand what age has to do with reporting and political bias 

&#x200B;

>They also seem to have a weird anarchist/libertarian bias as well

Anarchy is a far-left ideology, and libertarianism is mid-right. But you just said that the reporters are left-wing, so your statement kind of contradicts itself.

">I think that's a pretty narrow minded academic viewpoint.

What exaclty does the term ""academic viewpoint"" mean?

Since this is all in regards to the argument on Hawaiian Independence., your fixation on ""morality"" and ""culture"" is strange since the arguments  of independence don't rely or either morality or culture. Thus it seems you are engaging in *whataboutism*, a logical fallacy, with regards to the argument of Hawaiian independence. Thus it would be apt to characterize your statement's as non-academic.

&#x200B;

>This "" only our matters at the time are relevant"" is the same logic Putin has toward the soviet union. WW2 wasn't the greatest catastrophe of 1900s, in his personal closed off view the collapse of the \* soviet union was the worst event to happen. He only cares for this specific event of history and not anything else going on in the world at the time or its influence, much like you are with Hawaii now in your argument. It's a narrow viewpoint on history.

This is an both a nonsensical and irrelevant comparison.  Putin's argument for control of Ukraine is based on nothing but personal desire/beliefs. Its not based on law.

&#x200B;

>The world was and always will be bigger than Hawaii. This is my biggest problem with Hawaii focused historians/ history buffs. They only care about what happened to it without any nuanced context of the world around them.

What exactly are Hawaiian History Historians ignoring?

Are you arguing that by stating the US is responsible for its own actions is in essence ""ignoring"" the the *broader* and more *nuanced* context of the world? if so, LOLOLOLOLOLOL

WW2 wasn't the greatest catastrophe of 1900s, in his personal closed off view the collapse of the * soviet union was the worst event to happen. He only cares for this specific event of history and not anything else going on in the world at the time or its influence, much like you are with Hawaii now in your argument.

The world was and always will be bigger than Hawaii. This is my biggest problem with Hawaii focused historians/ history buffs.

King Kamehameha is also irrelevant as his time. His version of Hawaii was a completely different political entity compared to the Hawaii that existed at the time of the overthrow and today. Is King Edward II relevant to Great Britain’s current political status?

World War II and Nazi Germany are also completely irrelevant to Hawaii’s political status.

The laws at the time of Hawaii’s “annexation” and modern laws that today’s current Hawaii exist under are both relevant.

There are laws that are viewed as immoral by today's standards. The point is we are saying ""all countries must abide by our countries laws because that's the right thing to do"". Back then more so to now is strong takes over the weak. 

The simple fact is the world of the time was completely different than it is today. Again I'll keep going back to Nazi Germany. That happened roughly 40 years AFTER the annexation of Hawaii which started ww2 and the us defended Hawaii during it.

"I know what molestation is and consent is. These concepts are not new but what I'm trying to get across is that the conquest of other weaker sovereign nations was the norm back then. Weaker nations get conquered by stronger ones. King Kamehameha conquered the other people of Hawaii. Was that considered molestation of those separated groups of islanders? Or was it conquest? We don't ever post of his ""moleststions"" or ""conquest"" which ever verb you choose. It's the same thing. People taking over other people. 

This has been the story of humanity. It's a very modern western idea that weaker countries in general deserve to be sovereign. Look at whats happening in current Ukraine.

Thats my point. Applying current western morals after grown up in the freedom few in the past and even today experience in a cherry picking fashion to what is right and what is wrong way back then without speaking to the whole concept of the world at the time misses context of the times and romanticizes what life was Actually like back then and gives a completely ridiculous characterization of history. It's viewing through one specific lense IMO leads to non nuanced discourse on the reality of that history and the world. 

I'll use your kissing example to illustrate my point and opinion so if you disagree id like to see your counter argument. If a wife back in the ww2 generation refused to be ""a good wife"" to as ridiculous as not giving regular smooching or sex she could be considered insane and put to an insane asylum. We also thought gay marriage should be illegal and Trans don't deserve any rights. This has all changed In our lifetimes. Our concepts of what is ok and not has and will continue to shift.

Molestation is about consent. The kingdom wanted the missionaries, they wanted the printing press. The kingdom did NOT want the overthrow or annexation.

Also yes all they are responsible for is the acceleration of literacy. The printing press would have made it to the islands eventually, but the missionaries were the first to bring it. Which is a noble achievement in and of itself, and something that their descendants should be proud of.

"Sandy Terzo
United Nations was created in 1943 yet had no type of international law until 1964. Here is ""A BRIEF HAWAIIAN HISTORY"" : The earliest trace of human activity in these islands is 1300 ad. For 400 years (1300-1700 ad) islanders from dozens of Pacific islands colonized the archipelago that came to be known as the Sandwich Isles. All natives were slaves of the Ali’i Tabu chiefs. Chief Kamehameha the 1st, John Young and Isaac Davies brutally conquered these islands with English canons, muskets and Chinese black powder (1790ad). Now 'King' Kamehameha made John Young the governor of Big Island and Isaac Davies his minister on Oahu. Kamehameha the 1st appointed Alexander Adams as the Commander of the Hawaiian Navy. He delivered shiploads of Sandalwood cut by native slaves to China. Kamehameha 2, his regents and all of the Ali'i ended the Kapu religions and removed all temples from all Islands (1820). The missionaries arrived shortly thereafter and combined all of their Austronesian dialects into one English 'Olelo' for the printing of a native newspaper. The Russians attacked (twice) along with France and England), thus the US/Hawaii protection treaties of have been in effect since 1826 to keep us safe. Kamehameha 3 created a Hawaiian Constitution which freed all native slaves and stated "" all men are equal in the kingdom regardless of race color or creed "". He created the three branches of government. (1840's) He created the Great Mahele land divisions where the chiefs own their kuleanas (land) and could sell them. Kamehameha 4 passed the Alien Land Sales Act. The Ali'i (elite) sold their kuleanas (properties) then moved to town or mainland. The Ali'i (lords) displaced the Maka'ainana and Kauwa (peasants) when they sold their lands. The native Hawaiians went to the royal schools and mainland universities. They became great, loggers, teachers, lawyers, doctors, road makers, shop owners, policemen, hotel owners, musicians, statesmen etc,, Kamehameha 5 created the 'unicameral legislature then died without an heir. Kamehameha the fifth left all power to the unified Nobles and Legislature. The legislature voted Lunalilo as the Chief executor of the constitutional republic. Lunalilo died after 1 year. The Nobles and The Legislature chose David Kalakaua as chief executor of the Constitutional Monarchy. Kalakaua signed into law and stood by his final Constitution of 1886. He brought the nobles into the legislature to ensure fairness in constitutional government. He created the building codes and health dept. He brought electricity and telescopes to the islands. He traveled the World encouraging people to move here to bring wealth and labor to the islands, He ceded land and sea to the USA at Pu'uloa and Pearl (1875) for a naval base and stationed Marines there to assist the Honolulu Rifles when the riots of the 1880's and 90's were too much for them to handle. The five noble kings and Prince Kuhio were annexationists who feared Japanese, Russian and Chinese Imperial aggression. David Kalakaua, a lawyer and 33rd degree Freemason passed away unexpectedly. After swearing an oath to the 1886 constitution The Nobles and The Legislature allowed his estranged sister, 4th proxy successor, twice exiled for revolution, Liliuokalani to assume the role as proxy monarch. Liliuokalani attempted to overthrow the incumbent government by secretly staging an armed rebellion against the legal government of the Hawaiian Islands. The days of 'absolute monarchs were 50 years past. Hawaii was a democratic republic at that point. The legislature of nobles and statesmen met for 160 continuous days to deliberate her crimes and impeachment. She without question broke the laws of the land and was sentenced 5 years for treason ( of which she served months in detention in her home). She willingly abdicated all claims of dictatorial powers and swore an oath to the Republic in the presence of her lawyers and family (see below). She received a large sum of money and properties and remained the governess of Oahu. All major countries , their consulates, ambassadors, kings, and presidents of the World sent letters of acceptance of the new Republic of Hawaii. The legitimate government Hawaii and the USA made powerful acts, treaties and joint resolutions towards a union. USA forgave all debts of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Prince Kuhio called for annexation and spent the last few decades of his life fighting for US Congress to pass his US/Hawaii Statehood Admissions Act which when finally accepted by the USA 93% of Hawaii's people's voted for and rejoiced in becoming the 50th state of the United States. The laws and government that the 5 noble kings (K3,4,5,Lunalilo, Kalakaua) created are still the form of government we have today. Since 1843 all men were equal and free in the kingdom. 'Hawaiian' is a multi-cultural nationality, not a race. A Hawaiian is any naturalized subject of the kingdom. All people were invited here by the kings. All big titles were signed by the kings. Equal and legal are all races of people in the Hawaiian Kingdom, Republic and State.

">Just to correct some popularized missed information. The Missionaries never created the written Hawaiian Language. To make a long story short, Hiram Bingham and Asa Thurston, who are credited for creating the written language, never actually EVER took credit for doing so. In fact they were both still using interpreters and were still unable to even say a basic prayer in the Language by the time the Piapa was created. The first source that gave them credit for the creation of the language was actually Lorrin Thurston, the orchestrator of the overthrow. 

I think this is Cherry picking calling all the benefits ""cultural exchanges"" while the rest is considered ""molestation"". We are talking about written language upon how history and culture is passed down. The printing press has been an absolute revolutionary invention. To simply say all it did was accelerate literacy I think is a completely unfair conclusion to the level of impact that technology has had. It revolutionized Europe but it is a minor cultural exchange to Hawaii? I don't view that as cultural exchange at all.

"The crux of the issue isn’t statehood. Its annexation.  Annexation is the international act of cessation of a country’s sovereignty.

The referendum that was held for crimea is not considered valid as it went against the Ukrainian constitution which required the vote of independence to be voted on by all of Ukraine.

Thus if Russia were to have legally/diplomatically acquired Ukraine it would have had to have made a treaty with Ukraine rather that crimea’s puppet government installed by Putin. Besides diplomacy the other option to acquire crimea would have been conquest. Ironically however, Russia adamantly denies that what they did was war.

">caning

It’s probably hyperbole to be honest. But US legalism in general is anti-thetical to Hawaiian culture. It’s creating laws that force tourists to “love it or leave it” that would solve that problem. Much of the rudeness is the destruction that comes with the traffic of people and it stems from an Imperial worldview and cultures that uphold xenoculture genocide in the name of faith or superiority. That’s why there’s names in rocks at every natural park. The fact that we have to play by US rules which devours other cultures for breakfast instead of ours is just one more strike on the 120 years of absolute hell and misery the oligarchs next door have performed on this country.

>materialism and plantations

I think we have to out of survival. There’s not enough housing with too many houses, there’s not enough land when three haoles own a good portion of the state, there’s not enough food when we are surrounded by the ruins of food production and the gods are being destroyed by a zeitgeist focused on attacking imperialism and replacing it with their own flavor of foreign derangement or Old Guard supporting the colonial status quo. We were a lot better off till 2001, that I think was the beginning of the end. Maybe when the C&H plantations fell apart in the 90s but I was too young to remember that. Maybe it was when they stuck a rifle in Queen L’s face and she didn’t want to see her people in a civil war by an aggressor that casually mentioned they would flatten Honolulu.

>sustainability 

I think an interesting question to pose about sustainability is where does the human and the land meet? A lot of people think sustainability can be solved with purely science and technology, yet it cant. That’s where you lead to situations like the Dust Bowl or the Sahara expanding exponentially when agrarian machinery was distributed. Yet local humans have lived there for thousands of years, and if they foolishly despoiled an area, they moved. Polynesians didn’t have that luxury so they tended to err on the side of sympathy for the land than profit and the ones that didn’t….well you’ve seen Easter Island right? So sustainability comes from technology, but it also comes from technology used by the people in a deep ecological understanding with their traditional land and how to care for it. So does sustainability start with the idea that the machine gods will fix everything, or with the belief that sometimes a people needs to ignore false gods and empty promises and threats and work there way up from there?

"Okay.  Her arrest usually refers to her actual arrest in 1895 vs the overthrow.  


This brief text on the wikipedia page is a little misleading as the people who orchestrated the overthrow were also Kingdom citizens.  But yeah, 160 marines were used to help give them power.  


But then you had a Republic of Hawaii, and her arrest in 1985 was by the Republic.  During this time the US was unwilling to annex Hawaii and it wasn't until the 1898 time frame that the US had a congress willing to annex Hawaii from the Republic of Hawaii.  


Where you get this all wrong is comparing this to an actual violent invasion of a democratic state in a military campaign.  That didn't happen.  Without internal forces tearing down the Kingdom from within the US would never had gotten involved and at no point did the US engage in military conflict to take over Hawaii.  


The transition of the Kingdom to the US also was a transition from an autocratic state to a democratic one, exactly the opposite of what would happen if Russia were to take over Ukraine.

"Actually your response is the stupid one, and is a clusterfuck of poor analogies. 

A voluntary 10% water reduction isn't even close to the same thing as your analogy.

Also, water usage by tourists is so small compared to local usage. They don't drink it. They don't water lawns with it. They don't wash their clothing (for the most part). Most hotel toilets use low-flow etc. 

Tourists are also the main economic source in the state, so you want no tourists? then nobody would be able to afford those 5 steaks either because 90% of the state will be out of work.

It's also offensive to imply somehow that tourists aren't allowed steak (or water!), as if tourists are inherently evil and take/steal things that don't belong to them...lol

People who think tourists are a problem, sorry - you're dead wrong.

Making tourism the only real economy in Hawaii, sure I agree that is a stupid thing to do. And should be fixed. But that isn't the question here, either.

"We actually are specialty vacation servants.  If Hawaii had one job, this would be it.   


Most of us work jobs we'd rather not have at all, this is life.  Personally, I find tourism great.  People are happy and contrary to what some people say here, the vast majority of them are not less nice or respectful, even the ones from the USA.  


People here many have biases against tourists for the following reasons:  


1. They encounter tourists as part of a job they wish they didn't have to do, sometimes a college job or a non-career job, so they have a negative bias inherent in all interactions involving that job.  What you might blow off elsewhere becomes a bigger deal emotionally when you're already unhappy about the larger situation.
2. People from elsewhere have a different culture so they can seem rude in intention when they really just require a foreign knowledge to read and understand properly.  People from the mainland are generally more direct than people in Hawaii; this can seem rude.  Or they don't do certain customs that locals are used to from other locals which can seem rude.
3. It's common to want to blame an out-group when you're frustrated.  Or when someone from a out-group upsets you, you tend to paint with wide strokes in a way you don't do with people from your own culture.
4. Tourists can be easily confused, get lost, or stop to do things we never would.  Some people don't seem to grasp they aren't here to act like us.

  
As ""speciality vacation servants"" we absolutely should conserve water if that's what necessary to reduce the impact on tourism.  I'd rather conserve water than be broke.  It's good practice now and then anyways.  We have life so effing good here and so many of us don't realize our privileged we are.  So few things like this happen here.

"First off, shame on you for trying to compare that comment to domestic abuse.    


Whether or not Hawaii could survive off of something other than tourism, you know, if we pretend we aren't one of the most physically isolated island chains, in the world, things don't simply change the moment you want them to.  


All the fantasy alternatives from becoming a commodity producer to suddenly being a hub of tech innovation requires years to decades of change  if they are possible at all.  If there's an alternative that will work, then some of this right investment has to be happening or there is at least some signs it will happen.  There is none.   


Being on a beautiful island that people like to visit is our only unique positive trait when it comes to be economically competitive.  To stray from these means we need to compete with everywhere else and we're inherently disadvantaged due to our remoteness.

"You called him Francis.  Ha.  

But to speak to the larger point you're making, I don't think we should be blaming the federal government for imposing in the way you're describing.  I totally understand and agree that the COLA and housing allowance for military members drives the prices of rentals up.  That is 100% true.  BUT that federal standard is based on a benchmark.  Someone in the government, funded by our tax dollars, did an analysis as to how much money it costs to live in Hawaii.  The underlying analysis for setting that housing allowance/COLA is probably pretty spot on.  

So I think, instead, we should be identifying the problem as people not being paid as much as they should be paid for their labor such that they can afford to have those minimum standards.  Or alternatively, the government is not providing enough assistance for residents to meet their increasing housing needs whether by appropriating funds for them or raising more revenue by taxing non-labor income (read:captial gains).  

It's not so much about greedy property owners.  The real problem is unrestrained capitalism (ie free markets in rental housing) in a desirable place like Hawai'i (which is advertised as a paradise on Earth) results in the ""pricing out"" of locals simply due to the number of people who seek to make Hawaii their home or retire here or what have you.  The housing allowance/COLA is a result of those market conditions moreso than vice versa.  And don't get me wrong it certainly contributes to and continues the problem of unafforable housing.",t2_3cml4,imapluralist,0,1648156229.0,0,t1_i1zd0cr,i1zd0cr,False,[deleted],t3_tmtx21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/tmtx21/is_this_tweet_accurate_on_the_views_of_hawaii/,Is this tweet accurate on the views of Hawaii Locals?,/r/Hawaii/comments/tmtx21/is_this_tweet_accurate_on_the_views_of_hawaii/i1zd0cr/,3,r/Hawaii,0,3

"I was just thinking about this, it’s something that’s popped into my mind a few times. My question is - what would happen to Hawaii if tourism/military activities were shut down completely starting midnight tonight? What would we do to stimulate the economy? Would people pack up and leave for better jobs/lives? 

I just see people often yelling “don’t come here”, but at the same time, what do you (the people talking about it)  propose takes the place of employment in tourism/military? Especially when we look at the cost of running a business here - (cost of shipping materials, products etc etc.) 

I also often think of all these small tourist directed businesses - ex. the guy who runs surfing lessons on the west side (this is a hypothetical), the guy who runs snorkeling, the guy who does boat tours. Obviously those of us who live here are never (at most, rarely) going to use these services. What happens to these tourist/military only based businesses? Where do we shuffle them in in terms of employment? What happens to our already struggling native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders/etc in terms of employment??

I hate tourism too, I hate the way people approach/treat endangered (and not) wildlife, I hate how (some) tourists treat native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders/etc  working in the tourism sect, but I often just wonder, what is the alternative (this is not some kind of attack by the way.

I disagree.  If having a vacation condo in Hawaii becomes way too expensive tax-wise we will see a huge surplus of vacant million dollar condos which will only get worse and worse.  Sure it won't get into the affordable range but as long as they exist and are empty, the downward pressure on the price will be evident.
