"Its a small nuisance with massive upside to helping find children kidnapped. You may not be in bed you maybe out and about and see the vehicle. Perhaps they kidnapped then  drive 3 or 4 hours your way then laid low for a bit and you see them on way to get dog food or on your way to beg for change after thay 5k screwdriver set you bought from snap on. It very well could be the night your not at home. The faster the notice gets out and the more eyes looking the greater chance to save a child from the unimaginable 
Point is when your or anyones child is taken you want as many eyes looking for them as possible. A child snached from your arm and you dont know if that 5 year old is being sexually abused by creeps that pay for it or out right killed.

"Dick Shelby is an excellent public servant who has done a lot of good things for Alabama. Historically, in the Senate, he does what he believes is good for Alabama and what he believes his constituents want. The problem when it comes to Shelby has been that Alabama wants the wrong things.

I can understand that someone may have come away with the impression that Shelby is just like all the rest of them. He's clearly senile now and has been there for too long. I think Roger Stone or somebody managed to get their arm up Shelby's ass a few years ago and started making him do crazy shit like go to Russia on the Fourth of July.

I don't really know much about Durant or Britt, but Mo Brooks is a lying traitor who conspired in an attempt to violently overthrow the United States Government and should be in prison if not executed.

"I actually wanted to go to a private school with a good reputation, but they wanted me to take an additional year since I am a foreign student.

"It's even more complicated than that. Enforcement is lax to nonexistent at best due to the passage of the 2014 law, which states that Alabama doesn't license or regulate nonpublic schools, creating an interesting contradiction. The state superintendent seems to be the final say on what's enforced and to what extent, and [this is what we were last given](http://web.archive.org/web/20210224205502/https://www.alsde.edu/ofc/osp/Pages/faqs-all.aspx?navtext=FAQs). 

>Q: Are there any requirements for teachers at nonpublic schools? Could, for instance, someone with no high school diploma or equivalent legally teach in a non public school?

>A: The ALSDE is not authorized to license or regulate any private, nonpublic, or church school offering instruction in grades K-12 or any combination thereof.

Even then, this FAQ was not carried over when the ALSDE switched to their new website this school year, but the translation is all but saying that they can't enforce anything. Now, private schools are perfectly able to regulate themselves or volunteer information to the ALSDE, but that's not the same thing. Someone can even start a school and not register it at all and the ALSDE says they can't enforce anything.

How do I know all of this? I run a home-based private school, as defined under Alabama law, specifically as defined in §16-28-1. Because I'm a homeschool parent who doesn't participate in a church-run cover school or separate private school. 

And this is information that was given to me by the ALSDE as well as my district superintendent and confirmed again at the beginning of the current school year. (It's law I unfortunately often have to cite to parents and public school employees alike when predatory church schools and lobbying groups try to convince everyone that they can only legally homeschool by joining their church school– for a price.)",t2_9bvzo,JennJayBee,0,1648230721.0,0,t1_i23ctu9,i23ctu9,False,Careless-Yogurt-7871,t3_tmfnio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/tmfnio/are_alabama_universities_as_bad_as_the_schools/,Are Alabama universities as bad as the schools?,/r/Alabama/comments/tmfnio/are_alabama_universities_as_bad_as_the_schools/i23ctu9/,2,r/Alabama,0,2

"Evil? Pretty sweeping generalization of the two sides. The list of things you find evil could be endless. Masks, vaccines, alternative/green energy.. 
It’s pretty vague but I can say downvotes aren’t proof of anyone being right. That’s just people agreeing or disagreeing. I disagree. Didn’t downvote. I would still be a die hard Republican but I was heavily libertarian as well as atheist. It became clear the democrats typically want to guarantee the rights we already have for all citizens. Not giving some more than others. I couldn’t argue against big gov and then turn around and not acknowledge my own party fighting tooth and nail for anything that can preserve their way of life as THE american way. I’m not someone who gets fussy over someone wanting to have the same rights I get. Especially when the argument against is said to have come from a religious text. 

Perhaps trying to keep same sex couples from legally getting married is a bit evil as well as a terrible waste of time but seeing the attempt and then working to guarantee everybody is entitled to those rights is not evil. It may get cringe sometimes. I’ll give you that. Look at who they must deal with though. I would get aggravated if my coworkers call me a drinker of baby blood on a good day and on a bad day they invited a goon squad in to work to cause chaos (smearing poop on walls and stealing useless things from desks) and possibly physical harm. If judging patriotism and seeing our countrymen as the enemy of christianity is your thing there is a canadian born senator in texas that loves to do all that and would probably love to hear that theory about downvotes being the result of facts being angrily co-signed.

"I've been reading through this discussion, and I'm doing my best not to go off completely, so you'll have to excuse my bluntness here.

Most people on this subreddit went to Alabama public schools, and they're the folks who are taking the time to patiently answer your questions while resisting the urge to correct your punctuation. Perhaps a better educated and enlightened environment would have taught you to take the time to research the specific schools you're interested in before making assumptions based on stereotypes.

In looking that up, you'd have found that Alabama had educated actual brain surgeons and rocket scientists. The doctor who performed surgery on President Clinton's knee (David P. Adkison)? He's a graduate of University of South Alabama, and Clinton seemed to like him just fine. The guy helping to pick the current US Supreme Court Justice nominee? That's former Senator Doug Jones, who graduated from the University of Alabama and Samford University. Maybe you're a conservative? Condoleezza Rice went to Miles College. And that's just to name a few. Alabama also famously has a college right next door to a NASA facility.

So yes, the colleges are good. Even some of the public K-12 schools are good. We're not all a bunch of uneducated bumpkins. Yes, some of our schools are pretty shitty, but then [so are some of the schools in other states](https://calmatters.org/commentary/2020/01/functional-illiteracy/), and they don't have decent banana pudding.

">The demands were there far before Trump brought it up in 2011.  Back in 2008 during the primaries they were asking for Obama's birth certificate.

That is true, however the fact remains that Trump adopted that rhetoric and made it his own.

&#x200B;

>While I agree with you that they were different, the democrats in congress did everything they could to remove him from office. Constant investigations and impeachment trials. They didn't storm the capital physically but they did through legal means as much as they could.

The trouble being that there were legitimate reasons for those investigations and I have no problem with congress and a special investigator following up on those reasons. Just like how the investigations into Bill Clinton's lying to congress eventually led to his impeachment. Unlike Trump's,  those investigations were not impeded by the Democrats (it was heavily criticized) and were allowed to expand beyond the original allegation.

Also just like when the Republicans repeatedly investigated Hillary Clinton over her alleged mishandling of confidential information and her alleged involvement with Benghazi.  Those investigations took place in a very public manner, to the point that it became an obvious public platform to damage what the Republicans considered a political rival.  (Side note: Several high level officials of the Trump White House were caught mishandling confidential information and no Republican seemed upset with the breach.)

**Regardless, the investigations were important due to the public's need to hold politicians accountable even if it is the POTUS or a Secretary of State.**

When it comes to Trump, the investigation was a result of members of the Trump campaign being caught on tape speaking with Russian agents that were being monitored under a FISA warrant.  Sure the Democrats had a lot to gain politically, but the investigations were valid and should not have been hampered by Republicans looking to cover their own political future.

Anyway, to bring a longish comment to an end. We can't claim a necessary investigation into misdeeds caught on tape that produced some guilty convictions was strictly a hit job on Trump, without discounting the importance of accountability and how the process was used in the past to protect the public's interests with the Clinton's.

"- No he didn’t
- More government spending that’s leading to the highest inflation ever that is also hurting middle class families way more. Also gas prices. 
- Covid relief that was also more government spending and caused a huge drop in workforce and drastically affected the supply chain because we paid people to sit at home
- more government spending and even some democrats weren’t in favor of the infrastructure bill and a lot in the bill had nothing to do with infrastructure. Wouldn’t hang your hat on that one. 
- got us out of Afghanistan with the worst withdrawal ever allowing Americans to be killed and leaving massive amounts of military equipment that could be used today by Ukraine instead of terrorist. 
- Covid numbers rose more under his presidency in 2021. Big swing and a miss there
- standing up to Russia by allowing Ukrainian people to continue to die while the country is invaded. Hmmm way to stand up! Notice Putin waited until Trump was out of office. 
- Nominating the first black woman that can’t even explain what a woman is? Soft on pedophiles and promotes a divisive CRT. Maybe you should look up the definition of competence.

">In this instance, it's highly documented that Trump himself questioned the legitimacy of Obama's presidency. Trump went as far as demanding to see Obama's birth certificate.

The demands were there far before Trump brought it up in 2011.  Back in 2008 during the primaries they were asking for Obama's birth certificate.  It was the democrat voters asking for the birth certificate because they didn't want Obama beating Hillary in the primaries.  Trump is just a very loud person and was also priming himself for a White House run.  Republicans hated Obama so what better way to gain voters then to hate someone they hate.

">We're just calling out your blatant hypocrisy.

Hypocrisy? That word gets used a lot, but evidently the people who use it don't actually understand what that word means.

In this instance, it's highly documented that Trump himself questioned the legitimacy of Obama's presidency.  Trump went as far as demanding to see Obama's birth certificate.

When Trump was elected, there was no serious effort to stop his election from being certified nor was the Capital attacked.

Sure there were liberals that exclaimed ""not my president"" during Trump's presidency, but those liberals were private citizens not elected officials.  Also let's not forget that there were plenty of Alabamians claiming that Obama wasn't their president either.

Today we have right wingers acting out at Biden (let's not forget the ""Let's go Brandon"" silliness) just like they did with Obama, and I don't have a problem with them exercising their first amendment right.  Sure it makes them look just as silly as the liberals, but at least we all know who the idiots are.

As hard as Trump and his apologists try to play the victim, there is no getting around the fact that during the Obama presidency a Republican called him a liar in the middle of a state of the union address, and when Biden won the presidential election, the Republicans openly defied the results. Not only that, Trump organized a crowd outside the Capital to protest the election results and it winds up becoming an insurrection.

Today we are talking about an elected official from Alabama who questioned the legitimacy of the sitting president during a congressional hearing where the GOP minority committee invited him so that he can continue the rhetoric against the current SCOTUS nominee.

Anyway, the hypocrisy is with the folks trying to claim that it all began when Trump was disrespected when the facts point to Trump being the disrespectful guy first.",t2_fckzx,space_coder,0,1648215611.0,0,t1_i22avap,i22avap,False,smiles__,t3_tmhj53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/tmhj53/at_senate_hearing_for_judge_jackson_alabama/,"At Senate Hearing for Judge Jackson, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall refuses to say Joseph Biden is the 'duly elected and lawfully serving' President, can only say he is currently 'the President.'

Never underestimate the left’s ability to spin a narrative.

"The public schools are hit or miss for K-12. The private schools are also hit or miss. Many of the same educators have taught in both, depending on where they can find a job. We just had a scandal involving identity theft of students from impoverished counties being counted as charter school students (charter schools here are a joke). I am not sure how they are outside the state. I can only compare public/private to those in Georgia. While private schools are an option here, the ones we have either sent or looked at have not been worth the tuition. We decided to send ours to a great public school and we are seeing great results in opportunities in post secondary education. Most of our 4-year institutions are excellent- but it depends on what one wants to pursue. i.e. Health care is offered at all of them, but University of South Alabama as well as UAB are highly regarded in that field.

"Easy. The Mueller Investigation was about Russian interference of 2016 Presidential election and the possible links to the Trump campaign.  At no time during this investigation did any federal or state official refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Trump's presidency.

You confused investigating foreign interference of an election with outright refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of a sitting president.

In fact, despite evidence that Trump benefited from the propaganda linked to Russian sources and a high probability that the Trump campaign at least encouraged the propaganda if not coordinated with the Russians.  The legitimacy of the election process and the accuracy of the votes counted were never questioned. (Actually Trump questioned the accuracy and legitimacy of the election despite the fact that he won, and of course no evidence supporting the vote count being changed was ever found - I suspect it was another case of Trump projecting his guilt onto others).

"I currently live in Dothan and have lived there for the past 10 years, previously lived in Ozark.

I've eaten at what people call decent, and it's always bland and flavorless. There's been plenty of restaurants that died (River Nile off top of my head). The Cellar is actually good. There are some decent ones, but the vast majority is the same old same old.

A lot of the westward expansion has still been another McDonald's, another Hardee's, a Guthrie's which is essentially another Goldfinger's. The only new things that seem to be staying are Metro Diner. Taziki's is OK, different and not terrible but as far as Greek food goes, isn't that great (mostly bland). Otherwise, that new-ish shopping center on 84 next to Flowers Hospital has mostly the same options as all the others. A third Rodeo's (which is pretty good, but not different), McDonald's, Hardees, etc. Which Which was something different, but they're a chain and they used to have several options that have dwindled to practically nothing, they lost everything from their menu that was any good.

Foster Fest is just a bunch of drunk rednecks roaming the street with crappy music and the most ungodly stench in the world outside of a papermill or yeast factory. That's ALL it is.

"The problem with Alabama public school system is how much emphasis is put on using private schools in any area that has a struggling public school. This includes Mobile Alabama, parts of Birmingham, parts of Montgomery, and hundreds of places in between. Areas like Homewood, Hoover, Vestavia, Mountainbrook all have implemented higher tax rates for property to accommodate a better school system. Another major factor is that they have figured out how to control the population of who attends the school (as bad as this may be) By eliminating buses in many of these areas. By doing that, you ensure that everyone pays the same tax rate to attend to that school, which then accomplishes the same goal as a private school. 

In conclusion, Alabama public schools in general are not the greatest, but that it is likely due to an improper use of funding.",t2_a9gephdr,1Steel_Hands1,0,1648143048.0,0,t1_i1yffbu,i1yffbu,True,Careless-Yogurt-7871,t3_tmfnio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/tmfnio/are_alabama_universities_as_bad_as_the_schools/,Are Alabama universities as bad as the schools?,/r/Alabama/comments/tmfnio/are_alabama_universities_as_bad_as_the_schools/i1yffbu/,4,r/Alabama,0,4

"Even if it was the current lowest, still not worth living there.

It's a mini ""big city"" with city level traffic (as in number of drivers), but everyone still drives like it's Sunday in the sticks and they're the only person on the road. Way too much distracted driving, and way too slow. Alabama already ranks in the top 10 (usually top 5) worst drivers in the nation, and Dothan drivers are some of the worst within the state.

Beyond the traffic woes, there's not really anything to do. For a small metro sized city  or whatever, if you don't go to church, you have nothing to do and no social network. There's not even that many good restaurant options... there's 8 Waffle House locations within city limits. Rarely does a new or good restaurant stick around very long. If it's not one of the same 3 bland things, it fails. Though as a positive, not long ago they made some actually decent walking trails.

Dothan as far as jobs is equally crap. The city tries to wear too many hats and as a result, doesn't do any of them as well as they should. Commercial hub, medical hub, ag hub, travel hub. Unless you come from old money farming family, your job options are to work at the hospital or flip burgers, and that's pretty much it so if you can't become a doctor, well, better start the 100,000th lawncare or tree company because you don't want to flip burgers.

Dothan sucks ass, there's a reason it would rank low on the cost of living scale.

The only good thing about Dothan is the cost of living being low enough that you can afford to leave this place often.",t2_102bah,sardonicus87,0,1648142183.0,0,t1_i1yd677,i1yd677,False,oooogieboooogie,t3_tksxc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/tksxc9/4_of_the_most_affordable_places_to_live_in_the_us/,4 of the most affordable places to live in the US are in Alabama,/r/Alabama/comments/tksxc9/4_of_the_most_affordable_places_to_live_in_the_us/i1yd677/,1,r/Alabama,0,1

"Alabama schools have the potential to be great. The resources are usually there, as far as teachers and materials. The grading is dumb, where you pass as long as you attend and somewhat participate.

What seems to be woefully lacking is support systems. We could blame the parents, but honestly even the best families here don’t seem to have time to tutor and motivate their child/young adult. Then in college, depending on the major, you may find yourself without a proper tutor.

Not every student is inclined to “lean on” the professors for help, and those that have no tutoring or peers that can help fall behind.

It’s no top-notch education, but I got enough to do well on SAT/ACT and get into Uni. I think a good assessment is that if an Alabama HS education is your terminal degree, you may lack exposure/practice is a few areas. However, the state school system is sufficient to get you in to the next step in your education (speaking anecdotally).",t2_3u8vtg5q,jdanielh01,0,1648138149.0,0,t1_i1y2n7a,i1y2n7a,False,Careless-Yogurt-7871,t3_tmfnio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/tmfnio/are_alabama_universities_as_bad_as_the_schools/,Are Alabama universities as bad as the schools?,/r/Alabama/comments/tmfnio/are_alabama_universities_as_bad_as_the_schools/i1y2n7a/,11,r/Alabama,0,11

"You filled in a lot of weird blanks with stuff I never said. 

I’ve been seeing people talk about the 1% death rate since very early in the pandemic.  And it was *kind of* useful as a metric early on, before “1%” was nearly a million people in the US.  To talk about a million people who didn’t have to die as “1%,” while factually correct, is intentionally misleading and downplays the severity of the infection rates at various times.  It is an ignorant way to talk about the virus.  And it keeps people from taking it seriously enough to protect themselves and others. 

Now, all this other stuff about being triggered and vaccinated people spreading the virus, you said all that, not me.  The fact is, vaccinated people weren’t the ones clogging up the hospitals and dying, and that by and large, most of the new infections were among the unvaccinated.  But I didn’t bring that up.

"Dems are not going to win this year. I mean, I'll do my best to vote for the Dem nominee, but you have to realize two things... 

1) Democratic voters in this state are outnumbered 2:1, and there's not some niche group of Democrat voters that make up the difference. We haven't had that many liberals move here or conservatives move away or die from covid. That's a HUGE gap to fill, and they WILL show up to vote.

2) Doug Jones winning was the result of a very unique set of circumstances, the biggest factor being that the special election was literally the only race on the ballot. If you compare the results of [the 2016 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Alabama) to [the special election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Alabama), both sides actually lost voters, but about half of Republicans stayed home. There was no crossover voting or sudden boost in Democratic votes that pulled that off. Doug Jones won because GOP voters stayed home. Our midterms include a gubernatorial election, and there's no way in hell that Republican voters will sit out. They won't vote race by race, either. They'll fill in their Republican straight ticket box at the top and go home guilt-free, and that will all but guarantee a GOP win.

No amount of trying to get a bad Republican nominee for that race will make it ""easier"" for a Democrat to win, unless it's another special election.

"Just wanted to say I'm originally from NYC and moved to Louisiana and I'm looked at like the devil by a lot of people. I get the more polite ""well what are you doing here?"" To the less polite eye rolls and such. I've felt a lot of hostility even in New Orleans bc I'm a transplant. I moved because life was unlivable in NYC for me.. and that's more than just in a strictly financial way. I've made a family here, got married and have had 2 kids in the 5 years I've been here with a local and I'm happier than I've ever been.

People kind of did the same thing to me when I went to CA…. But I always had a funny reply for them….like at the hotel front desk…”don’t worry ma’am I left most of my 500 guns back in AL”….. or “can I book an adjacent hotel room to keep my firearms?” Or “I had to fly here because our AL trucks are lifted too high to fit into your LA parking decks”. I usually directed the humor at myself and the stereotypes of Alabama and it always led to good conversation even from those from which you may not expect it. You need a few good comebacks and always say then with a smile on your face.
