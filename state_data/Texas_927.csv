"The HSR ''Texas Central'' project is a passenger rail line like the Japanese bullet trains, not a cargo carrier. We do have existing routes already for getting BNSF to run cargo by rail between Dallas and Houston, but that route is technically short enough in terms of Logistics that it is not really worth it for postal companies compared to driving it. For something cross-country maybe if it is Cheaper by rail, but for parcel specific delivery, where most of their business is ecommerce of business shipping from their storage direct to a customer, it isn't worth it to go from trucked warehouse to truck to train then back to truck. Rail would be better suited for more big industrial supply to industrial supply or distributor commerce, which is why say petrochemical or agricultural product is more popular to run by train.

"> but do you know what's waaaaay cheaper than abortion? Not having sex in the first place

Or, and hear me out here: protected sex / sex with contraceptives.

Except you know what fuckers go hardest against people getting these things? Fucking Republicans and ""religious"" lobbies/groups.

Funny how these fuckers, who so desperately act like they want to prevent abortions, further shove their ""morality"" down the throats of others and fight against sex education and contraceptives because they want to push abstinence on people - something we've long had proof of not working at all.

People are going to have sex. They're entirely within their rights not to for their own religious beliefs, of course. But people who try to push abstinence from sex on others need to fuck off, most especially when they then fight against abortion after the fact.

These people don't have deeply held religious beliefs. They just want to wield the authority of religion over others as a cudgel for their political designs to control women as chattel.

"The headline is, thankfully, kind of misleading. There was a bill introduced last year in the Texas legislature, (before the post-6-week abortion ban was passed) that proposed giving the death penalty to women who received an abortion at any point in pregnancy. The bill died in committee. This article is referencing the comments of David Lowe, a candidate for the TX House of Reps, that were in support of that bill and the current incumbent Stephanie Klick‚Äôs pushback against those comments. Turns out she isn‚Äôt a fan of killing women, even if she opposes abortion. While it is disturbing that a potential future state rep supports killing women for having abortions, the headline makes it sound like there‚Äôs an actual near-term possibility of that being a law, when there‚Äôs not.

‚Ä¶At least not right now, anyway.

"Ted Cruz has no principles. This is all theater. He would enthusiastically embrace Marxism or radical Islam if he thought it would get him elected President. I know. He knows that about himself. Just watch him lying and making baseless claims on his Fox ‚Äúnews‚Äù appearances or talking over a composed and articulate judge in her confirmation hearing, or shouting over the committee chairs when his grandstanding badly exceeded his time limit. You can see his self-loathing. It would be sad we‚Äôre he not such a despicable person.  

I do not wish to sacrifice my anonymity here, but I am a lawyer and I graduated from Princeton, as did Cruz. I know some things about his experience as an undergraduate, his roommates, and his reputation there. I know a lot about Ted Cruz‚Äôs career at the Texas Attorney General‚Äôs office and as a conniving politician. He is a charlatan. He masquerades as a Texan but he is a spineless coward. The disgraced ex-president nicknamed him  ‚Äúlying Ted‚Äù and accused his father of murdering John F. Kennedy.  Yet even after those insults, and even after Trump piles on by calling his wife ugly, Rafael Cruz (he adopted Ted because Republican primary voters don‚Äôt like ‚Äúforeign sounding‚Äù names) prostrated himself for Trump.

"Near Houston is Galveston (within a couple of hours) which has some interesting options.  Of educational interest are an airplane museum, a still-working sailing ship from the 1800s, a few places you might be able to tour (not sure right now with covid) such as the historic Bishop's Palace. Also an Offshore Drilling Rig Museum.  Moody Gardens is quasi-educational, but it has a riverboat - and penguins!

I'm not suggesting Galveston instead of Houston, but pointing out it is close enough that you might be able to do it in addition to Houston, depending on time and circumstance.

The number of museums in Houston is actually quite impressive, as pretty much everyone has already pointed out - and many of them are quite close to each other in the Museum District.

"[Here is some data](https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/direction-texas-february-2022#overall) on whether Texans think the state is headed in the right or wrong direction.

The differences based on party affiliation, religion, etc. are interesting. Generally the largest group that believe Texas is headed in the right direction is white, male, rural, conservative, and Christian. No real surprise there.

In the end 40% of Texas who responded to the poll think the State is headed in the right direction. That's a very large chunk of voters.

"So I am a landlord and I have 5 rentals, typically 3/2 or 2/1.  I only deal with in person interviews, and typically I do not charge a deposit, which I may start doing when I have someone leave. When someone leaves, it takes hours, not even a day,  to fill a house. I accept dogs, but I want a personal guarantee, and I'm going to start requiring a pet deposit, again my next go around. I find 600 to be the magic credit score number, and I always talk to the employer to verify jobs. I consider my rentals to be B properties and I am upfront with this. If a person is late and they warn me before, I don't charge a fee. I'll typically put a listing on Craigslist, but I don't want a house to be used by the scammers who say for half the deposit I'll hold it for you, then run away with cash, so I may use zillo next time.  

When I run credit checks it cost (2 years ago) 30 bucks, so 50 bucks is not a stretch, especially if the companies are paying some kid to run them a decent hourly wage, but I get it, 20 bucks can be quite a bit to enter info on a website. 

Texas is hard to find rental houses like the ones I have at this time. What was going for 1350 a year ago now gets 1600., and people are constantly asking if i have a place. It's crazy.  

So, what are your flags?  Do you have pets, or more importantly do you have a medium to big size dog?  Do you have 600 credit?  Are you there in person to talk?  Do you have a stable job with work history?

My son is a felon and I have a big heart for second chances. I have two dogs at home, a bischon (aka crusty white dog) and a pit bull, which is the most timid playful dog I've ever met.

Also, I've had people get student grants who wanted to pay three months in advance. I would never do this because after the 3 months, it seemed they would not pay. 

So, it seems to me that you have been accepted, only your distance and job kept you from signing that lease.  If you're looking for a landlord like me, one who is small time, unfortunately I think you need to be there, or hire a realtor who deals with rentals to help out. I've delt with these realtors and have no issue with a middleman.

The only people who can get elected to office are those who actually run for office and get on the ballot. Bad candidates get elected when they have no viable competition.

It takes lots of campaigning to get lots of votes, and it takes lots of money to do lots of campaigning, so the candidates usually most likely to run & get elected are those who can round up enough money to pay for big campaigns - which inherently rigs the process (often with help from voter suppression tactics).

There is no shortage of better potential candidates, but there is a shortage of better-*funded* potential candidates.

"Then you're going out of your way not to see it, because it's been widely covered that the rejected ballots were disproportionately Democratic. Do you need more evidence than the guy down below presented that you didn't respond to? 

Here's the little known Washington Post: 

""Because so many ballots were rejected, thousands of Republicans‚Äô votes didn‚Äôt count in this election. But it appears substantially more votes from Democrats were trashed. The largest number came from heavily Democratic Harris County, where Houston is located: About 19 percent of mail ballots there were rejected.""

From the AP, that notoriously hard to find website:

""The most rejections were around Houston, a Democratic stronghold, where Harris County elections officials reported that nearly 7,000 mail ballots ‚Äî about 19% ‚Äî were discarded. During the last midterm elections in 2018, Texas‚Äô largest county only rejected 135 mail ballots. Harris County elections officials said they received more than 8,000 calls since January from voters seeking help, which they attributed to ‚Äúconfusion and frustration‚Äù over the new requirements.""

">A) if their budget stands to increase, they will find room.

Yeah that doesn't happen.  Expansion is expensive and schools only have so much property.

What a mess, you would have buses from different schools running all over the place, picking up kids from the same neighborhoods to rush them to different schools.  Add distance in and that there would be a lot more kids needing transportation (since many are currently walking to school).  A high cost logistical nightmare.

this simply isn't going to happen. The cheapest of cheap places are going to be 12-1300, and not in a great part of town.

the current average rent in austin is $1600 and climbing.

My rent just jumped $300 over last year, and my SO's went up $400.

Eveything in austin is blowing up, and as a result, everyone who can't afford it is scattering to the surrounding cities blowing up their rent too.
