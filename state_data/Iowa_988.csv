Jess Mazour, Iowa Chapter Sierra Club, will be there. She has been helping to organize the coalition of landowners & farmers with other groups who are opposed to these hazardous pipelines and eminent domain.
 
Below is the announcement I received from Jess Mazour;

"I mean, this question like most in the real world, has an answer of ""it depends"". It is going to depend on how much product you have to manage, and what the product is. Depends on exactly what the company thinks that that role is. Depends a lot on just how replaceable that position is, because that is supply and demand.

The Deere factory on the north side of Dubuque is an engineering center for their construction and forestry division. The person who manages that entire suite of products is better compensated than the person who manages getting the right tires for the dump trucks. Both are doing some level of 'product management', tho.

So, yeah, it's not a great answer, but it depends.

With a general check, they would see that you had been previously charged with interference, but it won't tell them HOW you interfered so they might just be being cautious since it is possible that you aren't truthful to them.

What you did sounds like a simple misdemeanor, but the other versions are: 

Serious misdemeanor: inflicts bodily harm other than serious injuries as a result of the interference.

Aggravated misdemeanor: intentionally inflicts bodily harm other than serious injuries as a result of the interference.

Class D felony: intentionally inflicts or attempts to inflict serious injuries or displays a dangerous weapon. (Depending on the specific charges, this can be up to a class C felony)

"Be weary if Iowa starts talking tort reform.

Fun fact, Texas enacted tort reform for malpractice, which caps medical lawsuits at $250,000. Now a botched operation can turn someone into a quadriplegic (not hypothetical, this has happened) and they won't even be able to find a lawyer to take the case because there's no money in it. Litigating a lawsuit against the hospital can be expensive.

This also means TX hospitals have little incentive to get rid of a dangerous Dr or surgeon. A surgeon can bring in one or two million dollars in profit every year to a hospital.

"I normally find Art Cullen insightful, but this article just comes off ragey and whiney and also ignores a lot of unfortunate realities. Could Democrats do more to curry favor in Midwestern States and rural areas in general? Probably, although I think it is more limited than Art realizes. The country has changed an awful lot since Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008. There is a real culture war now, and the simple reality is that on many cultural issues that used to not be so prominent in politics, Democrats are seen as alien in these parts of the country by many voters. This makes it so those voters don't really want to listen to Democratic policy ideas on other issues, because being on the other side of the culture war makes you ""not part of our team"", and people not on your team aren't worth listening to, is the rationale.

There was a long, long history of blue collar workers and farmers in the Midwest being bedrock Democrat voters, but as America's culture war has heated up and many of these people now vote over **cultural** not economic issues, there is no easy way for Democrats to appeal to them without violating both other important constituents and core values of the party. I can't tell you how many articles I read during Trump's Presidency about farmers who were losing their farms directly because of the trade war Trump was waging against China (which resulted in retalitatory tariffs that wiped out lots of small farmers.) To a man every one of them said they were voting for Trump again in 2020, specifically because they have things they care about more than their pocket books.

"Ah, allow me to share my two year experience with Hyvee, I applied for the job back in 2018 when I was 16, after a short talk with the hiring lady I got put in the bakery for about a month or two before the deli manager asked if I wanted to work in the deli, I said yes and moved between the deli and bakery before getting placed permanently in the deli. After about a year I asked if there were going to employee evaluations to y'know, ask for raises or whatever I keep getting told that they're going to happen yet it never does, around Christmas of 2019 I start getting my hours cut severely to the point of having only one 4 hour shift for the period of two weeks, during Christmas I got a huge boost in hours though afterwards it was back to getting jack. 2020 rolls around, I'm 18 and I'm able to play with sharp stuff and hot stuff though my hours keep getting shorter, at the time a new guy comes in and gets like 30+ hours a week while I barely get 12, that's when I just up and quit, I found a new job with the help of a friend.",t2_35fvk9fi,pacatte64,0,1648221790.0,0,t1_i22pro3,i22pro3,True,Silver_Ad_8948,t3_tn7mmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tn7mmk/former_hyvee_staff_share_how_layoffs_played_out/,Former Hy-Vee Staff Share How Layoffs Played Out,/r/Iowa/comments/tn7mmk/former_hyvee_staff_share_how_layoffs_played_out/i22pro3/,1,r/Iowa,0,1

"Oh it's definitely a PR move...just not the one they were expecting.

Imagine some backroom conversation to see if they can ""show this new plan works!"" ...it's not unfathomable.

Step 1) id some low hanging fruit, that is both highly marketable and likely has funds to sustain their lifestyle for a bit.

Step 2) fire them

Step 3) track the progress of the unemployment of this group and claim success of the program.

The way this played out, and is being walked back, something clutch happened.

"Finally, after weeks of driving the same gravel road almost everyday, I spotted one of the foxes again. 

Got to watch it hunt and catch something, I think a rat, so got some cool action shots even though not super great quality due to distance and lowlight. 

Managed to get a few closer photos when it was returning to its den. Have a better idea where it is now so I'll hopefully get some more photos soon and hopefully I'll finally see them in good lighting and when I have a tripod. 

Once again I took a few hundred photos so I'll share some more another time or check out my Instagram linked below for more Iowa wildlife photos!

I agree with you that the rich need to be taxed more. We need to go back to the old tax system of the early 1900's for taxes on the rich. They paid alot more taxes back then. I don't think that someone doesn't deserve to survive working full time. Sometimes people need to get a second job to survive or federal assistance becauseof bad things happening. What sucks for lots of federal assistance is sometimes people have to travel far to get to that assistance. The county I use to live in didn't have anything to help federally or state wise. They have to travel to the next county over which is an hour drive one way. When you are poor how are they supposed to get there? They don't have extra money to be running all over the country. In situations like this is when our systems need to travel to them to help them.,t2_7l68mql2,drew2872,0,1648184884.0,0,t1_i2134fu,i2134fu,False,Levi_Mitchell,t3_tmwm36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tmwm36/dems_warn_gop_unemployment_changes_will_drive/,Dems Warn GOP Unemployment Changes Will Drive Away Workers From Iowa,/r/Iowa/comments/tmwm36/dems_warn_gop_unemployment_changes_will_drive/i2134fu/,1,r/Iowa,0,1
You do realize it costs money that people don't have to move right? And it's pretty gross to think that someone doesn't deserve to survive working full time no matter what job they have.

"Weird. Same experience you describe. Ours is called ""Dollar Fresh"", which is weird, because it has basically the same selection as the Hy-Vee proper 20 miles away, and its produce is less fresh. The only real innovation seems to be in trying to eliminate labor, both by stocking more lazily (no ""facing"", in most cases stocking is just putting a flat of product on the shelf and ripping off the front) and having maybe one non-self checkout line. The place feels eerie and empty, and half the time what I'm looking for is out of stock. I like self-checkout, but it really only works well if you're looking to get like one thing, in-out-boom.

Anyways, a couple of months after the Dollar Fresh moved in the Fareway replaced half of their checkstands with self-service kiosks.

“The timing of the layoffs coincides with drastic reforms to Iowa’s unemployment law.   

Under a proposed new state law, unemployed Iowans would be limited to 16 weeks of unemployment benefits—the lowest in the Midwest—and be forced to accept lower-paying jobs by as low as 60% of their previous wage.

Hy-Vee publicly blamed COVID for the layoffs, but former employees told Starting Line they don’t buy that narrative.

By its own accord, Hy-Vee’s sales have grown during the pandemic.

"Raising the minimum wage is only going to make the cost of living go higher. I grew up in Iowa and now live in Maine. We have a minimum wage of $15/hr here. Even at $15/hr, many places cannot find enough people to work because our cost of living is so high that $15/hr means nothing for pay here Guess what, everything cost more to live because they jack the prices up on everything to offset the price of paying people more money per hour. My parents still live in Iowa (northeast of Marion/Cedar Rapids) and we often compare the prices of stuff. Propane in Maine cost $3.707 per gallon, in Iowa it costs $2.114 per gallon. Our regular gas is usually $0.60 per gallon more expensive as well. Apartments here run over $1400 a month. It is cheaper to buy a house than to pay rent.  Even our insurances cost more money monthly.

"It seems to me that a “worker shortage” is the excuse used to strip workers of unemployment benefits rather than a legitimate means to bring workers into the job force. 

If unemployment benefits are what’s keeping people from working, theoretically, workers would return to the job force once their six months of unemployment expired. If we were five months into a “worker shortage”, we could just wait another month and the workers would be flooding back into work. As it is, there’s been talk about a shortage of workers for the past 18 months. 

The GOP is just using the current lack of workers as an excuse to roll back worker protections. And when the economy slows down and there’s no longer a need for as many workers, they’ll keep the workers that don’t cost as much (the teenagers that don’t have as many regulations now) and let the more expensive workers go sit at home on unemployment for four months (instead of six).",t2_am56m,Motherofalleffers,0,1648173558.0,0,t1_i20h6eb,i20h6eb,False,Levi_Mitchell,t3_tmwm36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tmwm36/dems_warn_gop_unemployment_changes_will_drive/,Dems Warn GOP Unemployment Changes Will Drive Away Workers From Iowa,/r/Iowa/comments/tmwm36/dems_warn_gop_unemployment_changes_will_drive/i20h6eb/,15,r/Iowa,0,15

They maybe tell them you were arrested but they have no details on the case.  There is no digital record of the details of the specific case.  They can tell them, yes they were arrested for a simple theft.  But not even the clerk of court can see what the results of the case were, what was stolen.  No one can see anything without going and digging the only physical copy out of storage. 

I can send you a picture of the request the judge gave me.  Its called "" request to unexpunge and expunge file""

"I guess ymmv but I'll go through it:

>They constantly lied. 

Mediacom has never actually lied to me in 7.5 years of service. 

>They still owe me hundreds of dollars almost 8 years later. 

Mediacom has only mis-billed me once, at the very beginning when they slipped a modem rental fee in there (I have my own equipment). They removed it, and never had me pay it and claim they would either A.)Take the balance off my next bill, B.) Send me a check, or C.) ACH transfer it to me. Centurylink claimed they did all 3 and STILL kept sending me incorrect bills that each month had random new packages added on.

>Their entire business model is built on lying and exploiting the customer hoping they don't realize.

Idk, malicious scumbag billing department aside, Centurylink's actual internet service was abysmal. I got their best internet package for $59.99/mo. It was 7Mbps download and 0.15Mbps upload. As stated before my internet went down at least once per hour until they finally replaced my modem/router combo which took over 3 phone calls because they kept claiming it was ""fixed"". Their new modem/router combo was ""better"" but still crashed at least once a day. **Working from home, gaming, and streaming is literally impossible with Centurylink.**

When I switched to Mediacom I was initially paying $49.99/month and then it went up to match Centurylink price at $59.99/mo the next year. I paid for 200 Mbps download and actually got like 212. I also finally had an upload speed that was measurable (30Mbps) instead of 0.15Mbps which is useless.",t2_f6txy9p3,glizzy_Gustopher,0,1648160400.0,0,t1_i1zndb0,i1zndb0,False,WombyDragon,t3_tlfsfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tlfsfs/fuck_mediacom/,Fuck mediacom,/r/Iowa/comments/tlfsfs/fuck_mediacom/i1zndb0/,2,r/Iowa,0,2

"Lol you’re funny. I know people that haven’t worked since Covid started and have banked, literally banked, 10’s of thousands of dollars in unemployment and benefits over the last 2 years. 

There needs to be stricter guidelines on this stuff. I’ve worked since I was 15, I’m now 3x that age, I’ve used exactly 6 months of unemployment. There is no reason that people should be quitting their jobs to go on unemployment. This is literally what’s happening. They might not put in their 2 weeks, but they just don’t show up til they’re fired, same thing. 

It ruined me as a small business owner trying to keep approx 10 people employed. I couldn’t keep up with all the costs. When quarterly taxes come due that HURTS. We talk about livable wages? I started guys off at 15, let them work as much overtime as they wanted, and quickly would promote to $18/20 an hour. Literally straight from high school with no experience. 

I see no issue with cutting back how much UI is paid or making it stricter. Keep in mind, it’s the business owners that pay this wage. It keeps coming from the businesses bank account, not the states coffers.

Another note: that legal aid document says that more than 8 years must have passed for the courts to expunge a misdemeanor. I wrote the court about 5 years after mine and they expunged them.

"#1. NEVER EVER EVER plead guilty without speaking to a lawyer. 

#2. Are you marking that you’ve been convicted of a felony? Don’t. You weren’t. They are going to assume the worse part of the charge, which can be a felony. 

If you can’t help yourself and feel you need to accurate, ALWAYS write MISDEMEANOR BEFORE THE CHARGE 

719.1 Interference with official acts.
1. A person who knowingly resists or obstructs anyone known by the person to be a peace officer, emergency medical care provider under chapter 147A, or fire fighter, whether paid or volunteer, in the performance of any act which is within the scope of the lawful duty or authority of that officer, emergency medical care provider under chapter 147A, or fire fighter, whether paid or volunteer, or who knowingly resists or obstructs the service or execution by any authorized person of any civil or criminal process or order of any court, commits a simple misdemeanor. In addition to any other penalties, the punishment imposed for a violation of this subsection shall include assessment of a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars. However, if a person commits an interference with official acts, as defined in this subsection, and in so doing inflicts bodily injury other than serious injury, that person commits an aggravated misdemeanor. If a person commits an interference with official acts, as defined in this subsection, and in so doing inflicts or attempts to inflict serious injury, or displays a dangerous weapon, as defined in section 702.7, or is armed with a firearm, that person commits a class ""D"" felony.
2. A person under the custody, control, or supervision of the department of corrections who knowingly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a correctional officer, agent, employee, or contractor, whether paid or volunteer, in the performance of the person's official duties, commits a serious misdemeanor. If a person violates this subsection and in so doing commits an assault, as defined in section 708.1, the person commits an aggravated misdemeanor. If a person violates this subsection and in so doing inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury other than serious injury to another, displays a dangerous weapon, as defined in section 702.7, or is armed with a firearm, the person commits a class ""D"" felony. If a person violates this subsection and uses or attempts to use a dangerous weapon, as defined in section 702.7, or inflicts serious injury to another, the person commits a class ""C"" felony.
3. The terms ""resist"" and ""obstruct"", as used in this section, do not include verbal harassment unless the verbal harassment is accompanied by a present ability and apparent intention to execute a verbal threat physically.

I come from places in the Midwest that have just gotten redder and redder. I think packing in the Caucus means Democrats have given up on Iowa, and maybe that's the right thing to do. 

No having the Caucus would be an economic loss  as well. It's the political Super Bowl every four years and leading up to it.

* At the same time, the state is [trying to move DNR park rangers out of the on-site housing for 26 state parks](https://www.thegazette.com/state-government/iowa-dnr-tells-rangers-to-move-out-of-state-owned-houses-at-parks/), because the houses need a total of around $1M in repairs. 
* Rather than repair the houses, the legislature wants to do away with on-site management for the parks. 
   * There are safety concerns in absentee management.
   * The houses will still be there, but will be uninhabited AND unrepaired, not to mention unsupervised.

 “More than 70% of Americans stand behind the current U.S. response to the war, but only 37% of Americans approve of the job the president is doing handling this issue,” said Danielle Lussier, Grinnell College associate professor of political science. “There is a disconnect.

Personally I agree with the majority on the weapons, troops, and refuge questions, but disagree with his overall handling.

"I can verify that it is still very much like this. I'm a low-tier corporate employee. I'm in and out of stores all over the Midwest on a daily basis, and I can safely say I'm one of the only corporate folks who ever speaks to a store employee. I have a lot of long discussions with department heads and rank-and-file employees. 

The general sentiment is that they're, at best, forgotten or overlooked. At worst, they feel like they are actively resented by the company they work for. Like, the stores would be so profitable if it wasn't for all these goddamned employees demanding paychecks and hours that make sense. 

And many massive fixes would be so easy to implement. There are tons of tiny tweaks that would vastly improve the working conditions for miminal or no cost, just changes in policies.

But the corporate culture doesn't like getting feedback, or cutting useless policies, or streamlining/improving existing processes for the employee's benefit. It's all new, new, new. 

Who cares that everybody's wasting hundreds of hours a year on pointless tasks and busy work? Who cares that an idea didn't pan out? We only look forward at Hy-Vee Corporate, towards the future and Marky Mark's guiding light. We never never look back, to the miles of burning wreckage behind us.

"The Driftless Half Marathon in northeast Iowa is the most beautiful race I've ever run!  You're along the Mississippi the whole way, and you run through some pretty woods and pastures, and along some riverside trails.  It's quite serene, especially with markedly less of the ""clamor"" that you usually get with races in the city.  There's only one (rather large) hill right at the halfway point, but you're surrounded by the famous hills of Iowa's Driftless region the whole way.  Plus the last few miles you feast your eyes on Lansing's beautiful river bridge in the distance, which is where the race finishes.


It's not really a landmark or 'famous' race by any means, and enrollment is typically pretty small.  But it's nice to see the grassroots effort of the community come together to put on this race.  I had such a great time!  And FYI northeastern Iowa is pretty different from the rest of the state.  You could easily spend the weekend of the race touring through the hills and creek valleys, not to mention the hiking and several local state parks.

"The caucus system for the numbers of Democrats that show up in Presidential years is completely untenable. Attend a presidential year caucus, and an off-cycle caucus, and it's eye-opening. The big years are insane complex logistical feats at every level trying to get not just a party vote, but a full sales presentation with a consumer survey over in as short a time as possible. **The caucus is an activist activity, not a straw poll.**

The state party wants enthusiastic voters and participants, which is a great aspiration, but they're *never* going to get enthusiastic small-d democratic participation out of more than a few handfuls of people per precinct - and these are the people who show up for off-year caucuses anyway. They want to be activists.

99% of the folks who go to caucus just want to vote and get out. I've got no problem with that - most of us want lives not centered around political activism. I still want them excited and eager to vote, but they often make terrible party instruments.\[edited for typo\]",t2_zm6rn,StephenNein,0,1648055708.0,0,t1_i1thw9h,i1thw9h,True,malus545,t3_tkwjcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tkwjcp/good_riddance_democrats_circulate_plan_for/,"Good riddance: Democrats circulate plan for changing 2024 nomination calendar, moving against Iowa and welcoming new early states",/r/Iowa/comments/tkwjcp/good_riddance_democrats_circulate_plan_for/i1thw9h/,48,r/Iowa,0,48

"I mean it's specifically written in Iowa law that our caucuses ""shall be at least eight days earlier than the scheduled date for any meeting, caucus, or primary which constitutes the first determining stage of the presidential nominating process in any other state, territory, or any other group which has the authority to select delegates in the presidential nomination.""

It's actually a ""Serious Misdemeanor"" (up to 1 year in jail, and a fine of $315-$1875) if a party official allows an Iowa caucus or primary to come after another state's.

">  The people who were laid off also didn’t make sense, some were very experienced and influential people, while some brand new (like literal days) employees are still there.

I am going to assume this is from a bottom line perspective. A lot of companies don't value long term employees. Experienced employees get paid more, have accrued more benefits, and often (if age is a factor) use more benefits like medical.

New, inexperienced, and young employees cost less in all 3 areas and are often seen as easier to manipulate into doing multiple people's jobs (and working crazy hours that the more experienced will not) just to show commitment or to impress management.",t2_12t3xj,MakeUSASmartAgain,0,1648050998.0,0,t1_i1t567j,i1t567j,False,Silver_Ad_8948,t3_tkike9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tkike9/whats_going_on_at_hyvee_corporate/,What's going on at Hy-Vee Corporate?,/r/Iowa/comments/tkike9/whats_going_on_at_hyvee_corporate/i1t567j/,5,r/Iowa,0,5

"I don't know shit about what's going on at the top, but as a customer, fuck them.

I transferred out of their pharmacy last week. I went to get my meds last week and they told me several wouldn't be done for 2 days. Typical. 

My mom went over 2 days later to grab the rest. The pharmacy tech fucking shrieked at her saying, ""I told your daughter they wouldn't be done until tomorrow!! I don't know why she's always sending random people over to get her prescriptions for her!"" The fuck? 1. That's not what she told me. 2. Just say they won't be ready until tomorrow. No need to be a hag. 3. The tech fucking knows its an hour drive for me to get my meds and she knows my mom was picking up the medication I'm required to take in order to drive -- the medication they refuse to fill until the day after it runs out 80% of the time. Sorry I'm fucking disabled, lady. If I knew it bothered her so much to have others pick up an RX, I'd have trotted the 50 goddamn miles there and back. 

They have the most incompetent grocery pick up, too. They either text you 800 times at 6 in the morning or they substitute completely whack products without telling you. Twice, I got home to find they didn't give me basic essentials like cat food or shredded cheese. Had they told me, I could have picked it up elsewhere while I was in town, but nope. Had to make a whole separate trip. The next time I tried using it, they substituted everything. Like nacho lunchables instead of  pepperoni pizza lunchables. My kid is lactose intolerant. She can't eat nachos! They subbed my cheese pizzas out for sausage pizzas. I don't eat meat. If you're going to sub a pizza, wouldn't you go for a cheese pizza of a different brand instead of using the same brand with a different topping? I complained and they offered to deliver the right items, so I forgave them. They called me back an hour later, changed their minds and told me I could come to the store to pick it out myself. Wtf?
