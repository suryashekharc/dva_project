"Update to my previous comment. Been watching newsmax pretty much everyday to get a good survey of their messaging. 

This is their delivery in a nutshell: incumbent politicians are terrible. All things bad occurring now are the direct result of Biden and Obama. These terrible things would never have occurred under Trump. Trump is good and genius. All others are bad and stupid. 

Most of the hosts denounce government and yet consider themselves proud ex service people (military or law enforcement) and proud of the government for being so great in their next breath. 

Wash, rinse, repeat every hour with different talking heads and some My Pillow commercials in between. You have Newsmax.

"Tons of people are saying that. And I actually just had commented again stating if you have any pitbull breed (terrier and bully’s) or really any breed that can be seen as intimidating or a dog that has ever showed any aggression then you should have it muzzled in public. I 100% support muzzle training. It causes no harm to the dog and has so many benefits. I also agree on getting dog fixed. Backyard breeding is a HUGE problem in the USA. Breeding should only be done by professionals that breed for temperament/health. 

And basically None of the dog attack/bite statistics are correct either but they are still used. It’s nonsense. You group 10+ breeds into one umbrella term (pitbulls) and then wonder why there stats are higher. Not to mention the misidentification of pits. Or that they don’t do any testing to see what breed the dog is they just assume/go off looks. And when a dog is “mixed” with anything but pitbull they never mention it. They will on mention it if it’s mixed with pitbull bc of the hate against the breeds. Also that’s not true an aggressive dog cannot pass, that will be failed immediately. aggression, Panic, avoidance will all result in failure. They test 10 different catagory to determine the results. They cannot force every owner to bring there dog to be tested but based of what multiple studies have been done “pitbull” breeds test pretty high and do well.",t2_j355ownf,Pure_Audience_9431,0,1648217012.0,0,t1_i22e26c,i22e26c,False,fofpunko,t3_tm1az2,https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/tm1az2/woman_has_both_arms_amputated_and_part_of_colon/,Woman has both arms amputated and part of colon removed after horrific dog attack,/r/southcarolina/comments/tm1az2/woman_has_both_arms_amputated_and_part_of_colon/i22e26c/,1,r/southcarolina,0,1

"My moms chihuahua (rip weenie) actually but my niece unfortunately. She only needed 2 stitches but it was 100% our fault. Dogs should not be left alone with children. And the dog even tho small should’ve been trained properly. Too many people believe small = easy when actually small dogs are typically harder to Train than large dogs, or they don’t get trained at all bc people think it’s fine since they are small. I truly believe 99% of dog attacks can be prevented. 

I live in an area with lots of dogs. I have a dog. And bully breeds are very popular here. I love all dogs I don’t care the breed. I use to walk a cane corso and he was a snuggle bug. But I ALWAYS carry a dog deterrent Device. It makes a ultrasonic noise that will stop any dog that I’ve used jt on in its tracks. I have stopped a dog attack before it got serious. I also carry a stun gun (this is more for humans but if I ever need to use it on a dog trying to attack me I will as last resort)  and dog deterrent air spray on me. Especially when with my dog. I had owners that where incredibly grateful I stopped there dog attacking me before it turned into an attack. Did I blame the dog? No not at all, if I was a unsocialized, anxious dog, that lived my entire life in the backyard I would also be aggressive. I’m a huge advocate for dogs being safely leashed no matter where at if outside, dogs being trained no matter size, positive reinforcement, and precaution. I encourage anyone who lives in a area with dogs to buy something to protect themselves or stop a dog attack. I’ve went out of my way and actually gave my elderly neighbor a ultrasonic dog device and spray for her safety bc we do have a lot of irresponsible owners with untrained dogs in my apartment complex. I will stop people if they try approaching my dog without asking and educate them on the dangers even tho my dog is really wonderful. If I see a dog unleashed I will say something. I hate irresponsible uneducated owners. Most people shouldn’t have a dog. If you want a good dog you have to be a good owner. I think it’s mandatory to walk a dog. Walking can help SO much with behavior, socializing, aggression, it’s amazing and should always be done. Another huge problem is owners in denial. They don’t want to believe there dog is showing aggression and in result lie about it knowingly or unknowingly. If your dog has ever shown aggression you should ALWAYS be taking extra precautions, make it known to the people around, muzzle your dog. Even if your dogs not aggressive but you have a bigger dog or a dog people may be scared of just bc of the breed, muzzle them. It dosnt harm the dog and it just makes everyone more comfortable. I’m actually going to be muzzle training my pup when she’s a tad bit older bc she’s still young. Not bc she needs it. But bc it will make other people comfortable. It will make sure nobody can lie abt my dog attacking and It’s beneficial in almost every way. Taking precautions and preparing is key when owning a dog. And the pitbull owners I personally know have very well trained pits. They take precaution, they know that there dog will not ever get another chance, they know people lie and make up nonsense (like the people in this thread) about them, and in reality they are discriminated against bc of there breed. And that’s why they work so hard with there dog and take extra precautions. All “pitbull” owners need to be aware of the stigma, and take extra precaution",t2_j355ownf,Pure_Audience_9431,0,1648215718.0,0,t1_i22b3sj,i22b3sj,False,fofpunko,t3_tm1az2,https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/tm1az2/woman_has_both_arms_amputated_and_part_of_colon/,Woman has both arms amputated and part of colon removed after horrific dog attack,/r/southcarolina/comments/tm1az2/woman_has_both_arms_amputated_and_part_of_colon/i22b3sj/,1,r/southcarolina,0,1

"I sure would hope that pitbulls stats are higher since it’s not just 1 breed they are counting. Dog bites/attacks are usually misidentified as pitbulls, and like I said before pitbulls are more than 1 type of breed. So meanwhile these stats have “labs, goldens, separated into there own specific category. They label all bully breeds and some terrier breeds into “pitbulls” . It would only make sense for there stat to be higher. And yet again pitbull breeds are the most abused dog. That’s a fact, so again, it would only make sense for them to have high stats on bites/attacks. Nobody is arguing “pitbull stats show they attack more”. That’s true.

When people blame “pitbulls” it’s so funny. It’s a general term for any terrier or bully breed. So when you sit here and say “pitbulls should die” then your saying terriers and bully’s need to die. I guess the awful mean pitbulls that score an average of 92.4% on the temperament test. “Pitbulls” are the most abused dog BREEDS. So what a surprise they become aggressive and snap. I mean if I were beaten and abused I’d definitely snap. If I were trained to attack I’d expect myself to attack. Like wtf. Some of y’all’s logic and statements are incredibly false and ignorant.  It’s comical how dumb people are. 🤣,t2_j355ownf,Pure_Audience_9431,1,1648168357.0,0,t1_i205lj5,i205lj5,True,fofpunko,t3_tm1az2,https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/tm1az2/woman_has_both_arms_amputated_and_part_of_colon/,Woman has both arms amputated and part of colon removed after horrific dog attack,/r/southcarolina/comments/tm1az2/woman_has_both_arms_amputated_and_part_of_colon/i205lj5/,1,r/southcarolina,0,1
"What your saying is false. There is clear evidence that “pitbull” attacks are mainly done by abused dogs. “Pitbulls” are not immune to pain. Im not sure where you heard that made up bullshit but that’s incredibly untrue. Pitbulls actually have one of the best temperaments. They rank the same as a Golden Retriever on the temperament test. Allowing children to “play” with dogs is ignorant no matter breed. Majority of Children don’t know how to interact with a dog, throwing yourself on them, pulling hair, ears, tails. Throwing stuff at them. Hitting them. What do you expect. Any dog would attack. When my brother was attacked by a lab it was his fault. He was trying to get on top of  the dog bc they were “playing”. I highly recommend looking up real stats instead of spreading false information. 

The owners should be blamed for this situation. The dogs need to also clearly be evaluated to see if it would ever be possible for them to be rehabilitated. The owner needs to pay for all medical expenses and damaged done to the victims. A dog should never be unleashed when in public or has any way to escape. That’s just ignorant. Oh and let’s not forget these dogs were not “just pitbulls”. That’s false. And they were not up to date on shots either, which is also a huge factor in the case. But y’all just gonna ignore that too.

"You just get home, curl up with your fur babies, and BREATHE. I went nuts. I went to a psych and got on meds. I swear, it helped tremendously. I was truly losing my marbles from the event that I blamed myself for. I'm still on those meds and will stay on them for the rest of my life.

"SC won't do it. As hard as they're trying to hobble so many minority votes with their God-awful voting rules, I pray to GOD that Democrats show up and stand their ground. You'll be not allowed to vote if you're caught giving somebody a bottle of water? The state of this country cannot get worse. I'm not OVERLY find of Joe Biden, but this is NOT his fault. Trump came in on the promise that he would ""end our involvement and bring the troops home"". Abandoning the Kurds with no notice was his big move? He KNEW that getting out of Afghanistan was going to HAVE to be fast. Getting our assets out of Afghanistan was impossible without attracting ISIS attention, so he passed the buck. Set a date for AFTER Biden was inaugurated. There was no way on EARTH to withdraw without attracting attention. Trump was testing the waters with Syria. He KNEW there was no way to make it work without casualties. ISIS was just hiding in the hills. Start moving out military equipment, and every terrorist in the mid east would advance.  Why do his loyalists not see that he LIED to them every day of his campaign, and every day of his Presidency? I used to be Republican. That ship has sailed. I'm not brilliant, but I've got enough gray matter to see right through the monstrosity that the Republican party has turned into. There certainly IS such a thing as ""too smart to be a Republican"". Trump just rallied in Florence. I wish they knew that was an INSULT. He panders solely to the uneducated white male, and racist, idiot blonde females. He will probably rally in agricultural communities from this point on. They're his cash cow. He hasn't done a hard day's work in his entire life, hasn't had a callous. But men that will maintain a farm with 18 hour work days will keep sending money to his PACs. And he has given NONE of that money to any other Republicans. One man donated 3 mil to help Trump prove that the election was fraudulent.. and he asked for his  money back after hearing Giuliani say ""we're not saying that it was a stolen election, but we're filing in all of these states so that you look into it. It couldn't be right that Trump lost by 8 million votes!"". Trump flatly refused to refund his money. That money goes straight into his "" Deutsch Bank Balloon Payment Fund"". All of these hard working people that are simply not smart enough to see through his ruse...will see the light one day.

The majority of insurrectionists arrested were found to not have even voted. It was the excitement that drove them there, and Trump had said over and over that the election would be fraudulent .. so WHY would his loyal followers even vote, when he drilled that into their half-empty heads for months?

"He just lost his mother in the most awful way possible. Ditch her cats? My once future hubby committed suicide in 2017, and I still have a lock of his hair in my wallet that I feel like I should give his daughter, but it's how I've hung onto a part of him. I cannot IMAGINE if it was one of my parents. I couldn't survive. The s young man is doing the very best he can with a traumatized brain and a destroyed heart. If I had the tires that would make it and the gas money, I'd have left Charleston to bring them home for a decent night's sleep, a decent meal and a sympathetic ear that gets a LITTLE of what he's suffered. Because he's finding nothing but awful when he was asking for help. I could NEVER speak to a 19 year old that has just suffered something so life changing and traumatic in such a callous way. If you have ever lived that nightmare, well.. I don't think you have. I pray that this young man and his traveling companions, including those cats that are probably IRREPLACEABLE to him, get to Florida unharmed, so they can just rest. About a year of decent rest might help him recover a LITTLE. And suicide can very much be a generational curse. Always assume that the child of a parent that has made that choice can be capable of the same. Be careful with words.

"Cool. So for the illegal immigration thing, border crossing illegally isn't where the majority of illegal immigrants come from. The majority of illegal immigrants in the country are those who came here legally via work visas and stay past their work visa's duration.

As for section 230, the more concerning thing isn't the banning of certain opinions from social media platforms, it is the legal ramifications. If a douche threatened to kill someone on Facebook or Twitter, Section 230 prevents Facebook or Twitter from being sued or whatever because of that speech because they did not make the threat, the person who made the threat would get punished. If it's repealed, if said threat is made (seriously or not) Facebook and Twitter would be the one found libel for the threat and not the person who actually made it.

It'd be more prudent to treat social media as public squares or forums, but then that gets iffy with the law as well. For example, in SC it's illegal to swear or display obscenities within hearing or viewing distance of a church, regardless if it's on public property.

"“Traveled” isn’t lived by the way. Indeed relatively isolated as I suspected. Then more racist presumptions which are again, very sad.

I’m going to guess as a physician I’ve earned substantially more by age 51 (age 26 at med school graduation and of course one would subtract the next 5 years of residency/fellowship when salaries are limited), not that any of that matters from individual to individual. The data I mentioned notes general race based trends. As one can see however, comments suggesting a person must have made more than another based purely on their respective race can be wildly inaccurate.

I also note I golfed with an Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon from Ghana(1 of 7 siblings or so) at our course in Evans G.A.(Augusta suburb) 16-18 years ago. We linked up randomly on the 1st tee and had a very pleasant few hours chatting and playing. Point is, people are people with a variety of views. It’s not a general consensus by native Africans that A.A.s are despised.

I think I’ve gone well past the point of useful discussion and I have some very important matters to attend to, so I’ll wrap up here. I will pray for you and hope perhaps some helpful experiences may be forthcoming. I have to be honest by saying “___ Bless” sounds a bit awkward coming from a person who carries so much instant disdain and low opinion(based on stated presumptions of blacks, well documented above). I think you’d find a nearly 0% accuracy when applied to me, my siblings, and many other blacks you haven’t had the opportunity to interact with.

"I think we should have a secure border and we should stop using federal taxpayer money to fly illegal immigrants to various cities around the US with no court date. Try crossing the border illegally into Canada or Mexico and see how fast you get deported. Insecure borders only bolster the human/drug/gun trafficking businesses. Nothing wrong with legal immigrants or refugees, I just don’t think that being poor and wanting to live in the US makes you a refugee.

The whole section 230 thing is complicated. I do believe that conservative voices and opinions are being censored on social media like Facebook/Twitter/YouTube, which is problematic. I completely get that companies like those can really put whatever they want in their EULA. If you don’t like it, use another platform. 

The issue I guess is that there are no other platforms that can really compete, probably due to the overwhelming popularity of FB/Twitter/YouTube. It’s almost as if there are five mega-corporations that share common ideals that have a monopoly over all internet services…

Someone once said “…don’t repeal section 230. If it gets repealed, they’ll literally ban all conservative influencers and creators instantly.” That might actually be a good thing and give other platforms enough users to actually compete with Facebook/Twitter/YouTube.

"I see a lot of people here saying ""too much red"" to get rid of Graham.  Frankly, those who are truly conservative and don't just ""vote Republican"" have been sick of Graham for as long as any of us knew anything about him.  As at least one comment pointed out, he's wishy-washy on everything.  You never know how he's going to vote or on what side of an issue he'll side with.

I believe most of the upstate conservatives would gladly vote for another candidate.  It seems we had 2 issues the last time or two that was attempted:

1. Too many opposition candidates in primary: We need to circle the wagons around 1 candidate that can oppose Graham in primaries, not be split among 3 or 4.
2. Upstate seemed to give the others a chance, but once you get to Columbia and east of that, it seemed folks were just going to vote for Graham, regardless.

But there is maybe a glimmer of hope, depending upon how you look at it.  I've at least heard a rumor that Graham won't run the next time.  No idea, maybe it was just a hunch by the person who mentioned it.  And maybe it wouldn't matter, because we seem to be good at putting up candidates who are experts at flip-flopping on various voting topics.

"The fact remains it's not my ass begging other people to come down to the level of the lowest in my race or culture to ""put us on even terms"" or stop holding us back with some imaginary hands! I have been self-employed for over 2 decades and have earned in my life more than you will probably ever see, I have traveled the whole of the US and spent much time in the UK. I have a ""Ture African"" as an eye doctor, that I can tell you for a fact hates the America Black, more than any KKK member ever could, I assume! Care to know why! His words "" Even as poor as my country and people was, we never begged the white west for welfare they offered, and what they offered, we used to get out of being poor and move on! The blacks' you guys have in America that live in the dream that they will overthrow the white race to enslave them, out breed them with the dumbest of your race while killing off their own and are somehow better than the very people whose table they sit under begging for scarps and refuse to leave. like starving dogs is appalling to my people!"" So as far as being ""uncultured"" as you seem think. It's more the fact that I have spent enough time around the black race (Working, training, traveling and avoiding) to see though it's veil of fakery that is pulled over the heads of most young whites, and lots of older rich ones! I see that in hindsight to the common belief that blacks are somehow better at this or that, it's more that, the majority of the white populist is fcking stupid, like high schoolers on a good buzz looking for someone just as stupid to hang out with. While they claim/Live on benefits from someone else's hard labor! Make no mistake about it, IMO Most of the white race today, walk on eggshells around the black race, like they are gods not to be offended and are scared to allow someone else to do it. Because they might have to man up and get off their knees at their feet! Then there are multitudes of strong people like me, that could watch the weak, stupid, and Beggers starve along with their offspring and would prefer to see them done away with in our culture.

It’s rather sad to hear commentary like this. The same can be said about views between several other demographic groups and may pertain to religions as well.

"I'm from eastern NC and have visited MB probably 3 dozens times or more. To preface my answer, I'll point out two things: 

Your experience anywhere you live will always be based on who, what and where you choose to engage. With that said, I live in Asheville which has been described as a ""cesspool of sin"". So if that's truly the case, then MB is a ring of Dante's inferno.

MB is your hopped up friend asking you to do key bumps with him in the bathroom at the strip club while talking you into paying for a VIP room and he will pay you back but never does. The friend that convinces you that shots at 10 am is a solid way to start your morning. The friend that asks you to go on a spontaneous adventure at 3 am knowing damn well there is no end goal and this is probably a terrible idea- but the chance of it being we exciting is way to good to pass up. MB is that friend that is so fucking fun but is incredibly exhausting because of it and you only see him once or twice a year. Myrtle Beach is fomo, a 4-loko and gritty ass cheeks. MB is ""let's see where the night takes us"". 

You're going to get to experience myrtle beach bike week spring rally and also Atlantic beach bike fest (look both of these up. I have been down there coincidentally on the latter and it was pretty damn wild! I didn't mind, but my parents.... Whooooo). Playing ""count the thongs showing while riding shotgun on the motorcycle"" during bike week is a fun one. Just dont make it a drinking game. You'll get blasted. 


Spring break used to be crazy at MB but a girl went missing there maybe 15 years ago and it got tamer... Can't say how it's like now because I'm in my mid thirties. 

I bet your parents bought a place in North Myrtle, which is ""nicer"" and where the older people live. South Myrtle Beach is pretty wild at night.

The traffic is terrible, you'll be surrounded by tourists all year long, but you'll be able to catch some cool shows at the house of blues and the comedy cabana. There's some nice strip clubs too. Plenty of delicious fresh seafood (shout out Mr Fish). 

Have fun, be safe, and never drink and drive down there. Don't buy drugs on the street. Go to the gold bar and don't order Mexican, ask for whatever the owners wife has made that day (they're South East Asian). Go hang gliding. Cruise the south strip in the evening.

I would not consider myrtle beach particularly safe, let alone attractive or a nice place. 

I grew up in rocky mount North Carolina, which is a total shit hole with terrible crime. I’ve never experienced any crime first hand despite living there. That doesn’t mean it’s a safe place. Crime rates are also indicative of other unsavory parts of a community and the community’s health in general, making them not a nice place to live.

I never really felt unsafe when i used to ride up and visit but then again i was always armed.

No i did not do the bike week crap i ride dual sports/dirt bikes and only really went that way to visit cigar shops or eat lunch when exploring the areas outside of town.

"Lucy! I am about to make you dislike me very much!

Let's start with why blacks are locked up so much more often than whites!

1. When the got damn cop says shut up......White people and even Latino's who got an IQ above 80 do it....Why because we both came from nations where law is respected, if not you got your ass beat! It Has been that way for 1000's of years. That shit is ingrained in our DNA, opening loud mouth lead to ass kicking!
2. When the LAWS state some shit is wrong to do ""We Don't do it""! Why = We don't care It leads to the answer to #1 Ass Kicking's by cops and time in a box!
3. If the law is DRUGS ARE NOT ALLOWED ""Most of us are smart enough to leave them the f@#k alone or move somewhere we can use them! Reason why = See Rules 1 & 2
4. Most whites and Asian's prefer to be home with our blood relations over running the streets were, YOU Guessed it, We have to F@#k with the cops! Why = See 1 & 2!
5. Are you starting to get the cause of why we don't get locked up as much as blacks! Answer = WE DON'T LIKE ASS WHOOPING'S, FINES & BEING LOCKED IN BOXES! So we follow the law and do not act fool as hell in public to draw their attention to us! We don't need to be ""RESPECTED"" now!  We earn it in time!

Next why do so many woman of other races die during pregnancy on this planet? I think that shit would have more to do with location and stress during said pregnancy. If your ""BABY DADDY"" out there running streets selling drugs, playing gangster, chasing white whores and you not knowing if his ass going to catch a beat down and some time in a box. I could see where that might cause some stress on a pregnancy! Coupled with the location of said woman during her pregnancy. Once again you forget that most people on this planet are not afforded the ""privilege"" of living in white 1st world nations, even if not at the top of the food chain, you still get the trickle down effect!

Next why do whites and Asians have more ""Value"" than blacks! Well as a poor white bitch my self long ago, I had to find the answer to this years ago! It's like this ""Rich or Privileged"" as yawl keep saying is just short for I don't care to save my money to have shit later in life but would rather have gold teeth, chains, big ass wheels on my car, loud ass stereo systems, and clout today and fuck tomorrow. when the first thing most whites and those of Asian decent think of is how much do I need to make life better and pull up from here! When my father passed he left nothing but debt. Why, Because like I heard Asian on you tube tell an African man about why Africa was in such bad shape! If someone would have given him $10 the night before, he would have dink it up that night, and thirst to death the next day! this seems to be something that is ingrained in to the black race the worst or at least the vast majority of it, and us whites have a few that are the same way! But for the better part we light skinned folks are less caring of trying to lead the pack with things that fade with time like Muscles and flashy shit! So we are more a tuned to things such as less labor for more gain and passive income hacks to life, i.e.' stocks, bonds, land, homes, and anything else that will improve our children's future and lessen their fight in this world! We just have a better grip on the live for our children mentality. Because they are not our way on to the government food chain for life! I have a life now. My Father could have never achieved in his lifetime because of his inability to control his drinking, but to some extent my grandchildren will benefit from my hard work and the things I didn't take part in though out my lifetime! If yours doesn't! Then that's on you, not me. Because flashy items, fake respect, and pussy, were more important to you, than savings, and investments were to you! this is just the real truth of it. No hate to you or anyone else at the bottom of life, but you...you alone are the reason your there! Not what happened to people in the past or somewhere else in the world!

"Some statistics regarding the “protected race”. There are many more, this is but a sample:

Incarceration rates per capita:

U.S. News - October 2021

-Black Americans are incarcerated at a state average of 1,240 per 100,000 residents 
-Latino Americans are imprisoned at a rate of 349 per 100,000 residents. 
-White, non-Latino Americans, meanwhile, are incarcerated at 261 per 100,000 residents.

“The report cites a number of causes for racial disparity within U.S. prisons. According to the report, the nation's history of white supremacy over Black people created a legacy of racial subordination that impacts their criminal justice outcomes today.”

“The report also asserts that communities of color, especially Black Americans, are negatively affected by biased policies and practices including police-citizen relations, pre-trial detention, the weight criminal history records can carry in sentencing and unequal prosecutorial charging.”

———————————————————————————————

Maternal mortality?

CDC September 2019:

-Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women – and this disparity increases with age, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report today in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

Most pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. Racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related deaths have persisted over time.

———————————————————————————————

Income?

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System - 2019

In the 2019 survey:

-White families have the highest level of both median and mean family wealth: $188,200 and $983,400, respectively 
-Black and Hispanic families have considerably less wealth than White families. Black families' median and mean wealth is less than 15 percent that of White families, at $24,100 and $142,500, respectively.

CRT is learning about the lives of people just as poor, but had to experience potential lynching randomly, arrested falsely, prohibited from buying homes because of skin color, denied GI benefits because of skin color, denied entry into most colleges for most of the 20th century, continuing to receive disproportionate prison sentences, etc., etc.

"There were warning signs in Utah to not feed. They'll start to associate humans with food, actively seek them and their products out instead of the natural food sources. They end up starving or being euthanized because they raid garbage cans looking for those human treats and eat the plastic bag or wrapper and clog up their digestive system. Same way your dog will eat the meat wrapper from the grocery store. Smells like meat, taste kind of like meat, guess I'll eat it. Only in the deer's case it was nipchee crackers. It's not the food that kills, it's the behavior it causes.

"The only bar I’ve been to in Anderson proper is Bauernhaus, which was pretty good. You’re also around 30-45 minutes from downtown greenville, which will also be worth checking out. 

For hiking, Table Rock is great, and you aren’t too terribly far from Jones Gap, which is beautiful. Paris Mountain is also on the greenville end of things, and has some nice hiking trails. 

You’ll also be pretty close to some nice lakes in Anderson. Lake Keowee is great for swimming, and if you like flat water kayaking Keowee and Jocasee are both great.

This is similar to the pigeon problem in NYC and the Canada Goose problem in some parts of the SF Bay Area.
