"This is the better choice, we NEED more affordable housing and we NEED it close to where people working jobs that need affordable housing are working. A good start would be an immediate temporary ban on all new luxury apartments, lax zoning rules and increase incentives for building decent affordable apartments. Hell they could even do something crazy like incentivizing office jobs to move to all work from home and convert the massive offices into apartment buildings. Plus, it wouldn't hurt to make laws prohibiting wealthy people who can afford said luxury apartments from taking up all the affordable housing so save a buck while someone ends up living on the street as a result.

I am trying to finally move out of my parent's house and that simply isn't possible with rents for stupidly low end single bedroom apartments being nearly a grand a month with virtually nothing included with experts saying it will only continue going up for the foreseeable future on top of all the other outrageously expensive things in this state like our out of control car insurance on top of other issues like the rising gas prices and costs for essential goods going up. People love to bitch about so many young millennials and gen z living at home but continue going out of their way to make it so they can't leave unless they are lucky to either have well off parents to help them out or just get lucky in general.

Even working an 18$ and hour job feels like I am not making enough to get by. We need a different kind of change. Also, the reason this country doesnt feel free is because to mich diversity= less freedom. Look at the ""cancel""culture. Whats free about canceling things that were already writen. Books are peoples stories whether they are fantasy or real. Just like movies. Yet, we dont see them trying to cancel racism, rape, sexism, drug use, and selling sex on the TV screen or music videos. But, it's ok to get rid of books with inapropriate imagies or words in them? Here is a thought.

"The BBB Bill doesn't get passed because everyone with a hint of brain power knows it is BS.  The offsets are by cutting spending on project ''A"" for 10 years to offset the cost of project ""B"" for 1 year.  That isn't offsetting, and would cost Trillions of dollars once again.  

The original cost was included in the Covid relief funds, and that bill was basically printing money.  If the country is running at a deficit, and spending is done without cutting it elsewhere, it has to be printed and dilutes the dollar.

"The general reporting is when the Child Tax Credit went away in January, child poverty across the nation went up 47% practically overnight.

In a vacuum, that is **fucking awful** and government can and should be addressing that, especially in the ""richest/most powerful nation in the world"".

MIGOP right now are pushing a $500 child tax credit as part of their **STATE** tax reform, as a sort of bridging-the-gap peace offering of ""look we care about this"".

I need to emphasize this loudly:

That is _pissall_.


The Child Tax Credit that just expired federally was:  
- $3,600 for children under the age of 6   
- $3,000 for children aged 6 to 17.  

And to pass this tax reform, they want to lower the CORPORATE tax rate 2.1% (or 37% of what it currently is, take your pick for scarier number).

Some of the commissioners have been working full time during this whole thing. Some have attendance at 50% or worse. Some have never even been to any of their in person meetings despite all the COVID safety precautions that have been in place. If there are no rules in place for their attendance or attention to their job why should they be allowed to give themselves a pay raise? What’s stopping them from raising their salary even higher? Their salary is pegged by the constitutional amendment to a certain percentage the governors salary. That’s what the people voted for.

" I'll bite. There are actually a lot of cases where certain speech is, or may be, illegal -

""Categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment (and therefore may be restricted) include obscenity, fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law, true threats, and commercial speech such as advertising. Defamation that causes harm to reputation is a tort and also an exception to free speech.""

Not sure what you're referring to in your comment since, obviously, hurt feelings, in and of themselves, don't mean a crime has been committed. The issue at play in this article is that it can likely be successfully argued that a **government employee** violated free speech by contacting this person's employer.

If your point is that people need to toughen up then all I can say is that if you want to throw sticks and stones, expect to catch a few yourself. You're not protected from other private citizens and entities, except in the above-quoted section. If a fellow parent had contacted this woman's employer instead of a school district employee, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

"> An extra boost in child tax credits relieved financial stress for Michigan families who used the monthly payments on the basics — food, rent, child care, utility bills and clothing. 
> 
> That's according to a March report from the nonprofit Center for the Study of Social Policy about how temporary expansions in the child tax credit and child care helped Michigan families as they faced the economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
> 
> Among the findings in the report: 
> 
>*  A little more than half of Michigan families surveyed said they used the child tax credit on food and groceries. Meanwhile, 40% reported using the payments for their rent and mortgage; 36% for child or day care; 36% for phone, internet and utility bills, and 29% for shoes and clothing. 
> * Nearly 90% of Michigan families said the child tax credit made them feel ""a little"" or ""a lot"" less stressed about money, authors said. What's more, Black and Latino families were more likely to say the payments were ""a lot"" more stress relieving than White families, with similar results for households making between $10,000 and $35,000. 
>* Half of parents with kids under 5 said they had a difficult time finding child care. Access to child care is linked to work. A staggering 80% of parents said child care related challenges disrupted their ability to work; 78% said they reduced their work hours at some point, and 49% said they had to quit a job in the past because of child care issues.

"What is your solution? Because the reason those patients were not hospitalized because they were not ill enough to be in the hospital, which is why their nursing home was the only place that they could go back to absent their family or parents removing them.

"Medical provider here. 
The concept is nice - healthcare for everyone. 
The problem is two fold - well more than that but let’s simplify it. 
The reimbursement rates would be similar to Medicare/Medicaid. This pay out is lower than private insurance. This will in effect cause the system to go bankrupt without an increase in inflows. 
Even without an increase in reimbursement Taxes will be HUGE.  If health insurance costs around 10k per year per person and Michigan has 10 million people - that’s 100 billion dollars in extra taxes per YEAR.  Remember - the government is the people. So government funded healthcare is people funded health care. Aka - your paying for the healthcare yourself.  Everyone will be on the hook for 10k per year out of your paycheck per person. So if your a family of four then expect 40k of extra taxes. Oh - and since it will be like Medicare - you still owe 20% out of pocket.

"My wife and I get our insurance through her employer. We pay heavy premiums because we opted for the best insurance we could get. We both have health problems, so in spite of the premiums being high, our out of pocket cost is far, far less than if we had higher copayments. It covers hospital stays, procedures and lab work at 100%. With the negotiated cost between the hospitals and the insurance company the amount the insurance pays is about 15-20% of the billed amount from the hospital. Insurance on average pays out ~$150-300k/year for my care alone. I generally have two inpatient stays per year of varying lengths of time. I don’t know what her care costs, but I’d estimate it at about $30k/year. She had emergency back surgery a couple of years ago. Between that and the hospital stay that alone was well over $400k alone, not to mention physical therapy, 6 months of in-home care while she recovered and the loss of income during that time. 

Single payer would likely destroy us financially if we weren’t able to keep our insurance. I’m incredibly torn, though. Single payer would be a godsend to most people and I am a firm believer in sacrifice for the greater good. I’m not against single payer healthcare at all - it needs to happen, but it could also completely destroy us financially. I’d likely reduce my care which would shave years off from my lifespan.",t2_r1f60,fdc7719,0,1648210182.0,0,t1_i2205f6,i2205f6,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_tn9ych,https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/tn9ych/singlepayer_healthcare_bill_to_be_introduced_in/,Single-payer healthcare bill to be introduced in Michigan House,/r/Michigan/comments/tn9ych/singlepayer_healthcare_bill_to_be_introduced_in/i2205f6/,1,r/Michigan,0,1

"The above post is a great example of :Tell me you know nothing about Michigan politics without saying “I know nothing about Michigan politics.”

Gretchen has been preparing to campaign for governor her entire political career. She visited every county in the state when she was campaigning. Abdul did not campaign outside of major metro areas, he thought he could send Michael Moore to Traverse City and win the northern Michigan dem vote. He thought he could trot out Bernie at the last minute and that would save him. He committed all kinds of unforced errors on a Twitter feed, including accusing Gretchen Witmer of money laundering, which he quickly deleted after he got absolutely dragged on social media. Even with the Pod Save bros essentially endorsing him, Bernie sanders, and other people with national recognition, he still couldn’t win the nomination. He did not listen to the old adage that is “all politics is local.“ And he paid for it at the polls. 

Every prominent Democrat in the state, including the Michigan Democrat black caucus, endorsed Gretchen Whitmer because she had been spending her career building relationships with these people. The fact is, voters just did not like his platform as much as Gretchen Whitmer’s and he did not run a campaign as good as Gretchen Whitmer.  Most people outside of Detroit and GR had no clue he was even running. It is not a conspiracy that she had more support among Michigan Democrats, since she had actual relationships with these people. Gretchen started her career from the bottom and worked her way up, which is often how these things work. Abdul has never held elected position in his life.

"Main takeaway narrative (as far as the data shows): officers *caught* ""only"" amount to 5%, and even doubling false negatives gives us ""only"" 10% high risk cops. See just a few bad apples we will step up our vague efforts and you'll see how awesome we can do, or forget about it, either way is cool.

Actual Main takeaway narrative (as far as the UNSHOWN data ""shows""): 10% is absolutely appalling in its own right,  but even worse and more insidious it establishes a ""critical minority threshold (CMT)"" (sciencedaily.com 7/26/11) where a passionate 10% can drive the ""undecided"" to passively support their agenda (spoiler: the cop with 83 UNPUNISHED sexual assault complaints is waaayyy more passionate about continuing his behavior than Joe Goodcop cares about ""cleaning up the force""). (Edit: a newer-ish study from the Atlantic 6/7/18 changed the number to 25%, though I feel this does nothing to decromulate my point). I also didn't see the ""moderate/low risk"" numbers. What's the criteria for those categories? Come to think about it I'm now wondering why the headline wasn't ""95% of officers shown to pose NO risk to the public at large"" maybe because the number of ""zero risk"" officers is even more appalling than high risk? I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess... *zero* ""zero risk"" LEOs? And finally -obviously most glaringly- these ""few bad apples"" rack up dozens of complaints looks like damn near all of them are substantiated but *hand wave* ""qualified immunity. Ooooh, aaahhh"" ""You see, Officer Hasapointtoprove NEEDS to kill innocent children and rape trafficked sex slaves cause otherwise the bad guys win"". Well we all see the ""bad guys"" ARE the Watchers on the Wall! Now what?!? You don't need to ""step up [your] efforts to find bad cops"" or ""repriortize community based policing (i.e. really teach cops not to rape or murder random people/kids but like for super duper cereal this time!! I mean it! Stop laughing or you'll get me going Farva!)"". Seems like they do a great job finding them, that one dude was ""found"" 83 times! Then what? Buehler? 

Tldr - the bunch is spoiled and open criminals are in charge of (at least) Detroits police force. Cops arent pigs, they're wolves masquerading as sheep dogs. We are their prey.

Edit: As i meditated on this situation I was struck by how eerily similar it is to the premise of the movie Assault on Precinct 13 (set in coincidentally... Detroit. Also you get to see Laurence Fishburn fucking blast a guy with a molotov cocktail at like point blank range. TBH, I expected nothing from this film nd it mega over delivered in a surprising and great way. Just a good by-the-books they got us surrounded action/suspense movie), snd does a great job showing how the cops want you to think ""so what the good guys gotta do bad things to catch the bad guys, just let them do their jobs!"", and how disastrous worldview is for random innocent people and ironically makes it easier for the ""bad guys"" to do their thing.

Edit 2: CMT is based on standard distribution patterns that show for a given policy 20% of the people will be pretty ""for it"", 20% will be ""against it"", and 60% really don't care ""undecided/independent"". Basically, all you need is for half of your side to get suuuuper fired up about your thing and then the ""independent"" dominoes will start falling to your side as well whether curiosity, legitimate persuasion, or even just to shut those loud people up and suddenly even some of the other 20% start to switch over because no one likes to be on the losing side. Boom, suddenly your tight 10 person friend group seems to mostly only do what the 2 new guys like to do, and when you casually brought it up everyone said you're being paranoid, but later your friends started a new group chat with the 2 new guys but not you, and was that a new inside joke you didn't get? 

It's like that except instead of ""I thought we were getting pizza and watching Severence"" it's ""I thought we were NOT raping and murdering children. Wait a minute! Have you all been hanging without me?!?""",t2_agh64,mcnathan80,0,1648180818.0,0,t1_i20w8jd,i20w8jd,True,asanefeed,t3_tn8k8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/tn8k8r/detroit_police_identify_128_high_risk_officers/,Detroit police identify 128 'high risk' officers following 7 Investigation,/r/Michigan/comments/tn8k8r/detroit_police_identify_128_high_risk_officers/i20w8jd/,7,r/Michigan,0,7

"We agree, the system needs to be changed. I'm a physician, I have to deal with these animals at the insurance companies all day. I say rip off the band-aid and get it over with. 

If people knew how much they actually pay for healthcare, they'd realize theyd actually get money back instead of higher taxes. For my family, it costs $1200 per month insurance. No, that's not an error and yes, that's the market rate, I've checked. It's actually the going rate. The thing is, since employers pay the insurance before the employees see their paycheck, they don't even know that's how much it really costs.

If my employer pays it, I'm none the wiser. If single payer could save even 10% of that by cutting out the bloat in the system, I'd actually get the $120 difference in my check every month (assuming employers would be compelled to pass along the savings).

Part of the reason wage earners haven't seen real raises in years is partially due to healthcare. Companies are paying more, per employee, but it all gets eaten up by the insurance premiums before employees see a dime.

I have no compassion for the dogs at the insurance companies. They kill people. Theres extra steps involved but through their business practices, people die earlier and more miserably.

Prime example: prior authorizations... People say ""we don't ration care in America!"" Yes we do. Absolutely. When someone has a condition that needs a higher cost diagnostic/treatment, the companies will wait 2 weeks, send the doctor a form to fill out to justify why they need the test. Seems simple but it isn't: usually the justification is already documented in the office notes already sent in, so their form is duplicating work. The form itself is ever changing, so you can't just have it ready to send in with your office note ahead of time. They'll wait 2 weeks to send it, then give you just a few days to respond or they'll deny it and force you to start over. Even if you do fax it on time, they'll conveniently ""not receive"" the fax. So you have to try again and have your staff call them to make sure they got it. And then they'll make the doctor do a ""peer to peer"" discussion to go over why the person needs the test/treatment. And it's not like it's some expert youre talking to, usually it's someone in a totally different specialty who can't deviate from whatever algorithm is already written out for them (i.e. not your ""peer"") And maybe, MAYBE  after all that they'll approve it. Nothing in that process is reimbursed to the doctor for their time either... The whole process is geared to waste doctor and his/her staff's time so that eventually you give up and don't order the test/treatment because you've got to move on to other patients otherwise you'll actually lose money trying to fight them for every single one of your patients. 

And then everyone wonders why physicians are burning out and there's a physician shortage. The whole system is garbage, I hope it all burns down.

That is a potentially a lot of job loss, add a tax increase, and stiff lobbying opposition makes it nearly impossible. Systemically it helps small employers who don't have the economy of scale to negotiate better deals with BCBSM, local businesses are the **local** economic engines. Big businesses are the ones who can afford to lobby, and they also disproportionately benefit from a class of people who cannot afford to go without healthcare.

"On \#3, it's not really fair to compare it to power generation at scale.  Power production at scale is magnitudes more efficient

A better comparison would be running a personal generator to charge the vehicle.  Ironically, it ends up being reasonably close to the same energy use mathematically to charge an EV as run an ICE when comparing personal sized engines.  

EVs aren't really any more energy efficient at the personal level, they can just offload the energy production to much more efficient methods.  They're also not locked into needing a supply of dead dinosaurs to keep running since power is power no matter the source.  Solar, wind, geothermal, coal, nuclear, or natural gas all turn into the go juice, so sourcing electricity with more green friendly methods compounds on top of the already gained efficiency at scale.

"Just so you're aware, this is a reduction in pollution no matter how you lay it out. 

1 - This production is going to happen regardless.  Where do you think that production would cause less overall pollution, here in the US with it's moderate environment laws (which are no where near as robust as many other western countries), or China where their pollution controls are basically ""Let's turn off some of the factories in the summer when the winds don't blow them away as quickly""? 

2 - Shipping the final product from Warren to a US based EV battery facility is far less than from China to those same facilities. 

3 - This should speed along the transformation to EV and away from ICE vehicles.  And to give you an idea of how inefficient ICE vehicles are, it would be more energy efficient to burn gasoline at a power plant, send that hundreds of miles over power lines to your house, charge a car with it and use that. 

So unless your argument is literally ""Not in my backyard"", you're pretty much wrong no matter how you slice it. And if that is the crux of your argument, that you'd rather there be more pollution overall as long as it's away from you, then you officially are part of the problem.",t2_4iy1z,msuvagabond,0,1648144666.0,0,t1_i1yjlh0,i1yjlh0,False,msuvagabond,t3_tlpf38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/tlpf38/michigan_will_get_a_new_graphite_processing/,Michigan will get a new graphite processing factory to support US EV battery production,/r/Michigan/comments/tlpf38/michigan_will_get_a_new_graphite_processing/i1yjlh0/,2,r/Michigan,0,2
