"As do we all, right? I wish I could take this sweet boy (my heart and home belongs to my 10-year old American Bully, Anastasia and she’s not okay with competition.) I adopted her after breaking up with a boyfriend who had a beautiful red nose, Bella. After the breakup I realized I missed the dog so much and opened up Pet Finder. Swiped right, love at first sight. Boyfriend and I got back together. We tried to introduce the dogs. I spent close to 5k sending them to board and train together with a very reputable trainer. They came home, we took Bella out of her crate to pee the first morning, Ana walked right in her crate and pissed in it. We kept them on separate levels of the house after, but this wasn’t sustainable and they got at each other while I was bringing laundry down the stairs. Myself and my boyfriend’s roommate were able to detach them, after much time and a lot of dramatic tussling. It was really awful. My girl, who is 50 am staff and 50 pit, 75 pounds, solid like a fire hydrant, sank her teeth into Bella’s neck and just would not let go. I still have scars, minor, and both dogs were fine, but they could not live together. I bring this up because I see a lot of pit hate on Reddit and it breaks my heart. I was never a dog person until I lived with a pit. They have personalities that rival most humans I know. They are silly, smart, loyal. Affectionate, inquisitive, psychologically complex. But they also weigh 75, 100, 120 pounds. Their skulls are like cannon balls, their teeth like alligators’. My dog is not allowed around my niece or nephew, my brother or sister in law, strangers in general. But she is a pad of butter with me, multiple ex-boyfriends, my mom and dad, and the vet as well as everyone at the vet’s office, including people in the waiting room and receptionists. I’m not sure where this comment turned into a PSA about pits, but it did. Pits are fantastic dogs. Literally, the best. But they are strong and many have had a lot of wrong done to them. My girl is fantastic and I wouldn’t trade her for the world. But she was rescued from an abandoned, boarded up home in East Cleveland and had kennel cough, visible ribs, and bald spots from sitting in her own urine. She visibly flinches if I reach, in a certain way, to pet her while she’s sleeping. She cannot live with another dog in the home and needs new humans to be introduced slowly. But she is the most pure example of unconditional love I have found on this earth. Adopt pits but respect them. Chihuahuas have such shitty dispositions, comparatively, but they can’t do nothing.

"You know that you can still get hurt pretty bad even if it doesn’t kill you, right?

You’re right, in terms of actual deaths, it’s not a lot of people. Turns out that after childhood, humans are typically stronger than dogs. 

4.7 million dog bites annually. It’s not uncommon. So why would you choose to expose yourself and your loved ones to the breed that tends to be the most aggressive and has a strong, unrelenting bite? Why would you risk them getting seriously injured, even if not killed, when you could choose not to?

"I can’t speak for all shelters. I am just familiar with the process for volunteering at Hamilton County and IndyHumane. It is intense. There are different types of volunteer positions and I know about the animal handling ones well. You have to take a 6 week class, you have to sign up for a certain amount of shifts and you have to commit to a certain amount of months. It’s pretty intense. The workforce is like 90% volunteers and only 10% paid staff so they really need dependable, regular volunteers. That said, there are one off volunteering opportunities too and parent and child ones so there are a lot of choices. But yeah, the bulk of the work is dedicated volunteers. I stopped volunteering for them when I got a full time job so my numbers might be slightly off though IndyHumane has all the stats and their financials on their website.

"People should really read the description. I’m 5’1” female and would not adopt an animal that I can’t physically control. (I mean, if I had advanced dog handling trainings maybe). Even the nicest dogs are set off by the weirdest things. I had a shelter dog that was a sweetheart but hated things with wheels (skateboards, strollers, etc.). Rocky seems to have the same reactions and honestly, just from the pics, I am not sure I would be able to hold him back. More important than a dog being adopted is that the owner understands and can meet the needs of the dog. You see videos of dogs attacking and their owners can’t stop them. That’s the worst case scenario. I volunteered at the Hamilton Co Humane Society in the past and they treat the animals really well there so I would rather it takes more time for him to find a good match than just be adopted out due to time/space restraints.

Don’t get me wrong, a profile from an agency that wants to get this dog into your home as quickly as possible having to write “no sudden moves, loud noises” etc…well that’s not a good sign and hints to some previous abuse. If there’s anything that a person can point to more than “don’t like that breed for prejudice pushed by morons like peta”, it’s that. That, more than anything else is why this dog is still in the shelter.

I’d like to add to this by suggesting a short term foster program for those who can’t long term foster or adopt. Many shelters have programs that allow you to take home a foster pup for a weekender/overnighter. It’s a great way to get pets out of the shelter for a short break. Not only does it help gather information about a pup in a home setting but it also serves as an effective marketing tool by 1) getting the pup out in public 2) pics and videos taken during the overnighter/weekender can help the shelter promote the pup.,t2_a5t5zsd,Jteslaa,0,1648242312.0,0,t1_i245h9s,i245h9s,False,Jteslaa,t3_tnqkji,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/tnqkji/rocky_has_been_waiting_nearly_a_year_to_be/,Rocky has been waiting nearly a year to be adopted.

Plenty of dog breeds have been reared over centuries to be genetically inclined to have certain temperaments or do different behaviors, such as herding. That’s not controversial until it comes to Pit-bulls, when suddenly it’s all how you raise them

Like bro it’s literally in their name. Pit. Bull.

No Bro. I think you're out of your depth here. I already stated in the original comment you replied to that I think it's a misapplication of States' Rights to limit interracial marriage. The point that Braun was making was one of the role of the state vs the fed. His words are being twisted to make it sound like he doesn't support interracial marriage.

"Ive got some good news and I’ve got some bad news.  The good news is we found the person responsible for the death of the late Casey the all gray cat.  The bad news is that, unfortunately like so many other cat owners in this country, it is with a very heavy heart I inform you, that it was your actions, and your’s alone  that ultimately cost your furry companion, in this instance to suffer what was surely the unnecessary loss of it’s life.  A fate that should have, and possibly could have been avoided.  I feel compelled to speak truthfully, as I believe the choices made by so many in this world to which we find ourselves living.  In regard to this topic, it’s the result of pure ignorance as to the reality that the actions we ourselves have taken with reckless abandon without respect to the inherent responsibilities that come with those actions.  As to those that come with cats, the more notable being for one thing, the world is not a litter box.  Despite the masses of cat owners spanning the globe trying so hard to make it such, like so many other lazy and irresponsible things we do, it has failed from day one.  Cats are not, nor were they ever “designed,” to roam free after their domestication well over a thousand years ago, and probably against their own will in the first place.  Some may make the arguments with topics of pest control, rats, mice, and what have you, while simultaneously ignoring the biggest aspect of that argument being that an urban environment with thousands of men, women, and children, traveling to and fro, a lot of which is done in large fast moving vehicles, where so many of these cats suffer a fate not fit for a living creature.  That cat, that is struck, and laying in the gutters of our roadways, with two broken legs, or a broken back, is laying there, in the elements, dying in agony, often time alone.  That happens every day in the country, in every city from coast to coast, because we the owners, who claim to love our pets, can’t manage to do this simplest of things to ensure that the animals which we so arrogantly claimed for our own, have a full life such as they deserve, which our actions work to create.  Is my opinion harsh, or the words of someone who isn’t an animal person, not even a little bit.  I’m on the end of the spectrum where anyone that chooses to be an animal owner should be, if they weren’t irresponsible, and downright so selfishly oblivious when it comes to the responsibility of their actions.  Particularly when it comes to the consequences for everything around them that affects others, especially the living things we SHARE this planet with.  If you feel like that’s harsh, tell that to the 530,000 cats, and the 390,000 dogs that get euthanized in this country alone, every year, year after year.  I can’t speak for you, or anyone but myself, but if it disgusts me having the burden of knowing these things, almost as much as the people who could absolutely care less as to whether something lives or dies, so long as they don’t have to wash it off their tires, or step in a pile of dogs shit.  Which by the way, came from an irresponsible persons actions, but is just an example of karma as well as a reminder to all those that think just because you don’t want any part in something happening in this world, doesn’t mean that you will not suffer from the consequences of your choice to act or not.  All of which is a choice, even choosing to do nothing, you are as part of the problem, as your not part of the solution.  What we touch in this life, also touches us, it just so happens that these people were touched by loss, others with the desire to do more, and some to step in shit, as their actions so deservedly bring to their doorstep.  Personally it pains me to see all the ways in which we as a species, fail everything in the world around us, especially those around us we share the world with.  Not emotionally, but physically.  I have two cats, and a dog.  I’m a mail carrier for the United States Postal Service, and despite the large amount of dogs I cross on my path daily, some of which have chosen to try and attack me, a result of their owners irresponsibility, I’ve made the choice never to spray a single one of them, such as they only do what they’re taught.  It’s not personal, nor is it malicious in it’s intent, and it would never happen if it weren’t for human failures.  I don’t know of any dog or cat that would cross the path of a person lying in the gutter of this planet starving and dying that probably wouldn’t do something to help out if they could, even if it meant just sitting there with you so you wouldn’t have to suffer alone.  No one had to teach the dog the character trait of compassion it takes to make the choice to starve on the corner alongside the homeless man you see on your way to and from work.  It does that naturally, and it even does it with a smile.  Animals deserve better, especially since we give them no say in the matter.  Are we better than this world that we’ve created, such as many people argue we so often deserve better than we are given, or is the world such as it is, because we all have gotten what we so sadly deserve?  Unfortunately, the only innocence to exist in all of this, are the animals that suffer it’s fate, and our children  we bring into this world to inherit once it’s our time to go, the trees that bare the fruit of our labors,  fields our actions served to seed,  and the world in which we live and harvest, the result of everything we chose to sew.",t2_grs8mq14,JunkinJakeJones,0,1648239944.0,0,t1_i23zqc4,i23zqc4,True,redfiesta44,t3_tn8fk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/tn8fk1/we_have_a_serious_crime_problem/,We have a serious crime problem,/r/Indiana/comments/tn8fk1/we_have_a_serious_crime_problem/i23zqc4/,-1,r/Indiana,0,-1

"So, just for the sake of understanding where the line between good and evil exists,

If I own a single family home that I rent...evil

If I own a duplex home that I rent...?

I I own 2 duplex bricks next to eachother and rent 4 domiciles....?

If I own a early 20th century 3 story 8 bedroom home that is converted to 4 apartments to provide lower emissions, higher density living....?

If I own a 4 story apartment building with 16 aparments....good?  


I guess I hadn't considered renting a single family home so cut-and-dry.    A family has special needs for an enclosed yard?  Needs more bedrooms than are commonly available in apartments?  Will only be in the area a limited time (college, work, etc.)  Can only be on the ground floor so many apartments are not viable?   ....All these various scenarios seem reasonable that one might want to rent a house rather than an apartment but I guess that's wrong.

"Considering that Republicans were pretty much hell bent on creating their own dictatorship though on January 6th and even now to seal their gerrymandering and control of the rural states doesn't say much for their party. They're pretty much out of ideas and philosophically bankrupt when it comes to new ideas. It's like a traditional Republican that I knew had to admit about 2006 or 2007 once said that ""Democratic Party had better ideas"" and that's when you know that a political party is headed down the tubes. After all the Republican have had 15 years since Bush and they've went farther and farther to the right to the point that Joe Biden who is a moderate politician almost slightly right is considered a communist even though he's a moderate capitalist. 

The left wing is always associated with communism but they're more on the lines with European style democratic socialism where people still have private property rights and self choice and not some sort of Venezuela type of social control or even worse that of Russia or China. The Republicans have gotten to the point that they were trying to establish a personality cult with Trump and they still have 30 to 40 percent of the people that aren't smart enough to realize that Trump is only totally out for himself and himself only partially to avoid prosecution but also to please his master Putin who also with Trump wanted NATO gone. The goofballs think that the personality cult is actually something that would benefit them but isn't all that much different than the personality cults that surround Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin. The only difference is the countries and political systems and some ideology but a dictatorship is still that no matter how much you want to act that it isn't a personality cult. Having people wearing red hats doesn't exactly inspire logical or rational thinking and using facts, figures and logic. Its done to create a system of fear and intimidation and cult like status not much different than people wearing Mao suits or Kim Jong Un pins. 

Furthermore, the right doesn't seem to have any valid ideas anymore other than to use perpetuated myths about everything being communist like a Red Scare of the 1920s and 1950s. They have no real policies which improve the lives of the middle and working class and generally support the top 5 percent or maybe 10 percent while not giving a hoot and a holler about the other 80 percent. They've been able to bamboozle people into thinking that they're part of the ruling class just by putting an R by the name and in Indiana people think that an R is going to be for the little guy. The Dems are far from perfect as they tend to be centrist with a increasing left wing but at least they've tried to have policies that are beneficial to working and middle class individual and families. The Republicans rely on racial animosity, bitching about CRT and dog whistles to keep their increasingly polarized and weakening base from falling apart since they have no real platform or ideas.

"It depends on how the law is instituted.



[Congress actually had a report issued about a year ago](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10655). 

A simple removal from the Controlled Substance List by the DEA or FDA won't be enough and neither would a similar bill in Congress. The DEA and FDA can't because the Constitution does not grant the Executive Branch the authority or power to change the law of the states. 

The reason why Congress can't is a bit different. They have the ability to require states follow the laws passed, but the CSA states that it does not preempt state laws unless there's a positive conflict. Basically, states can make a substance illegal that's not federally controlled, but they can't do the inverse. 

However, this does not mean it's impossible for Congress. It just means they can't just remove it from the list to make marijuana legal across the country. If Congress were to amend the CSA, they can require states to legalize it at a local level. They can also have marijuana legalization treated similar to the drunk driving laws - basically, states aren't required to adopt the law locally but they'll lose out on a chunk of federal spending if they don't.",t2_t7g6h,droans,0,1648206027.0,0,t1_i21tl5y,i21tl5y,False,NbAlIvEr100,t3_tmu2j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/tmu2j8/its_time_to_speak_up_indiana/,Its time to speak up Indiana!,/r/Indiana/comments/tmu2j8/its_time_to_speak_up_indiana/i21tl5y/,2,r/Indiana,0,2

"I literally have a degree in political science so the idea that you’re going to try and explain to me something with the preface being “in political science”, is laughable. 

In the US, the popular national vote does not exist. It means nothing. It achieves nothing. It is used for nothing besides liberal complaints. It is purposely meant to mean nothing. The entire point of statehood is that sections of the country with smaller populations cannot be overwhelming run by people hundreds of miles away. Do large population areas still have the advantage? Of course. Both in the house and in the electoral college. 

Now on to the rest of you idiocy. “By what metric” the moron asks. The US is not only the most powerful country in the world, it is also one of the few countries which for generations has been committed to a free a democratic world. Does it have flaws? Yes. Every country does. Is it clearly the leader of the free world for th past 100+ years? Yes without question. How does this happen with a relatively young country built from expeditionaries, revolutionaries and immigrants? A constitution and voting system which trumps all in world history. There’s a reason people from every corner of the world flock to this country. (It’s not because it sucks like you would like to tell everyone).

You're like halfway there you see it's not an anarchy but with better infrastructure there would still be laws and regulations just not as many as we have now and all those laws and regulations will only be in place to protect the people's personal freedoms. There would still be speed limits to protect another person's right to life. Seat belt laws would go away because it's your right to choose whether or not you want to risk your own life in the event of a crash. The drinking age would be lowered but not to that extreme. If the government can own it so can you but what you can't do is use it against other people unless those people are going against your personal freedoms to life and property basically the right to defend yourself.

"I wish we could raise Barbara Jordan from her grave.   I'd love to see her ""school"" today's pack of Trumpians in Congress on the right to privacy.  I'd like to hear her  remind them of her statements back in 1987 about Robert Bork's views on privacy. Remind them of how Bork's nomination was rejected.  (He was ""Borked"".) 

 If you're too young to know who Barbara Jordan was or never had a chance to hear her speak, here's a video of her introducing the Articles of impeachment of Richard Nixon in 1974.   [https://wwws..youtube.com/watch?v=FrqVBclJVco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrqVBclJVco)(She was a U.S. Representative from Texas from '73 to '79.)

In 1987 she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee when they were considering the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.   Reagan had appointed Bork.  Bork held this view that if it's not a right stated in the Constitution, then it wasn't  a right.    He didn't see privacy as a right because it wasn't a right stated in the Constitution.    Bork's views and writings on privacy and one-man-one-vote.

I can still hear Jordan's deep voice as she said, ""No right to privacy? My word.""

I thought these cases and principles were settled decades ago. In the 1960s, '70s and '80s.    I guess this is part of the ""again"" in Trump's Make America Great Again.   Trumpians keep going back time after time to Supreme Court rulings long after they've been used as the basis to decide other cases.

The Trumpians really do want to go back to the 1950s.  And the 1920s. 1930s, 1940s.  Back to the 1700s if they could so they could shove their way into rooms where the Constitution was being written to ""make sure they got it right"".

(Jordan also used those nomination hearings to reminded everyone of Bork's role in Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre.  Bork became Acting AG after Attorney General Elliot Richardson resigned and after Deputy AG William Ruckelshaus resigned when Nixon ordered them to fire the Watergate Special Prosecutor, Archibald Cox.  ---  Bork fired Cox.----  )",t2_8gk55rct,More_Farm_7442,0,1648158259.0,0,t1_i1zi2h5,i1zi2h5,True,ZRX1200R,t3_tm57yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/tm57yq/why_republicans_want_to_roll_back_americans_right/,Why Republicans want to roll back Americans' 'right to privacy',/r/Indiana/comments/tm57yq/why_republicans_want_to_roll_back_americans_right/i1zi2h5/,4,r/Indiana,0,4

"It is crimes against humanity - simple as that. 

However, it is *you* who is making it a partisan issue even in your reply again.

Look, Jeffrey r/Epstein had known links to Donald John Trump going back **YEARS**! Jeffrey Epstein was associating with circles of the globalist elitist oligarchical aristocracy that rubbed shoulders with “influencers” in politics, “megachurches”, etc. all over the world - a redacted version of the infamous “black book” was released to the public: https://epsteinsblackbook.com/

Wonder which names are *still* redacted?

There was a legal litigation proceeding with both Jeffrey Epstein and Donald John Trump named in the suit a few years back - [Trump Epstein Pedophilia Suit](https://www.scribd.com/document/463829562/Trump-Epstein-Pedophilia-Suit).

Donald John Trump’s mentor-guru was [Roy Marcus Cohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cohn) - Roy Cohn was well acquainted with both Jeffrey Epstein and [Ghislaine Noelle Marion Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell) as they mingled in the same elitist social glitterati circles all around the world. Roy Cohn was [Trump’s child abusing attack dog. The only lawyer Trump professes to admire these days was a well-known paedophile, child trafficker and blackmailer who was disbarred from practice.](https://villagemagazine.ie/trumps-attack-dog-the-only-lawyer-trump-professes-to-admire-these-days-was-a-well-known-paedophile-child-trafficker-and-blackmailer-who-was-disbarred-from-practice/) - there are linkages to the sexual exploitation ring in Northern Ireland, UK and Europe centring at the [Kincora Boys’ Home](https://villagemagazine.ie/a-kincora-boy-abused-by-mountbatten-committed-suicide-a-few-months-late/). This goes back decades - see 60 Minutes’ investigation [Spies, Lords & Predators](https://twitter.com/60Mins/status/623090184142241792) in 2015. 

Then we have the curious case of the ex-POTUS (45) paying more personal taxes in Philippines than in the US while shitting in the White House on the tax-payers dime! What has been going on in the Philippines last few years?  Another 60 Minutes investigation sheds some light: [Catching A Monster](https://twitter.com/60Mins/status/577046465563914240). 

What else is going down in Philippines last few years? Well, have you heard of “qanon”? What political parties globally are associated with “qanon”? What are the roots of this degenerate “qanon”? It stems from image-boards 4chan which are *known* places where pedophiles/paedophiles lurk - it is a cesspit of the most degenerate depraved elements of human society - hardly even human society more like sub-human or worse. 4chan then became 8chan/8kun and is linked with a [James Arthur Watkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Watkins_(businessman)) and his son [Ronald “Ron” Watkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Watkins) and they have been peddling the “qanon” global cancer from the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan with enabler shit-disturbers like Steve “[wear racist as a badge of honour](https://www.france24.com/en/20180311-france-usa-bannon-le-pen-national-front-racist-badge-honour-populist-pep-talk-lille-trump)” Bannon who is still peddling the global cancer like a neo-nazi punk in a smelly basement “war-room”.  Ron Watkins is running for Congress in Arizona…from the Philippines or Japan. Let that sink in. 

Then you have the “megachurch” bust of [Apollo Carreon Quiboloy](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2021/11/18/philippines-mega-church-founder-with-ties-hawaii-charged-massive-sex-trafficking-case/) who was “leader of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ”:

>*Quiboloy, who has referred to himself as the “appointed son of God,” is the leader of a church with a worldwide reach. He has claimed to have more than 6 million members in more than 200 countries.*

>*”The founder of the church and two top administrators were charged for orchestrating a sex trafficking operation that recruited and coerced girls as young as 12 years old,” said Matthew Moon, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles office.*

Who else was in the Philippines last few years? The same vacuous corporate companies involved in the Trump campaign for the US Presidential election as well as the LeaveEU/Brexit in the UK - both far-right platforms in terms of the political landscape. 

>*Filipino politics kinda looks a lot like the United States,” said Wylie. “You’ve got a president who was Trump before Trump was Trump, and you have relationships with people close to him with SCL and Cambridge Analytica. And you have a lot of data being collected – the second largest amount of data after the United States being collected in the Philippines.”*

[Exclusive: PH was Cambridge Analytica’s ‘petri dish’ – whistle-blower Christopher Wylie](https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/239606-cambridge-analytica-philippines-online-propaganda-christopher-wylie/): *The Canadian whistle-blower says Strategic Communication Laboratories, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, found the Philippines an ideal target and used proxies here*

So pedo rings have been linked to “megachurches” globally for years and those evangelical bible-bashers tend to *always* be associated with “conservative” political parties almost exclusively on the right, far-right or “alt-right” of the political spectrum. 

Then there is one other connection to Stephen Bannon and Donald John Trump that should be researched more - [George Aref Nader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Nader_(businessman)). Stephen Bannon met this degenerate pedo at the White House 13 times!!!! Nader then helped arrange paid-speaking gigs around the world for Bannon’s neo-nazi “white” supremacist “alt-right” populist cheerleading tour raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

>*Nader has had several run-ins with the law over the years related to sexual abuse of children. He was convicted in the 1990s of transporting child pornography publications, and imprisoned in 2003 for sexually abusing ten boys in the Czech Republic. He pleaded guilty in early 2020 to flying a 14-year-old boy from Europe to the US for sex, and transporting pornography depicting child sexual abuse and bestiality.*

Both Nader and Epstein straddled both sides of the political spectrum in the US roping in Bill & Hillary Clinton as well. Bill liked women and was a sex-addict and so there was always a plan to get “dirt” - that is what these degenerate scum do for a living. Trump was close with Clinton’s as well.",t2_a0gkog5y,ContextSwitchKiller,0,1648139903.0,0,t1_i1y79s8,i1y79s8,False,ContextSwitchKiller,t3_tky0ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/tky0ci/indiana_man_sentenced_on_child_porn_charges_in/,"Indiana man sentenced on child porn charges in Virginia: Ora Good, Jr., 40, of Steuben, Indiana, was sentenced to 110 years in prison with 20 years of active incarceration.",/r/Indiana/comments/tky0ci/indiana_man_sentenced_on_child_porn_charges_in/i1y79s8/,1,r/Indiana,0,1
