"It depends on where you are working for the state. At the county assistance offices, they tend to be highly overburdened

To give you a personal example, I could do 120-150 applications a month with some hussle, we have around 150 hours per month to work.  This would be about an hour on each case to review the information, contact and interview the person, send out appropriate request forms, complete anything in the system as needed and narrate the case.  This doesn't count other work that we would have to perform, such as trainings, answering follow-up calls, or any other special projects.  


I was once had a manager meeting because I had 90 overdue applications, which was very bad. I asked if they knew how many not overdue applications I had, they said they did not... i pointed out that I had aorund 230 not overdue applications.  


That would have given me a bit over 30 minutes for each of those cases... and everything else I had to do.

Vests have a five year expiration because they‚Äôre typically warrantied for five years from the manufacturer. So the manufacturer will only guarantee that they actually work for five years. Of course as I said it‚Äôs not like they disintegrate at 5 years and one day. On one hand I do absolutely think it‚Äôs a money making thing. On the other hand these things take a beating since they‚Äôre worn every single day for 8+ hours. So all the sweat, rain/water, and general wear and tear from moving around does make them a little rank after several years. I‚Äôll liken it to sneakers. A good pair of sneakers can last a few years but after a while they just get kind of worn out. Of course you can still wear them, but they‚Äôll be old, rank, worn, frayed, etc. with something as important as a bullet proof vest, you don‚Äôt want to take any chances.

In this case, they may be worn, but they‚Äôre not worn out and are better than nothing.

"These results are not surprising at all.  As a retired PA teacher, we never ""taught to the test"" in terms of content, but we practiced teaching the types of questions (in all subject areas) that the students would encounter.

"Prior to Covid - yes, I can say there were more Liberal anti vaxxers. This originated from false beliefs that MMR Vaccines caused autism. (Falsely)  This led to an uptick in Measles cases and deaths which were sadly preventable. 

However,  even in the early 2000s the data is skewed as there was also another fringe group out there of antivaxxers. The survivalist, ""off grid"" population.  These people do not vaccinate and do not participate in surveys- are not ""counted"" . And they are Right Wing. 

Today- the largest % of anti - vaxxers is Republican.  

I am a Nurse so it is not just the mandating of the vaccines that the Right objects to. They claim their natural immunity is enough to protect them. Totally different story when they are just about to get intubated though.  They claim that there are ""dangerous chemicals"" in the vaccines (the same ones they praised while being developed under the Trump administration) And this has been a GOP hot button topic of opposition since Trump was no longer in office.  

So- what started out as liberal holistic medicine leaning anti vaxxers has morphed into Right wing propagandizing of the Covid vaccine. I suspect if a Republican was going to be exposed to anthrax or ebola they would have no issue getting vaccinated and they would not depend on their ""superior natural immunity"" to protect them .  Their anti vax stance seems to be specific to the Covid vaccine and Trump's turnabout in his support of it , which as usual was emulated by his flock.",t2_gbg1axrk,JustSayin_1013,0,1648177962.0,0,t1_i20qlfq,i20qlfq,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_tm35iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tm35iq/biden_requests_mehmet_oz_and_herschel_walker/,Biden requests Mehmet Oz and Herschel Walker resign from presidential council or be terminated,/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tm35iq/biden_requests_mehmet_oz_and_herschel_walker/i20qlfq/,1,r/Pennsylvania,0,1

"My mistake it was an anchor from NBC rather than CNN, a nearly identical far-left ad-funded sensationalism source, who came up with this phrase. CNN coined ""fiery but mostly peaceful protests"" which was even more ridiculous

>Second, that's not what it means and you know it. 

Sure it mostly means the more vulgar thing, but the point was that a far left news source coined it and is responsible for its spread. At least it isn't *explicitly* vulgar. I *wish* that the ""F--- Donald Trump"" crowd had switched to something less vulgar too

>Third, anyone who's even tangentially aware of politics has seen or heard the phrase and is undoubtedly aware of its meaning, if not its origin

Including children who were exposed to F-bombs by the ""F--- Donald Trump"" crowd but not by the ""Let's Go Brandon"" crowd?

It took a while but I found an actual poll here. 58% of Americans are familiar with the phrase, about half. At least half of the population thankfully hasn't been drawn into toxic politics yet

https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/poll-americans-say-lets-go-brandon-chant-is-appropriate-protest/

Also **76%** of those familiar with the phrase feel it's an *appropriate* way to protest, implying even a slight majority of *liberals* are able to recognize this is preferable to the vulgar version.

>Fourth, great job at deflecting while completely discounting birtherism... Acting as if people go to Trump rallies to unwind is laughable.

Who's talking about *political rallies?* I'm talking about the assholes who chanted political stuff at *sports events, concerts, night clubs*, and other **entertainment**. People can say whatever stupid things they want at a rally, because attendees there signed up for that. People at **entertainment** events did not.

The law prevailing before medical marijuana was that ANY amount of marijuana in your system is a DUI even if you ARE NOT impaired. The medical marijuana law didn't address DUIs directly. So now we have a county by county debate with every judge to convince them the law changed that. It's not ended up consistent so far.

Now marijuana possession under 30 grams has only a 30 day potential jail sentence. (A lot of traffic violations in Title 75 have a 90 day maximum sentence; bet you didn't know that.) And you're most likely not getting jail; you'll get a fine. But the bag that's holding the marijuana? The bong you smoke it in? The lighter, even, that you use to light your joint? That's drug paraphernalia. That has a 1 year maximum jail sentence. That's completely asinine and should be changed immediately.",t2_n0dzg,victorix58,0,1648162918.0,0,t1_i1ztamb,i1ztamb,True,PienotPi,t3_tmb3tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tmb3tx/pennsylvanias_cannabis_laws_are_among_harshest_in/,Pennsylvania's cannabis laws are among harshest in U.S. despite public support of legalization,/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tmb3tx/pennsylvanias_cannabis_laws_are_among_harshest_in/i1ztamb/,67,r/Pennsylvania,0,67

">But on the whole I think we've let religion and politics become way too big a part of our daily lives and of our outward-facing identities.

Seeing this as ""letting"" it become to big a part of your life is something you can only say if your deviance from their expectations is concealable. In your own anecdote you note that deviance from norms will be challenged and your only recourse is to go somewhere else. It's just a mask for you so you call the problem solved but if it's every shop and the mask is a fundamental part of who you are not as a behavior or choice but an inmate characteristic, just going somewhere else isn't an option.

"Your mileage may vary.

This isn't my experience, at least not entirely. There are people who might learn I'm not religious and get on my case about ""praying for me"" or asking me to come to church. And then I avoid those people.  There are people who have made their political affiliations their entire identity; if they can't exist in the world without being obnoxious about it, I'm going to avoid them too. Great example: Boop's Gun Shop in Mifflinburg. I went to buy a shotgun there about a year ago.  Somehow because I was wearing a mask at a time when masks were entirely appropriate, they figured I was a liberal and the owner and another customer started giving me shit.  Cool.  I'll do my gun shopping elsewhere. End of transaction.

But on the whole I think we've let religion and politics become way too big a part of our daily lives and of our outward-facing identities. I honestly don't get the sense that the majority of people want to live their lives with those two very personal, deep issues playing a central role in their everyday interactions. There is so much more to people than that. Even being a liberal in a conservative part of the country, I don't feel like people really *want to get into it with me* about the things we disagree about.

"[Here](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/SOL/files/Political-Activities-Guidance_2021.pdf) are the guidelines provided by the office of legal council.

>A federal employee (including PAS officials) may not:  
**‚Ä¢ run for a federal office (Congress);**  
**‚Ä¢ run for office as a candidate in a partisan election (i.e., an election in which candidates are designated by party affiliation**);

It doesn't matter what their political affiliation is. They are barred from running in an election that includes any party affiliation on the ballot.

"Honestly?  I obsess about minor things to make people's lives a little easier.  When dining with my family in restaurants, I like to stack the plates to make it easier for the staff.

When I'm purchasing  a dozen tins of cat food, I stack them for the cashier such that the bar codes are aligned, and the cashier can scan all of them in seconds.

When buying groceries, I make an effort to ""group"" them for easier bagging ... frozen/cold items first, hard-to-crush items next, ... easily-crushed items go onto the conveyor last.  When I'm buying ten bottles of diet soda, I leave nine of them in the cart, hold up one, and say ""ten of these.""

If I park near the shopping cart corral, I'll sometimes grab two carts.  One, I take back to the store entrance, and put it in the lineup.  The other I'll use to do my shopping.  Just so there's a little less work for the employees.

If my habits for putting out the trash can make life a little easier for those who collect them, I'd feel better about doing it.

Crimea in 2014, Ukraine in 2022. 

And after all the ""masterful"" maneuvering, Biden prevented no civilian deaths and has done nothing to stop the Russians beyond hurting their currency, which will bounce back after the conflict in Ukraine is settled in either direction.
