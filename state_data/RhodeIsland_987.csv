"I’m 55. I have shadowy memories of rooting for the Friars with my mom back in the early 70s. Ernie D., Barnes, Hassett, Stacom, those were the originals for me. 
I was able to fully appreciate the Pitino years where we got back to the Final Four once again with Billy D, Delray and Pop. 
Since then there have been other great players and runs, most memorable being the 96 team with Murdock, Shammgod and Croshere. That year it really felt like it could happen. 
The years go by and I know how hard it is for a small school like Providence to attract talent, build a program and then make it to the tournament. We are not Duke, or Kansas or any of the big schools that dance every year. 
That’s why when we have a shot like we did this year it’s so special and appreciated. 
And why it hurts so hard when it comes to an end. 

My son took his life in 2020. Two weeks before starting college. We went to a few Friars games as he was growing up and we would hope for the best every year for them. We knew the odds were long but that didn’t sway us from hoping every year together. I was thinking of how much joy he would have had this season. It made me smile a little to imagine it. 

I watch the games alone now and hope for the future is hard to hold onto in general never mind for my Friars. But I can thank PC for letting me feel hope for a little while this season once again.",t2_fjs5n,Wolvercote,0,1648289671.0,0,t1_i26drvf,i26drvf,True,mkmck,t3_toez31,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/toez31/nice_run_friars/,Nice run Friars!,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/toez31/nice_run_friars/i26drvf/,3,r/RhodeIsland,0,3

"Translation: “Because we don’t know how much Langevin has made, he must be getting rich.” Maybe — his explanation for non-disclosure is weak — but that’s not a very substantive basis to accuse him of getting elected to make money. Again, there are faster and easier ways to do so than that …

Also, isn’t this part of the article actually contradictory to your implication:

>”Conley said it’s hypocritical for Langevin to criticize economic espionage by the Chinese government, as he did in 2018, while profiting from holdings in Chinese companies like Alibaba and Huay.”

If he were making significant money by investing in Chinese tech stocks, why would he publicly accuse the Chinese of industrial espionage, which could drive the value of those stocks *down* …?

The charge he’s more susceptible to from the article is that of insider trading — which actually supports your earlier point, but you haven’t made it here.

I have no brief for either Langevin or Whitehouse, I just thought the latter’s points about the Democrats fumbling on climate change, and dark money contributing to Congressional fecklessness, are accurate …

Casa Azul is a basic burrito place but kinda elevated, kinda hipstery, good tacos and stuff and a whole vegan section if that matters. 

Hidalgo feels like a place in Mexico... the selection, the prices, the quality. 

California is the perfect American taqueria... you can tell Mexicans are running it and the tortillas are 'random' like it feels different people make them different days but the Mexican tacos are perfect (enough meat, onion, cilantro) while the crunchy tacos and other 'taco bell' inspired fare is also really good...

">The cognitive dissonance required to simultaneously believe that the state is inherently violent, oppressive, and racist and also that the state's agents of violence should have a a monopoly on access to firearms is absolutely bizarre.

What?! My argument is not at all about what the state *thinks, perceives,* or how the state *explains, rationalizes, or pursues* action. My question does not require the state's perspective at all. The reason it does not is because ""the state's"" perspective is almost entirely impossible to determine, especially on domestic issues, because the states positions is not clearly, consensually, and consistently articulated. It makes for a shitty research question because there IS NO single thing that the state ""sees"" or ""does."" To say it again: The state's ""opinion"" or ""justification"" or ""rationale"" for anything does not matter here at all.   


OK, I am really not making myself clear here. One more try because I really would love to see this data (but Im starting to get a sinking feeling that it does not exist in the way you described)

I gave my personal opinions and ideas just to try to show you that I am not arguing with you. Forget I even said anything about myself.

I want data that shows ""minorities with guns are harder to oppress than minorities with guns.""

Forget about my opinions. Forget about the state's motives. Forget that ideas of racism or anything even enter into this at all.

Just can you show me research that demonstrates that black people with guns somehow face ""less oppression"" (however you/they want to operationalize that) than black people without guns. IN fact, this doesn't even need to be about black people and it doesn't even need to exist take place in the US!

&#x200B;

In other words, imagine that *I* am not the one that needs convincing. Imagine that you are trying to convince, say, a US Senator who is totally in favor of banning all guns, period.

That Senator says: We should have no guns whatsoever in the US.

and then you say: but we do want certain populations to have guns because we know they are better able to resist oppression when they are arms.

And the Senator says: OK, can you show me evidence that minorities with guns are better able to resist oppression than minorities without them?

This evidence *should not include* any rationales or reasons or whatever. **All it needs to show is that oppression means X. and that black people with guns are better at avoiding X then black people without them.**",t2_kuhme8lr,GendunGramsci,0,1648173849.0,0,t1_i20htow,i20htow,False,GendunGramsci,t3_tklhe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tklhe0/gun_ownership_by_state_i_thought_we_had_won_but/,Gun Ownership by State - I thought we had won but then saw that Delaware had snuck in under us.,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tklhe0/gun_ownership_by_state_i_thought_we_had_won_but/i20htow/,1,r/RhodeIsland,0,1

(1)the authoritarian state is institutionally racist and uses its monopoly on violence to actively oppress specific races of people

(2) that the authoritarian state uses gun control measures as a legal justification for using its monopoly on violence to actively oppress specific races of people

(3) the authoritarian state uses its foundationally racist institutions to actively minimize gun ownership among those populations its seeks to actively oppress 

(4)the authoritarian state sees no threat from gun ownership among the peoples it seeks to oppress.

"ugh, same again.

all of these are important. but none of them substantiate your claim.

and look, im an ethnographer. I dont take individual cases lightly. nor do i think anything that's not statistically generalizable quantitative research is bogus.

I'm talking about producing an argument that shows minorities with guns are harder to oppress. I'm even open to a variety of operationalizations of any of those terms!

because even explicit statements are not necessarily proof: THE STATE COULD COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY ""it's easier to oppress black people that down own guns,"" but EVEN THIS would not make yours a scientifically valid claim. It might reveal the state's strategy and a variety of other things, but i feel like you are rightly concerned about this issue but that you do not recognize what kind of data you would need to analyze to show that ""minorities with guns are harder to oppress.""

"Due to religious freedom, Rhode Island organized towns around a Main Street instead of a church common like Massachusetts. This is now a staple in the country, happened here first. 

Due to Samuel slater Rhode Island got involved in  industrial revolution 1.0  before Massachusetts.

As a result of this historically many parts of Massachusetts were more tied into Providence than Boston for trade. Basically the entire south shore (Fall river, New Bedford, Taunton) as well as the Blackstone valley up to Worcester.

Due in part to Brown and Sharpe being in Rhode Island, Rhode Island was ahead in the adoption of more advanced machine tools and measurement equipment in industrial revolution 2.0. It led the country and the world at this time. 

First raised highway in the US was in providence. 

Up until the 50s, providence was considered the “Beehive of industry” and punched way above its weight relative to the population.

"> Any advise on finding a house that are not long term contracts (I’m thinking 3-4 months)

You'll need luck but also I'd try contacting a bunch of realtors. You need to find a ""sublet"" situation where you find a match with another family juggling the same logistics of selling / buying. You temp rent the seller's house while their new buyer juggles *their* logistics? 

Then use airbnb to chink any gaps.

But could you leave the fam where they are and just move them up here when you've found a place? IOW: Would it be easier to sell your house, then find *them* a short term rental where they are, and meanwhile you move up here on your own for a bit? You'd have more choice / options here that way.

Even without your extra complexities, it's an insanely tight housing market in RI, rental or buying. Somewhere I read the vacancy rate here is 2%. And people are losing bids despite offering $20,000++ over asking price. People are buying in cash. They're waiving home inspections. It's nuts.

For example:

look like native americans *according to whom?* 

can rocks also look like white people or black people or asians? or is it only native americans whose complexions are to be found in the natural world? 

If so, might this suggest that (those who participate in these naming practices might think that) native americans are somehow more primitive-less evolved, more natured-less nurtured, more base-less refined, more raw-less cultured than those people, like white europeans, whose faces don't as often appear in rocks? 

Because, clearly, you can't tell me that this dehumanizing binary of the sophisticated European and the primitive Native has not been a significant and violent ideology throughout history. 

So either show me natural features said to look like white people or i will continue to argue that these naming practices are Othering and dehumanizing.

1. is to sharpen my own thinking for how i should respond to questions like this should someone i am responsible for engaging with (e.g. a student) brings up a similar point.

">Perhaps I’m misunderstanding you, but I’m unsure of where this cut from income tax is coming in. Remote workers still have an income and still pay that tax. That wouldn’t change. 

Some cities, like NYC, have a city income tax. You pay it if you live or work in NYC.  If you now work remote from Westchester or Hoboken you don’t. 

>And yes, it is a fair and potentially concerning point that many businesses thrive on commuters contributing to them and sales taxes, but it isn’t necessarily proven that these places would suffer from that lack of commuters. 

It’s not potentially concerning. It’s happening.  There’s a reason you’re seeing big cities push this harder than most companies. 

>We’ve never had a lack of commuters (besides quarantine, in which there was a complete halt to the economy altogether). People would have additional free time and money from their lack of commute. To be fair, it’s only theoretical that they’d then go out and spend that extra income to keep those businesses going, but it’s also only theoretical that the businesses would suffer.

Sure, people have extra time and money.  But I have to imagine you’ve never commuted before if this is your take. 

I’m not driving 40 minutes into Providence to get lunch ever. I might drive 15 mins up the street to grab lunch from a local place, but even the occasional work lunch in PVD is a far cry from 2-3 days / week when I commuted, or grabbing drinks after work once a week. Sure, I’ll still drive in for a nice dinner, but much less frequently than it was before.

>I absolutely agree that there are concerns and potential consequences to the remote work shift, but to base an economy on something proven to be largely obsolete, or at least optional, seems like a pretty futile option. Economies need to adapt. If workers are forced to do something they don’t need to because the economy can’t properly adapt, then it seems like a broken system that needs to be repaired or replaced

I agree. You just seem to be under the impression that *capitalist elites* are going to be the ones to feel pain. They aren’t. Maybe one or two here or there, but that’s nothing compared to the millions of city residents who are going to face deterioration in services as revenues shrink faster than demand for service.

"Perhaps I’m misunderstanding you, but I’m unsure of where this cut from income tax is coming in. Remote workers still have an income and still pay that tax. That wouldn’t change. And yes, it is a fair and potentially concerning point that many businesses thrive on commuters contributing to them and sales taxes, but it isn’t necessarily proven that these places would suffer from that lack of commuters. We’ve never had a lack of commuters (besides quarantine, in which there was a complete halt to the economy altogether). People would have additional free time and money from their lack of commute. To be fair, it’s only theoretical that they’d then go out and spend that extra income to keep those businesses going, but it’s also only theoretical that the businesses would suffer.

I absolutely agree that there are concerns and potential consequences to the remote work shift, but to base an economy on something proven to be largely obsolete, or at least optional, seems like a pretty futile option. Economies need to adapt. If workers are forced to do something they don’t need to because the economy can’t properly adapt, then it seems like a broken system that needs to be repaired or replaced",t2_it87i94t,CasualSquirrel,0,1648050351.0,0,t1_i1t3gce,i1t3gce,False,rhodyjourno,t3_tkctm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tkctm8/when_will_downtown_providence_recover_from_the/,When will downtown Providence recover from the pandemic? - The Boston Globe,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tkctm8/when_will_downtown_providence_recover_from_the/i1t3gce/,3,r/RhodeIsland,0,3

"🙄.  You know who the single largest owner of real estate is in the US?  CALPERS, with a $51 billion portfolio. That’s the pension fund for CA government employees, in case the name doesn’t ring a bell.  Capitalists will find ways to make money whether a market goes up, down, or sideways.  You know who doesn’t have the same option?  Cities. 

I’m not sure what “altering their infrastructure around remote work” means, but here’s the reality. NYC gets 25% of its revenue from city income tax, the majority of it paid by commuters. The contribute a lot to sales tax receipts too. You know what commuters don’t use?  City schools, which are almost 30% of city expenditures. 

Here’s how that plays out.  The the city loses 10% of its revenue, and not only can’t reduce services (still as many kids in school) but still has pension obligations to service that don’t shrink relative to income either. Cities are slow to move, and they can’t easily cut costs when revenue gets hit. The residents who can afford to leave will be least affected. I’ll leave it to you to figure out who is going to get hurt the most here, but it isn’t “capitalists.”  

The idea of a city “supporting remote work” also just seems to misunderstand the whole idea of remote work.  I have the infrastructure I need to remote work almost anywhere in the world - a laptop, a headset, and a hotspot. I don’t need a city anymore.",t2_16rodp,fishythepete,0,1648040456.0,0,t1_i1sfizg,i1sfizg,False,rhodyjourno,t3_tkctm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tkctm8/when_will_downtown_providence_recover_from_the/,When will downtown Providence recover from the pandemic? - The Boston Globe,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tkctm8/when_will_downtown_providence_recover_from_the/i1sfizg/,3,r/RhodeIsland,0,3

"Waterfire in Providence is free and held periodically from later spring through Oct or so. If you're new to RI and don't know what Waterfire is, I'm sure there are YouTube videos. But no video or description could capture what experiencing a good one was like.

Prov will likely have its 2-3 day annual festival again this summer -- personally I haven't gone since the one with an official Central America theme, music, dancers. The one that had the team of ""dark romance"" stilt walkers (I think from France)? That festival was free and great, at least for the hours I went. But I've read subsequent years were less so, and during the pandemic the event was cancelled altogether at least one year.

Back in the good old days Thayer St used to have at least one a year where they closed the street to vehicles and had artisans and live music and performers. And RISD hosted the same on Benefit St spring and fall. They've held one on Wickendon in recent years but hasn't been as good. Maybe it'll get there 🤞

For just a whiff of festive atmosphere, the artisans + farmers market that's held every Saturday morning on Blackstone Blvd where it meets Hope in Prov is free and fun.

Loads of individual RI cities and towns have their own events, parades (notably Bristol's 4th of July parade); historical (Gaspee Days) / cultural; and music and art festivals, many free. They must be listed somewhere -- it's something the weekly Providence Phoenix (RIP 😢) was handy for.

"In 2020, a lot of people learned firsthand what normalcy bias is.  The thought that come April, then May, then July, then... whenever, that COVID would be over, and everything would go back to the way it was before.  Now, two years later, I think most individuals have adjusted to the new normal - it's time for cities and businesses to catch up.

Eric Adams and Jamie Dimon can talk about how a return to the office is necessary to keep NYC vibrant, to keep JP Morgan competitive, but the reality is that things aren't going back to the way they were before COVID.  I've been remote for about 11 years now.  It's a perk I've always valued highly - I've turned down opportunities that would pay 40% more but require me to commute daily.  Pre-COVID I would get into my office once or twice a month, and I was on the road 1 - 2 weeks / month.

Since COVID I've been into the office once and I have yet to travel for a client meeting.  Not because of any corporate direction, but because I've learned to operate effectively this way, and going back to the old way would be a big step backwards.

In a time that employers are struggling to acquire and retain talent, forcing employees who would prefer the ability to stay remote back into the office just isn't a viable option - they'll leave.  That means city budgets depending on sales tax revenue from commuter spending or local income taxes are going to be facing some pain long term.  Those who adjust now will no doubt be better positioned than those that keep crying for things to go back to the way they were.",t2_16rodp,fishythepete,0,1647990423.0,0,t1_i1q4zjl,i1q4zjl,True,rhodyjourno,t3_tkctm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tkctm8/when_will_downtown_providence_recover_from_the/,When will downtown Providence recover from the pandemic? - The Boston Globe,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tkctm8/when_will_downtown_providence_recover_from_the/i1q4zjl/,27,r/RhodeIsland,0,27

"FROM THE STORY: Rhode Island will receive more than $10.4 million to help local providers and community partners deliver affordable housing and supportive services to those experiencing homelessness.  
The federal funding, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through its Continuum of Care grants, will support 37 local homeless housing and service programs across the state. The funds will help both individuals and families, said U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, on Tuesday.  
Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, said the funds will be used to help launch new projects to create youth crisis and rapid rehousing programs, new services for people seeking Emergency Housing Vouchers, a permanent supportive housing project at the Rockville Mill, and a Coordinated Entry System project for survivors of domestic violence.

“Ensuring every Rhode Islander has safe, private shelter and a stable place to call home is both an ambitious goal and a basic, core community commitment,” said Reed. “But too many people can’t afford stable housing or have other issues that cause them to experience homelessness, in no small part due to the alarming shortage of affordable housing in our state and the lingering impact of the pandemic.”

"**FROM THE STORY:** On any given weekday in 2019, workers would flood out from their offices in the afternoon for lunch, snagging a table or to pick up take out. They’d beat traffic going home by meeting for after-work drinks that could easily turn to dinner in the city.  
On weekends, a new convention or sporting event might be in town, centrally-located hotels would be sold out, and there was a wait to get a table for any sit-down meal. Providence’s eclectic dining scene was always on the menu, and nightclubs like EGO and music venues like Dusk would have energetic lines wrapped around its buildings.

But, of course, the pandemic changed all of that.  
The trouble now, in an economic recovery period, is while leisure tourism is making its return, and business travel might not come back until at least 2024; Providence’s “comeback” could be reliant on office workers commuting again.

“The offices are the most problematic in coming back,” said Cliff Wood, the executive director of The Providence Foundation.  
According to a recent survey Wood conducted of the Foundation’s 150 members — which include businesses from Bank of America to the Providence Preservation Society — about one-third said they would not commit to returning to the office while another third were “chomping at the bit to come back.”

"It goes back much further than last year, it predates the bike path. This area was completely wild for years and years.

The question of how to address these issues is a really good one. I hate the trash too, but what's the solution? Displacing the homeless seems needlessly cruel. Provide them with trash cans or a dumpster or something and other people (not the homeless you are trying to help) will throw their trash in there. Maybe the city could organize things better though.

If only the truism about how few people have to suck in order to ruin it for everyone else weren't true.

However, if you’re willing to drive for almost an hour to Warwick or anywhere further north/west for anything other than Walmart (or deal with limited bus service or the pricetag of Amtrak), and if you like the smallish coastal town feel with easy access to the beach during the summer, then go ahead!
