You don't. Having a gun on your person doesn't make you more safe, in fact, quite the opposite.

\>Results. After adjustment, individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 (P  
 < .05) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in   
possession. Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance  
 to resist, this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 (P < .05).

\>Conclusions.  
 On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being   
shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur each   
year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in   
urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or,   
at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety  
 countermeasures.

"From the 27 year study of mass shootings in the USA I liked earlier from American Public Health Association.

>Results. Between 1990 and 2017, there were 69 high-fatality mass shootings. Attacks involving LCMs resulted in a 62% higher mean average death toll. The incidence of high-fatality mass shootings in non‚ÄìLCM ban states was more than double the rate in LCM ban states; the annual number of deaths was more than 3 times higher. In multivariate analyses, states without an LCM ban experienced significantly more high-fatality mass shootings and a higher death rate from such incidents.

>Conclusions. LCM bans appear to reduce both the incidence of, and number of people killed in, high-fatality mass shootings.

">Sure, fear monger to prevent solving real problems.

Its not fear mongering, it has been seen and done in other states. We al know the Democratic party is increasingly removing more and more gun rights by adding more ridiculous restrictions ala the Republican strategy towards eliminating abortion rights.

>nobody is taking away anyone's guns or ammo

Go to Cali or New York and see how difficult it is to get a firearm. They also have ridiculous magazine caps and New Jersey doesn't even allow JHP for ammo.

>Seriously, there is zero negative to this bill unless having a big clip in your gun gets your dick hard.

And here we go w/ the sexual innuendos when people just simply want to be able to have easy access to ""high capacity"" magazines for their firearms. The negative is that with lower capacity magazines for legal gun owners they are at a disadvantage against violent criminals, hence why the bill still allows both the police and private security to have high capacity magazines *because it puts them at a disadvantage.* Now it is civilians who are forced to be at a disadvantage if ever they need to defend themselves due to restricted access to high capacity magazines.

>There is clear data that these restrictions work in lowering the lethality of mass shootings

Show me this data? I find it very hard to believe as mass shootings with high capacity magazines seem hardly effected by the capacity due to often the poor shooting skills of offender and if anything most school shootings involve smaller arms like handguns.

Also this ignores what has been brought up before regarding the ease and speed of changing magazines and of course as you yourself noted high capacity magazines possession isn't banned so a school shooter could still have access to those.

What happens when another school shooting occurs? Apparently one is being used to justify these magazines sales restrictions, why wouldn't another one then also be used to close a ""loophole"" that possession is legal? Anyone can see the trend and where this is heading especially when you note other states which ban possession.

Edit: Regarding your ""data"" you should see this:

[The study found that the ban was effective at reducing crimes committed with assault weapons, though less than 2% of gun murders in the U.S. are committed with assault weapons.\[37\] **The ban was not associated with a reduction in firearm homicides or the lethality of gun crimes in general**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-capacity_magazine_ban#State_high-capacity_magazine_bans)

"This legislation does not represent the outcomes that you desire and the statistics proving as much are readily available.

Moreover, I'm 31 years old and not once in my entire life, even my infancy has a politician represented my interests. Not our Governors, not our Representatives, not our Senators, and not our Presidents, be they liberal or conservative.

I don't care if you're left, right, or center. I don't care if you're are young or old. I don't care if you are male, female, or anything else. I don't care if you are straight, gay, bi or whatever. I don't care if you're a capitalist or a communist. None of that matters and neither do the Parties themselves.

We are ruled by bunch of decrepit old guard politicians who control us through propaganda, media, marketing, consumerism, executive actions, emergency orders, and back-door dealing. The very same people who prop up multinational oligarchs. The same people who kill over oil and accept slavery so long as cheap goods keep coming from abroad. The very same one who call themselves Progressives or Traditionalists and condemn one another openly all while breaking bread with each other behind closed doors to the detriment of you and I alike.

If you truly believe that YOUR interests have ever been served by a living politician then you are a useful idiot of the highest order. If you honestly believe that there is ANY meaningful distinction between the Clinton's, the Bush's, Obama, Trump, or Biden then you've been brainwashed, likely your whole life.

"Your point of view is exactly what gun owners rail against, you've essentially admitted this has nothing to do with preventing gun violence and is instead a baby step towards the banning of gun ownership. What buy in can you expect from gun owners to work towards regulating gun ownership if your point of view is, on the face of it, blatantly disingenuous? 

&#x200B;

Your comment tells me that you have lead a sheltered life, but I cant tell you from experience that evil people exist, that they would take the opportunity to hurt you if they could, I have seen this with my own eyes. Its from my own experiences that I know that protecting myself or my family may one day be a thing that I have to do, and to do it I need the best available weapon. I have a spine injury which preludes any sort of martial training or fighting, a gun is the single best tool I have for defending the people I love.   


Also, I think its clear you have little to no experience with guns, but a full size pistol, that is a pistol with a grip that comfortably fits your hand, with a longer barrel to help accuracy and control recoil typically holds 17-21 rounds. This is the standard capacity for full sized handguns in 9mm. There is no magic danger threshold that is crossed when loading the 11th round into the magazine, its an arbitrary number intended to reduce the total number of guns for sale in WA as not all manufacturers will spend the time and money to create a 10 round magazine for ban states. Again, disingenuous attempt to ban guns via sidestepping the constitutionally protected right to own firearms, which is also in the WA state constitution I might add.   


For your final point, you have completely miscalculated my political leanings and character. Liberal voters and people of color are the fastest growing group of gun owners in America.

"Allow me to illustrate. 

Let's say you have a law against murder, with punishment ranging from 10 to life in prison. Because of the lengthy prison sentence and other ramifications  (such as after you get out of prison no one will hire you for the rest of your life, so you will always be poor), the law has a deterrent effect, so it is an example of an effective law.

Now let's say you have a law restricting magazine capacity where the punishment is misdemeanor, and the only enforcement is when you caught violating some other gun law... such as aforementioned law against murder. So now if someone commits murder with this high capacity magazine, they go away for 10 years, plus they would have a misdemeanor.  If someone commits murder with a 10 rd magazine, they go away for 10 years and they don't have this misdemeanor.  Would any criminal care about that misdemeanor? Of course not.

You should have to be trained BEFORE you purchase a gun. This training must include maintenance of a firearm, proper use of a firearm and a minimum accuracy test. This training should be funded by taxes on the purchase of the firearm and should be in person or if virtual, proctored.  


There should be licenses for guns that allow you to purchase a different level of gun based on the amount of training you have received. For example, with minimum training you may purchase a shot gun or single action rifle. With advanced training you may purchase a full auto rifle etc...

"Unless you can prove they wrongfully rear ended you; the rear ender is always at fault. Most you can do is file a claim. Even after incident you can file a pd report for any accident even if it's a scratch. I'd suggest to hire a lawyer at this point. I let my mom handle mine and I feel I got screwed out of a large compensation check. If you're not the rear ender take them for all they're worth.

I'd suggest a dash cam that's front/rear facing. This is the one I have. It's relatively decent quality. I did not install the gps as it isn't required. If you don't know where you are on the road when you get hit then it would make me question the driver's competency behind the wheel. That and the insurance company doesn't need to know you were doing 5 over speed limit.

The only down side is when you tell it take photo the interface freezes and becomes non responsive but will continue to recorded. And the sensitivity is really high. It takes a ton of falsified photos even with the sensitivity turned off but the loop recording will just record over them.

1. The lack of police enforcement. Seriously in many areas the police have a hands off approach to dealing with crime directed at the industry or they have to be in a remote area to even conduct business.
2. The lack of firearms. Between the Feds and the Insurance companies they frown upon employee's firearms so when confronted by violence the immediate response is limited.
3. The black market resale of stolen products. Seriously, repackaged it is hard to trace and extracts have high values.
