"You even said yourself that half of the tags sold are from non-residents, so national numbers are indeed appropriate. You only seemed to mention bow hunting elk, which I would imagine is probably like 1/4 to 1/3 of all licenses. The last time I looked at the actual numbers was maybe a year or so ago, so those might have been from an older report, but there was clearly a downward trend from hunting license revenue (dollars, not licenses sold). Maybe I can find that report again. 

Anyways, the original comment I replied to was equating wolf management with CPW's funding being ""destroyed."" And that is just flat out hyperbole. Their funding will not be destroyed because of this. That's such nonsense. If anything, the current price of tags being out of date with things like CPI and inflation would contribute more to a reduction in funding that anything that has to do with a few wolves having an effect on a small number of hunting units. Colorado is cheap compared to our neighbors and keeping fees low for an activity in decline isn't going to do anything to improve funding.

Worrying about a few wolves ""destroying"" CPW's hunting license revenue is meaningless. If you're that worried about revenue, then a more effective change would be to significantly increase the price of licenses, which is supported by a huge majority of hunters and anglers according to CPW's own outreach meetings.",t2_eyxe0,pspahn,0,1648255613.0,0,t1_i24yvz1,i24yvz1,False,schmoolhead,t3_tmg4of,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tmg4of/guard_donkeys_are_here_to_go_ham_on_colorado/,"Guard donkeys are here to ""go ham"" on Colorado wolves",/r/Colorado/comments/tmg4of/guard_donkeys_are_here_to_go_ham_on_colorado/i24yvz1/,1,r/Colorado,0,1

"my opinion is that this is already settled by easement laws, essentially if the only viable access route to public land goes through your land, you must allow access.

however...

i also recognize there is a massive difference between allowing the occasional backpacker or ADV rider through and feeling like your backyard is grand central station with jeeps and tacos parked everywhere and inconsiderate tourists dumping trash because they all saw some spot on instagram.


i dont think property owners should be able to block people from seeing the backcrountry, especially if its designated park lands, but at the same time, the public can be shitty to property, so perhaps a balance point should be made where public access is the default, but when visitation reaches a certain level, the property owner should be entitled to some options, perhaps something like property tax breaks, or the state paying to maintain the property for the owner, or the owner forcing the state to purchase the land for full market rate.",t2_ae36et2m,uCyanotical,0,1648222648.0,0,t1_i22ryoo,i22ryoo,False,xraygun2014,t3_tlg237,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tlg237/over_half_a_million_public_lands_in_colorado_are/,"Over half a million public lands in Colorado are inaccessible due to being ""landlocked"" by privately-owned land.

"As others have recommended, Garden of the Gods is pretty and an easy walk around the park. It's a little bit of a detour but west of CO Springs there's also the Manitou Cliff Dwellings (replica Puebloan Native cliff homes) that are also pretty neat. The Springs also has Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, US Olympic museums, the ProRodeo Hall of Fame, and numerous other places that are neat.

Great Sand Dunes I would also recommend since you'll be pretty close by.

It looks like youll be passing through Antonito - there's actually quite a few things do do there despite it being a small town:

There's a place called Cano's Castle on the northeast corner, a castle made entirely of beer cans.
If you like Indiana Jones, the house they used for his childhood home in The Last Crusade is there. Tons of Indiana Jones memorabilia and props and such there. You need to call for a tour but if you just stop by you can take pictures of the outside of the house and such.
If it were later in the season I'd suggest the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad (also the railroad they used in the opening of The Last Crusade) but they won't be open until June.
If fighting is your thing the Jack Dempsey Birthplace & Museum is also in that town.

Pueblo also has a few things including an air museum and railroad museum. If you end up in Pueblo and are hungry I would highly recommend Angelo's. Tasty Italian food and it's right along the Riverwalk (pretty riverside walkway along the Arkansas).

"Story time. After college I split up with my fiance after two years. I didn't see it coming and shortly after I found out it was because she wanted to sleep with her new neighbor. I was drinking too much and if it wasn't for friends making me hang out with then I'm not sure how things would have gone. 

A few months later my local resort here in CO opened up and as an avid snowboarder I was there. I hadn't been good for a long time and was still thinking about it on the lift ride. I got to the top, strapped in and rode the flats to the top of the run and stopped. Looking down into the valley,  snow and mountains all around me, cool air in my lungs....  it was beautiful. At that moment everything changed, everything was going to be just fine. 

At the time I didn't KNOW things were going to get better, but I knew that didn't mean things going to stay the same. Just realized that there's always going to be ups and downs and you just have to roll through them. It may be meeting someone new, it may be finding a new hobby, or it may be just seeing a beautiful landscape in front of you, but things will change.",t2_4n7lz0er,jryanll,0,1648176704.0,0,t1_i20o0qg,i20o0qg,True,hobo123443,t3_tnau6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tnau6y/my_mental_health_is_struggling_these_days_but/,My mental health is struggling these days but views like these help me find peace.,/r/Colorado/comments/tnau6y/my_mental_health_is_struggling_these_days_but/i20o0qg/,18,r/Colorado,0,18

"It actually doesn't work well for the sex workers in either of those locations as they still can't go to the cops when something goes wrong and a huge amount of violence is still present. All legalisation does is create a 2 tiered system where workers are able to adhere to the law sometimes but not during other times. For example, it was legal where I am (in VIC, AUS) so we were able to legally work BUT I was only able to work from my clients houses and we had to pay an high fee to be put on a public register.   


We're under Decriminalisation now which is what sex workers want and also what has been proven time and time again (through NZ, NSW and numerous studies) to actually reduce not only harm against us, but harm in the general community. It also lessens the stigma attached to sex work making it easier for us to leave the industry if we want and obtain other jobs, so there's less chance we'll be economically forced into continuing in the industry if we don't want to. Criminal penalties also still exist for things like human trafficking etc. under decriminalisation.",t2_hfhdn40,LolaHunt,0,1648175640.0,0,t1_i20lq0h,i20lq0h,False,LolaHunt,t3_tizjfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tizjfq/brutalized_with_little_recourse_colorado/,“Brutalized with little recourse”: Colorado lawmakers take a first step to protect sex workers,/r/Colorado/comments/tizjfq/brutalized_with_little_recourse_colorado/i20lq0h/,1,r/Colorado,0,1

"Sure, a significant portion of the western *slope* of Bross is public, but the summit of Bross is privately owned, and the trails are mostly on private land. The summits of Lincoln and Democrat are also private property. Cameron has a mining claim at the summit that is now owned by the USFS. You can verify ownership through [Park County's GIS website](https://maps.parkco.us/) (property lines shown on this service are accurate to roughly +/-50 ft in my experience). So I stick by my statement - these summits are not public (except Cameron, which I was mistaken on).

These owners have been paying taxes on their land for all this time instead of donating the land to the public, ostensibly because they think it will become worthwhile to re-mine these claims one day. Besides, the mines built all the roads and trails that we still use to access the area - you're directly benefiting from their work.

The liability issue is not just some minor concern to be hand-waived away. In 2019 a federal court awarded a mountain biker $7.3 million in damages from the Air Force Academy for injuries sustained while recreating on their land. He fell into an eroded out wash at the bottom of a gulley (called a sink hole in the court documents). That's just one case, and tens of thousands of people access these peaks every year. Even if you could find a company to provide liability insurance, the premiums would be insane.

> people being people (trash/vandals) happens everywhere

And that makes it okay? Why the heck would a private landowner *WANT* the public on their land if people have that attitude? If I were that landowner and heard people saying it's okay to trash my land because thats just the way people are, I'd shut down access tomorrow. I think that's *exactly* the attitude that these Facebook groups you're complaining about are trying to address. Heck, with how trashed some of our 14ers are getting due to asshats that can't be bothered to pick up after themselves or entitled douches driving all over the landscape, I almost wonder if we shouldn't be *applauding* the owners of Bross for limiting access.",t2_6ti5m,KapitanWalnut,0,1648157047.0,0,t1_i1zf2c3,i1zf2c3,False,xraygun2014,t3_tlg237,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tlg237/over_half_a_million_public_lands_in_colorado_are/,"Over half a million public lands in Colorado are inaccessible due to being ""landlocked"" by privately-owned land.

"I agree that reintroducing more dangerous predators such as wolves being in the wilderness is not without risk, but so is abjectly removing them.

While the risk of personal injury or loss of livestock went down when they were forcibly removed, so went up the risk to the ecology of their former habitat. There has been lots of evidence detailing the critical roles many apex predators play in their environments, including wolves. And no matter what you're doing in an environment - living, ranching, whatever - the health of that environment is important and inescapable.

The difficulty is that identifying and quantifying the entire risk of removing wolves from the ecosystem is really hard and never complete. It's likely the generations that felt justified in hunting wolves to extinction weren't considering the long-term ecological impacts because that science hadn't evolved yet. The only risks they knew or cared about were addressed by removing all wolves. Our science on this is still evolving now, but we know that ecological risk is there and that all ecological risks carry potential health and economic risks. It still comes down to finding the right balance, but considering all risks. Maintaining an absolute ban on wolves in the wilderness is no longer capable of striking that balance.",t2_3tk0k,Frencil,0,1648149817.0,0,t1_i1ywpyf,i1ywpyf,False,schmoolhead,t3_tmg4of,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tmg4of/guard_donkeys_are_here_to_go_ham_on_colorado/,"Guard donkeys are here to ""go ham"" on Colorado wolves",/r/Colorado/comments/tmg4of/guard_donkeys_are_here_to_go_ham_on_colorado/i1ywpyf/,10,r/Colorado,0,10

And they knew I was there. They won’t fuck with humans unless feeling territorial. They hunt solo. A human or child has a chance to back off and get away. 

As you know, wolves hunt in packs. And wolves are known to kill just for fun. Our ancestors worked really hard to kill them off and drive them out for a reason. As fucked up as it is, they didn’t have the kind of modern amenities

Maybe they’ve adapted or changed like the deer and elk have with hunting season (going to where they know they won’t be shot). But that’s what I was always told by people who dealt with them when they were still around. (Who are long dead now.)

"I believe that you believe you're right, but unfortunately the facts are not on your side. 

SOME of Bross is owned, not ALL of it. The part with the trail passes through the private mining claim. The mining companies do not own the entire mountain. Yet they restrict access to the peak. When was the last time mining was active up there?

If these mining concerns with stakes on Bross can afford to own huge swaths of land they can manage with liability insurance the same way every other person in Colorado must manage the risk on their property. Dont like it? Turn it over to the forest service/BLM. 

People being people (trash/vandals) happens everywhere. Its unfortunate in most instances. When private mining companies are blocking my access to PUBLIC lands then I dont give a fuck how vandalized their stuff gets. 

Yet the 14er groups keep saying ""Just stay away from Bross and maybe some day we'll get to hike it legally again"".  I already hiked the loop a few years ago (including Bross), while Bross was closed. Im not inclined to do it again since Im not into repeating 14ers but I'll be damned If Im going to let some defunct mining claim from 50 years ago hold sway over which peaks I can summit and which I can't.

"> No one who is visiting public land for recreation is going to cause damage

That is either incredibly naive or willfully ignorant. Every year there are a large number of stories about vandalism on private property adjacent to public trails. There are huge liability concerns around trails crossing private land, particularly for cliffs, sinkholes, and old mines (which is why the public access to Mt. Lincoln was closed after the $7.3 million mtn biker lawsuit back in 2019). Hell there's been an ongoing issue with sport shooters on public land *hitting people's houses* with stray shots, in rural Boulder County of all places.

Considering that a fence and no-tresspassing signs are not enough to protect land owners from liability (look up attractive nuisance lawsuits where people literally climbed fences and went past signs, got injured, and *won* lawsuits against the landowners), I would never allow a public easement across my land unless the state created some serious protections and codified those protections into law, and even that might not be enough. We currently have the Colorado Recreational Use Statute which is supposed to address liability for land owners regarding members of the public recreating on their lands, but even that isn't enough since that statute has been significantly weakened by past lawsuits.",t2_6ti5m,KapitanWalnut,0,1648136627.0,0,t1_i1xyp8s,i1xyp8s,False,xraygun2014,t3_tlg237,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tlg237/over_half_a_million_public_lands_in_colorado_are/,"Over half a million public lands in Colorado are inaccessible due to being ""landlocked"" by privately-owned land.

"Its not like this in all states. 

I just moved from NH, we have public use laws. You have to actively post your property every 50 feet or noticeable enough for someone not to miss it, the entire perimeter. If there isn't a posted sign, by state law I can go on. If you ask me to leave, I have to leave. Did not need permission to hunt or fish. Recreational vehicles are not allowed unless you have written permission. 

Property tax is expensive there because they don't have income or sales tax. You get a tax break if you allow recreation on your property if you own I think more than 10 acres. If not, full rate. If you try to lie and then tell us to leave, it can be reported and you go back to full tax rate.

I took that wayyyy too much for granted. 

Trick we used to use is if it was posted and blocked us off from access, we'd bring a canoe or just walk down river.  They own the land to the water's edge.

">These resignations come after Monday night's council meeting where a citizen called for the Florence Mayor's resignation. During the meeting, Mayor Paul Villagrana said he won't resign because 500 people elected him in.

>The six resigned members all tell 13 Investigates they quit their jobs because they did everything they could to find the truth and address corruption and were rejected.

>Hardy and Allen have been pushing for answers and taking action to address issues exposed by 13 Investigates.

>Those issues uncovered include a pattern of abuse by former City Manager Mike Patterson that spanned several years, former and current city employees saying they were forced to take off COVID-19 sick time when they weren't ill, and [missing taxpayer money](https://krdo.com/news/2022/03/03/13-investigates-florence-city-staff-paid-95k-in-interest-free-loans-on-taxpayers-dime-records-show/).

Edit : Geezus, that link is its own sordid tale

>Interim City Manager Thomas Piltinsgrud says fired City Manager Mike Patterson displayed ""a rouge arrogance to city government"" when he violated city policy by authorizing the wage advances for himself, the former police chief, a former clerk, and other staff from 2014 to 2018. Patterson also provided $24,963 car loans for five employees to purchase cars through the city in payroll deduction, according to the finance director's report to the city manager. 

>Patterson, who served as the Florence city manager for a decade, was fired by the city council in August 2021. He was arrested in November 2021 at the Denver International Airport, charged with stalking and sexual contact with no consent, and providing alcohol to a minor. The charges are all related to women he supervised. Patterson was at the center of 13 Investigates special report earlier this week exposing a years-long Florence city sex harassment scandal. Our investigation demonstrated a pattern of abuse with multiple employees alleging they were sexually harassed by Patterson even after the city settled a lawsuit with sexual harassment allegations by a former city clerk in 2019.",t2_jh6nk,xraygun2014,0,1648071141.0,0,t1_i1umdu1,i1umdu1,True,makarmackinnonstan,t3_tkl5gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tkl5gt/entire_city_council_resigns_in_wake_of_corruption/,Entire City Council resigns in wake of Corruption Scandal in Florence,/r/Colorado/comments/tkl5gt/entire_city_council_resigns_in_wake_of_corruption/i1umdu1/,3,r/Colorado,0,3

"It’s interesting how much propaganda there is out there about Israel, and the majority of people peddling it have never even been there. Nobody talks about how Palestine corroborated with Nazi Germany providing funds and weapons so Hitler could play out his final solution in Europe with the strategy being to come there and finish off the Jews once he ridded Europe of them. And that when the border lines of Israel were drawn up created that this was in part punishment for involvement in the war. Or the thousands of years Jews have existed in the Middle East only to be at the hands of genocide and pogroms in old Palestinian lands and throughout the Middle East. There are millions of Jews missing from the planet today (30 million as a result of the Holocaust only- let alone millions more as a result of the genocide played out again and again throughout the Middle East and Europe) and Israel is the size of New Jersey. Nobody is crying about the smaller Holocaust that’s been happening in Syria for years or the one in Yemen or Cameroon. The reason is because anti-semetism is alive and well in America.

I think some of the original costs were in the $8k-$10k range and now may be down around $3k-$5k getting competitive to direct cremation at around $1k. Those costs are vs.an average of $7k-$10k for a traditional funeral depending on options. The process takes about 30 days and seems ""respectful"", it's not like they just throw gramma on a stack of leaves in the garden. I guess at some level all the options end up with the same result ""dust to dust"". Americans probably need to take a more pragmatic approach to death, it's something that happens to everyone but no one want's wants to think about. Make your wishes clear to your family before it's too late and they're left to deal with the funeral industry, which is mostly honest and provides a valuable and essential service, but certainly has a bad reputation. Clearly there are many considerations beyond the simple economics that go into the decision, and everyone needs to make their own choices.

Whether or not it was specifically aimed at minorities, or if people felt intimidated (I imagine they did; I guess you'd have to ask them), it's not a new story coming out of thin air. Just like the Tina Peters fiasco, it's bubbling up in the news now because something's moving forward, legally.
