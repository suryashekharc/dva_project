""I believe she will rubberstamp Biden’s far-left agenda instead of protecting the Constitution and our Kansas values,""

1. The SCOTUS doesn't ""work"" for the US President.
2. Ole ""Doc"" Marshall describes everything as ""Far left"" but has no idea what that even means. If Biden said, ""All toilet paper should dispense over the top of the roll"" every member of the GOP would come out against using toilet paper. 
3. The GOP is doing everything they can NOT to protect the Constitution and Roger is one of their poster children.
4. The SCOTUS doesn't 'protect values'. They evaluate legal issues.
5. Kansas values are so far removed from anything this jackass stands for that it's almost laughable that he can even say that with a straight face.

"In the 1800s, the Quakers were strongly abolitionist, often supporting the Underground Railroad.  They already had a presence at the Shawnee Mission, ministering to the Shawnee. When Kansas was opened up for settlement, it quickly became obvious the real intent of the Kansas-Nebraska Act was for pro-slavery groups from Missouri to populate Kansas and bring it in as a slave state.  Abolitionist groups back East set up organizations to bring free state supporters to Kansas (Lawrence, for example, was founded with help from the New England Emigrant Aid Company).

They don't want teachers.

Kids can quietly sit in their seats and hear the lesson.  Then the schools can save $$$ by paying only for monitors to walk around as kids do the HW that is assigned after hearing the meaningful lecture (no questions answered by the monitor of course because they might not say exactly what Topeka wants said).  We could 100% control what is said this way.

"I'm from northwest of Oskaloosa and my experience is that in all these small towns, there is need for skilled labor.  All these little towns used to have auto repair shops, but since the 80's-90's they mostly closed.  Now, there is a newer generation opening them back up with the capability to work on modern vehicles.  They are well equipped on many levels (skills and tools), so more people are staying local.  Everest reopened their tire and repair shop and it's doing great.  Bendena has limited service, but the guy is a great mechanic and always has a wait.  The same with the guys in Highland, though they are a full service shop.  

The shop in Lancaster closed within the last year, but that was health related.  Search around and see if there is a shop in Nortonville, Winchester, Valley Falls, Perry, Easton.  My sister lives outside of Easton and the shop they use for repairs had something like a two-three week wait for issues she was having with her vehicle.  

In short, there is business to be had.  You'll find a lot of farmers in that area and people who work in Lawrence, Leavenworth, Atchison and Topeka.  

Best of luck to you!

Edit:  If you proceed, you'll benefit greatly from local recognition.  So living in the area would be a plus.

"In addition to the many great points in the answers others gave to your question, there’s a lot to be said about shifting demographics as well. People pin a lot of the more radical conservative legislation being pushed through state houses now on Q/J6/Trumpers/etc., but I think that’s kind of missing the bigger picture. The truth is we just saw a sitting Republican president receive the most votes a candidate has ever received for the Republican Party, *and still lose*. Republicans across the country, rightly, see this next decade as their only real chance to pass through and maintain their desired legislation. They’ve always hated LGBTQ people (and yes, kids too), workers, people of color, etc., but have previously been able to rely on de facto policies and the prevalence of their base among active voters to maintain their view of the proper social order. That’s over now. So they’re going for broke and attempting to make that de facto social order into a de jure one.

Kansas is no different. We’ve swung towards Democrats in both 2018 and 2020 compared to 2016 (even if we still elected Republicans overall).

A snow day is taken, and they have to switch things up. Five snow days happen, and they have to pull assignments from a unit. They get data back from state practice tests that say their kids can't remember how to do something they learned three grades ago, so they have to reteach it. A kid pulls a gun at school & shoots the AD & SRO, so they're not teaching that day. Or maybe the next week even, as half the students are traumatized.

"Remember the guys involved in Unite the Right, QAnon, and J6?

Basically, they saw that their proclivities for violence made getting out onto the streets in national actions counterproductive because they got bad press, ended up with prison sentences, or were financially ruined due to [lawsuits and civil suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sines_v._Kessler). They turned to local ""politics"" instead.

So, they decided to go after local organizations like libraries and schools to ram their agendas through. They realized these organizations were ill-equipped to handle a mass-onslaught of angry organizing and veiled threats, and that controlling these organizations would either hurt ""woke"" ""liberals"" or get their own agenda instituted at a local level (probably both). This became a popular idea among the Far-Right and spawned multiple groups dedicated to this initiative. Because this initiative has grown so popular, right-wing legislators and other prominent right-wing groups are responding by publicly supporting it.

Areas with an embedded culture of community grassroots activism (for example, coastal California and much of the Northeast) are doing pretty good at resisting these folks. But areas that traditionally don't have a solid network of grassroots community activism (much of Kansas) are struggling to respond.

The best solution is to develop a robust network of community activism across Kansas communities. Unfortunately, it seems that a lot of Kansans tend to view activists as rabble-rousers and aren't sure how to feel about them.

TL;DR - these bills are created by a new wave of ""enthusiasm"" for local political intervention by people you _probably_ don't want anywhere near local government.

EDIT: additional reading:

* The groups founded to advance these efforts are [very new (often about 1 year old) and oftentimes members don't have kids in the school systems they are targeting](https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/who-behind-attacks-educators-and-public-schools)
* These groups and efforts are supported by familiar faces from [domestic extremist organizations](https://www.google.com/amp/s/chicago.suntimes.com/education/2021/11/21/22789363/gender-queer-proud-boys-downers-grove-north-south-culture-wars-school-board-illinois%3f_amp=true). As we've seen from the recent Unite the Right trial in Virginia and is becoming increasingly apparent from the J6 investigation, these types of groups often closely collaborate and their members are often involved in multiple similar groups.
* A key component of this strategy is threats and harassment, and it's so severe that the federal government is investigating. It isn't surprising because far-right groups have a history of [casually discussing harassment and violence in ""private"" communications](https://www.wired.com/story/leaked-alt-right-chat-logs-are-key-to-charlottesville-lawsuits/).

"I wouldn't even worry about it, Kansas is pretty friendly when it comes to this kind of stuff.  The only thing law enforcement cares about is that your registration and insurance is current, regardless of the state it came from.  Worst case scenario, if you get pulled over, they may spend a few extra minutes running your tags/VIN to make sure it's not stolen before sending you on your way.

To get a Kansas DL you'll need to show two forms of proof of residency, like a utility bill, cable/satellite bill, letter from your landlord or property tax statement, etc.  The information desk is really good at making sure you have all your documentation in order before you go stand in line for an hour and find out you're missing something.

For the vehicle registration, you will need an inspection.  They keep switching around which offices are doing inspections these days so call first and find out where/when these are done.  Basically you show up with the title, proof of insurance, previous state registration, they make sure the VIN is not reported stolen and the car is road-legal (lights & signals work, mirrors and glass are good, safety belts work), pay a few bucks and you're good to go.",t2_emixc,Mortimer452,0,1648012941.0,0,t1_i1re9n7,i1re9n7,True,Local_Crows,t3_tkmd9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/tkmd9q/license_question/,License Question,/r/kansas/comments/tkmd9q/license_question/i1re9n7/,12,r/kansas,0,12

"I'm interested in your point #5.  You ask about ""good diverse rural areas.""  Depending on where you are from, you might consider most of Kansas to be ""rural.""  If you are from someplace like the Los Angeles area or even Dallas/Ft Worth, Wichita (technically our biggest city) is going to seem rural by comparison.  The only truly ""urban"" area we have is the Kansas City metro area compared to large metropolitan areas.  You can drive from one side of Wichita to the other side in less than 30 minutes, for reference.  

I've lived in several cities in Kansas and have traveled throughout the State.  Based on what you've posted, you might be most comfortable in the Wichita area. It's diverse enough that you certainly wouldn't feel out of place in a mixed relationship and there are plenty of African Americans living and working there.  It's conservative, but most people mind their own business.  Very few people will give you any trouble for not being conservative. (There are always a few idiots around, so you could run into an exception or two). 

If you want to go to an even lower cost of living area, you could look for a small farming community within an hour or so of Wichita, but if you are from a large urban area, my suspicion is that you'd be unhappy with the lack of things to do.

"I got a bachelors in advertising, and let’s just say I’m lucky it was well rounded. From my experience, aside from your portfolio being immaculate, it’s more about how many different tricks you can do and who you know if you want to work full-time. It’s competitive like everywhere else, but there are fewer companies here than a lot of places and even fewer hiring. I’ve been freelancing and getting my own business running and so, I’m just thankful to have skills that I can use remotely and a broad range of skills. I’m not saying I have an advantage or disadvantage, but at the same time, you need to keep in mind the cheaper lifestyle also has a lower pay rate, and by being able to secure remote work, you can also negotiate a higher wage depending on where that remote company is from. Asking for $50k a year here for an editing job for a smaller agency is kind of unreasonable, but if it’s a company hiring for a remote editor in San Francisco and offering $50,000… you’ll be making a killing by living here and not starting work until 10-11am CST and they’re getting a steal of a deal on hiring an editor at a more affordable rate.",t2_4469jkj8,garbage_jooce,0,1647912115.0,0,t1_i1luygk,i1luygk,True,MisanthropeManic,t3_tjbw5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/tjbw5b/hi_kansas_citizens_i_wanted_to_inquire_a_couple/,Hi Kansas citizens!

"1. Well there's different jobs based on your qualifications, just like everywhere else. Expect the pay scale to be lower though.

2. Kansas was a free state. Read up on Bleeding Kansas, which was the conflict that directly preceded the civil war. You won't find a lot of rebel sympathizers here, and the ones that are likely moved here from somewhere else. People-wise, mostly more conservative-leaning than liberal-leaning, but most people will keep to themselves. There's a small minority of loud obnoxious super-trumpers, but they are usually easy enough to ignore.

3. Well, I'm not going to lie, it's heavily white. The bigger cities and college towns will be the ones with the most diversity and more tolerant of interracial relationships. The smallest towns probably less tolerant. There's still some racism, but I personally think that the deep south is a shitload worse. Expect whispers rather than in-your-face hatred. 

4. We have all 4 seasons. Cold in the winter, hot in the summer. Crazy storm season is about mid April through mid June. You get used to it. The key is to just be prepared. Your chances of ever being in a tornado are still pretty low.

5. Diverse rural areas is an oxymoron here. The more rural it is, the less diverse.

6. Well there's a lot of property crime in poor areas. Cost of living may be low, but wages suck.

"1. Ag, government, and healthcare. More tech oriented jn the KC metro area. The only place that's going to make it viable is living in NE KS, where the KC metro area encompasses. Wyandotte county is cheap but not so desirable to live in. Johnson county is nice but you're going to end up where you tried to escape- high COL.

2. I don't know about Wichita, but the urban areas in NE KS are not hard core right. That's mostly western and rural Kansas. I've only seen one truck with a ""F*CK JOE BIDEN"" flag in Lawrence, where I live. But you're asking your car to be keyed and dented if you park with that here. Johnson county KS has 600k and voted reliably biden this past election. A lot of their state reps are democrat too. They're a moderate red county.

3. Pretty diverse in Topeka and Kansas City, KS. It is not uncommon to see interracial couples. Large Hispanic and Vietnamese communities in southeast Kansas.

4. Fucking humid in the summer. Like it can be 80-90 degrees out with 90% humidity in the morning. You will beg for AC and will want to give the inventor an award. Nice springs and falls. Wonderful thunderstorms in the summer. Winters are a hit or miss. It is reliably dry. Average 1-3 good snow days in NE KS (eastern KS gets a lot more snow). Gets very windy in Western KS. Can get the occasional gusty days in NE KS. Like 50-70mph gusts lol.

5. Rural areas are more likely to be white

6. Any county that aren't in NE KS, the Wichita metro area, Shawnee County (Topeka), and Manhattan (Riley county)County.

Disclaimer: I'm biased towards city living.

I think Kansas is nice except for the ass backwards republican government and the lack of attracting companies. But the problem comes down to jobs.

"""Sex"" refers to your biology ie: chromosomes, primary and secondary sex characteristics, etc. ""Gender"" refers to identity ie: man, women, nonbinary, etc.

When a baby is born the doctor says ""it's a boy"" or ""it's a girl"" based on the appearance of your genitals. Around 1%-2% of the time a baby is born with ambiguous genitalia(intersex) and is often given surgery to ""correct"" their genitals. You don't actually know your chromosomes unless you've had a DNA test. What the doctor says when you're born puts into motion a huge legal and social apparatus that will inform every aspect of your life like who you marry, your hobbies, who your friends are, how you dress, your profession, your lifetime income, etc. But it turns out genitalia is a poor way to determine identity: aside from intersex people around 0.5% of people(millions of Americans) are transgender and as lgbtq+ identities face less discrimination we are seeing an explosion of people who identify as non-binary as people start feeling less pressured to hide who they are.",t2_j36kr,VoxVocisCausa,0,1647876676.0,0,t1_i1jh1c2,i1jh1c2,False,aclu_kansas,t3_tjcfr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/tjcfr0/today_the_ks_senate_is_poised_to_take_up_sb_484/,"Today the KS Senate is poised to take up SB 484, which targets trans children in Kansas.

The purpose of the bill is to politicize trans bodies and force transgender people out of the public. Especially in high school sports trans women who are on hormones have little to no competitive advantage over cis women. Also when this bill was introduced last year there were only 5 trans athletes playing in KS schools(and one report said that they're all assigned female at birth and therefore not covered by this bill). And that's before we talk about how the original bill was written by the ADF(an anti-lgbtq hate group) and the abusive and dehumanizing language used by several of the lawmakers supporting this bill.,t2_j36kr,VoxVocisCausa,0,1647874836.0,0,t1_i1jcm6j,i1jcm6j,False,aclu_kansas,t3_tjcfr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/tjcfr0/today_the_ks_senate_is_poised_to_take_up_sb_484/,"Today the KS Senate is poised to take up SB 484, which targets trans children in Kansas.

"1. Depends on what part of the state you're in. You're going to get a very different answer in the Garden/Dodge/Liberal area than in the Lawrence or Kansas City area and yet another different one in the Wichita area. Your field is not my field, so I couldn't tell you what kind of opportunities there are in multimedia. I don't know of any, but I don't know what non-movie-industry jobs in that field would be.
2. Politically the state really ranges from left-leaning to far-right, with a lot of diversity in between. It's only deep red instead of purple because we're gerrymandered all to hell. That said, the really red areas are REALLY red. I rarely see a rebel flag outside of a gun show though, and folks around where I live don't put up with racism.
3. I can only speak for my specific area (SW). There are some African Americans in this area, not as many as other ethnicities, but enough to be noticeable. They're well integrated with the community. that said, we are a very diverse and don't really put up with racism. I don't know how true that is for other parts of the state.
4. If you don't like the weather, just wait a bit. It'll change.
5. The Garden/Dodge/Liberal area is, as mentioned in 3, very diverse. Again, I can't speak for other parts of the state.
6. If you want to avoid the cities, the entire Western half of the state is rural. 30k people is a big town and major commerce hub out here.

"Sounds like you’ll want to live in Kansas City, the place is a melting pot of cultures and people, you just got to know where to look. Regarding your work in multimedia, there’s plenty of sports teams/tech companies looking for people all the time (chiefs, sporting KC, Garmin, T-Mobile, etc). Kansas on paper is a red state but most bigger towns west of Manhattan are pretty liberal (Lawrence, Overland Park, Olathe), people are extremely open and are super friendly. If your looking for a larger African American community, you’ll find it more in Kansas City than anywhere else. We have hot summers, cool falls, cold winters, and warm springs. Usually Lawrence is the place to be if you’re looking for a good diverse rural area as it’s about 40 minutes to KC and 30 minutes to Topeka (state capital) but far enough in the country so that you won’t deal with traffic. Usually some parts of east Kansas City (Missouri side) has the most crime but overall you won’t have to worry about it too much, there’s some poverty and crime in parts of Topeka but overall anywhere in Kansas is very safe at any given time.

"The best way to find them is by being a deer: they find the lion's share of them, hands down. The next best way is by going with someone who has found them in the past, but morel hunters are pretty secretive as a lot and don't want anyone else know where they've fount them.  There are some morel season websites that show when the season has begun in your area: it's worth looking around for those sites to schedule your trip.

My general rule of thumb is to look around a few days after it's warmed up and there's been a rain, especially this year since it is so dry. They seem to like dead trees, especially elms and I've had good luck looking under silver maple or cottonwood trees. One year they were under cedars, too. Don't forget to check for ticks; morel season typically puts you in the middle of a patch of ticks, so take a shower and check yourself afterwards.

"Kansas is very much a live and let live type of state. I don’t think calling us a red state is quite fair. I think many of us are actually more independent voters than Republican, but generally we do turn out in big numbers to vote Republican. That said, we have a Democratic governor right now. 

I don’t think you’ll experience a lot of prejudice though, unless your attitude comes off as judgmental towards other people.

There are very few Black people here. I also don’t think you’re going to be discriminated against heavily for being in a racial marriage and I don’t think it’s unsafe. Speaking for my community in general, there’s maybe half a dozen Black people in my part of the county with a population of say 20,000.

The weather is fairly hot and humid in the summer, muddy and wet in the winter, rainy in the spring, and just gorgeous in the fall. I like summers here quite a bit but the humidity generally means I turn the air conditioner on mid June and it stays on through roughly 1 October. Generally the furnace comes on mid November and stays on through mid April. That’s not to say there are not nice days in between those, especially in the winter. But it still means that it’s getting cold at night and if we don’t have the heater on it will cool down in the house.

I would highly suggest you come here and visit to see what places are like. Most all of the population lives in the eastern part of the state. In the western part of the state is very sparsely populated. I would suggest you consider Wichita, Lawrence, and Manhattan. Those are all medium size towns with at least 75,000 people. Wichita is quite large by Kansas standards but they’ve got a need downtown and a lot of nice neighborhoods. Lawrence is a college town home to the University of Kansas and is considered quite liberal. If you’re worried about tolerance and inclusion Lawrence should be on your shortlist. Manhattan is also a college town although its home to Kansas state which is the agricultural college. The big difference here is that it is obviously a college with more rural students who are more conservative overall. Still a nice community but a very different feel from Lawrence.

I wouldn’t tell you to stay away from anything. There are towns in Kansas that I’m not a huge fan of, like Emporia and Garden City. But that has a lot more to do with the complications of being a small town with a large meatpacking facility. Still, I wouldn’t tell you to stay away from any of them.

"I am not sure Kansas is for you….

1. Lot of agricultural, government, and education. For your line of work you would need to look at the Kansas City metro area or potentially Lawrence unless you could work remotely. 

2. Seen a few confederate flags and in the rural area it is more prejudice but it isn’t as overt as other states. But make no mistake, outside of Wyandotte, Douglas, Shawnee, and Sedgwick counties it is very, very red. It is exceptionally conservative. 

3. Very few African Americans outside of the above named counties. Kansans are normally polite but you are going to get some strange looks. Largest minority group are Hispanic and really concentrated in the western portion and the Kansas City area. 

4. 70 one day and a blizzard the next. Summers are brutally hot and winters can be long and very cold. It is a land of extremes. Humid in the east and dry in the west. 

5. Diversity in rural areas is primarily Hispanic in the western third of the state. You would be looking Liberal, Dodge City, Garden City, etc. but a diverse truly “rural” area is an oxymoron in Kansas. 

6. Crime ridden areas are Wyandotte County in the KC metro area portion, Sedgwick, and Shawnee Counties. Ford County also has a fair amount of crime (Dodge City).

3. I have no idea what this breakdown is. There is a good sized Lebanese and Vietnamese population in this area.
4. Fools spring man. Gets me every year
5. Not a clue. Wichita as far as a city goes is pretty easy to deal with. I can get across town in 30 minutes during rush hour.
6. Wichita does have a history with sex trafficking because of its location. I have heard south eastern Kansas has a lot of drugs running through it, but that is just what I have heard.

"I don't think all landlords are evil because that's statistically impossible.

But let's take your friends.

Your friends gained some money somehow and bought a property. Maybe they moved and just rented out their old house instead of selling or maybe their grand/parents bequeathed them a house or maybe they specifically bought it to rent.

Let's assume a few things that are certainly false, but they'll help us isolate and identify the evil part.

They are perfect property managers and never make any mistakes, nothing ever breaks or wears out, and property taxes never rise over the life of the mortgage.

This means that costs are always the same, meaning that rent these perfectly altruistic people charge is always the same for the life of the mortgage.

So boom. 30 years pass and their last tenent finished their lease without the option to renew. What do you know? That house they bought for a perfectly median $51,800 is now valued at $181,200.

So young couple Billy-Bob and Deshayla is house hunting. They happen to have exactly $181,200, and they offer it. But then GloboCorp comes in an offers $200k.

Our landlord would *love* to sell it to Billy-Bob and Deshayla, but profit is profit, and landlord did without profit for 30 years explicitly so that they could maximize it now.

So landlord sells to GloboCorp. And they, being an undying corporation immediately jack the price up to market value and rent it out for the next 100 years, profiting a couple million dollars.

This happens thousands of times per year.

Billy-Bob and Deshayla can't afford to buy, so they rent their whole lives, and so do their kids, and their grand kids, and great grand kids. All from GloboCorp.

Is it evil to maximize profit? No, not inherently. 

But is it evil to demonstrably contribute the creation of a permanent underclass of renting poors that had the misfortune of being born poor? Little bit.

But I'm certain that our landlord will shrug and say that it occurred millions of times before and after they profited, so surely it's not *their* straw that broke the camel's back.

Essentially by renting, landlord chose to maximize profit instead of giving someone the ability to buy a house and profiting less, and then by selling to GloboCorp, they effectively removed a unit of housing from the market because it's more profitable to either rent it out or let it sit empty when GloboCorp buys it outright for 0.1% of its annual income.

Will every landlord sell to GloboCorp? Certainly not. But they'd likely sell to the landlord with 5 properties, and they'd probably sell it to their buddy with a small apartment complex, and that landlord would very likely sell to GloboCorp.

That's how you get there, essentially. Regular ass greed. You can have no evil intentions, but still participate in an evil act because evil isn't some big bad.

"If you are pro government then you should also be pro taxes.  Therein, I think sales taxes are good including food sales taxes.   These are usury taxes.  The more you use the more you pay.

I agree that everyone pays property taxes. However if the state suddenly cut the food sales tax by 10% everyone would see savings from that. If property taxes were cut by 10% then only property owners would see the savings. As I’ve said before I really doubt that very many landlords are going to pass that savings onto their tenants.

"First of all, there are clearly other costs besides just the mortgage. I’m putting three new roofs on this summer. Where do you think the money comes from to do that? 

Second of all, you are making the assumption that renting is somehow inferior to ownership. The big part of my business is short term housing to people who are building a new house. They sell their old one, rent for a year, and then when their new one is done they move again. I also own some commercial properties and rent long-term housing to corporations that have workers in the area and want housing available to them so they can travel home on the weekend. 

Most people don’t benefit from owning a house unless they know they are going to be in an area for a little while. For most people, renting is what you do during a transitory time in your life and then when you get a little bit older and have greater stability you purchase. There is a demand for rentals and while I agree that for some there can be burdens to buying a house, there are plenty of people that have legitimate reasons for renting that make a good financial sense for them. 

Personally, I only have higher end residential properties and commercial. I don’t even think I participate in the same part of the market that you’re referring to when you are looking at people that have no choice but to rent because of financial reasons.

"In almost every case it is a more wise decision and to postulate that it's close is a boldface lie. If you took a poll of any given multi-unit property or housing renter, your most common answer would be that those individuals would prefer to be living in and owning property but cant because of barriers like this. 

The median household wealth among homeowners is 3,965% higher than it is among renters.

Excluding home equity, household wealth among homeowners is 1,469% higher than it is among renters.

Renters are 89.9% more likely than homeowners to be behind on housing payments (rent vs. mortgage payments).

The renter:owner ratio is 50.1%, its lowest since 2010 (49.56%).

"Neither party is trying to do anything about property taxes. 

Do you care to address any of the points I raised? As I see it we live in one of the least affordable states in the country. Low cost of living (and incomes), high housing costs, high property taxes, high sales taxes, and relatively high income taxes. 

If the average family is spending $500 a month on food that’s roughly $600 per year in sales tax on food. That’s significant, but that same family is probably spending on average $200 per month on property taxes on their house alone, not even including personal property taxes on cars. I’d say this is a far bigger issue than sales tax on food. Besides, she’s not going to get any widespread support on it so it’s already a dead issue. That’s why it’s pandering.

"While in general I could agree with this, this is clearly just pandering for votes. If she wanted to do something about the cost of living in Kansas the obvious place to start is property taxes. 

As a landlord, I’m here to tell you this is going to be a rough year for tenants. I’m seeing 15 to 50% increases in property taxes on my rentals, and property taxes on average equal two months rent. This is going to result in about a 10% across-the-board increase, and that’s just to keep up with the increase property taxes and insurance and property repair costs. Personally speaking, I don’t expect this year‘s rent increases to do anything except keep up with increased ownership cost. And this is going to increase the B and C class rentals the most, which means it’s going to hit the tenants paying the least the hardest.

They also have a nice piece on stream bank forestry: [https://www.kansasforests.org/streamside\_forestry/bestmanagement.html](https://www.kansasforests.org/streamside_forestry/bestmanagement.html) In it they talk about cutting willow sticks, sticking them in the bank where they will take root--it works and now is the time to harvest willow twigs to make the live stakes.

It's actually in a really lovely little forested valley and it's very pretty, but college students who never leave urban areas go fuck around out there and swear up and down that it's ""creepy"" or that they could ""feel a presence"" off in the woods. Horseshit.

The story is that a witch was buried there in the 1800s.

"It's outside of Lawrence, but not worth a trip. It's in a privately owned cemetery and the sheriff will trespass you if you go in without permission. There are neighbors with good views and they do keep an eye out. 

There are exactly zero documented cases of supernatural or demonic activity. It was just an easy-to-reach, dilapidated church that KU students made up stories about so they could go scare themselves. It was bulldozed because the liability of having an ""attractive nuisance"" was way too high and because people are jerks who littered and damaged the headstones.

If you really, really must visit Stull cemetery (looking at you, Supernatural fans), consider attending the sunrise service on Easter morning held by the Stull United Methodist Church. It's a nice service and not too long since it's usually cold. Assuming Covid isn't awful, they have good pancakes afterwards, too. Be sure to make a contribution if you attend the breakfast. 

There are living people whose loved ones are buried in Stull cemetery, so please be respectful and don't do anything damaging or that makes a mess (like throwing bottles).

Also, it is far less photogenic than the ""Stull Cemetery"" used in the show. Just FYI. Unless you are driving that road for some other reason, there are much better ways to spend a day in Lawrence.

Source: I drive by it at least once a week and attended the church for a few years when I lived nearby. 

Bonus info for Supernatural fans: the street that the Winchester house is on in the show does exist in Lawrence, but the address does not. Nothing even close.

Another one is they have the same size economy:

It is also unlikely that the plane is operating near you with any greater purpose than an exercise or equipment test. You do also realize that if they wanted to practice  “strafing runs” or “pylon turns” since you can’t seem to decide which one it was, that the military has countless live ranges where they could blast the hell out of targets using live rounds right?

"That's speculation based on short term data. The truth is that Dixie Alley was always very active, and tornado numbers have always varied wildly state to state per year. 

Per square mile, Oklahoma and Mississippi are the most active severe weather states in the USA, with Kansas, Texas, Alabama and Florida not far behind. Florida gets a lot of weaker end tornados. Texas gets the most overall because the state is huge. Kansas gets more than Oklahoma, because Kansas is a bigger state than Oklahoma.

It used to be that they only kept track of larger, more destructive tornados. Now these days, communication, radar, and drone survey abilities allow very few tornados to go unrecorded. So the ones that were likely never recorded in the past are being recorded today.

It's likely that they were always happening, and that there is no real shift. It's just that the right ingredients for an outbreak can come together over wide swaths of the USA east of the Rockies.

Did you know there was a tornado in Washington DC in 1814? That's what really saved the city from the British during the war of 1812. The British decided that it wasn't worth keeping if the weather was that crazy.

"**[Pylon turn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylon_turn)** 
 
 >A pylon turn is a flight maneuver in which an aircraft banks into a circular turn, in such a way that an imaginary line projecting straight out the side of the aircraft (nominally the wing) points to a fixed point on the ground. The maneuver originated early in the 20th century in air racing. In some contexts, simply making a turn around a fixed point on the ground (such as a physical pylon) is called a ""pylon turn"". In these cases, the altitude may be incorrect for the maneuver to be a proper ""pylon turn"" where all three parameters (altitude, speed, bank angle) come together for the wing to point to the fixed turning center on the ground.

"dare I say, defunded.

Its a way to make the government seem incompetent despite the best effort of its talented, passionate emplyoyees. I guess I'm glad I'm not raising kids in Kansas. If I was the brain drain would drive them from the state anyways. what a deplorable, depressing state. I love it but if I had kids it would be sad.

I dunno dude weird stuff goes on in Kansas. 13 years ago when I was a middle schooler in Overland Park we had a C-130 appear and circle over the area every day during my gym class for a week.
