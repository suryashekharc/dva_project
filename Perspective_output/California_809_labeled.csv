>> As a result of these various efforts, Boswell and his heirs got to own one of the most extensive farming operations of the United States. To this day, the family company ranks among the country's top 100 overall landowners. The farming operation is one of the country's top 10 in terms of output.

>> You can participate in the family's ventures by buying stock in the J.G. Boswell Company. The shares of the company are traded on an OTC segment of the US stock exchange. However, only 990,000 shares are outstanding in total, and the family controls most of them. Shares do change hands occasionally, but the average trading volume is just a few dozen shares per day. On some days, no trade takes place at all.

151,"> The report points out there are several reasons a home could be vacant; it may be on the market or it could be a vacation home. There’s also the chance it’s uninhabitable.

How is a vacation home considered in this? These homes are maintained and used.  

Inhabitable homes should not be considered. That’s like counting undeveloped land. If people can’t live it then it’s not vacant it’s unsafe. 

> A low vacancy rate often means there’s strong demand in the housing market, and typically home prices are higher, writes LendingTree. But the opposite isn’t always true. Some of the states with high vacancy rates have affordable housing markets, while others have lots of expensive homes that are simply sitting vacant most of the time because they are vacation homes or weekend homes.

> Unsurprisingly to anyone living in California, low vacancy rates here are correlated with high prices. Of all 50 states, California has the second-highest median home value at $593,400. 


In the r/CentralValley sub I tried to explain to someone that we are not short on homes and we did not slow building after 2008. We are short on affordable homes. 

Not to mention a lot of these empty homes are poorly located. They are built by developers thinking if you build it they buy. Not true if the jobs are few or the drive is long. Not everyone is willing to do 3-6 hours round trip commuting. 

Near Tracy a new community called Mountain House took many years to take off but they kept building despite lack of buyers. 
They are still building. It’s mostly due to the Bay Area not longer being affordable for so many and Mountain House being  at the tip of the Central Valley so it’s not extending their commute by much. Still the homes are not affordable for most residents that have been living in the San Joaquin area for a long time.

Yeah, then I think it's out for the delta. There are any number of guys out there who literally irrigate by turning off their pumps that drain their fields from the seepage that come from the levies. 

Delta farming, as I know it atleast, is kind of crazy. I think a lot of it will have to change or go away, but how that happens is going to be complicated because the farming impacts infrastructure and the surrounding cities and towns. 

I see a lot of delta farming changing to something that is more of ecology management kind of stuff. Or, as I think you wrote above, some kind of regenerative farming with subsidies to help farmers change or offset the loss in yield. I know people say you can make more, but it takes time to get there and can have other issues associated with it.

272,"What a laugh.

""Low tax low reg areas are no longer backwaters we flyover despite 50 years of neoliberalism (Reaganism!)""

Oh wait.

What a lot of people don't realize, particularly those trumpeting doom and gloom California, is the basic, *basic* difference between net and gross. Like the first thing taught in introductory econ.

**Gross** there may be singular examples of businesses leaving, like Tesla. **Net** is reality where California replaces Tesla so fast there's no blip in its economy, nevermind that Tesla's ""flight"" has some rather notable disclaimers doom and gloomers don't tend to shed light to. Like how they didn't actually leave.

The below table is California business count by worker size starting in 2012 when gerrymandering ended and Legislature got its act together. They started writing more taxes and regulations. Businesses screamed every time something new came up, saying it'll destroy the industry. Notice that nearly all columns, from small to big businesses, are a net gain every year. Well, up until 2020 anyways, but that was COVID.

The funniest thing about people claiming businesses flee to low tax states is that they actually don't. They ""flee"" to the high tax, high reg blue areas within those states, not the low tax, low reg flyover areas.

The [Los Angeles River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_River) What is essentially turned into a concrete channel to avoid floods. And it does that marvelously, but what happens instead is that concrete moves the water downstream more quickly than a natural river would, so A lot of water is lost very quickly.

Also, yes, golf courses are a waste. Having said that, they are also a very, very small percentage of water used, whereas agriculture uses 80% of human water use in California.

426,"> Despite pressure from experts urging a strong mandate, [Newsom's] order leaves the exact conservation measures up to the urban water providers and major water wholesalers that supply the vast majority of Californians. It does not affect agricultural water providers, or the small water systems that are especially vulnerable to drought. 

Seems this article headline is a little misleading, especially considering Newsom's administration really messed up water releases last year. 

> The calculation for the Sacramento River region was off by 68%, leaving the state’s reservoirs with far less water supply than expected.

Since the state makes the calls about water releases, much more water was released last year than is appropriate. Apparently Turlock Irrigation District was extremely close in its estimates on the Tuolumne River basin. The NOAA’s California Nevada River Forecast Center – whose data many water districts incorporate into their calculations – was also extraordinarily close. But the state really was way off and ended up releasing more water than was appropriate. Now Newsom's administration is putting forward toothless mandates in response to the states mistakes.

Also missing from the discussion is the fact that over the past 40 years California (the state) has not completed a major water storage project of statewide significance despite the state’s population nearly doubling. Lastly the Democrat controlled state legislature just rejected a major piece of legislation to invest heavily (using the surplus) in water infrastructure.",t2_fwsmi6ff,aBetterCalifornia,1,1648576743.0,0,t1_i2ldafq,i2ldafq,True,BlankVerse,t3_tr9p43,https://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/tr9p43/california_drought_newsom_orders_tighter_water/,California drought: Newsom orders tighter water rules that could ban some from watering grass,/r/California/comments/tr9p43/california_drought_newsom_orders_tighter_water/i2ldafq/,-1,r/California,1,-1,0.0714949,0.013742739,0.043097325,0.06246513,0.0061604395,0.014528676,0.0087667145

667,"Direct Subsidies


Intangible Drilling Costs Deduction (26 U.S. Code § 263. Active). This provision allows companies to deduct a majority of the costs incurred from drilling new wells domestically. In its analysis of President Trump’s Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Proposal, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that eliminating tax breaks for intangible drilling costs would generate $1.59 billion in revenue in 2017, or $13 billion in the next ten years.


Percentage Depletion (26 U.S. Code § 613. Active). Depletion is an accounting method that works much like depreciation, allowing businesses to deduct a certain amount from their taxable income as a reflection of declining production from a reserve over time. However, with standard cost depletion, if a firm were to extract 10 percent of recoverable oil from a property, the depletion expense would be ten percent of capital costs. In contrast, percentage depletion allows firms to deduct a set percentage from their taxable income. Because percentage depletion is not based on capital costs, total deductions can exceed capital costs. This provision is limited to independent producers and royalty owners. In its analysis of the President’s Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Proposal, the JCT estimated that eliminating percentage depletion for coal, oil and natural gas would generate $12.9 billion in the next ten years.


Credit for Clean Coal Investment Internal Revenue Code § 48A (Active) and 48B (Inactive). These subsidies create a series of tax credits for energy investments, particularly for coal. In 2005, Congress authorized $1.5 billion in credits for integrated gasification combined cycle properties, with $800 million of this amount reserved specifically for coal projects. In 2008, additional incentives for carbon sequestration were added to IRC § 48B and 48A. These included 30 percent investment credits, which were made available for gasification projects that sequester 75 percent of carbon emissions, as well as advanced coal projects that sequester 65 percent of carbon emissions. Eliminating credits for investment in these projects would save $1 billion between 2017 and 2026.


Nonconventional Fuels Tax Credit (Internal Revenue Code § 45. Inactive). Sunsetted in 2014, this tax credit was created by the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 to promote domestic energy production and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Although amendments to the act limited the list of qualifying fuel sources, this credit provided $12.2 billion to the coal industry from 2002-2010.
 

Indirect Subsidies


Last In, First Out Accounting (26 U.S. Code § 472. Active). The Last In, First Out accounting method (LIFO) allows oil and gas companies to sell the fuel most recently added to their reserves first, as opposed to selling older reserves first under the traditional First In, First Out (FIFO) method. This allows the most expensive reserves to be sold first, reducing the value of their inventory for taxation purposes.


Foreign Tax Credit (26 U.S. Code § 901. Active). Typically, when firms operating in foreign countries pay royalties abroad they can deduct these expenses from their taxable income. Instead of claiming royalty payments as deductions, oil and gas companies are able to treat them as fully deductible foreign income tax. In 2016, the JCT estimated that closing this loophole for all American businesses operating in countries that do not tax corporate income would generate $12.7 billion in tax revenue over the course of the following decade.


Master Limited Partnerships (Internal Revenue Code § 7704. Indirect. Active). Many oil and gas companies are structured as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). This structure combines the investment advantages of publicly traded corporations with the tax benefits of partnerships. While shareholders still pay personal income tax, the MLP itself is exempt from corporate income taxes. More than three-quarters of MLPs are fossil fuel companies. This provision is not available to renewable energy companies.


Domestic Manufacturing Deduction (IRC §199. Indirect. Inactive). Put in place in 2004, this subsidy supported a range of companies by decreasing their effective corporate tax rate. While this deduction was available to domestic manufacturers, it nevertheless benefitted fossil fuel companies by allowing “oil producers to claim a tax break intended for U.S. manufacturers to prevent job outsourcing”. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that repealing this deduction for coal and other hard mineral fossil fuels would have saved $173 million between 2012 and 2016. This subsidy was repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115 – 97) starting fiscal year 2018.",t2_11o4ho,gunghogary,0,1648280129.0,0,t1_i26324h,i26324h,False,BlankVerse,t3_tnqiza,https://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/tnqiza/californians_find_bargain_gas_prices_in_mexico/,Californians find bargain gas prices in Mexico | regular gas sells for an average of $3.96 a gallon — nearly $2 less than in California.
