7,"I agree that raw milk should be legal to sell as long as it's labeled properly and that most people should be fine drinking it. But pasteurization exists for a reason: a small chance multiplied by hundreds of millions of people results in an unnecessary amount of sickness and death.

The *main* draw to raw milk is better taste (that's the inherent trade-off in pasteurization). Yes, heating can change nutrition and availability of probiotics, but pointing that out is very different from establishing quantifiable health differences solely between drinking pasteurized milk and raw milk.

It's like drinking kombucha for health reasons.

57,"We've been using the Oliverio's hot peppers in my home ever since my uncle who made them at home passed away.

Our favorite and most frequently made dish is as follows.

Slice up several large yellow potatoes medium thin, give them a quick hard saute' in a pot til the edges just start to go translucent. Dump in a large jar, or 2-3 small jars of hot peppers. Fill the now empty jar about half full of water and dump that in too. Add red pepper flakes (however much you like), 3-4 cloves of mashed garlic, couple pinches of parsley, a few turns of cracked black pepper, a pinch of salt. Stir, cover, simmer till potatoes are soft all the way through and sauce re-thickens. Stirring very gently to avoid breaking up potatoes, every few minutes while simmering.

When potatoes are done, uncover and let stand 5-10 minutes to cool and thicken a bit more. Plate, drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Serve with warm 'Tally bread and butter.

This was a recipe I got from my Nonna. I've been eating it my whole life, but I'd say my family has been making this for easily 60-70 years. I just made some for dinner this past Friday, and the leftovers were gone by Sunday morning. It's delicious and I can't recommend it enough.

I’m all for telling the extraction industry to take a flying leap, but what interest do you think developers have if they can’t get near the natural entertainment resource.  There is a reason summersville after all these years is still just a Walmart and car dealership.  If they can build on the lake they just aren’t going to build.  You have to give in somewhere.  All the actual tourist possibilities are locked up to new development.  They aren’t going to build something ten miles away.  When you go to the beach you want a hotel or house on the beach.  Nobody is going to travel to stay at summersville crappy camp ground.",t2_iuo9bd5b,porchguitars,0,1647975094.0,0,t1_i1p2hk8,i1p2hk8,False,Slash3040,t3_tk038m,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/tk038m/wv_bill_would_allow_privatization_of_state_parks/,WV bill would allow privatization of state parks,/r/WestVirginia/comments/tk038m/wv_bill_would_allow_privatization_of_state_parks/i1p2hk8/,1,r/WestVirginia,0,1,0.1818762,0.06489887,0.072196774,0.23322578,0.175161,0.071285166,0.023887334
378,"First thing to get money flowing in: stop being a grifting social conservative shithole of a state 100% focused on culture war nonsense. Since that isn't happening for another few decades at minimum, if ever, there is never going to be a major investment into WV from the private sector. As long as grifting remains the #1 priority of elected officials in this state, no one outside of Dollar General is going to put major dollars into anything in this state, let alone industries or tourism. This state has to rethink its priorities from the ground up.

Second thing to get money flowing in: improve infrastructure tenfold. Nobody likes dodging 1,000 potholes and driving windy roads for 4 hours to get 100 miles. Also nothing is going to locate here so long as the dominant internet is Frontier 3MB ""high speed"" internet. Money is being dumped hand over fist into this for minimal improvement, which gets back to grifting. Let's not even get into water and sanitary sewer limitations for large scale development.

Third thing to get money flowing in: NOT GIVING AWAY PUBLIC FUCKING LAND FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPERS. Most of this state is gobbled up by land companies from the days of George Washington. And fun note, almost all of our parks sit right next to these kinds of lands. Start getting that land out from under resource extractors and into developer's hands, then all of a sudden we aren't sacrificing things people have spent over a century trying to preserve for the sake of a few pennies on the dollar from some grifter to put minimal dollars in and pay nothing other than minuscule property taxes even after development. If the Boy Scouts paid a dime in taxes, they would be a prime example of investing in private lands, not taking away public lands.

436,"I used to work for the State Park Service, only a temporary summer job, so my knowledge is limited, but I did learn a few things. To me, this seems to be a bit of a shot in the foot for West Virginia. During my time working for the parks, I learned that the big parks, like Watoga, which my boss's smaller park was under, make a lot of money for the state. I would feel like contracting bits of state ownership out to private companies, particularly the renting of cabins and camping spots, would strip the State Park Service of so many vital funds. I understand the sentiment of wanting to encourage investment in the state, I'm just not sure if this is the right way of doing it.

Also, I'd like to point out this line, quoted from Angie Rosser, someone campaigning against this measure, ""lawmakers are interested in opening privatization of activities like casinos, like amusement parks."" Most of our parks are centered around natural areas, it would seem that building casinos and amusement parks kinda contradicts the whole purpose of the park being in a natural area.

Least favorite: The crushing poverty, low wages, and disinvestment from the area.

Much of this can of course be attributed to the fact that Gov.

I thought moving back here was going to be one of the best things I could have ever done for myself, but it's turned out to be one of the worst. I regret ever moving back to this part of the state; things aren't the same as they were four years ago when I graduated high school.

671,"If you are near Canaan Valley would check this place out. We are not originally from WV but have lived here for 13 years now and love it. We don't love far from this outfitter but only discovered this place last summer. My kids are little older and the gal that owns this business rents standup paddle boards and Kayaks for $25 for pretty much as long as you want to use in a day. Her company does float trips and some whitewater stuff too. Floating the Cheat River, a completely wild river, is fantasticly chill. She even rents float coolers so you can tow a picnic along with you. The water is deep in places but crystal clear, no agriculture anywhere along it's path. Then you can go up the Mountain to stay at the newly renovated lodge at Blackwater Falls. Cabins are great there, lots of nice short hikes for kids of that age, petting zoo, etc. Better book now if you want a cabin. I have lived all over the US but WV is by far the best place. We chose to stay here over a paid company transfer to Colorado. You can't go wrong anywhere in the Eastern Mountain Counties. Just drive around and explore, people are super friendly and it's 100% genuine. Place is truly a hidden gem. Here is link to outfitter.

Probably too late to book the cast away caboose but it's the bomb. This railroad offers other day trips though. It's a little shabby but great fun. The castaway caboose isn't shabby, it's sweet. The day trip stuff is a little run down but it's someone's labor of love to keep these rail trips alive.

762,"“You don’t matter to me whatsoever.”

Pro narcissism!

Personally, I tend to care about internet strangers, even when they’re toxic. I tend to wish they felt better and didn’t buy into so much nonsense, but that’s just me.

I say the same thing because I know where I stand. Or what, should I make up new answers I don’t even believe in, to be a narcissist or troll or something? I have nothing more to say than what I see. It’ll always be the same except when I see something new and evolve my perspective.

You know someone who did flip-flip though, making up answers for whatever best suited them? Hillary Clinton. I remember when she rejected gay marriage, but later supported it, because it was gaining popularity. There’s a difference between evolving your perspective, and being spineless and bending with the wind for whatever will keep you in power. Clinton is the biggest thing that broke Liberalism’s stronghold on me. Maybe if she hadn’t been around, I’d still be beholden and voting for Biden. Who knows.

Edit: Also, the whole “you don’t matter to me at all” is a precise narcissistic tactic. It’s a way for you to defend yourself in your head instead of confronting your behavior and hatred. If I don’t matter to you (and if my existence or perspective doesn’t even matter in general), then your hatred, categorizations, and generalizations seem logical and justifiable. You get to treat me or view me however you want, because I and my experiences and perspectives aren’t valid and don’t matter. How very xonvenient for you!

Like I said somewhere, narcissism ain’t original. You’re behaving like any other narcissist. (Which is also precisely what you’re projecting onto me, that I’m just like any other Conservative, even though I’ve already presented differing viewpoints — but you can’t acknowledge them, because it would fracture your superiority complex of being 100% right even if you’re not.)

Thankfully narcissism is not a terminal mental illness IMO, so I hope someday you get better.

Edit 2: oh yeah, Russia is aggressive. Again, I didn’t imply otherwise. I’m only pointing out that America/NATO isn’t perfect or angelic or innocent in this situation. NATO’s progression is a form of aggression. It doesn’t justify Putin’s aggression; it’s just a contributing factor. Like I again said somewhere, Putin’s aggression is innately part of him, and things like Ukraine independence or NATO encroachment are just triggers for him to be more of himself.

I think you all just don’t know how to divorce yourselves from taking sides in order to see all parts clearly. NATO isn’t innocent just because it’s not Putin. Putin isn’t justified just because NATO betrayed him. Etc. These toxic leaders are playing chess with us as the pawns. I’m not anyone’s pawn. You’ll see things differently when you stop being Biden’s/America‘a/Democrats’/Liberalism’s/NATO’s pawn.

All the matters is protecting innocence with dignity. Taking sides tends to alway betray the sanctity and freedom of innocence, even when you take “the good side.”",t2_j4nggo4v,artegon117,0,1647750469.0,0,t1_i1d91t8,i1d91t8,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_ti5zcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/ti5zcv/wv_democrats_respond_to_justices_gas_tax_statement/,WV Democrats respond to Justice's gas tax statement,/r/WestVirginia/comments/ti5zcv/wv_democrats_respond_to_justices_gas_tax_statement/i1d91t8/,1,r/WestVirginia,0,1,0.4711267,0.28991646,0.6633596,0.567169,0.21789412,0.1927241,0.13341452

If you want to go down to the river bottom, you could drive to the Cotton Hill parking area and explore. There's a wide trail from the parking area to Hawks Nest Dam. On the way to Cotton Hill, you'd pass Hawks Nest State Park and Mystery Hole (closed for the season).",t2_2104wque,local_drifter_,0,1647746667.0,0,t1_i1d2h1h,i1d2h1h,True,dcasta123,t3_ti8fh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/ti8fh5/any_recommendations_for_fayetteville/,Any recommendations for Fayetteville?,/r/WestVirginia/comments/ti8fh5/any_recommendations_for_fayetteville/i1d2h1h/,3,r/WestVirginia,0,3,0.062253486,0.027411155,0.023227822,0.043580536,0.06681714,0.043768875,0.053025752

(Or in the case of hating Trump, also throwing Russia under the bus in plain view. You think Putin found Democratic Trump-Era Russia-bashing flattering?)

Putin is an overt warmonger.

Biden et al instigate war in other ways. Like I said, it’s not overt/superficial. With the way they behaved during Trump, it’s a self-fulfilling prophesy are this point. Biden’s so lucky Russia attacked Ukraine too, it’s exactly what he needed for his horrendous poll numbers. Now everyone will forget Afghanistan and applaud him as a hero!

For anyone who watched House of Cards, you might remember how Frank threw Russia under the bus and pushed things to the brink of nuclear war, just to win an election. Remember, Frank Underwood is a Democrat! That show gives us an idea of how some of these top-tier Democrats behave. Obama even remarked it as similar to DC.

On another point, while Biden was calling Putin a tyrant or dictator or whatever the other day, I saw that the Kremlin refused to respond and mocked his comments as “irritable.” That emphasized for me how stupid and reckless Biden is. Imagine your worst arch-enemy being kind to you, because you’re a moron who’s stoking fires, and your enemy’s just gonna let you do it. That’s our Biden!

I don't think its one single thing. A mix of inflation, speculation, a small bit from Russian oil.

Biden certainly hasn't helped since he got in. While his executive actions have done little to the oil industry directly, it signaled the oil industry to hold up or face possible consequences. They have severely cut drilling and fracking. Everyone is afraid to be caught with a ton of investments out and suddenly getting the rug pulled from under them by the white house. Production is behind, it hasn't grown with the post covid demand. It likely won't get better for years. In my area all oil work aside from legacy jobs like compressor stations and water bottles has moved on. Now what little is left is up in PA. I think Antero might do three fracks for the entire year.

We had to set her loose. See, she was suffering from dementia. She was living with us for a while because the retirement home would not keep her any more ever since she kept gathering acorns and shrubberies in her hair, and at one point she had an actual birds nest on her head; she would yell ""the Raven's of Satan are comin' for Yee!"" and would cackle at the other retirees. She refused to cut her nails for like a decade because ""them's squirrels gonna get my 'corns"" she would say. Eventually we put her in the back of the pick up and droved her out to Grant County and set her loose. She did not want to go at first, so we took some logs wrapped in old sheets, dipped them in gasoline, lit them on fire and just waved her off.
