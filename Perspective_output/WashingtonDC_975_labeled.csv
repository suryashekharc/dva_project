84,"Hey OP - I see it's your first day here. Welcome to Reddit! 


Here are some tips for you:


Everyone in DC knows you aren't here to help. If you cared about anyone here you would've solicited donations of food and supplies for others before going across the country to harass people here. But unfortunately that isn't as profitable as seeking donations. There is no goodwill for your organization to earn here and no more opinions to change. The people who support you are largely elsewhere and they already think you're just great, fighting for freedom and such. They don't need more evidence. People here were opposed to you before you came here, and they don't like you any more now. You've gotten your live streams for the audiences at home, so leave. If you cared about anyone here you'd be volunteering instead of doing live streams and drinking in Hagerstown, where fewer people think this whole thing is a big circus that draws in stupid and gullible people like flies on shit.

An 87% majority in an ABC News/Ipsos survey say that Russian President Vladimir Putin bears at least a good amount of blame for the war between Russia and Ukraine...  
  
In Monmouth's polling, 81% of Americans support the economic sanctions imposed on Russia, even as 33% say in a separate question that these sanctions are doing a lot to hurt the US economy. In a Pew Research survey, 85% of Americans favor keeping strict economic sanctions on Russia.  
  
That support crosses party lines. In Monmouth's poll, 75% of Republicans and 91% of Democrats support the sanctions. Pew finds even less of a partisan gap, with 85% of Republican and Republican-leaners in favor, compared with 88% of Democrats and Democratic-leaners.""

From my view in NW, I saw them fly down the Mall from the Capitol area, past the Monument, and disappeared over the horizon where Georgetown is (were they going to JBA? Can't tell).  I did not receive any alerts on my phone about aerial flyovers or exercises.  

About 45 minutes later, I saw a single helicopter emerge from the place they all went toward and then return to the point of origin.  I know nothing about helicopters, but they did not appear to be the usual medical/traffic copters or what I've seen of the Presidential fleet.

596,"You can be educated, and efficiently so, from a congressional hearing. If you're going to attribute a blanket statement to me, get it right. You cannot be educated efficiently about a judicial nominee to the supreme court from these hearings, because their purpose in our modern government is for politicians to grandstand. 

Case in point: in the hours you spent watching the hearing, you learned as much surface level information about her as a cursory 5 minute read of her on google could have told you. If you wanted that information in a form you could listen to while doing other things, you could have gotten it by having a wapo article read to you over 5 minutes, or listening to any number of 15 minute long podcast segments regurgitating the relevant digestible soundbites and discussing them. 

I normally applaud education and civil engagement, but when you're holding up your memorization of a paragraph's worth of surface level trivia over the course of hours as some sort of accomplishment, i only see problems.

So, I'm on a plan so I pay only for wind-powered energy. The actual electricity that enters my house could be from coal, gas, nuclear, solar, wind, or whatever.

623,"I think it's a blend of things. Probably personal impatience is in there some, which I know I share with you. It gets really frustrating to be someone in a hurry who also has a lot of situational awareness when a lot of others really, really don't have that.

I also wonder about the volume of travelers to DC right now who aren't as used to traveling. I used to fly allllllll the time but because of COVID and having an infant shortly before COVID I've been very cautious. We finally took the baby to my hometown to visit family last May and it was truly remarkable just how much NO ONE knew what they were doing...and it seemed like most people flying were people unconcerned about the pandemic. Don't want to draw any conclusions but it seems like there's a lot of overlap between not caring about the pandemic and not having flown a lot. Plane tickets were cheap. Why not get out while others weren't flying?

668,"You realize that all of the water runoff from storm drains in DC lead UNFILTERED and UNTREATED into the Potomac River? So every time a homeless person or a dog owner doesn't pick up their poop, that bacteria will eventually find its way into the water and into your eyes, nose, mouth, and even lady parts. 

That's just the poop part. All of the plastic and trash that you see in the streets ends up in the water if you don't pick it up. No one needs a lecture on the chemicals that are leached from that trash. Think about the oil and dirt in the streets, the soaps that people use to wash their cars, and the fertilizers in the grass. Not only do these things create disgusting conditions on their own, but they also create the perfect storm for toxic algae. In combination with warming temperatures, toxic algae blooms have increased dramatically in VA's freshwater sources. They can kill a dog in less than 15 minutes just from contact on the skin. 

I'm not sure about current levels, but it was just 10 years ago that the estrogen levels in urine of women taking birth control was a huge issue for the Potomac. Do you remember when male fish were laying eggs? Children exposed to these levels obviously would be most affected.

The water authorities routinely test the Potomac River for pollution and harmful chemicals. Those of us that fish, see the warning signs sometimes all the way down to Stafford. It is well known not to eat the fish you catch in and downstream from DC. Upstream is much cleaner, and you can safely swim and eat fish in Ashburn and Sterling. 

People aren't willing to even do the simplest of things in disposing their OWN trash properly (in a bag that can't loosely fly off a truck or from the wind), let alone pick up a piece of trash on the ground that's not theirs. Throw a grappling hook or a metal coat hanger in the water and then pull it back. Until that hook comes out clean, you will never get a watering hole. And that's the LEAST of the water quality requirements.

Rifles and shotguns are pretty tough to conceal which makes them generally less useful for things like robbery or assault (as you will be seen coming from quite some distance and draw a lot of attention to yourself).  They are also somewhat unwieldy at very close ranges (such as being close enough to hand people a wallet).  There's a reason why handguns are vastly preferred for those applications (along with things like self defense).  Preventing ownership of handguns while allowing rifles and shotguns (mostly used for hunting and other sport applications) is a generally good balance between allowing weapons enthusiasts and sportsmen to engage in their hobbies while reducing the number of firearms available (and making their possession a crime in and of itself) for criminal activities.

They are heavily filtered: both by the politicians grandstanding on both sides about the candidate, and the candidate themself, who is doing their best to filter out any substantive answer about the law from any response. 

About the only hearing in the last couple decades you could learn anything relevant is kavanaugh's, and only then because you could see how short temper, which allowed you to learn about his terrible temperment. Usually the candidates are better about controlling their emotions to be neutral throughout. 

That's the one exception. KBJ is not an exception in the sense that her hearing is as uninformative as nearly every other confirmation hearing has been.

I used to work in an upscale Italian restaurant and one day 3 women came in.  They were loud and abusive to the staff all through their meal.  The front of the house manager got to the point he was tempted to toss them out and lose the revenue and food from their meal. 

Other diners would look at them and ask us if we could do something about it.  

Finally they were leaving and the leader of this bunch turned to me and straightened my tie.  Yes, she placed hands on me and I was not pleased.  She then said something to me, while her hands were still on my chest, that I will never forget, “Tell me, what time do you get off?”  

I looked her up and down as the manager watched shaking his head cause he knew me and told her, “About an hour after I get home” and walked away.  He broke up laughing and she left red faced.

884,"Yes. Watching hearings can give any viewer the sense of what type of people are working in government or are nominated for government positions or what bills are being debated, which will leave them more informed. There is a plethora of information available here and its not just republican soundbites. Its sad your perception is that they serve no other purpose except to be propaganda for Fox News. Although I can understand that someone who hasnt watched the hearings would think so (assuming you havnt). That is why I advocate for citizens to watch any congressional hearings for themselves.


The hearing with the Judiciary Committee on the American Music Fairness Act a month ago was interesting. None of the republicans were being obtuse except for one odd question about ""why is copyright length is life + 70 years"" (which is irrelevant to the AMFA bill).


I think everyone should watch congressional hearings. I think everyone should strive to be more informed. Again, an easy way to do that is engage with the free access to watch the public hearings that congress continuously has.


It shouldn't be hard to comprehend. Plenty of people listen to podcasts and talk radio about subjects they care about. Maybe congressional hearings is that for me.

How is that right?

Personally I believe the children are our future but apparently these people missed the memo entirely.

What I want is for ALL children in DC regardless of race to be able to get to know people of diverse backgrounds and not be stuck with the same folks all the time.

 I just don't think that's good at all.

I used to go to a school that required two buses to go from Carver Terrace to Union Station and then near Ft Totten for middle school and it truly sucked. Granted, my local school was pretty rough back in the late 90's as well so I was pretty much jacked up regardless.
