23,"Wow. There's just so much to unpack here.

The downvotes you receive are due to your intellectual dishonesty, which is what makes the debate pointless. Debate only works when **both** sides are willing to consider the potential validity of the other. Thesis and antithesis come together in synthesis, where the merits of **both** arguments have been extracted to form a coherent idea that both participants can agree to.

You make it abundantly clear that you will categorically refuse to consider any point I make that you disagree with as having any merit whatsoever. Your naked, blatant tribal politics where you are Right and therefore *correct* (don't think I didn't notice that conflation) and anyone who disagrees is wrong is so dishonest as to make any attempt to debate with you pointless.

And I will note, that you are terribly wrong about the founding principles of this country. This country was founded on the principles of the Enlightenment, upon which you *trample* even in this very chain of comments with your dogmatic inability to *reason*. Your hypocrisy of not considering that protection of the individual rights and liberty extends to the individual rights and liberty of *all* people, not merely those you believe are deserving, that the ""community good"" is antithetical to individual rights and liberties instead of an expression of preserving those rights for *all* people, only compounds it.

If you could prevent global nuclear war by killing a random stranger, would you? Probably, because the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

What's good for the community, is good for the individual as well, because they're part of that community. So your assertion is asinine.

68,"> Flat taxes are still progressive taxes.

They are not. They can be made *somewhat* progressive by way of exemptions, but can also be made regressive. It also depends strongly on *what* the flat tax is applied to. But *by definition*, they are neither progressive nor regressive.

As to the rest of what you said... I will repeat myself: you are spouting *dogma*, not caring about real economics. You also completely ignore how many factors in life are *not* under a person's control, not limited to: how they are raised, the quality of their education, whether they are able to access higher education, whether they have disabilities, even if they just randomly get hit by an idiot in a hummer blowing through a stoplight. But you want to ignore all of that and just say that poor people are bad, they didn't make good decisions, they didn't work hard, they didn't choose wisely, they don't **deserve** to not have a greater *proportion* of their income go to taxation than others.

Besides, *real economics* shows that a progressive income tax greatly *enhances* economic mobility (which you later seem to be in favor of), by *not* placing the greater burden on the lesser able to support it.",t2_6gjdv,PyroDesu,0,1648188825.0,0,t1_i218kti,i218kti,False,Frank_Castle1980,t3_tn0nls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tn0nls/tennessee_gov_bill_lee_proposes_30day_grocery_tax/,Tennessee Gov.

In fact you can just read the words of the Nixon administration to understand why drug laws are all about race:

> The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I‚Äôm saying? We knew we couldn‚Äôt make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did

Cocaine and crack are the same drugs with different methods of use, but up until recently, it took 500 grams of cocaine to get the same mandatory minimum sentence as 5 grams of crack; today the disparity is 20 to 1 instead of 100 to 1. No guesses on which race tended to use which.

Reagan even tried to make crack a higher scheduled drug than cocaine, despite them being the same drug. Also weed is still a higher scheduled drug than cocaine

Prison populations exploded during the 80s when the crack epidemic hit, but when the meth epidemic hit, there was a reduction in prison populations. Meth users are overwhelmingly white. Same story goes for opioids

As a gun owner, the fetishization of guns is so stupid to me. I get wanting a gun that can shoot 10 times or maybe even 20 times to shoot at targets once a month. But people being angry that regular people can't own full auto rifles is such an insane take to me. I don't even trust people in their cars when I'm driving near them, and you want me to trust them with no special training at all to be able to own machines designed to kill? It's like people that collect shoes they (rarely) wear. I just don't see the point.

Hi Fellow Tennesseeans,

I'm posting this link to raise awareness about Representative William Lamberth's new amendment to Bill HB-1927 that will effectively outlaw Delta-8 THC and other legal cannabinoids derived from legal hemp. Please remember, this bill is attempting to criminalize Delta-8 THC and other cannabinoids that are legal under both State and Federal Law.

This bill will:

Decrease State Revenue ‚Äì Net Impact - $4,840,900/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

Increase State Expenditures - $2,900 Incarceration

Decrease Local Revenue ‚Äì Net Impact - $1,975,400/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

This is a very poorly thought out bill that will negatively impact sales revenue in the state, will increase incarceration and expenses thereof and will decrease local tax revenue. This will hurt many local businesses and hemp farmers operating legally under state and federal law and will result in more Tennesseans getting incarcerated and becoming felons in possession of a FEDERALLY LEGAL compound.

Please my fellow Tennesseans, do what you can to raise awareness about this and help stop this bill in it's tracks. Representative Chris Hurt is pushing through Bill HB-1690 that seeks to regulate Delta-8 THC and create sales tax revenue in the state. This is a better approach and I hope that the bill to regulate vs outlaw takes precedent this year.

Both of these bills are going through the process now, so please do what you can to contact local reps, local businesses who legally sell Delta-8 THC and anybody who benefits from this legal medicine to try their best and fight back.

Much love Tennessee.

I'm reaching out as a concerned Tennesseean to ask you to vote NO on Representative William Lamberth's new amendment to Bill HB-1927 that will effectively outlaw Delta-8 THC and other legal cannabinoids derived from legal hemp. Please remember, this bill is attempting to criminalize Delta-8 THC and other cannabinoids that are legal under both State and Federal Law.

This bill will negatively impact sales revenue in the state which hurts the people you represent, will increase incarceration and expenses thereof and will decrease local tax revenue. This will hurt many local businesses and hemp farmers operating legally under state and federal law and will result in more Tennesseans getting incarcerated and becoming felons in possession of a Federally legal compound.
I ask you to please do the right thing and vote No on criminalizing a Federally legal compound that will result in reduced state tax revenue and increased incarceration and costs associated.

322,"I mean it's not nebulous, it's meaningless in the literal sense. It does not have a meaning according to these folks. It's an empty classification. 

Sure. Legally, 18 in the US. Biologically, when our species is physiologically developed and no longer growing. Now you can have other definitions like ""when you get your first job"" in the same way they can define woman differently, but neither of those are supported by universal consensus or culture so we don't legislate them as if they were. 

To see how silly it is, would we allow ""women's sports"" to be filled with only men that identify as women? No, because we recognize there is a difference. What is the basis of that difference? Sex. Anyone can say they're anything, it does not mean the world needs to contort to accommodate every conceivable request.

All I'm getting at is we're playing word games to avoid hurting someones feelings when we all know what we mean when we say women, but have to pretend it's meaningless and can mean anything. 

We already made womanhood synonymous with female. If womanhood can be usurped because someone decided we need to let them be one, then why not female too? Should people lose their job over not calling a 6'2 dude with a beard a woman? The whole push is just.. silly.

Is it related to anything feminine whatsoever? If so, then it no longer meets the definition that women can be literally anything, meaning that women are feminine and thus would reinforce sex essentialism related to a woman's behavior.

Senator Blackburn: (02:02:19)
I will say this, unfortunately, it‚Äôs neither rare nor remarkable to see the kind of performances my democratic colleagues have put on today. What they‚Äôre trying to do is to convince the American people that they should be terrified of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. If you listen closely to their full statements it betrays their true intent. If you go back through the transcript, you‚Äôre going to fund not a coherent legal counter argument, but a panicked stumped speech on behalf of their controversial platform.

Senator Blackburn: (02:02:56)
Rather than reviewing your judicial philosophies, they‚Äôre instead choosing to project their own desires and their fears onto the American people. It sounds as if they are trying to create a panic. They decided to drum up indignation over the fact that you dared to present a counter argument against the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Apparently, a difference of opinion between two brilliant jurists who often disagree is just too much for them.

434,"TLDR: failing a student is not a violation of free speech. firing a faculty member from a tenured position because their words felt bad in someone else‚Äôs ears is far closer to a violation of free speech. And educators do not discriminate with those who disagree with them 99 percent of the time. That‚Äôs not how it works.

Can I just say something? The scenario you‚Äôre putting forth is very, very unlikely.  No professor acting professionally and in good faith would punish a student for their beliefs. What they could potentially grade them lower for is not being a good scholar. 

Being a good scholar usually looks like having the ability to quote and evaluate sources. That‚Äôs just a fact. That‚Äôs how science and academia works. I mean, shouldn‚Äôt it? Shouldn‚Äôt you be able to think critically about where you‚Äôre getting your information, and what other experts, in a long documented line of experts who have dedicated their lives to the study of something, have said before them. Do they always agree? Absolutely not. But the literature is there, and that literature is based on evidence that has been collected and documented. 

Okay. So, what does discrimination look like? How do you prove that the bad grade was a result of discrimination? That gets tricky. 

And according to this bill it‚Äôs not just about grading. The spectrum of possible injuries is more vague than that. So then we can have a scenario where merely by mentioning the history of Jim Crow this could hurt a student‚Äôs feelings, or in other words, bringing up things we know have happened in our country could cause a student to feel down in the dumps about themselves for some reason.

And what reason that is doesn‚Äôt matter here, because the people who have the most power in this situation are free to terminate a tenured professor on the basis of what a student and their lawyers say. 

You might say accusing politicians or businesspeople of abusing their authority is the same as what you are doing‚Äîallowing professors to be accused of abusing their authority. This is where history comes in very handy, though, because politicians and businesspeople have a lot more authority than professors, and there‚Äôs ample evidence of those people abusing their political power.",t2_jx6vwpm,bronsad,0,1648054889.0,0,t1_i1tfoqx,i1tfoqx,False,BuroDude,t3_tkpw0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tkpw0a/senate_passes_critical_race_theory_bill_targeted/,Senate passes critical race theory bill targeted at Tennessee colleges,/r/Tennessee/comments/tkpw0a/senate_passes_critical_race_theory_bill_targeted/i1tfoqx/,6,r/Tennessee,0,6,0.13904673,0.038174417,0.13520038,0.11845805,0.025068793,0.092455536,0.043260247

Spending must come down, taxation must go up, and interest rates must rise if we're going to limit inflation, but doing that would cause a lot of wealthy people to lose a lot of money and kill off quite a few jobs (including lower paying jobs).",t2_jx9khlje,Skillet_Chinchilla,0,1647978579.0,0,t1_i1pbfvj,i1pbfvj,False,AngelaMotorman,t3_tj1k2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tj1k2g/spring_hill_tn_public_library_retracts_a_tweet/,"Spring Hill (TN) Public Library retracts a Tweet, but the internet never forgets",/r/Tennessee/comments/tj1k2g/spring_hill_tn_public_library_retracts_a_tweet/i1pbfvj/,-1,r/Tennessee,0,-1,0.12925388,0.06114245,0.112775445,0.09043821,0.044837944,0.35152417,0.023579728

Marsha is of the Boomer generation that has learned that it's Really Bad to be called a racist, but this generation also hasn't done any of the work to understand how historic racism has impacted their world view. I am from Marsha's hometown in Franklin - the country club she goes to was built on an old slave plantation. A statue of KKK leader NBF stood at the entrance to our county for decades. The fabric of racism is woven so tightly into our community that sometimes it's hard to see.

Marsha's comments were:

This is racist, because it fundamentally misuses critical race theory as a scare tactic. CRT analyzes how the American legal system has incorporated racial inequity in the 300 years we've been a country. It's not an agenda to be incorporated, it's a philosophical lens to view the law.

583,"I don't think that's fair. Everyone has a blend of what they care about. 

---

Let's look at Roberts in the original Obamacare case (i.e., NFIB v Sebelius) as an example even though he doesn't fit the originalist mold perfectly. 

To set the stage, Roberts cares about the original meaning of text, but he also cares about the credibility and stature of the Court and stare decisis (i.e., precedent).

In NFIB v Sebelius, the Obamacare case, the Court was basically asked if individual mandate was ok and if the mandated Medicare expansion was ok.

Roberts lead the Court in preserving the individual mandate, but he did so in a really weird way. He didn't say the feds were utilizing their powers under the commerce clause like the left claimed. Instead, he said they were simply taxing people. That's horse shit, but it let the Court save face while avoiding a further dangerous expansion of the commerce clause. He was also able to expand states' rights by invoking the 10th Amendment to shut down the Medicare expansion.

So he followed a more originalist line of thought, but he also took into consideration the Court's power.

---

Two other good ones to compare and contrast are Thomas and Scalia. Both of them claim(ed) to care about the original text, but I think Thomas was more of a purist. Scalia could veer, from time to time, but he was generally principled and consistent. If you need proof of that he was best buds with Ginsburg even though they were often on opposite sides of an opinion.

Thomas does seem like he's the most dedicated to this school of thought. Gorsuch, as a follower of Scalia, uses it too, but so far he's been more consistent with it than Scalia. Barrett might go down that road too, but I could see her moving towards Roberts. I thought Kavanaugh was going to reject orginalist interpretation and act like a Republican Sotomayor, but I'm not convinced he'll be a partisan as her.

---

If you want to read two opinions that do a good job of showing the originalist approach to law, I'd recommend Robert's dissent in Obergefell v Hodges and Scalia's opinion in DC v Heller.",t2_jx9khlje,Skillet_Chinchilla,1,1647967476.0,0,t1_i1oilep,i1oilep,False,OnionManagement,t3_tjyn4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tjyn4w/marsha_blackburn_criticizes_1965_supreme_court/,Marsha Blackburn criticizes 1965 Supreme Court ruling on birth control,/r/Tennessee/comments/tjyn4w/marsha_blackburn_criticizes_1965_supreme_court/i1oilep/,1,r/Tennessee,0,1,0.46212968,0.26020414,0.14196977,0.4361136,0.69309914,0.06261409,0.06632726

The only thing I would add is that when a suspect refuses to show ID or get out of the vehicle it will often cause the officer to see the suspect as a more of a threat.

Who does their Twitter account speak for? The people with access to it should only use it to speak as the library, as an institution. If the staff want to sound off on their own Twitter accounts or interact with the library as individuals that is fine. As far as their role as employees and volunteers with the library, there should be some apprehension when it comes to tweeting a position on something.

Twitter is dominated by people who aren't really in touch with the day-to-day life of most Americans and Facebook pushes things that make people angry because it leads to more engagement with the site.

636,"It sounds like we are in agreement about municipalities wasting taxpayer money. I'm not sure I would call this frivolous though. Yes, you have to get out of the car when an officer tells you to, but the officer is also arguing that the driver refused to identify himself when we can be pretty sure that isn't true as the driver has said he has identified himself and has what I assume is his driver license in his hands. 

Unfortunately, the law is generally based on precedent so I am not surprised that this would go to court. It doesn't seem right to demand a person leave the safety of their vehicle for speeding (the original reason the driver was pulled over), especially when it seems the officer is rapidly escalating a scary situation. If the officer kept his cool, he probably wouldn't have to taze the driver.

I'm just wary of supporting a cultural norm whereby people with access to public platforms pre-emptively self-censor their opinion because somebody else, somewhere else *might* take offense. I lived in TN long enough to overdose on that fear, and I now manage a non-profit's Twitter account that required a lot of internal education to get free of misconceptions.

Remember, my original post was clear that the library director should be assumed to have honestly believed she had an obligation to remove that tweet. And if (as now appears to be the case) they get government funding, she was right to try. Not her fault that it isn't even possible to delete anything from the internet.

Should yes, but legally there is not firm requirement that I am aware of that requires officers to inform the detainee of thier crime until the citation is issued or an arrest is made. So the detainee has no way to decern if the ID demand is lawful potentially. The officer has to have suspicion of a crime to demand the ID (different states vary here), but does not have to inform the driver what that crime is or even if there was a crime at all.

709,"As long as he believes you committed a crime (traffic violation for example), then he has the right to detain you for a reasonable amount of time to investigate and write a citation for that crime. As a part of that detainment, he has the right to ensure his own safety. And the courts have ruled that ordering a person out of a car is a reasonable and reasonably unintrusive way to ensure his own safety.

From there, it gets legally pretty grey since the officer does not have the right to detain you for an unreasonable amount of time or unreasonably burden the detainee. It should be 100% business. 


So the officer had the legal right to order this person out of the car. The order was lawful. Probably unnecessary, but lawful. Whether or not he should have escalated the situation when the driver refused is the real topic of conversation here. 

The officer should have called a supervisor and informed the driver that it was going to take X amount of time to get the supervisor there and that he could either comply with giving him the information he asked for or be detained until the supervisor had the time to come to the scene... Also, I know of no legal requirement for the officer to inform the driver of what crime they committed before demanding ID. The officer has the right to demand ID if they witnessed what they interpretted as a crime, but no requirement to inform the driver of that knowledge until the citation or arrest.

So generally speaking, if you are pulled over:
1. Shut up other than the bare minimum communication to inform the officer you are coherent. 
2. Comply
3. Shut up
4. Fight your battle in the court room.

No battles are ever won on the side of the road.

775,"Ok - sorry/not sorry for posting this over and over, but I am super tired of the narrative the lookout cut out of whole cloth.

Hi everyone! Current Mason resident here. I attended the meeting last week. Here‚Äôs the big issues - many of the solutions presented to make the town better are all items that could have been done back in 2016-2018 when the majority of the current officials were elected, such hard to do items such as:

Apply for grants 
Improve customer service at city hall
Better public works service

Note these are direct quotes from the PowerPoint.

Another note - Virginia Rivers, who is pictured there, has been an alderman since 2014 or so. A fun item about that is that the last mayor, Gwen Kilpatrick, convinced the entire board (including Rivers) that the part time job needed a 30k salary. She got it approved, then was voted out over it, Mayor Gooden had no platform other than he wasn‚Äôt her. Back to present day:

They voted to increase the property tax in November, didn‚Äôt announce it, and then announced this month that they changed their minds in February after MTAS said it was a bad idea. There has been no vote to reverse this, just a ‚Äòour bad‚Äô 

I would be a-ok if I became part of the county. There is no tangible benefit to paying city taxes here - town roads are bumpy, there‚Äôs no real services provided. I‚Äôm sure the sheriffs department would be just has happy to swing through and catch speeders coming through 2-3 days a week as the PD does currently. Fire services only cover the immediate town and just a little over, due to the shutdown a few years back.

I don‚Äôt think the current admins are corrupt. They‚Äôre just not doing anything. I don‚Äôt feel like they actually wanted to do anything other than be an elected official and be able to say they are one. Yes, they cannot change the past. But there a lot of tiny towns in TN who submit their paperwork to the state every year without major issue. 

One of the current aldermen is suing the town over the rebuilding of his gas station that burnt down. He says the town is being overly restrictive, the town says he wants the town to play ball. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs right, all I know is there‚Äôs no gas station in town because of this, and driving to Galloway sucks. 

I invite all of you to look at Gates in Lauderdale County for an example for what a city the size a Mason giving a rip can do - they have a safe building/community center from a FEMA grant. Outdoor exercise equipment from built environment grants. Etc. Mason received mile marker signs for an existing outdoor area and they were lost at city hall within a month.

It‚Äôs very easy for folks not living here to look and say oh the big bad state crushing these poor folks, but they miss the main point - there have not been elected office holders who haven‚Äôt been corrupt/incompetent/immobile in many years. Why should I pay extra every year and get nothing in return? Bozos and Gus‚Äô will exist if the town doesn‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs really all we have going. That and the crappiest dollar general on Hwy 70 from Arlington to Brownsville.

Finally, for everyone who says they‚Äôve cleaned up the  problems - the current administration has continued to illegally take money from the water fund. I‚Äôm sorry none of this fits a storyline of heroes and villains, but real life is like that. While I‚Äôm sure that my desire for potholes on town roads to be filled will pull in the downvotes, that‚Äôs the way it is.",t2_d5kp7,Toomanykidshere,0,1647797329.0,0,t1_i1fdd8p,i1fdd8p,True,bowlcut,t3_ti9c5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/ti9c5o/ford_motor_expresses_concern_about_mason/,Ford Motor expresses concern about Mason | Tennessee Lookout,/r/Tennessee/comments/ti9c5o/ford_motor_expresses_concern_about_mason/i1fdd8p/,4,r/Tennessee,0,4,0.35334846,0.12310322,0.10856975,0.42331025,0.2973064,0.14068334,0.10299025

793,"So what do you think about when cops detain and arrest people illegally, for no broken laws. There are many incidents in which the driver is stopped via racial profiling, or a minor traffic violation (like a brake light being out), and are told to step out of the vehicle for a search. This has happened to me. We are told as citizens that we have rights, and one of them is privacy- you cannot be searched without probable cause or a warrant. I've had my rights violated in this way two times. I am black. 

First time, I was pulled over near to my girlfriend's house and the cop said he pulled me over because my vehicle was suspicious. It was a new 99% white neighborhood and they said there had been reports of suspicious people and vehicles. I guess my 87 Jetta was just too much.

837,"You brought it up the ability to do it. Either way, I prefer facts to more simplistic media narrative on the issue. It's a fact that what has been going on in the Ukraine is far less simplistic then the attempted narrative of unchecked Russian aggression against the Ukraine. It is far more complicated. No, I do not think that Vladimir Putin is a good guy and no I do not believe that a full-scale invasion of Ukraine is justified. But neither was our invasion of Iraq, and it is completely disingenuous to not contrast the two. We made unfounded claims of aggression against friendly neighbors and ourselves and stated publicly that we would find chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and/or the facilities to create and utilize that weaponry and we made these claims over the span of 18 months while we built up troops and materiel to sustain an invasion and occupation. We even went so far as to brand Iraq an ""Axis of Evil."" We found none of what we claimed and in fact caused formation of a terrorist state where one had not existed before and left.destruuction in our wake. Our lead envoy in the Ukraine was caught on tape admitting to engineering a coup and handpicking his successor and has testified before our Congress that we were funding the very types of laboratories in the Ukraine that we were looking for in Iraq and testified to one of our Senators that she fears what the Russians may do with what they find there. This scenario isn't a joke, a game of gotcha or a ""who's media is better"" contest. It's real life played out over a decade of international meddling that has real life consequences that is life or death for the people involved on both sides and the potential to drag the world into war.
Though you may not think so and just assume that we are all some conservonazissuprmacistschill or ignorant fool just because we don't agree with the narrative, I assure you that is not necessarily true. As recently as 1996 (yes, I am old) I ALSO truly believed whole heartedly that the WTO was a wonderous institution that truly had the ability to make the world a safer and better place l, so much so that I espoused it's virtues every chance I got to everyone I could, making sure everyone knew that it was imperative that China be granted entry even after the years of protests against it. We'll, they eventually got that membership, as did many other nations, and the only benefactors of all the promised opportunities that would be afforded to us, them and every other nation that wound up getting sucked into the maw of this world-striding Colossus that is the World Trade System (which is what ALL of these various wars have been about) are the tiniest handful of top-tier international corporations and self-appointed potentates in the nations that are it, at the expense of the vast majority of the citizenry who get by it's machinations. This is exactly the point of this system in the first place, not to do any sort of ""democracy spreading"" or ""people empowering"" or any such nonsense or platitude they spout. It exists solely to put people under it's boot heel, economically for now, but with force and violence.if necessary. This is WHY the coup in the Ukraine was engineered when they decided to take the more generous financial loans from Russia as opposed to the EU managed WTO loans and it is why every nation that does not currently have a central bank is on the International State Terrorism Sponsor watchlist. I know, I know. You probably could care less or are going to figure just TLDR; fine, but on the off chance you don't... look up the project for a New American Century and the Carlyle Group sometime. Then the next time any mainstream media (which is all media, by the way) starts getting everyone everywhere to hashtag ""the new thing"" on unison, ask yourself if you're really getting the whole picture. After all, after the TARP bail-outs are issued, at the end of day, you're usually the one who's paid for it.

>UKRAINE
Donetsk POW March: When Is A Parade A War Crime?
August 25, 2014 07:35 GMT
By Carl Schreck
Ukrainian prisoners are paraded by pro-Russian separatists on Ukrainian Independence Day in the eastern city of Donetsk on August 24.
Ukrainian prisoners are paraded by pro-Russian separatists on Ukrainian Independence Day in the eastern city of Donetsk on August 24.
When pro-Russian separatists marched captured Ukrainian soldiers at bayonet-point through the streets of Donetsk over the weekend, the crowd jeered, cursed, and hurled refuse at the haggard prisoners.

>It was a spectacle that shocked many, including human rights activists who called the procession a clear violation of the Geneva Conventions' rules on the treatment of prisoners of war (POWs). But whether the forced march constituted a war crime -- and whether it could be prosecuted as such -- is not so clear-cut, international law experts say.

>This ambiguity lies largely in how the Ukraine conflict itself is classified, according to David Glazier, an international law expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

>The rules for civil wars spelled out in the conventions ban ""outrages upon personal dignity"" and ""humiliating and degrading treatment"" of POWs. The rules for wars between governments set a lower bar by including a ban on subjecting these prisoners to ""insults and public curiosity,"" both of which were on prominent display at the August 24 parade in Donetsk.

>""If this is an international armed conflict, this definitely seems to be a clear...violation of the Geneva Convention language,"" Glazier says of the POW march. ""The problem is if it's not an international armed conflict, then the standard is a much harder one to satisfy: the actual 'outrage upon personal dignity.' And it's not clear that this rises to that level.""

>The International Committee of the Red Cross, the guardian of the Geneva Conventions, has called the war in Ukraine a ""noninternational armed conflict."" Kyiv and Western governments, meanwhile, have accused Russia of providing arms and other support to the rebels in eastern Ukraine -- accusations Moscow denies.

>Even if the conflict were to be classified as a war between Ukraine and Russia -- bringing the ""public curiosity"" language into play -- ""all war crimes are not created equal,"" says law of war expert Michael Scharf, the interim dean at Case Western Reserve University School of Law.

>The ""public curiosity"" provision is not among the ""grave breaches"" of the Geneva Conventions, which include crimes such as ""willful killing"" and ""torture and inhumane treatment,"" he noted. ""So while this is certainly something that would be of concern, I don't think this is the kind of thing that you could bring Russia, for example, to the International Criminal Court and have a whole case based on,"" Scharf says of the POW parade.
