136,"I mean, this question like most in the real world, has an answer of ""it depends"". It is going to depend on how much product you have to manage, and what the product is. Depends on exactly what the company thinks that that role is. Depends a lot on just how replaceable that position is, because that is supply and demand.

The Deere factory on the north side of Dubuque is an engineering center for their construction and forestry division. The person who manages that entire suite of products is better compensated than the person who manages getting the right tires for the dump trucks. Both are doing some level of 'product management', tho.

So, yeah, it's not a great answer, but it depends.

277,"I normally find Art Cullen insightful, but this article just comes off ragey and whiney and also ignores a lot of unfortunate realities. Could Democrats do more to curry favor in Midwestern States and rural areas in general? Probably, although I think it is more limited than Art realizes. The country has changed an awful lot since Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008. There is a real culture war now, and the simple reality is that on many cultural issues that used to not be so prominent in politics, Democrats are seen as alien in these parts of the country by many voters. This makes it so those voters don't really want to listen to Democratic policy ideas on other issues, because being on the other side of the culture war makes you ""not part of our team"", and people not on your team aren't worth listening to, is the rationale.

There was a long, long history of blue collar workers and farmers in the Midwest being bedrock Democrat voters, but as America's culture war has heated up and many of these people now vote over **cultural** not economic issues, there is no easy way for Democrats to appeal to them without violating both other important constituents and core values of the party. I can't tell you how many articles I read during Trump's Presidency about farmers who were losing their farms directly because of the trade war Trump was waging against China (which resulted in retalitatory tariffs that wiped out lots of small farmers.) To a man every one of them said they were voting for Trump again in 2020, specifically because they have things they care about more than their pocket books.

Got to watch it hunt and catch something, I think a rat, so got some cool action shots even though not super great quality due to distance and lowlight. 

Managed to get a few closer photos when it was returning to its den. Have a better idea where it is now so I'll hopefully get some more photos soon and hopefully I'll finally see them in good lighting and when I have a tripod.

373,I agree with you that the rich need to be taxed more. We need to go back to the old tax system of the early 1900's for taxes on the rich. They paid alot more taxes back then. I don't think that someone doesn't deserve to survive working full time. Sometimes people need to get a second job to survive or federal assistance becauseof bad things happening. What sucks for lots of federal assistance is sometimes people have to travel far to get to that assistance. The county I use to live in didn't have anything to help federally or state wise. They have to travel to the next county over which is an hour drive one way. When you are poor how are they supposed to get there? They don't have extra money to be running all over the country.

430,"It seems to me that a “worker shortage” is the excuse used to strip workers of unemployment benefits rather than a legitimate means to bring workers into the job force. 

If unemployment benefits are what’s keeping people from working, theoretically, workers would return to the job force once their six months of unemployment expired. If we were five months into a “worker shortage”, we could just wait another month and the workers would be flooding back into work. As it is, there’s been talk about a shortage of workers for the past 18 months. 

The GOP is just using the current lack of workers as an excuse to roll back worker protections. And when the economy slows down and there’s no longer a need for as many workers, they’ll keep the workers that don’t cost as much (the teenagers that don’t have as many regulations now) and let the more expensive workers go sit at home on unemployment for four months (instead of six).",t2_am56m,Motherofalleffers,0,1648173558.0,0,t1_i20h6eb,i20h6eb,False,Levi_Mitchell,t3_tmwm36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tmwm36/dems_warn_gop_unemployment_changes_will_drive/,Dems Warn GOP Unemployment Changes Will Drive Away Workers From Iowa,/r/Iowa/comments/tmwm36/dems_warn_gop_unemployment_changes_will_drive/i20h6eb/,15,r/Iowa,0,15,0.069113426,0.021806477,0.053795226,0.06324462,0.013136821,0.04115295,0.035538424

They maybe tell them you were arrested but they have no details on the case.  There is no digital record of the details of the specific case.  They can tell them, yes they were arrested for a simple theft.  But not even the clerk of court can see what the results of the case were, what was stolen.

I can send you a picture of the request the judge gave me.  Its called "" request to unexpunge and expunge file""

>They constantly lied. 

Mediacom has never actually lied to me in 7.5 years of service. 

>They still owe me hundreds of dollars almost 8 years later. 

Mediacom has only mis-billed me once, at the very beginning when they slipped a modem rental fee in there (I have my own equipment). They removed it, and never had me pay it and claim they would either A.)Take the balance off my next bill, B.) Send me a check, or C.) ACH transfer it to me. Centurylink claimed they did all 3 and STILL kept sending me incorrect bills that each month had random new packages added on.

>Their entire business model is built on lying and exploiting the customer hoping they don't realize.

Idk, malicious scumbag billing department aside, Centurylink's actual internet service was abysmal. I got their best internet package for $59.99/mo. It was 7Mbps download and 0.15Mbps upload. As stated before my internet went down at least once per hour until they finally replaced my modem/router combo which took over 3 phone calls because they kept claiming it was ""fixed"". Their new modem/router combo was ""better"" but still crashed at least once a day. **Working from home, gaming, and streaming is literally impossible with Centurylink.**

When I switched to Mediacom I was initially paying $49.99/month and then it went up to match Centurylink price at $59.99/mo the next year. I paid for 200 Mbps download and actually got like 212. I also finally had an upload speed that was measurable (30Mbps) instead of 0.15Mbps which is useless.",t2_f6txy9p3,glizzy_Gustopher,0,1648160400.0,0,t1_i1zndb0,i1zndb0,False,WombyDragon,t3_tlfsfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tlfsfs/fuck_mediacom/,Fuck mediacom,/r/Iowa/comments/tlfsfs/fuck_mediacom/i1zndb0/,2,r/Iowa,0,2,0.44592518,0.195255,0.088280894,0.53000575,0.34892395,0.08665482,0.07410012

I see no issue with cutting back how much UI is paid or making it stricter. Keep in mind, it’s the business owners that pay this wage.

Another note: that legal aid document says that more than 8 years must have passed for the courts to expunge a misdemeanor. I wrote the court about 5 years after mine and they expunged them.

719.1 Interference with official acts.
1. A person who knowingly resists or obstructs anyone known by the person to be a peace officer, emergency medical care provider under chapter 147A, or fire fighter, whether paid or volunteer, in the performance of any act which is within the scope of the lawful duty or authority of that officer, emergency medical care provider under chapter 147A, or fire fighter, whether paid or volunteer, or who knowingly resists or obstructs the service or execution by any authorized person of any civil or criminal process or order of any court, commits a simple misdemeanor. In addition to any other penalties, the punishment imposed for a violation of this subsection shall include assessment of a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars. However, if a person commits an interference with official acts, as defined in this subsection, and in so doing inflicts bodily injury other than serious injury, that person commits an aggravated misdemeanor.

791,"I can verify that it is still very much like this. I'm a low-tier corporate employee. I'm in and out of stores all over the Midwest on a daily basis, and I can safely say I'm one of the only corporate folks who ever speaks to a store employee. I have a lot of long discussions with department heads and rank-and-file employees. 

The general sentiment is that they're, at best, forgotten or overlooked. At worst, they feel like they are actively resented by the company they work for. Like, the stores would be so profitable if it wasn't for all these goddamned employees demanding paychecks and hours that make sense. 

And many massive fixes would be so easy to implement. There are tons of tiny tweaks that would vastly improve the working conditions for miminal or no cost, just changes in policies.

But the corporate culture doesn't like getting feedback, or cutting useless policies, or streamlining/improving existing processes for the employee's benefit. It's all new, new, new. 

Who cares that everybody's wasting hundreds of hours a year on pointless tasks and busy work? Who cares that an idea didn't pan out? We only look forward at Hy-Vee Corporate, towards the future and Marky Mark's guiding light. We never never look back, to the miles of burning wreckage behind us.

837,"The Driftless Half Marathon in northeast Iowa is the most beautiful race I've ever run!  You're along the Mississippi the whole way, and you run through some pretty woods and pastures, and along some riverside trails.  It's quite serene, especially with markedly less of the ""clamor"" that you usually get with races in the city.  There's only one (rather large) hill right at the halfway point, but you're surrounded by the famous hills of Iowa's Driftless region the whole way.  Plus the last few miles you feast your eyes on Lansing's beautiful river bridge in the distance, which is where the race finishes.


It's not really a landmark or 'famous' race by any means, and enrollment is typically pretty small.  But it's nice to see the grassroots effort of the community come together to put on this race.  I had such a great time!  And FYI northeastern Iowa is pretty different from the rest of the state.  You could easily spend the weekend of the race touring through the hills and creek valleys, not to mention the hiking and several local state parks.

The state party wants enthusiastic voters and participants, which is a great aspiration, but they're *never* going to get enthusiastic small-d democratic participation out of more than a few handfuls of people per precinct - and these are the people who show up for off-year caucuses anyway. They want to be activists.

99% of the folks who go to caucus just want to vote and get out. I've got no problem with that - most of us want lives not centered around political activism.

I am going to assume this is from a bottom line perspective. A lot of companies don't value long term employees. Experienced employees get paid more, have accrued more benefits, and often (if age is a factor) use more benefits like medical.

New, inexperienced, and young employees cost less in all 3 areas and are often seen as easier to manipulate into doing multiple people's jobs (and working crazy hours that the more experienced will not) just to show commitment or to impress management.",t2_12t3xj,MakeUSASmartAgain,0,1648050998.0,0,t1_i1t567j,i1t567j,False,Silver_Ad_8948,t3_tkike9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tkike9/whats_going_on_at_hyvee_corporate/,What's going on at Hy-Vee Corporate?,/r/Iowa/comments/tkike9/whats_going_on_at_hyvee_corporate/i1t567j/,5,r/Iowa,0,5,0.070641406,0.014932043,0.025973449,0.055518333,0.0179983,0.031821255,0.0395407

941,"I don't know shit about what's going on at the top, but as a customer, fuck them.

I transferred out of their pharmacy last week. I went to get my meds last week and they told me several wouldn't be done for 2 days. Typical. 

My mom went over 2 days later to grab the rest. The pharmacy tech fucking shrieked at her saying, ""I told your daughter they wouldn't be done until tomorrow!! I don't know why she's always sending random people over to get her prescriptions for her!"" The fuck? 1. That's not what she told me. 2. Just say they won't be ready until tomorrow. No need to be a hag. 3. The tech fucking knows its an hour drive for me to get my meds and she knows my mom was picking up the medication I'm required to take in order to drive -- the medication they refuse to fill until the day after it runs out 80% of the time. Sorry I'm fucking disabled, lady. If I knew it bothered her so much to have others pick up an RX, I'd have trotted the 50 goddamn miles there and back. 

They have the most incompetent grocery pick up, too. They either text you 800 times at 6 in the morning or they substitute completely whack products without telling you. Twice, I got home to find they didn't give me basic essentials like cat food or shredded cheese. Had they told me, I could have picked it up elsewhere while I was in town, but nope. Had to make a whole separate trip. The next time I tried using it, they substituted everything. Like nacho lunchables instead of  pepperoni pizza lunchables. My kid is lactose intolerant. She can't eat nachos! They subbed my cheese pizzas out for sausage pizzas. I don't eat meat. If you're going to sub a pizza, wouldn't you go for a cheese pizza of a different brand instead of using the same brand with a different topping?
