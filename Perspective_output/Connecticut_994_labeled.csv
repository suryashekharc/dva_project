Just this past week alone 3 people have almost made me maim them by having their face in their phone and just walking out onto the road/street. Imagine if I was texting and driving. They're in the hospital. Imagine if it was a panicky driver - not texting. They're in the hospital and the driver catches a case bc of the peds stupid ass. 

It's these fucking phones and shit. Look up for literally 2 seconds see if there are cars coming either side. 2 seconds should be plenty to look and process the information. Go or Stop. 

Drivers suck too. Don't fucking text while driving in a stop and shop parking lot, don't speed in a stop and shop parking lot or any parking lot actually, don't fucking text and drive while speeding in a parking lot, don't text drive speed in a God damn school zone, e t c. 

Sometimes it's emergency situations whatever life isn't perfect but I know for a fact 99.999% of these fricks aren't in a life or death situation needing to text and drive at a damn whole foods.

Station B goes against market, they will have a run on gas, potentially run dangerously short - and damage $800,000-$1,600,000 worth of pumping equipment. (4-8 pumps respectively. 2 pumps = $250,000)

Any commodity trader who sells low when the market is high is a bad commodity trader. Never leave profit on the table.

What happens when the prices fluctuate and profits are down? You sell at market, lose money. Not taking profit = short on inventory shipment = out of gas = now you know how gas stations go out-of-business.

[Ebay also shows a bunch of options.](https://www.ebay.com/b/Catalytic-Converters-for-2009-for-Jeep-Grand-Cherokee/33629/bn_87761654)  Certainly going to find some cheaper stuff, but if it will get you through emissions, may be worth it. (i should add that against every VW fanboy on the r/GTI sub, i bought a chinese downpipe for 300 (any normal one was 1200$, it worked and sounded great, well put together...just saying not all the cheap ebay stuff is junk like some people say)

It would be a matter of verifying which part you need.  Usually the code reader can tell you if it is one or two of the cats failing.  (as far as i know there is a front/rear cat, and this one has two down pipes, so actually 2 in the front.  But it appears they can be bought separately if you knew just one was bad.

As far as an install, a local shop will likely do it much cheaper.  I can recommend one place that is grea, but it is in NY, right at the CT boarder near Canaan in Millerton.  [North East Muffler](https://www.facebook.com/northeastmuffler/)  Really good people.  They put an aftermarket cat in for me.  Did it quick while i waited.

317,"Yeah, I know that there is an opportunity cost to every decision made, I know that nothing is free. It’s not a buzzword, it’s just easier than saying “free at the point of use”. A buzzword is fashionable jargon. I pay taxes that make it possible for you to drive on a road without you paying a toll. Maybe I don’t want to pay for your access to a road, and if I didn’t it would cost you more every time you needed to drive somewhere, but I know better.

The thing is public funding goes to things with spillover benefits. As someone pointed out in this comment thread this generates economic activity, there are positive externalities to funding public transportation. That free bus ride gets someone to work, and it gets someone to a store to spend money. And when money gets put into the economy there is something called a multiplier effect. The money spent is someone else’s income, that then becomes money spent and becomes someone else’s income.

Initially you said making public transport free won’t make it any better. You’ve provided zero evidence to back that up. You even acknowledged that it’s already mostly funded by taxes. I’d say it will make it better because it increases access, and that will generate economic activity, and give people a better opportunity to spend money and obtain gainful employment so they will be less likely to need financial assistance that we also collectively pay for.

332,"I had a 99 Acura several years ago. It constantly had check engine issues due to emissions problems with the cat, meaning no inspection pass. Here’s what I did, I don’t advise it in any capacity.

Buy an OBD II reader at auto zone,
clear the check engine light,
drive a short distance, until the computer has come back online but the check engine light hasn’t been thrown.
You can test this by parking somewhere and seeing if the reader is registering other systems online.

Then time out how long it takes after clearing codes for the computer to come online before the code is shown, so the shop doesn’t know you cleared the code. Then pick a shop within said distance.

Somehow passed with this method 4 years in a row. This was in NY mind you. One or two times it failed and I was out 20 bucks having to try it again. Maybe I was lucky. Anyway, that’s in the past.

So, we cant apply this 31% factor, or any other pro-public transport argument to rural areas as the need is simply not there. Nor is there a desire among certain parts of the population (e.g. farmers and agriculture workers) for public transport like subways, rail, and buses the same way that the more cosmopalitain city dwellers might have.

If we built a busway in eastern CT the same way we did between New Britain and Hartford, it is unlikely demand, ridership, and convenience would make it worthwhile.  Last I saw, the CT Fastrak barely made 10% of its operating costd up with revenue.

And professors who also don't want to be there because they are paid almost nothing. Or who just aren't very good because their only credentials are a master's from a diploma mill themselves. Plus you miss out on having a more consistent group of peers to build relationships and network with. Your peer group matters way more than people give credit too.

410,"Hearst CT is announcing a big move into Hartford County.  
  
The company, which owns papers from Torrington to Danbury, through Fairfield County, New Haven and up to Middletown(an area described by some as Connecticut’s “fertile crescent”) is pushing into territory historically dominated by the Hartford Courant.  
  
Hearst has announced plans to add 11 reporters, including a newsletter writer, an editor and two sales representatives. This very large addition of reporters, some focused on Hartford and other statewide stories, has the potential to dramatically tip the balance toward Hearst when it comes to determining the most influential news source in the state.  
  
The news market in Connecticut has traditionally been divided geographically, with Hartford never dipping serious toes into New Haven or Fairfield County, and the southern half of the state never venturing north of Wallingford, except in the case of very big stories that cannot be ignored(think Sandy Hook, L’Ambiance Plaza, Mianus River Bridge, statewide elections, etc.).(Please start Tweeting your protestations over this generalization NOW).  
  
The hiring of ten reporters, by a largely southwestern Connecticut based news organization to focus on Hartford and other statewide stories, represents a clear and direct effort to change the paradigm and capture as much of the Connecticut news audience as possible. The only part of the state left specifically untouched by this move would be eastern Connecticut, which is the least populous.  
  
There has been a long-time rivalry in Hartford County between the Courant and the scrappy, tabloid sized, Journal-Inquirer based in Manchester. Both those papers have been facing severe challenges in recent years, including shrinking and demoralized staff. The decision by Hearst to aggressively move into Hartford represents a challenge, backed by a personnel investment that nearly fields a team as big as those remaining at the Courant and the JI. The move will obviously fuel speculation about whether Hearst can ever close a deal to buy either, or both of those papers.  
  
There has never been a strategic move as big as this in the Connecticut news market since Al Terzi, on set in Hartford, tossed an orange to Pat Sheehan, on set in New Haven, to demonstrate that WTNH had just opened a Hartford bureau. Those were heady days.",t2_1n6ja,mas90guru,0,1648239442.0,0,t1_i23yhyr,i23yhyr,True,mas90guru,t3_tny2nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/tny2nk/hearst_expanding_into_hartford/,Hearst Expanding Into Hartford,/r/Connecticut/comments/tny2nk/hearst_expanding_into_hartford/i23yhyr/,5,r/Connecticut,0,5,0.06000746,0.0143319415,0.031992033,0.03817614,0.0124665685,0.024888916,0.014177674

I know its hard to care about people when you feel like youre not being cared about, or that you feel youre being asked to pick up the bill; but theres a lot of people who struggle and in reality the taxes shared amongst us all is a symbol of compassion  give a sense of community.  

[For Sarason, psychological sense of community is ""the perception of similarity to others, an acknowledged interdependence with others, a willingness to maintain this interdependence by giving to or doing for others what one expects from them, and the feeling that one is part of a larger dependable and stable structure"" (1974, p. 157).](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_community)


In large, modern day communities its easy to feel like taxes just go to the void and never benefit oneself, but for the most part they do benefit all of us in one way or another.  They would benefit all of us much more if we were socialist, but all US can manage is socialiste lite so we end up with some people reaping more rewards than others.

530,"What you are insinuating is needed are price controls. These were tried in the US and Europe in the 70s and failed miserably. They were maintained in other places in the world as well, and also failed miserably. Price controls distort the market, lead to malinvestment, and can permanently alter natural demand signals. It will inevitably lead to permanently higher prices as economic incentive is destroyed. 

It's unfortunate that dramatically reduced capacity from underinvestment for the last 10 years, topped with supply chain constraints, and a war/sanctions on one of the top 3 oil producers in the world is contributing to current elevated prices. To be fair the price is still substantially lower than the prior high in 2008, which was about $200/bbl, inflation adjusted.  

The only ways out of higher oil prices that does not irreparably damage the entire energy and economic system \[across the world\] is to permit and pump more oil/gas domestically and build more pipelines, and remove sanctions on Venezuela and Iran. Doing either/both of these would have an instant impact of bringing down oil futures due to anticipated added capacity, and would aid in bringing down prices in the long-term as more capacity hits the market over the next 12-24 months.",t2_bza7f,EasyE0287,0,1648229619.0,0,t1_i239zti,i239zti,True,Bulky-Mark315,t3_tnguik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/tnguik/gas_prices_are_so_high_because_corporations_have/,Gas prices are so high because corporations have made them so high,/r/Connecticut/comments/tnguik/gas_prices_are_so_high_because_corporations_have/i239zti/,3,r/Connecticut,0,3,0.11582158,0.027496614,0.051048797,0.12907739,0.014041345,0.0760339,0.009868947

576,"I'm not dense. Just disillusioned with the shitty system we have to deal with.

I understand that the retail tax holiday doesn't affect prices until it is instituted. As I said multiple times, I thought the tax holiday was for the wholesale price.

I was calling shenanigans on your saying that a wholesale tax holiday would necessarily have zero effect now. 

If ,theoretically, CT proposed *raising* the wholesale tax in a week, would you really not expect gas stations to raise prices now in anticipation of the added cost? Why do they always raise prices based on speculation, but never decrease prices based on speculation?

I fully understand that gas stations raise prices over speculation because they can and decrease them slowly when wholesale prices go down because they can. Even though I get *why* they can and do price the way they do, I'll still bitch about it because it's bullshit.

It's shitty that they can get away with this because competition is so limited and we have few other options. If it's not gas stations being in cahoots with the local competition, it's the shitty gas zone structure they're allowed to operate under.

643,"There is a good argument for free fares, and there have been a decent number of places that have implemented this policy.

One of the problems with flat fares is that they really discourage people from using public transit for short trips. I should take the bus to work every day, but my commute is only 2 miles. This means that it is actually cheaper and more convenient for me to drive (since I already own car) than take the bus and pay $1.75.

Getting people who have short commutes off the road is really important. We tend to drive mostly in cities and take busy roads. We are a big reason why the chokepoints get so bad in densely populated area. And most importantly, it is already relatively easy for us to take public transit.

Some cities will charge different fees based on how far you travel on a bus or subway. But the problem with this is that this makes travel on a bus even less convenient. This requires scanning a card to get on and off the bus, making it so that buses are even slower as they have to wait for passengers to complete that transaction.

689,"Ok. Here is an extremely simplified explanation of why prices shoot up when oil shoots up but comes down slowly when oil drops:

Station A: buys gas for week

Station B: buys gas for a month

Prices spike.

Station A has to pay more for gas after a week, so they have to raise their prices after a week. As soon as A raises prices, B can raise their price to just under the price of A. B makes more money / gallon and are the best price in town. Thus the price shoots up quick.

Same example but instead of a spike, oil drops.

Station A can start lowering its price as soon as their week of more expensive supply is out. They will only drop their price to just below station B to make sure they are the best price in town. Station B can’t compete until the full month is up. Only then can they lower their price. When they lower their price they'll go just below A. Then A will go below B etc etc etc. Thus the price goes down slower over time.

Are oil companies greedy? Absolutely. They spend money to 'disprove' climate change, they fight regulation tooth and nail despite the destruction they have caused. They actively work to kill alternate energy options. They pay politicians to vote against minimum MPH/Gallon legislation and tons of other laws they see as potentially harmful to them. But Prices at the pump not coming down as fast as they go up? This is not an example of oil company greed. This is normal everyday market forces.

697,">You have a downtown city (New Haven) with decent public transport (that could benefit from more funding, and bus system has good ridership). Next door you have a wealthier town (where everyone owns cars) that doesn't have a business district, maybe it has a bank and a cafe in their ""downtown"". So if you did want to do some analysis, does it make sense funding a bus system to service the 3-4 jobs in the suburban downtown or do you want to improve the already existant bus system that has high ridership daily? The answer in my mind is you make sure the already existant bus service in New Haven remains funded. Doing the opposite would most likely beneift only a few wealthier subruban citizens while way more urban riders miss out on that funding. Are we going to improve a bus system in the wealthy town next to New Haven because of America's rascist history while the majority of bus riders in New Haven miss out on funding? This logic makes 0 sense to me.  
>  
>Particularly in Connecticut, the tax environment is already shit. If i owned a house in the suburbs, i would also vote against funding a new bus line when ridership is so low.

Again, bus ridership is low because the system is underfunded, not the other way around.

I don't mean to come on so strong, but I hear this shit at every zoning meeting I go to and it drives me nuts. The argument is basically, ""we made bad decisions on infrastructure and tax policy 70 years ago and there's nothing we can do to fix it,"" at meetings where proposals to fix it are being brought up for consideration!

I also think you're also underestimating the economic potential of suburban downtowns. Road diets, transit-centered development, higher density housing, reduced parking requirements; all are associated with more vibrant, economically dynamic areas, which are going to employ a hell of lot more than ""3-4"" people.

There's no reason that small downtowns have to be hollowed out because that money could be spent elsewhere. a) this is an investment that pays for itself through taxes gained from increased economic activity, not a pure expenditure b) living in a town with a vibrant downtown is a hell of a lot nicer than living in a town with a wasteland in the middle of it c) CT's GDP would put it in the top quantile for COUNTRIES in the world; we can afford infrastructure spending in both urban and suburban settings.

758,"I never said it was accidental that suburbs are car-centric, my understanding from reading that book ""Strong Towns"", and other ubran-planning docs/articles, is that suburbs in USA were designed specifically with cars in mind. I agree with your claim that building suburban communities this way, removed a lot of funding out of cities into suburbs in a very inefficient manner.

My issue is not with ""keeping bad people away"", which i assume you are alluding to the racist narrative that a lot of people believe why suburbs have no public transport infra. This narrative was preached in that book ""the power broker"" and pete buttigeg this year, even though many critics/historians have debunked that book and the narrative to be largely innaccurate/unhelpful for policy making now. 

My understanding is the following: 

You have a downtown city (New Haven) with decent public transport (that could benefit from more funding, and bus system has good ridership). Next door you have a wealthier town (where everyone owns cars) that doesn't have a business district, maybe it has a bank and a cafe in their ""downtown"". So if you did want to do some analysis, does it make sense funding a bus system to service the 3-4 jobs in the suburban downtown or do you want to improve the already existant bus system that has high ridership daily? The answer in my mind is you make sure the already existant bus service in New Haven remains funded. Doing the opposite would most likely beneift only a few wealthier subruban citizens while way more urban riders miss out on that funding. Are we going to improve a bus system in the wealthy town next to New Haven because of America's rascist history while the majority of bus riders in New Haven miss out on funding? This logic makes 0 sense to me. 

Particularly in Connecticut, the tax environment is already shit. If i owned a house in the suburbs, i would also vote against funding a new bus line when ridership is so low. 

I would consider buying/living in one of CT's cities. I think CT's cities could beneifit from better policy/management going forward of course though.

It's possible that they believe you don't qualify for some reason.  It's also possible that whoever made that decision is wrong.  :-)

So, you basically have to do a cost/benefit analysis.

Figure out what's going to cost you more in the long run.  

You can take the hit and avoid an audit.  However, this may hinder your ability to file as Head of Household in the future.

Or, if you're sure you really do qualify for the Head of Household deduction, hire a CPA, take on the audit and definitively prove them wrong, which should save you from having to deal with this again in the future.

I'll never really understand why our politicians decided to ban standard capacity mags and cosmetic related features when it's been shown time and time again such bans do not have any impact on violence. I'd much rather they dedicate time and resources addressing the roots of these issues rather than focusing only on the tool used. It's like blaming the truck the drunk driver was operating instead of the driver themselves, and going after Ford in the aftermath. 

At the end of the day, bans like these in the name of ""safety"" come off as disingenuous when these laws are written with specific exemptions for law enforcement. If these feature bans actually had an impact on mitigating crime and violence, doesn't it stand to reason that the people enforcing the law should also have to work with similarly neutered tools in order to help achieve this goal?

World markets have nothing to do with it.

If we set the price of gas at say $4.25, then that's what the gas price will be in CT. Period.

What would ""world markets"" have to do with it? The market is no longer dictating the maximum price, the government is.

Governments have used price caps in rough economic times many many times before, it's not a new or ""radical"" concept.

We even had a federal agency at one point solely dedicated to regulating food prices called the Food Administration.

Prices caps have been used on a variety of products before, including gas. Several countries like Belgium are currently imposing these price caps to keep their economies moving.

There are plenty of people who have service jobs like servers and Uber drivers who enjoy their work and they shouldn't have to ""do a good job and get promoted"" to a management job be deserve of the bare minimum of human rights.

Think the carrot is a much better method than the stick, make it faster people will use it.

So it still boils down to build more highways to meet demand, limit demand, and/or shift demand to a faster alternative. For Fairfield CT think were realy at the end of practical options for 1 and 2 so the best route forward is to shift demand to the north end of the county aka the 84 corridor.  If we do that smartly it's combined high speed rail and highway to shift demand up before heading to NYC, that relieves the pressure on the 95 corridor so it can be updated similarly.

Now their are wild cards in this.  If the shift to work at home sticks how many are still commuting to NYC?

Zelensky is an INDEPENDENT.

Front Street has great barbecue (Bear's), ElPollo Guapo, Capital Grille, Infinity Music Hall, and a movie theater. There's the Convention Center which has interesting things weekly, and the CT Science Center. Plus concerts at the XL Center and at the outdoor venue in the North Meadows.

Grocery stores are a bit more problematic unless you have a car. But if you do, 10 or so minutes away in West Hartford, Wethersfield, Windsor, Glastonbury. Ditto if you want to stroll West Hartford Center/Blue Back Square, Old Wethersfield, Windsor Center.
