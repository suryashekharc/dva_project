6,">So glad I have a choice in her schooling. I want my kid in a Christian school and thankfully we have had just that. As an educator who has taught from title 1 to public to charter to private schools I hope to NEVER not have a choice in her schooling.

As someone who went to private Catholic schools practically from birth until age 18, the education was highly damaging to me and many other students. One of my classmates sadly ended up homeless and committed suicide, while another attempted suicide shortly after graduation. My Catholic high school was also later revealed to have, in no uncertain terms:

1. Fired my theology teacher - a good, upstanding Christian man with a wife and young children who relied on his income - for blowing the whistle on a predatory priest.
2. Harbored said predatory priest, who went after teenage girls at my high school; denied; deflected; and did everything in their power to shield and defend said predator.
3. Was revealed to have harbored another predatory priest who had molested young boys. This priest had daily contact and no supervision with the school's students, myself included.

This is not counting the fierce and horrific bullying I endured in Catholic elementary and middle school(s), as well as abuse and neglect from teachers, and even the school principal - a nun - that resulted in overt symptoms of PTSD and trauma by age 9. I was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), and my 3rd grade teacher tried to force medication on me.

The school principal, in turn, threatened to cane me with a bladed ruler for ""bad behavior"", and then proceeded to shame and threaten me into silence ""so as not to tattle-tale to my parents"".

This is also not even touching the iceberg of how woefully unprepared I was for the reality of sex, drugs, and dating in college, given that private Catholic schools advocate ""abstinence-only education""; hire religious zealot Pam Stenzel to slut-shame girls at school; and much more. The Catholic private education directly led me to being taken advantage by predatory men.

All of suffering I endured being raised in Catholic private schools - and all of the pain, to the point of attempting or even succeeding at suicide, for my classmates - had me vow to always advocate for parents to strongly consider public schools for their children, including my future kids as well. I want to make sure another child never again has to suffer in the private school system.",t2_k11a2,Obversa,0,1648281749.0,0,t1_i264ve1,i264ve1,False,Candy_and_Violence,t3_to957o,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/to957o/gov_ron_desantis_rfl_announces_bill_allowing/,Gov.

56,">Why Florida? there‚Äôs plenty of other states that are warm and you won‚Äôt have allergies.

Most of my friends are on the east coast and I still love New York, so staying on the east coast makes it easier for me to take more frequent and cheaper trips. Plus I work for an east-coast-based company, so work hours align which is convenient and make for a good work/life balance.

>Also Florida ranks 39th for allergies and New York is 41st so basically the same.

That's nice for statistics for a population and all, but as a single individual I have specific allergies and they're better down here. They're not basically the same. I've gone from 6-8 weeks of annual misery to about a week and half tops of mild symptoms. It's not really up for debate. 

Sorry man. If you think this convo leads to a path where you somehow convince me that I chose to move down here because I secretly like what Republicans are doing to this country, you're in for a lot of wasted energy.

249,"> I‚Äôm now convinced that Florida is operating a legal child trafficking scheme.

I understand your frustration, but the adoption process isn't a child trafficking scheme.  I would recommend that you *consider* fostering.  It gives you an inside understanding of the process and will possibly  increase your probability to adopt.  I say this, because several kids I've seen adopted, who were removed from their parents, were adopted by their foster parents.  

I'm not saying fostering is the normal path to adoption, it isn't supposed to be; but when parental rights are terminated, there's usually a ""game plan"" for the child already.  If there is a foster parent willing to adopt, or a relative willing to be a permanent guardian, the children will likely go to them.  It is a significant factor in deciding what is in the best interest of the child.  Kids usually aren't just removed from their parents and put up for adoption without a plan.  This is a common misconception.  

BTW, I said fostering isn't a normal path to adoption, and that's with good reason.  Fostering is supposed to be a support mechanism to allow the children to be cared for, while the parents get their act together; it's not a ""try-and-buy"" mechanism.  If the parents get their act together, they get their kid back; that's in the best interest of the child, even if you love the kid and think your home is a better environment.",t2_776flhud,dark-copper,0,1648243324.0,0,t1_i247vjw,i247vjw,False,ra3ra31010,t3_tn9ckg,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tn9ckg/the_problem_is_poverty_florida_removing_more_kids/,‚ÄòThe problem is poverty‚Äô: Florida removing more kids from poor families over alleged ‚Äòneglect‚Äô,/r/florida/comments/tn9ckg/the_problem_is_poverty_florida_removing_more_kids/i247vjw/,2,r/florida,0,2,0.0849363,0.028939987,0.08318358,0.0724835,0.038482573,0.050273925,0.02941558

Typically having a working AC running should be enough to prevent mold in most places but some housing may not be properly ventilated and of course you want to make sure you have an extractor going when showering and possibly after if you know your house is prone to mold.

Florida DCF is setting new records taking children from impoverished homes in its history. Taking children from families simply for the family being unable to afford food 

So rather than helping families keep their kids, they take them and put them somewhere more unsafe - but with money 

Also, Florida DCF has the most calls to check in and not removing children from homes that they should be removed from, then the kids end up dead

We know instinctually that is not survivable not only because he fell, but that he was propelled by the forces involved.

429,"We already f‚Äôd up by building 90% of our land as single family car dependent suburbs. Therefore everyone has to drive. What need to do is redevelop areas with higher density and more mixed use buildings. It doesn‚Äôt have to be high rises. It can be as little as allowing backyard apartments and corner stores or small offices on residential street. People need more options to live closer to work or at least in a place where they don‚Äôt have to get into a car. I should also mention that nothing will solve traffic completely. Traffic is a symptom of high amounts of economic activity. What it would do is give people options. You don‚Äôt want to sit in traffic? That‚Äôs fine! You should have the option for a comfortable walk, bike ride, public transit ride, etc. But those options aren‚Äôt available in most places right now, so naturally most people drive and deal with the traffic. 

If you spend a week in any of the downtown areas east of I-95 you can literally watch this happen in real time. Those areas are denser and have a much more diverse mix of uses. As a result people in those areas are able to live closer to where they work to the point that they can ride a bike, electric scooter, moped, bus, or train to get to and from. Those are all people who aren‚Äôt clogging the roads with a car. 

And it spans across socioeconomic scales as well. In my area a common scene on any given weekday is an office worker in business casual and a briefcase riding their bike a few miles to their office, an immigrant restaurant employee in their smocks riding their electric scooter to work, and a construction worker getting off of trirail and getting picked up in his bosses pickup truck. If you only live, work, and hang out only in the suburbs, you would never see this or understand how it works. You only see traffic, gridlock, and people that poor sap walking on a tiny sidewalk in the blazing sun. So, we already have great case studies in our backyard of what to do. The question is will we do anything about it?",t2_c36o2ad0,lofibeatsforstudying,0,1648220963.0,0,t1_i22np52,i22np52,True,Viparita-Karani,t3_tncyr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tncyr2/south_florida_transportation_and_gridlock/,South Florida transportation and gridlock?,/r/florida/comments/tncyr2/south_florida_transportation_and_gridlock/i22np52/,2,r/florida,0,2,0.14398076,0.07490824,0.109046325,0.1238129,0.12157059,0.14614536,0.087527946

The article compares Florida to Virginia and Mississippi where juvenile hall and group homes are used.  Florida doesn't use either nearly as much.

912,"You're asserting that I am claiming that the public should have the right to know your address, as a former police officer. They shouldn't, of course not. No reasonable person thinks they should.

However, defendants should have the right to know the identity of the person who arrested them -- in fact, the state and federal Constitution grants defendants that right in the form of the confrontation clause of the 6th Amendment (and in the confrontation clause in our state Constitution, found in Article 1, Section 16(a)), which also allows them (or their attorneys) to cross examine witnesses. Effectively doing that requires that they know the officer's name in order to collect evidence favorable to them (for example, if an officer has a history of wrongful arrests or lying on the stand, that is relevant information at trial for impeaching them on the basis of their credibility).

Being that police officers have an abiding interest in keeping their addresses out of public view due to the work they perform, and those accused of a crime have a Constitutional right to confront witnesses and effectively cross-examine them at trial, the only satisfactory solution is to make it easier for police officers to keep their addresses out of the public record, not to deny public access to the names of police officers.",t2_1hpvnq5u,I-Am-Uncreative,0,1648171663.0,0,t1_i20cy21,i20cy21,False,RingloVale,t3_tk66x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tk66x9/marsys_law_in_florida_are_police_victims_volusia/,"Marsy‚Äôs Law in Florida: Are police victims?
