1. The plate usually has ""DV"" in a vertical orientation next to the plate number, usually at the beginning of the number but might be at the end, however never in the middle of the number. The characters are also smaller than the plate number. 

2. The plate number is either a 4 or 5 character, and not the traditional 6 character or whatever the standard length for the state is. Due to the ""DV"" if on the plate taking up a space

3. ""Disabled Veteran"" might be spelled out on the plate as well. 

4. It might include a combination  of the following symbols: the handicap wheelchair symbol a special Disabled Veteran seal, or a military seal for the branch served

I always had my needleworks and crafts as well as my cats and thank goodness for cable TV at the time.

Someone who makes a career at say, Game and Fish department and works their way up towards the top may have quite the power in their department (Hypothetical example: Walleyes! More Walleyes! Walleye Walleye Walleye Everywhere!!! etc), but won't have much or any sway outside of their sphere of influence, and won't likely have the ear of anyone that actually controls the budget, so they ideally can't waste tons of money. (Ex: Too much money spent on walleye, not enough on Deer/Pronghorn herd management). And HOPEFULLY those more localized problems that do occur can be solved easier since they likely won't require changing laws and won't move at the speed of legislation.

This is in contrast to someone in the state legislature with decades of seniority that works to bend wording or carve exemptions out of all policies, and has budgetary influence to set or change the budget and not only starve some departments of needed funds, but also to potentially waste that money elsewhere.

243,"So weirdly enough I just moved to the Tampa area from North Dakota. Just a few tips as you fly from Tampa to NoDak. If flying in the winter be prepared for delays coming and going, my wife flew back to visit family in January (I know, not my first choice but its what she wanted) and ended up getting delayed in Denver (connection to Jamestown) by about a day (and ended up stuck in Valley city one day of her visit due to other travel but thats neither here nor there). So just be prepared or travel only during the warm weather...which...if you've been in Florida for a long long time might just be the best advice. North Dakota winter can be something else if you're not used to it.  What airport you do pick is going to usually limit what airlines you can fly out of a Tampa on so keep that in mind as well as the fact that the airports in NoDak don't have quite as many flight options in and out.

322,"First of all, the sheriff said she was the killer in the press conference. Second of all, they are charging a cold case after 15 years. Do you realize the level of assuredness, the level of preparation, and the preponderance of evidence that has to be present for either of these two things to happen? And did I say she shouldn’t see inside a court of law?  Did I say she should go straight to jail without a trial? No. 

You act like the sheriff and prosecutor just woke up one day, stretched, and said “I don’t know bro maybe it’s a good day to charge this murder.” There’s an incredibly laborious process that led up to this point that gives me a large amount of confidence that they have the right person.
That said, I feel pretty comfortable saying she’s the murderer. I’m not going to apologize for calling it out because some lawyer wannabe online tells me to. But being a murderer and being convicted and sentenced for murder are two different things, clearly. So yes, she is not yet convicted of murder. But she is, nonetheless, a murderer.

Here is the actual laws breaking down the oil tax

[https://www.ndlegis.gov/cencode/t57c51.pdf](https://www.ndlegis.gov/cencode/t57c51.pdf)

Take a look at the slides from the state Treasurer and you'll see that the lions share of the money was used on the Western half of the state. Most of the funds ended up in Hub cities, which in short are any city with more then 12,500 pop. in a county that produces oil. 

20% of all the funds went to the School trusts alone, most of that money and funds were used on hub cities for the Boom. 1% increase in Taxes would be nowhere near what was needed to cover the population growth from oil. Unless specials on property were used or something more draconian.  

Where you would see most of the direct money getting spent in the Valley was on Research up at UND at their Energy research Laboratory which accounts for like less then half percent of the funding.",t2_1gsw0yjb,BjornAltenburg,0,1647377381.0,0,t1_i0sqqn4,i0sqqn4,False,iseedeadllamas,t3_tegm9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/tegm9o/as_someone_originally_from_williston_i_get_it/,As someone originally from Williston… I get it,/r/northdakota/comments/tegm9o/as_someone_originally_from_williston_i_get_it/i0sqqn4/,2,r/northdakota,0,2,0.045750856,0.012597409,0.025253529,0.028422194,0.022008507,0.022205465,0.01578144

Pros:  High pay, great benefits, and living a chunk of your year in a handpicked community where you're surrounded by many of the smartest people in the world; you get to work in one of the most amazing places in the world; if you are a scientist, a field safety technician/mountaineer, or a helicopter pilot, you get to go to places that almost no one else has ever seen.

Cons: You are not free to roam off base, except for three or four designated trails;  summer workers have to pass extensive physical and psychological exams and it's harder for overwinter workers; people on the base talk about divorces and suicides among year-rounders as sad but not surprising - so those appear to be significant risks.",t2_16iafy,judoberg,0,1647351081.0,0,t1_i0qwie9,i0qwie9,False,judoberg,t3_tdhlg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/tdhlg1/the_thing_i_miss_about_north_dakota/,The thing I miss about North Dakota.,/r/northdakota/comments/tdhlg1/the_thing_i_miss_about_north_dakota/i0qwie9/,1,r/northdakota,0,1,0.057003107,0.018829193,0.034088846,0.04739151,0.0121357925,0.03770706,0.009990702

449,"Well I just looked up some of the information on ND code regarding debt collection; it appears that medical debts in ND can only persist for 6 years.  Of course, like other debt collection processes, there are ways that the collection agency can 'reset the counter'.  IE if you identify yourself to them on the phone or acknowledge that you are the person they're looking for.  They just made a valid contact regarding the debt and the 6 year counter is reset.  One thing I will admit that I am not certain of is whether or not the state operated medical institution has a special status that changes the category of this debt somehow..

But yeah it's absolutely ridiculous.  I spoke to a paralegal friend that I have on the east coast and he was blown away by the state allowing you to be billed for services that you did not request, and may have actively refused.  It's straight up financial reimbursement for being detained against your will.  Of course any sane, warm-blooded human with normal emotions is going to vote against something like that.  You didn't enter into _any_ sort of agreement or contract.  But you can't really count on sane, warm-blooded humans with normal emotions in this backwoods state, can you?

In this case there has not been contact for at least 10 years, and the stay was 15 years ago now.  Not a peep since 2012.  Plus there was the issue of being charged a full rate to be detained without access to the process necessary to complete the Tx for a release to be possible...

Anyway, unsurprisingly, the wonderful world of google informed me that a lot of agencies will even take you to court for debts that have timed out, because if you ditch the appearance where you make that defense the judgment will default against you.  I'm pretty sure that's what's got to be happening here.

Regardless, with a tag into 5 digits to pay it off, when much of that was an utterly unstimulating hotel stay with no medical services rendered at a tag of $450+/day, and so much time has passed, I think this is one that is gonna get fought.  Even if there's a down payment necessary.  Those guys are straight up assholes.  I wish everybody had the resources to fight places like this.  It's the damn gatekeeping of the law institution that so many people are utterly unable to avoid being fucked if they can't hire legal counsel.  If you're not able to throw down 4-5 digits at a time without hesitation, you're gonna get pwned.  The poor should not be utterly helpless to defend against the upper class armed with armies of lawyers that they stand no chance of defending against.

To be honest, I wonder how true this really holds anymore? At one point it was true just because where we were geographically and that we had so many warheads here AND that we had them here specifically as a matter of time. 

Now, we have nukes all over the world and in submarines. It just isn't the cold war anymore. 

Besides, I don't think he wants to end the world. I would suspect he is more likely to use a small nuke over a closer location that is strategically placed to subdue EU and our actions there... not start wwiii, which could be the case anyway in the unlikely event that this happened.

I am one, and have basic nuclear war training in the military, so I can offer suggestions, and some things to think about.

Some things to consider:

ND has a lot of missile silos, and each and every one of them will get a ground burst in an attack. Ground burst detonations throw up a ton of fallout, so if you live in an area down wind from this (Fargo, Grand Forks), you're toast.

Bases will catch warheads, too, so Minot, Grand Forks AFB will be gone. Minot is far enough outside of town that collateral won't be too bad, I would think, depending on whether its and air burst or surface burst. Some towns have silos in close proximity to them, so be aware of any silos you might have near by.

Survival of the attack itself is the least of the problem, because then you have to worry about uncontaminated food and water. Any city over maybe a couple of hundred will have to figure out how to ration resources, and if there are a lot of people riots are a distinct possibility.

If you want to play with detonation effects, you can plug your location into [nukemap](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) and see what the effects of an attack by you there would be.",t2_tmtum,Muskaos,0,1646655115.0,0,t1_hzp0zn8,hzp0zn8,True,alexlapointe27,t3_t8m7a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/t8m7a8/where_do_we_go_if_we_are_under_a_nuclear_attack/,Where do we go if we are under a nuclear attack?,/r/northdakota/comments/t8m7a8/where_do_we_go_if_we_are_under_a_nuclear_attack/hzp0zn8/,9,r/northdakota,0,9,0.123231925,0.054002102,0.055001784,0.097300716,0.026302136,0.2556682,0.043004427

3. Cost of living is good. Houses went up for a while but seemed to level out. Everything else is very fair.

6. There’s good options for school.
7. My mom comes from Oregon to get surgery’s done although I haven’t cared for my results from general visits.

Another thing to consider is something like 92% of the state is private land. Coming from Oregon it was a big shock to not have many options for outdoors and the options there are crowded. Hunting is basically shooting from your truck competing with everyone else shooting from their trucks.

3. Cost of living is much lower in ND than UT although it is still rising. Houses are smaller in ND on average than UT.
4. Summers in ND are more humid than UT. We don't get inversions here but we have smoke from forest fires in Canada. Fall, Winter, and Spring are so much colder. Snow in ND turns to hard ice. It's not fun. The only hills to sled are man-made. The wind is brutal and kids learn about frost-bite at a young age. Kids are kept inside most of the long winter. Western ND is far warmer than Eastern ND.
5. ND is very safe.
6. Schools depend on where you live. It is not a unified school system like UT, so they vary more by area. Your realtor and online reviews can show you school ratings.
7. I worked in Healthcare in UT. Healthcare is FAR superior in UT compared to ND.

As a side note, I have also lived in Texas and Oklahoma which are more conservative and also have a low cost of living. They may be a better choice than ND.  hope you find a place that is a good fit for you and your family!",t2_a8df3,eknowles,0,1646429472.0,0,t1_hzdb1c1,hzdb1c1,True,[deleted],t3_t6srp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/t6srp6/thinking_about_moving_to_north_dakota/,Thinking about moving to North Dakota,/r/northdakota/comments/t6srp6/thinking_about_moving_to_north_dakota/hzdb1c1/,3,r/northdakota,0,3,0.08804796,0.0437669,0.13611127,0.074165605,0.0267881,0.06915418,0.021715164

829,"Spent 23 years in North Dakota…my first 23 years on the planet. I visit a few times of a year as my family lives there and I still fish and hunt. This is just my opinion having lived in many other places and not necessarily a fact so don’t get offended No Daks. 

1. North Dakota is cold for many months of the year. Like 9-10 of them. December-Feb being the coldest with temps often reaching negative teens as a low and 0 as a high. It’s very windy which makes this much worse. People say summers are hot there…they aren’t. They are warm and windy…often times they are 75 with some mild to moderate wind. The weather keeps children and people inside as the landscape is flat and there isnt much opportunity for outdoor recreation like in Utah. I think that’s why there is such a high rate of underage and binge drinking as well as obesity and depression. The fishing is excellent as an outdoor activity, the hunting is good if you own private land. Most of North Dakota is private land and the public land is not great and often crowded  for larger game. 

2. Not sure how the finance industry is there but the income is good there for the cost of living plus there is an oil industry there and this should create a lot of opportunity for some wealth management and or a thriving car and house loan market. 

3. There are good people in North Dakota. I have found people to not be very open but very agreeable. Your neighbor may be suspicious of you if you move in but most people will give you a chance and if you show you are a friendly neighbor they will give the shirt off their back for you. Like I said…a lot of obesity, depression, and alcoholism there. The culture is largely based around church, high school sports, hunting, fishing, and beer! Everyone knows a farmer or rancher and this is deeply ingrained into the North Dakota culture no matter where you are at. You’ll make friends…people seem to appreciate the simple things which is nice. I’ve found a lot of individuals to be home bodies…how could you not with the weather. 😄 overall I made good friends in North Dakota and had pretty good experiences with the people. My only gripe was that there was a really low level of openness…you have to really look for people who are open to new people or experiences. 

4. Cost of living ranges from very cheap in small towns 100k for a decent home to moderate in key areas of larger towns. An example would be my family owns a 2400 square foot home in the capitol city on a lake in a very nice neighborhood and I believe it appraised for 275k not that long ago. 
5. About as safe as it gets. There are definitely some areas that are more dangerous. More like certain apartment complexes I wouldn’t walk through but not necessarily neighborhoods. Maybe certain neighborhoods I’d avoid late at night as a female or child but this seems to be good advice for any city and any neighborhood. Bottom line is you probably will never even think about security other than locking your car and your door at night. Some towns you maybe wouldn’t even lock your door. 

6. I haven’t done a ton of research into this but the quality of Schools depend on where you are but almost all are very good and provide a safe environment with good teachers. Lots and lots of Christian schools and universities to choose from..I went to both of them and got a good education and look back fondly on that time. 

7. Fargo has very good hospitals, they just built a new giant Sanford hospital with good trauma surgeons and good cardiovascular surgeons. I don’t think you’d be wanting for anything healthcare related unless your illness was so rare that you needed a university hospital or a Mayo Clinic..which is a couple hours from Fargo in Minneapolis.  Bismarck is a little more lacking for hospitals but I don’t know that you will be deprived…there are two decent sized hospitals downtown. Outside of those places you have kid level facilities that would transfer to those two larger cities for major issues and in rural areas you are counting on small town clinics and rural access urgent cares and ERs so this could be an issue.

Edit: if I could add some suggestions. The black hills in South Dakota are beautiful and also meet a lot of your needs while being a bit more positive outdoor activity friendly and also a bit more warm. Rapid city has some increased crime but some of those little Mountain towns (spearfish, deadwood, hill city, etc) are absolutely beautiful and would be A dream spot to grow up. Honestly with all the tourism there directed towards kids and families I can’t think of a more kid friendly place. 

Also if you don’t mind cold northern Idaho is gorgeous and has many neat smaller to kid sized towns. 

Bend Oregon is worth a look as well. Nice weather and gorgeous with the nicest people…this may cost a little more.",t2_h4mjiiqx,Old-Assumption-3162,0,1646428878.0,0,t1_hzd9h6h,hzd9h6h,True,[deleted],t3_t6srp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/t6srp6/thinking_about_moving_to_north_dakota/,Thinking about moving to North Dakota,/r/northdakota/comments/t6srp6/thinking_about_moving_to_north_dakota/hzd9h6h/,0,r/northdakota,1,0,0.08889827,0.04072718,0.0816522,0.07518254,0.038380463,0.056423366,0.05147041

946,"Um. We're not in Canada. This is bumfuck hillbilly wasteland of the USA, and we don't take kindly to human decency in these parts.

Seriously tho, are you just acting or do you believe that? My mom was just looted blind by a fellow church member for over 45 years who was supposed to be caring for her here as her health declined. She signed her out of the hospital on agreement to provide 24/7 care and then convinced her she didn't need it and left to go vacation on the coast with her daughter for a month.

My mom had a fatal aneurysm two days later, while I was on the phone with her. She was freaking out because she couldn't get ahold of her assistant to find out some important information. The blood pressure spike blew a huge artery in her brain. I heard her hit the floor, got over there, noticed unresponsive pupils and Cheyne-Stokes breathing, and called the ambulance. The next morning I took her off of life support, after my son had been taken home. Over the next few minutes my last close relative other than my son died while I cradled her. The bitch caretaker turned out to have stolen well into 6 figures from her, and that is just a small sliver of all the ways that she shit on my family.

Best part is that in their little cult of a church that I was raised in, the majority of the people were hypocritical pieces of shit like that. Outside of the family I've had sliced tires when I was homeless with my son, bottles broken over my head because I didn't wear my hat the right way, I've seen public elementary school teachers call a student ugly just to get laughs from the rest of the class.

I've lived all over the US and spent time in Europe with the army. There are some places in the Midwest that may be worse than here, but let me tell you you don't have any idea of what true decency is like. These people are playing the roles that society demands of them, often with a smile on their faces, but by and large they are poorly educated, cognitively rigid, judgmental assholes who will shit on you when you're down for fun if you didn't grow up with them.

I cannot wait for this legal shit due to my mom's death and that cut throat bitch's theft to be done so I can get the eff out of here and only come back to visit the four or five decent souls that I've met here out of frigging _thousands_ over the past 35 plus years of living here.
