I know that Georgia's infrastructure makes this near impossible in many places in the state. But if you can, I would recommend everyone to envision how they would get around without a car.

It took me a solid 5 years to get there, but the day I got rid of my car was the day I lost a lot of stress, saved a lot of money, and had just a more active day to day. No longer do I have to worry about:

* Highway accidents

* Gas prices/car insurance

* Other people's driving habits

* A big event screwing with my plans

* APD fucking with me for no reason

I spend less money on Marta, Uber, & scooters than I did owning a car. 

Does it take me longer to get to places? Sure. But it hasn't stopped me from doing anything I would have done when I had a car.

38,"I grew up there. There are certain places you would want to avoid but you are very unlikely to go down those roads anyway, and it would be dangerous more because of meth not necessarily because you are a woman of color. Do not eat at the Dillard House, they recycle food and are generally gross anyway. The city of Clayton is a quick drive away from Rabun Gap and downtown Clayton is cute and quaint. Universal Joint is a good burger and craft brew spot with a good homemade black bean burger (I used to work there). My really good friend owns a cool store called Cage Free Boutique, check it out! Rabun County has changed a lot with more tourists, new residents, general growth. There are a few lakes in the county that are beautiful! I wouldn't worry too much, there is little overt racism. But I'm not a person of color and I'm a man, so your mileage may vary. I'm gay so that was super shitty growing up there but that was more school/church/family related. I also got kicked off of Rabun Gap's campus for kissing a guy there so definitely some homophobia among the staff but they have lots of international students of color. So don't feel like you are stuck at Nacoochee, just don't drive down random scary back roads alone at night and get out of your car, again, you would be unlikely to want to do that anyway!

Edit: I was assuming you meant your residency was at Rabun Gap Nacoochee. Also Rabun Gap isn't a county, Rabun is the county you will be in. Oh, and don't speed or break any traffic laws. The unofficial motto of the county is ""welcome to Rabun, you're under arrest."" The PD there sucks but if your rental car (assuming you have one) has local tags you should be fine.

However you are on campus at Rabun Gap. This is where the most diversity is in the county. It is a diverse group, a beautiful campus, and the parents are involved with the education of their kids.

KJV:
Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

2 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.

4 For they **bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne**, and lay them on men's shoulders; **but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers**. 

Another, more obvious translation (Contemporary English Version) of verse 4, with 5 included:

4 They pile heavy burdens on people’s shoulders and won’t lift a finger to help. 5 Everything they do is just to show off in front of others.

136,"I assume the situation is you are making either a protected (green arrow) or unprotected (no green arrow) left on a green light. A car is approaching you in the opposite direction and is making a right. Their right turn has a yield sign. I can't speak for other states, but in that case, the GA law is clear. Since they have a yield sign, the right turner must yield to you (the left turner).

This case is covered by:

[https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2020/title-40/chapter-6/article-4/section-40-6-72/](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2020/title-40/chapter-6/article-4/section-40-6-72/)

The relevant part of 40-6-72:

c. **The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall**, in obedience to such sign, slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and, if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After slowing or stopping, the driver shall **yield the right of way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway** so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways.

If there is no yield sign for the right turn, then another section comes into play:

[https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2020/title-40/chapter-6/article-4/section-40-6-71/](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2020/title-40/chapter-6/article-4/section-40-6-71/)

Which means you (the left turner) have to yield to them (the right turner).

The problem I have seen is when you have a protected left turn but a right turn lane with no yield. Then it's the wild west.",t2_eyl16blp,a_concerned_cat,0,1648224150.0,0,t1_i22vtvs,i22vtvs,False,HoovesCarveCraters,t3_tnkryo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/tnkryo/please_im_begging_you/,"Please, I'm begging you",/r/Georgia/comments/tnkryo/please_im_begging_you/i22vtvs/,6,r/Georgia,0,6,0.092717886,0.048529394,0.044428416,0.07341356,0.10024483,0.06345443,0.086381905

140,"I think there are legitimate questions about easing the process for involuntary commitments.

I do hope that the other provisions aren't hanging in the balance because of this. 

Any of you that have actually read the bill, what safeguards are in it to ensure vulnerable groups due to race, gender or poverty won't be subject to unnecessary involuntary commitments?

We talk about disproportionate harm of abuse of systems like criminal justice and child welfare, is this replicating those disparities in mental health systems?

If you're homeless, or a gay runaway youth what stops anyone from weaponizing the involuntary commitment system as proposed? What's described below gives extraordinary discretion to professionals....

""Under current state law, mentally ill people must show an “imminent” risk of harm to themselves or others before they can be committed for treatment.
The bill would create several criteria for such commitment. The steps would include determining that a person presents a “substantial risk” of harm to themselves or others; and creates a reasonable expectation that a crisis or major psychiatric deterioration will occur without that care.
Other criteria include an assessment that there’s a reasonable prospect that hospital treatment would help that person; that other, less restrictive alternatives are not appropriate; and that the person has declined voluntary treatment or lacks the capacity to make such a decision.""",t2_5rlzzlbe,rikitikifemi,0,1648223013.0,0,t1_i22svx0,i22svx0,True,2317,t3_tmhoj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/tmhoj4/georgia_mental_health_bill_receives_conservative/,Georgia mental health bill receives conservative pushback,/r/Georgia/comments/tmhoj4/georgia_mental_health_bill_receives_conservative/i22svx0/,1,r/Georgia,0,1,0.24043772,0.10953868,0.5416756,0.2565395,0.070128635,0.07981864,0.080498904

183,"I did it once about 10 years ago! I think most people do it in 5-8 days, depending on how strenuous they want to make it and their fitness level. When I did it I added the the approach trail to the trip and did it in 6 days, which was a lot. I’m a little out of shape now so I’d probably plan for 7 or 8 if I was to do it right now. Plan on going around 10-12 miles in a day. The elevation changes in that section of the trail can be pretty intense and pushing it too hard through there can make it less fun. It’s pretty easy to do a resupply stop near Neel Gap so I would shoot to make that be near the middle point of the trip. 

March and April are obviously the busiest months out there because all of the northbound hikers are starting their trips. I like to hike out there in May and June because you’ll still see some through hikers but the shelters and trails aren’t slam packed.

The AT starts at Springer Mountain and the NC state line is 73 miles from that point. Most people get to the start via the approach trail from Amicalola State Park which is about an extra 8 miles of 'uphill the whole way'... my night in Hiawasee was on my 7th night, then when I got back on the trail I crossed the NC state line later that day.  There were a few days where I hiked around 8 miles and a few where I hiked over 15 miles in a day. 

I'd suggest doing some day hikes - maybe from Mtn. Crossing to Blood Mountain or the AT Approach trail a few times with your full pack before you head out and maybe ask the people at the store at Mtn Crossing to help you shake down your pack - they can help you trim a good deal of weight from the pack and they are really good at it....

266,"Oh. man. these two fuckers, both boebert and majorie tayler green...If you're a lobbyist at the house of representatives you hear all sorts of shit about them but the general public doesn't hear about them since we generally don't talk to the press because it fucks up our relationships with lawmakers.

I'll give this one story though.

I'm Facebook's lobbyist and I need to lobby politicians FAST because of upcomming anti-Facebook legislation but we only manage to sway a handful of lawmakers because most of their constituents hate Facebook.

After reporting my failures to Mark Zuckeburg directly he decided to come to DC directly to talk to politicians directly. The only ones willing to meet with us are Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. At the meeting Mark makes his pitch and after that MTG and LB eye each other, smile, and nod at each other.

""Oh, we can get the republicans to help"" said one.

""But we need some 'help' from you first"", said the other.

And they pass a note to Mark and when he read it he frowned and got very pale. He then told me I could leave now.

I was surprised, but I knew better to ask questions, so I left.

Halfway to my car I realize I was still holding Mark's very important notebook so I go back to return it and when I go into the meeting room I see mark getting double cowgirled by them! They were high fiving and Mark noticed me and managed to push boebert's buttcheeks off his face for 2 seconds to scream 'IT'S THE ONLY WAY' before she forcibly removed his hands, repositioning her butt back on his face with a loud fleshy slam with enough force to make me wince, followed by a fart which I could only assume was further punishment from Lauren.

I got in my car. And drove. All the way back to Silicon Valley. I quit federal lobbying for good. I sent Mark my resignation. His only reply was a single word 'received'. I hoped to avoid seeing Mark because it was just too awkward for me. And I think he felt the same because he made to request to see me.

I got a job as a state lobbyist for Cisco. I was in a much better place mentally and emotionally. State politics isn't as crazy as federal, and the capitol at Sacramento was only a 3 hour drive from my clients compared to the half a day travel going to DC.

But considering that Facebook also lobbys state govt it was only a matter of time I would run into him again and that time came at the annual silicon valley big tech lobbying social. It's a secret meeting in an isolated mansion in the Santa Cruz hills where the top tech companies execs, politicians, and lobbyists meet to establish their secrets channels of favors.

I noticed Mark and he seem to avoid me at first but them he came up to me with a nervous smile. ""I heard you saw my stunt double getting Eiffel towered MTG and LB. I have a stunt double in DC btw"". And then he looked at me nervously, as if he was unsure if I would believe him. Did Mark think anyone would actually believe him? But I humored him 'Oh yes. He looks exactly like you. I thought he was you tbh"". A big look of relief spread through Mark's face and body.

We then caught up, and our conversation ended with a job offer to lobby for Facebook once again, at the state level, with a considerable pay increase from my current job.

Around midnight the party was ending and people were starting to trickle out of the party giddy at the new channels they established. 10 minutes into my drive I realize I left my coat. I go back to get it. By then the mansion was empty but all attendees are given a key card that lasts for 24 hours. I go to the coat room and open the door to find Mark getting double cowgirled by then senator Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi. Mark yelled 'I'M THE STUNT DOUB' and I slammed the door before Mark could finish his sentence.

I forfeited my coat, got in my car, and drove, non-stop, all the way to my hometown of Boulder Colorado. I arrive at my parents house who were surprised to see me as I didn't tell them I was coming. I went directly to my old room, and slept, for 14 hours straight. When I woke up, I re-evaluated my life. I now work at a non-profit for cancer research and I am now in a much better place, both emotionally and mentally.",t2_e31c2o8t,BadBoysWillBeSpanked,1,1648178924.0,0,t1_i20sj00,i20sj00,True,Pierceleli,t3_tmpojr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/tmpojr/time_to_remove_marjorie_taylor_greene/,Time to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene!,/r/Georgia/comments/tmpojr/time_to_remove_marjorie_taylor_greene/i20sj00/,0,r/Georgia,0,0,0.7174381,0.6771831,0.5707079,0.734651,0.8087925,0.5293452,0.7407407

293,"Not defending or advocating for the bill, but even the heavily biased article linked shows that every Georgian earning income would have their tax bill reduced.

The article seems to express a fundamental frustration with these themes:

1. When income taxes are reduced, people paying a lot of income tax will pay a lot less than people who only pay a little income tax. I mean, that's just kind-of how math works.
2. State revenues will be reduced. Worthy of debate, but not inherently bad. If you believe Georgia can spend more of your money better than you can, we're each free to donate more money to the State when filing our taxes. I think there's a place on the form to do that.
3. The proposal would ""worsen racial inequities and expand the racial wealth gap."" A claim which is not substantiated or explained beyond a footnote annotation referencing another article. Another article written by the same author at the same site. In fact, 2 of the footnoted sources are articles by the same author at the same site.
4. ""Bill Proposes Tax Cuts for High Earners at Expense of Georgia Families"" but does not explain how. There's a comparison to the size of the tax cut: ""This is greater than the amount the state spends on the entire Department of Human Services, Georgia’s ninth-largest state agency, each year."" Which seems to be trying to conflate the tax cut issue with a cut in services when it doesn't appear any such cuts are mentioned.

When working with percentages, of course those with the largest incomes will experience the largest changes in taxes owed.

Is a graduated tax rate better for the state than a flat tax rate? That's certainly worthy of discussion. But don't get emotionally manipulated by headlines and stories that amplify the hype by manipulating how numbers and percentages are presented.

Since only about 30% of tax filings itemize deductions, this may be helpful to 70% of tax filers: ""The legislation proposes replacing the state’s current standard deduction and personal exemption with a new “standard exemption” that would increase from $2,700 for single filers to $12,000 and from $7,400 to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly.""

*Edit: As for ""Slashing State Revenues"" Georgia's 2021 total budget available to the state is $48.2 billion. (source: same author, same site,* [*different article*](https://gbpi.org/georgia-revenue-primer-for-state-fiscal-year-2021/)*). The bill being discussed as described in OP's article is forecasted to reduce State revenue collections by \~1 billion. This equates to a 2% reduction in State revenue. A comparison presented nowhere in the article because ""a 2% reduction"" is not nearly as exciting as ""one BILLION dollars.""*

*Again, all of this is worth evaluating but articles like the one shared are biased garbage.*

*Edit: The more I think about current inflation rates, the more I think I'd support a reduction in state income tax withholdings. Keep more of my money? Yes please.*",t2_z8sf7,robot_ankles,1,1648174069.0,0,t1_i20ib38,i20ib38,True,lowcountrygrits,t3_tmrgwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/tmrgwo/house_proposes_massive_tax_cuts_for_wealthiest/,"House Proposes Massive Tax Cuts for Wealthiest, Slashing State Revenues | Bill Analysis: House Bill 1437",/r/Georgia/comments/tmrgwo/house_proposes_massive_tax_cuts_for_wealthiest/i20ib38/,3,r/Georgia,0,3,0.062423266,0.014160775,0.08186667,0.043489143,0.029415475,0.028600635,0.012722936

305,"Ehh, I’m going to voice the dissenting POV. I was born and raised in DeKalb county and never owned a car. I always lived close to Marta stations, which certainly made it easier. It is completely by choice as I don’t care to be stuck in traffic, deal with vehicle maintenance, live sedentary, or risk a car accident.

Your best bet without a car would be intown neighborhoods like Midtown, Cabbagetown, etc but it appears you are most interested in the suburbs. You will definitely need to live ITP to be carfree, meaning DeKalb/Fulton counties (sans Alpharetta). At least there, you have the MARTA system and it is a mix of heavy rail and buses. Outside Atlanta proper, I really like College Park and East Point. My only complaint is the airport noise.

Any of the “suburban” counties will be extremely difficult (ie Cobb, Gwinnett, Clayton). Although they have public buses, they operate separately from Marta (except Clayton) and have no rail. Unfortunately, it may be next to impossible without a car. However, I’ve never lived in any of those counties so if there is anyone who has while carfree, feel free to dispute me😉.

Here are “suburban-like” areas in Dekalb/Fulton where you can survive without a car. I’ve lived full time in all 3 of them so it’s definitely feasible.

- Around the Decatur Marta station is very walkable with lots of small businesses. It is really nice but can be super pricey (DeKalb). 

- Chamblee, also in DeKalb, is very diverse with apartments and condo developments around the Marta station. It’s also very affordable and less urban than than other ITP areas.

- Likewise, Sandy Springs is very suburban and has several grocery stores; it’s not as diverse as Chamblee though if you care about that.

Now with remote work even more common post-COVID, living carfree is more feasible these days depending on your career. Granted, I now split my time between GA and NYC for work but never found a car necessary at all even when I was in GA full-time. But it all depends on the individual and what you are willing to tolerate.",t2_90y987y5,Best-Ad-6794,0,1648171834.0,0,t1_i20dbtf,i20dbtf,True,kindoftemporary,t3_tn4woq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/tn4woq/atlanta_suburbs_with_good_reliable_transit_system/,Atlanta suburbs with good reliable transit system?,/r/Georgia/comments/tn4woq/atlanta_suburbs_with_good_reliable_transit_system/i20dbtf/,5,r/Georgia,0,5,0.07882957,0.028997928,0.045303345,0.04886214,0.038123667,0.06943698,0.026731905

The redistricting doesn't make that as much of a sure thing as it once was.  And there's a bizarre bright side to MTG's embarrassing antics.  She has no time and no support left to actual move her horrible ideas forward as legislation.  Strahan would take the job seriously - and to me, that's worse.

From Strahan's site: 

*""I’ll fight for a government that works for us – one that is transparent, fiscally responsible, and accountable to the people. I’ll fight to protect our constitutional freedoms – for our gun rights, free speech,* ***religious freedom, and the right to life*** *– and to free our Georgia entrepreneurs from burdensome regulations and high taxes that strangle prosperity and innovation.""*

Our religious freedom is not in peril in Georgia - and certainly not for Christians.  Right to life is just the whitewashed version of blocking women's healthcare based on personal beliefs.

367,"MARTA was put up for a referendum in the early 1970s, and only the voters of the two more urban counties at the time (DeKalb and Fulton) approved it. So MARTA lines could only be built in those two counties, because they were the only two counties paying for it with an extra penny sales tax (or however much it was). 

Back then, Cobb County, for example, had about 200,000 residents, the same as current day Hall County, which many would consider to be more rural than urban by today's standards. So many of the people bavk then didn't see a need for transit.

But even then, not everyone worked in the downtown core. Atlanta was a much smaller metropolitan area then -- about 1.3 million people, roughly the size of current day metropolitan Louisville. Many people today would argue that Louisville doesn't need a subway system, so I assume that many people in the metro Atlanta (of a similar size) back then didn't see the need, either. Nobody could have known how much Atlanta was going to grow.

Heck, even the city of Atlanta in 1970 only had 500,000 people, about the same as today. It's not a dense urban city like Philadelphia that has 1.5 million people living in the city limits. 

Atlanta itself is very suburban. Most of the 238 or so neighborhoods of Atlanta were once it's inner ring suburbs (neighborhoods like Inman Park, East Atlanta, etc).

Atlanta has many ""hubs"" of activity as well,  for example downtown, midtown, Buckhead, Perimeter, Galleria, Alpharetta (a lot of tech sector jobs up that way), etc. It's not a traditional city with a big urban core where many of the jobs are, like Chicago.

For real - if you can choose, don’t mess around with in-window air conditioners, be prepared for insects (especially mosquitoes and cockroaches), and be cautious when looking at properties with low points - water has a tendency to pool and not drain = mosquitoes. Also allergies are a problem for most people in spring. Pay attention to this sub over the next few weeks and you’ll see all the killer pollen photos. 

North Georgia is of course a little cooler, and the mountains can make for a nice retreat when it’s peak summer, but even they stay pretty humid. depending on how NE of Athens your work is, you may want to consider looking north of I-85 - that seems to be a significant weather line, for some reason. But that’s also a much more rural place - if political environments matter to you, Athens is one of the most liberal towns in GA; everything around it is very red. 

It’s *really* pretty and nice right now though! If you can visit, now to the end of April is perfect. May gets a little warmer, a little balmier, and then it starts in June.

393,"Conclusion
As Georgia nears the two-year mark since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the state has the opportunity to regain ground lost to deep budget cuts and set a new fiscal course. Georgia can avoid repeating a prolonged period of underfunding state priorities as the state did in the decade that followed the Great Recession. **To do so, lawmakers must guard against attempts to weaken Georgia’s still-volatile revenue system or risk the state’s ability to sustain its funding commitments by rejecting risky tax proposals that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest individuals and/or select corporations at the expense of working Georgians.** With unprecedented resources on hand, including billions in surplus funds and over $4.5 billion in flexible ARP federal funding available—and the potential of numerous bipartisan proposals to raise revenue, such as opportunities to lift the tobacco tax from the lowest level in the nation to the national average—state leaders have a unique opportunity during the 2022 session to find bipartisan consensus by investing in an equitable recovery for all Georgians.

You seem like you are arguing in bad faith if you are going to twist my words like that. You can't win this argument without twisting the words, I said back in the day and you're claiming "" a lot of black people live suburbs now"" lol.... 


Here are a few issues with what you're saying:



Researcher Richard Murnane found that private school students score higher on achievement tests than public school students because they come from more advantaged homes and bring more skills to school with them.




Private schools can be anything, a lot have been found to be scams also, they are not regulated like public schools and they do not have to adhere to the same thing public schools do. 


What you're saying, it will end up being almost the same as redlining. The rich kids will go to the rich kid school (no bus routs, further away from poor kids, smaller lottery selection) and the poor kids will end up with the low funded, easy to get to, closer school.

409,"Atlanta is almost entierly car-centric. Outside of the people who live in condo high rises in Midtown, I Don't know anyone who doesn't own/use a car in metro Atlanta. Even people who are hardcore ""ITP"" people still usually own a car and have street parking at a minimum.

Decatur, GA or nearby Avondale Estates is your best bet, but it's an expensive/growing area and the transit is not even extensive within the Perimeter, honestly. But with Decatur/Avondale, it's still walkable, there's a lot of shops to go to, and you can still take the train to downtown, Atlanta, midtown, or the airport if needed.

Maybe also consider College Park, East Point, or Hapeville, although thise are more middle class areas that are majority black, so not a lot of metro Atlantans will have informed opinions of those areas. (I think the tri cities area gets a worse reputation than it deserves. Many people think It's hood, and parts if it are, but there are also many good areas. Schools are likely not as great there, however).

MARTA doesn't extend much beyond the Perimeter, and many of the suburbs are very car-centric.

532,"I'm glad you asked and that you are open to learning new things. To clarify something: imperialism is an economic term about exporting capital and financial dominance over other countries, which sometimes involves military invasion but not always. So think about how the United States has been consistently meddling with the economies of Latin American countries to prop up governments that are friendly to US business practices and assassinating leftist leaders or funding death squads to murder labor organizers. We're at the point in history where it is financially easier to keep developing countries as pseudo-colonies instead of actually directly controlling them, although the US still does have colonies such as my family's home country of Puerto Rico.

Really the most glaring example of US imperialism today is how it uses sanctions as a way of blockading countries that don't want to be subjected to the whims of US capitalists. Korea has been occupied by the US military since the 50s, and Cuba has been blockaded since the 60s. Bolivia and Venezuela had democratic elections that the US didn't like the result of so they continue to suffer sanctions. 

It's also crucial that you understand that the US has NOT withdrawn from the Middle East. US sponsored genocide is ongoing in Yemen. The US props up the Israeli apartheid state and its atrocious human rights abuses. Libya is still a mess because of US intervention there.

575,"LBJ if you stretch it a little, for the Civil Rights act if nothing else. Carter was a good man who badly misread the room but deregulated a lot of industry and helped modernize the American economy. Reagan and Trump are cut from the same cloth, empty populists with evil advisors. Reagan just had more competent handlers and no Twitter. Bush Sr. was an old school conservative technocrat who never really drank the kool aid but pardoned so many people who did that it comes out the same. Clinton was an inspiring politician who brought the Democrats out of the electoral wilderness by being aggressively centrist, which left him entirely unprepared to deal with the rabid partisanship of Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh. His personal foibles didn't help. GW was just a bumbling Oedipus who surrounded himself with the worst people from Nixon and Bush Sr's administration. Obama was a generational political talent entirely unwilling to confront the GOP on their own terms, and unable or unwilling to call out transparently racist behavior for what it was. 

In the past fifty years, Democrats have largely won on empty centrism, and Republicans have largely won on culture wars. The Democrats have governed more effectively because that's what they do, but they are rarely loved because they engage in the politics of the possible. It's the thorough brushing and flossing of politics; Something you have to do, but that is hard to get excited about. The Republicans are remembered more fondly by their base because they told them they were the best and gave them someone to hate; populism is easy to sell.

Biden is another centrist Democrat, because it looks like that's the only type that can get elected. He's good at his job, generally uncontroversial, and uninterested in the histrionic populism that animated the Trump administration. He's also not particularly interested in the more sweeping policies pushed by the progressive wing of the party, even though he has been by any measure the most progressive president of my lifetime. We'll have to weight 8 or 12 years after he leaves office to figure out where he slots in the ""best"" category.

Crime is on a upswing , it doesn’t mean everywhere. Texans have had their fare share of crime and I’m certain you are aware of your surroundings when you’re out and about. Just so you know, Kennesaw is a great place to live that is safe and housing, while depending on the neighborhood, is affordable. They promote gun ownership therefore the crime rate was almost zero a few years ago (depending on the crime). They have a high presence of neighborhood watch, as well as patrol vehicles in neighborhoods with plenty of outdoor recreational areas. While it may be farther away from some of the attractions that might interest you, for a small fee, a Peach Pass will allow you to use the express lanes (which really come in handy). Just do your research and spend some time visiting neighborhoods, schools, venues, etc. Most of us natives are proud that others want to live in our beautiful city.

There's no doubt that the ones who love that kind of ilk from candidates like her will keep loving it. The more hateful, nasty, and prejudiced she is, the more some rally around her all that much more exuberantly. Their objective above everything is presented as ""anything to own the LIB'RULS,"" and I guess that if you asked them, they'd say that is the goal.
