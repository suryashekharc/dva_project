You’re fucking with me, right? 

How about the Great Recession. Why do you think housing was the move for investors at the time? Could it be that the rate of profit had been on a steady fucking decline (and is at historic lows right now) leading them to more speculation and general growth and take over of finace Capital over productive capital? And what led the profit rate to drop so low…. Wait for it…

Overproduction is a *reality* of capitalism. Marx just labels it over production but capitalists tend to call it something along the lines of “under demand”. 

Anyway, I’m fucking with you. I *know* you have no answer because the “best” capitalists theorist in history have proved incapable of resolving the contradiction. Whether approached from a neoclassical or a Keynesian (or any fringe shit in between) capitalist perspective none have been able to do away with that pesky reoccurring problem. Keynes got the closest but even after living to see his ideas implemented in great capacity even he came to the realization that it would require something akin to a perpetual war economy to work long term. Which is a non starter for a civilized world. And even that assumption is heavily disputed by other economists even capitalists

125,"Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

Jan 7 was right around when they started the migration. Ours got stuck in that processing, and then again after that approval with Deval. They've also changed the ""published email"" like 4 times. It's very frustrating.)

I finally had success calling Deval  (703) 962-1884, who said it had been ""sent to accounting"" (but got stuck for weeks). I then called  1-833-RENT-RELIEF (1-833-736-8735), operated by the new egov processor, to see if they had any further insight. They said the Deval transition was rocky and they had been recommending some people re-apply through the new eGov portal, but I had already been approved and ""sent to accounting"" which is apparently the Commonwealth, not Deval.

I was finally successful emailing [rrp@dhcd.virginia.gov](mailto:rrp@dhcd.virginia.gov) withApplicant's Name: XApplication Number ###Landlord's Name: Yand saying I'd been getting the runaround from Deval since November (now early February). A few days later a real DHCD person responded saying check was sent.

My guess was is you are stuck in limbo between Deval and Egov. It looks like Deval was officially removed from the contract March 1st, so that might be even more complicated to sort out.

153,"I don't live in the Arlington area or Northern Virginia (NOVA), but I do live in the Richmond area, and have considered some DC metro-area positions.  

Coming from CA I imagine you are no stranger to traffic. But please pay attention to the guidance regarding traffic flows.  

The traffic issues in and around the DC-Area are among the worst in the US.  

If you choose poorly, a 15 mile commute can take several hours each day.  

If you choose to live in the NOVA area, I'd encourage you to plan your commute around public transit.  
Find an apartment within a mile of a Metro station and walk/bike.  

Your idea to live in Richmond isn't as crazy as it might sound.  

There is a 6:05am Amtrack leaving Richmond Main Street Station arriving in DC Union Station at 8:22am  
$15 Coach, $36 Business class. WiFi on the train I believe is free.  
From Union, you can take the Metro line to Arlington and walk/cab/Lyft to your office.  

There are three Amtrack stations in Richmond, with Ashland being the Northernmost.  

There are discussions about increasing the train schedule to support Amazon HQ2 which is supposed to open in 2023.  
I don't know the current state of those discussions...  

https://www.constructiondive.com/news/amazon-hq2-first-phase-on-track-2023-completion/610439/  

So, if they are serious about you only needing to come to the office occasionally, this could work and your $105k salary you mentioned will go a lot further here in Richmond than it will in NOVA.  


This is fairly close to Main Street Station:  
https://www.apartments.com/cedar-broad-richmond-va/gem8m5z/  

This is fairly close to the Ashland Station:  
https://www.apartments.com/ashland-woods-apartments-ashland-va/y6fs3fv/  

A second bedroom for the same approximate money could make for a really comfy office.  

Public transport in Ashland is practically non-existant, so owning a car is pretty mandatory.

191,"Lived in Richmond [/r/rva] for three years and loved it, there’s great food and a lot of young people since downtown Richmond is occupied by three large universities (VSU, VUU, VCU). Downtown Richmond is a very eclectic area with unique things to do and neat local venues. It’s also very walkable and cycling is a common mode of transportation. 

That said, the vibe and demographic of Richmond is drastically different from NoVa. NoVa is however a great place to live and you will virtually never run out of things do to up here. 

Richmond to Arlington is not a bad drive at all, I used to make it weekly. You should allow for at least 2.5hrs to drive to Arlington if you are heading there in the morning, as traffic severely jams up on 95 North (what you’ll take from RVA).

215,"If you want to live within 45 minutes of Arlington during rush hour, look for accommodations along 495 (the beltway) or I-66. 

Alexandria, Annandale, Merrifield, Crystal City, and Springfield may be good places to start looking that are convenient to 495. 

I-66 has terrible eastbound traffic in the mornings, so living out west (toward slightly cheaper areas) comes with that price. Depending on how far you want to go out on 66, some parts of Falls Church, Dunn Loring/Merrifield, some parts of Vienna, and Oakton are also good places to search. Generally, the farther you move out on 66W, the more green space you’ll find near accommodations.

One thing to mention is that the metro runs along 66. If public transportation for your commute would interest you, Vienna is the last stop on the orange line and will take you directly to Ballston/Virginia Square/Clarendon/Courthouse (areas within Arlington). The metro is perpetually under construction (along with everything else in NoVa haha) and occasionally operates under reduced hours. For the most part however it is reliable, cheap, and a good way to avoid the behemoth that is 66E starting around 6:30am.

You must have missed my post from hours ago about sensationalist arguments. 

ARs are common smaller caliber hunting rifles. What does it matter if someone added an ergonomic stock, different scope, free float rail etc? It doesn't change the mechanics of the rifle.

Here's an AR round on the left compared to a 308 (most common hunting round).

230,"The expert in the article is from an organization promoting human/coyote coexistence in the DC metro area. I dont see anything on their site addressing how to protect livestock. We use donkeys because they serve as guard animals and literally rip a coyote apart. They can't be everywhere though so we tend to shoot Coyotes on site at the farm.

Coyotes will always continue to proliferate but massive local impacts to their populations will cause a temporary reduction in their presence. Killing them does actually increases breeding cycles and as packs grow they do move toward less populated areas. Still  continued large scale culling has been the only shown method to reduce populations short of introducing competing predators. It's probably why the article cites the Feds culling 60,000 a year.

Part of the challenge is their food sources are growing. Lots of people leaving their pets outdoors and deforestation surprisingly leads to more deer since they're forest periphery animals. There are more white tail deer in the US now than back at the founding of Jamestown.

The real answer is trying to rebalance the ecology by reintroducing apex predators.

Ukrops Monument Ave (10K) in Richmond in mid-April is an epic VA race, fast course.

This sounds a lot like victim blaming. I suggest you read feminist critiques on rape culture.

>Scott Smith straight up lied about a random transexual predator, because it got national attention on his daughter's case.

Lie must demonstrate intent. It's not ridiculous to assume a ""boy"" who wears dresses and other ""girl"" clothes may be viewed as some sort of trans or pansexual; at a minimum it demonstrates the gender fluid nature of queer theory. The father, not necessarily understanding the complexity of queer theory, seems to have used the word 'transsexual' because that was the only queer theory type word he had any understanding of, even if it was wrong.

I will admit that media failed to do their job in proper reporting, because within a few phone calls multiple journalists immediately recognized this ""boy"" was not trans in the traditional sense but something else entirely.

I would recommend seeing a doctor to see how they can help you document you condition so you can request reasonable accommodations, which, depending on the nature of your job, can include flexible hours.

But for the immediate, if your management are reasonable humans, they shouldn't begrudge you a sick day in your probationary period. People get sick in their probationary periods. I did at my last job (though I was in a FT salary position), took the negative sick day, and after my 90 days I earned it back pretty quickly. 

And if nothing else, as someone who used to have debilitation migraines, an unpaid day is better than prolonging this by trying to work through it.  Call your management and explain the situation - I am sure a solution can be found.

649,"This might not help a ton but I grew up in Stuart’s Draft. Not southwest VA but from what i can tell they seem to have similarities. Growing up in a small town I just got used to it, didn’t go out often, definitely get used to either staying in and finding hobbies, watching TV, playing video games etc. or be willing to drive 15+ minutes to the nearest bigger town to do something fun or have nicer things to do. Not to say Marion probably doesn’t have nice things in town but in a small town things get old quick.

In stuart’s draft there was definitely some racism but it came far and few, Trump signs are prevalent but you even catch some Biden stickers on the back of cars here and there. Like another person mentioned there won’t be a ton of POC in the area but most likely a few and especially if you are attending higher education i imagine the school will have at least some diversity. 

I’d say overall definitely expect a massive lifestyle change, not sure where you live in the big city right now but definitely expect to drive everywhere you need to go, less things to do, quieter, Im sure your studies would occupy a lot of your time but it can get a little boring, this is where netflix and video games saved me growing up. Definitely visit the area and i’m not sure if there are any airbnb’s in Marion but if there are rent one out for a day or two and see what it’s like down there, you’ll immediately know if you can tolerate the lifestyle. It takes some adapting but don’t let it discourage you from getting your education! you won’t be there forever.

If it’s any encouragement I knew someone who moved from a major city in northern virginia to attend college in a city in south virginia with a population of ~10k and the nearest bigger city being 1+ hours away and last i heard they were having a great time.

I'm a white male so I can't say what your experience there would be, but people there are friendly in my experience. There is definitely more of a historically rural black population in counties such as Surry, Prince George and Charles City. These southern Va counties are probably closer to how I would picture rural Georgia to be. Another poster recommended doing an air bnb somewhere to try out an area and this is a great idea.

In particular, the conclusion that Russia attempted to sway the election for Trump was affirmed unanimously by all Senators on the panel, Democratic and Republican. Affirmed unanimously, for christs sake. There's also the Mueller Report and indictments, various other reports out there, all of which include documentation and proof.

765,"Yes, that's a huge issue. 

It was even more so in the early phase of the Omicron wave. We used to assumed we were detecting about 1/2 of the cases (ascertainment rate of 50%), but during the January surge it is probably closer to 1/5th. This is especially an issue given that Omicron that made [most] people less sick than Delta did, so they were less likely to bother getting medical attention. Another factor was people avoiding the hospital and doctors office during the surge, thinking they'd rather just test at home (especially since antivirals and MAB treatments were so limited they were reserved for the very sick). 

I would guess that this ascertainment rate figure has improved since the surge, or at worst stayed the same. So I'd guess the drop is real or even larger than it seems. That said, there are much better metrics. 

[Hospitalizations](https://www.vhha.com/communications/virginia-hospital-covid-19-data-dashboard/), though they lag, are a far better indicator when there is a single dominant variant. Since BA.2 is very similar to BA.1 I think we can compare hospitalization rates between December and today without worrying about subvariant composition. It is probably inappropriate to go back further and compare Alpha / Delta hospitalizations to Omicron hospitalizations. Test positivity among people who are not sick (e.g. people waiting for surgery, or getting routine tests) are also a good metric. 

Finally, I put a lot of stock in the wastewater testing. VDH has something like 35 testing sites now, where they pull samples to see how much covid is in the poop. Turns out people shed virus in their poop before they even get sick, and testing is usually a few days after they get sick, so wastewater sampling actually leads confirmed cases by 4-5 days. 

Check this out: https://biobot.io/data/ 

You can see that not only does wastewater levels lead confirmed cases, but indeed as you said, the detection rate for cases went down during the surge. I know VDH was planning on releasing a Virginia specific dashboard for wastewater data, but I haven't seen it yet. 

That said, hospitalizations and test positivity have also fallen alongside confirmed case rates and wastewater viral loads. This curve is also what was expected since December based on modeling. I'd wager that this is a real effect and not just home testing.

Yeah, my wife must be making up these stories about people telling her they're moving to less brown areas.  She also is probably acting when she looks hurt and upset about hearing those things.

We live in South Riding - it's become increasingly less white and folks are largely moving to Warrenton, Manassas and more rural areas.  Lots of explanations are that it's just more white there.  

What money do you think they're saving?  They're moving into bigger homes and increasing commute times.  Doubt they are saving much when you factor in gas, increased commute, large size home etc..

813,"The whole ""hunter left his laptop at a blind man's repair store"" story is not verified.  It was not verified at the time or since. At the time, Rudy couldn't provide a consistent story of how he got it,  he refused to provide copies of the hard drive, or complete copies of the emails. He only offered a small number of hand selected emails with no context, which it why every other media outlet took a hard pass on the story. He offered metadata for one of the e-mails, but it didn't match up with the document date. 

Recently several e-mails have been verified by the NY Times, but the bizarre laptop story and everything Rudy was pushing has not. 

Even those e-mails and pics that have not been verified don't show anything untoward about Joe. If the scandal is Hunter was a drug addict fuck up and got a job he didn't deserve because of his last name, then...okay. Nothing we didn't know.

It's also interesting that in one of the e-mail chains Rudy passed around, it turns out he only shared part of it of the chain:

In a 2014 email written by Hunter Biden to his business partner as their work with Burisma was about to begin, Hunter noted that his father, then the vice president who would soon visit Kyiv, should ""*be characterized as part of our advice and thinking — but what he will say and do is out of our hands*.""  
  
He went on to also state that Burisma officials ""*need to know in no uncertain terms that we will not and cannot intervene directly with domestic policymakers, and that we need to abide by FARA and any other U.S. laws in the strictest sense across the board*.""

Your experiences may be different but there is a consensus online that thinks Virginia has lost its character, and it's heart and soul, because of Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads.   I don't find that to be accurate because there are clear differences between people here and Northerners, but I do hear it a lot online.  Differences that I actually find refreshing because I find my peers to be insufferable at times.  But sarcasm is lost on internet forums.   

I hate the ignorance.  I think Virgina is great if people would actually give it a chance.   Even West Virginia is interesting in ways. But unless you've lived here you're in the dark.   Coming out of Ohio not knowing anything it was cool to see how people live somewhere other than the Midwest,  with its segregation and what not.   Although the architecture is great up there. 

One thing I love here is how bad this city is or how great this city is.  A lot of places that are horrible here,  that stuff is regular up in Ohio.   A lot of places that are the bees knees, there are suburban neighborhoods you can get that same experience up there.   It's interesting how it's a conversation at all.

You are perfectly safe as a black female. I’m not going to lie to you and tell you that you DEFINITELY will not experience some backward ass ignorant individual because it’s entirely possible. However, from what I’ve seen, people tend to be more prejudice in theory but not directly to someone’s face, if that makes sense. Like, if you purchase land in a rural part of the state, you are not going to agree with most people’s politics (assuming you are progressive) but people are going to treat you with kindness. People in the western part of the state tend to have decent hospitality.

910,"Sure but that’s a different problem. You’re 100% right that the “public square” no longer exists, and what was the new public square (the free and open internet) was privatized by social media companies. In other words, they’ve privatized the commons in a fascinating example of e-primitive-accumulation lol. 

Well the problem lies in the concept of private property. Mainly the fact that society operates with a feudal conception of it (everyone is an individual producer that produces a finished commodity and which they control fully), while the reality of todays world is that all production has been socialized(outside of hold out artisans most everything is a result of a social production process). 

Thus social media companies have control over what is now our commons. Even though social media is by definition a social product

Frankly the only way out of this imo is nationalizing social media and placing it under public control. Of course given our “liberal democracy” (neither liberal nor democratic) this would be ripe for issues. That said, it would at least bring these platforms under federal law which means free speech would be mandatory. Of course this will never happen because the people that own(buy) our govt absolutely love the current situation where the commons are in private hands and can be completely controlled with absolutely no legal ramifications.

I think a ton of people reacted extremely poorly to trump getting banned from Twitter. Don’t get me wrong, I loathe the guy, but a fucking *president* got banned from social media. That is WILD.

I suspect that politics and business concerns played a bit into when they chose to deplatform him.  I suspect that they let him run rampant on their platform for so long despite breaking their TOS because when you have the President of the United States quite famously using your platform to communicate with his constituents, you don't look such an endorsement in the mouth, because it's good for business.  Much like how people will often mimic things that the president does such as styles of dress or hobbies (like Eisenhower and paint-by-number), which serves as a boon to those industries by virtue of the president's doing it.

That said, I suspect that the Twitter folks were probably tired of him by the end of his term, but politically, it wasn't a good time to do so.  They have a [world leaders policy](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/worldleaders2019) that gives presidents and prime ministers some level of special dispensation because of their positions, and I suspect that they would have deplatformed Trump after he left office regardless.
