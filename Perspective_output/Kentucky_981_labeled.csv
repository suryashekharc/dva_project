The people in control of the legislature just aren't willing to take the chance I guess. Now, I'm not saying this is the *sole* reason they keep shooting the issue down.

But when you allow the bills that the legislature votes on to be determined by one or two people this is what you get. Deadlocked issues that never get voted on and therefore the elected officials blocking the issue for vote never have to say if they voted for it or against it and why they voted the way the did.

They're killing the country because they're ignorant, greedy, assholes. EVERY piece of legislation republicans push through is almost always legislation restricting people, cutting benefits, or lining the pockets of their friends and/or even themselves. Republicans are corrupt and people need to wake the fuck up and start doing something about it. Just look on ANY social issue, republicans are ALWAYS the party advocating against it, always the last party to finally concede on it. It's been decades and republicans are STILL fighting against gay rights for fucks sake.

Republicans have made it a fucking mission to unbalance courts across the country, to shove through legislation on everything from restricting what books appear in libraries, what subjects teachers are allowed to teach, when/where someone can access birth control, and don't even get me started on the stupid fucking ""don't say gay"" legislation either. Republicans are obstructionists at their best, and holding the country back. At their worst, they're actively destroying this country by fucking up it's checks and balances, by introducing clear bias into places like the supreme court, and by supporting all this qanon bullshit. Wake the fuck up.

234,"I think that such situations are also in part complicated by making those assumptions and not debating the issue as either entirely itself, or its direct relationship to more fundamental concepts of rights and the role/limitations of state power. 

You're right that most people don't have eloquent beliefs and buy more into a piecemeal platform than a thoroughly thought out tree. But I believe the answer to dismantling this behemoth of partisanship isn't to speak that over everyone we disagree with on a topic. It's to build coalitions around issues. These walls that don't let us believe that people actually care about the issue prevents growth on the issue and makes extremist policy more likely, not the principled defense people think it presents

As absurd as I find most absolutist arguments, most of the things people care about are at least rooted in something worth substance. I disagree with Berg here, but I think she cares deeply about preserving the rights of women. That's something anyone supporting this bill should care about, too.

The reality is I think they do care about women's rights, but doing the same approach and thinking that pro-choice people don't care about the unborn they view as sacred, they turn all projection of things like Berg's stand into unjustified objections that pay no respect to the thing they hold important. 

They see bills like [what got introduced in Maryland](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2022RS/bills/sb/sb0669f.pdf) that prevent the investigation into the death by ""failure to act"" AKA neglect of any baby born as the intention. Rather than it being the extremist protection on the other end of people being so afraid of pro-lifers that they don't want women being prosecuted for abortions or miscarriages that have a viable fetus. That would be a terrible law, and it was proposed because we can't see each other as genuine. 

I don't think that was the intent of the bill, but this fear in each other will push things to extremes far beyond what should be reasonable measures.

273,">So what is wrong giving a woman the chance to live life on her terms

Nothing is wrong with giving her a chance to live life on her terms. That's not what anyone is arguing against. To your benefit, I do think that those in the pro-life camp do need to do a better job of expressing that and showing concern for the women involved. The same as we're having this conversation, I push back the same on those who fail to pay enough respect to the mother and her circumstances.

Your mom's situation sounds like a tough one. I certainly don't envy some of the tough choices I'm sure she made. That said, would she have made that choice if she had it? After all, wasn't abortion legal in the late 1970s and not a controversial issue per your early discussion? If she could go back now and do it all over again and not have you, would she? Who knows what that alternate life would have been like. Maybe it would have been better. It could also have been worse. Maybe your life gave her something to push for or some additional sense of meaning. 

It's easy to look back at the past and assume better choices could or would have been made, but most of the time, I'd argue they probably would just be different ones. I work with a lot of men in crisis situations and, on the other side of the coin, people more well off trying to get their finances in order. Most of the decisions I see made by both of these groups is part of larger pattern that doesn't change until something more core starts to shift. It's a trajectory rather than a single moment almost across the board. The people that do have isolated incidents? They're the quickest to rebound as long as they don't let it define them. The same with people who experience a sudden success like winning the lottery. If they live like they were, it'll all go away quicker than they realize. 

Obviously, I don't know your mom. I won't speak to her circumstances. Maybe she would have gone to school and had a completely different outcome. But the prescription of abortion also ignores that there are many other significant things that could have empowered her life in many other ways: legally, systemically, and socially.
 
There is a statistical path based on having children at certain points in your life, but it's certainly not deterministic. At the same time, we also live in the most prosperous era of existence when we have so much available for so little. Not that it's easy, but it's a relative examination. We have more support networks than ever previously. I personally donate heavily to a number of single mother programs that do some great work.

>shouldn't a abortions be allowed so that she may further her education, career, so that one day when she is ready, she can have a kid with much better options

It's  bit disingenuous to say that there are no other alternatives for women than to be pregnant, particularly when faced with something like a 15-week bill. There are contraceptives, there is choice in when and where we have sex, there is even this 15-week period before in which you can make a decision. In a case like violent rape, there's plan b and other immediate steps that can be taken. 

>Shouldn't she minimally be allowed to a ort if there is any danger to her life? 

Regardless of the period, even in third trimester, if the woman's life is in danger, that's within her power to make that decision. Again, the stance is they are equal in rights. If the child becomes a threat to her life, she has an equal right to take action to preserve it.  It's a shitty situation, but to do otherwise would be preferring the child.

>The world has enough humans, specially those dealt with odds against them

I'm not sure the potential for suffering is justification for not letting someone live. After all, why not then end the suffering of a poor 5 year old, or all of those starving in Africa whose lives will statistically NEVER know the comforts the poorest in our nation live under. The same life you're saying isn't good enough for someone. This is the same logic that's leading to horrendous policy like Iceland's, where they're ""eliminating"" down syndrome by simply killing any fetus with it. What does that say to the lives of those living with similar conditions, that their life wasn't worth it? 

Any level of this is a very dystopian view on suffering. That it's not allowed. That it's impossible to have a life worth living because it faces difficulty. We of course should look to minimize it, but with so much opportunity available in the world today, it feels almost like satire to say people shouldn't be able to given the chance to enjoy life. If our ancestors were able to celebrate life while the threat of literal starvation was a commonplace experience for the majority, what does it say that we worry about not being satisfied enough to live now?

An unacceptable amount. Lethal force should only be used in such a situation to stop an imminent threat. The collateral damage created by this indiscriminate attacks both create more enemies than they kill, and hurt so many innocent lives, it makes us just as bad or worse than the monsters we claim to fight. Politicians and military leaders should be in jail over it.

334,"As others have said, Run The Bluegrass is a really great race. It runs though some really nice farmland around the Keeneland area, and is a nice change up from running races though a city. It’s also full of hills and a lot of the course is up/down, and personally, it wrecked my right knee for a few weeks after. 

Also, the mini marathon in Louisville is really great as well. It is mostly flat and runs though downtown Louisville and the midway point is a trip into Churchill Downs to do a loop though the infield of the race track. I really enjoyed this race because the people of Louisville come out and cheer on the runners along the course and there is a nice festival at the end next to the water front. 

I believe both of these races are coming up pretty soon, so if you plan on racing in KY later this year, check out the Iron Horse half marathon in Midway, or the Bluegrass 10k around the 4th of July in Lexington.

They need to rid themselves of him while the program is at an all time high. They could get a very nice coach to replace him because the incumbent will love stepping on cal.

365,"I thank you for the well thought out and articulated point. Many people seem to only regurgitate the popular opinion of the friends, family, and news pundits. We can agree that a fetus is life. That's pretty undeniable. I can go so far to agree that if a baby is healthy and viable with no life threatening issues that it should be carried to term for at least adoption purposes. A scant very few  pro-choice people would disagree with this. But this is where we defer as far as I can tell. The rights of the mother (host) shouldn't be overridden by another human being. That's like saying (similar but yes definitely different) a squatter should be able to show up at my house without my approval and hang out in my basement till they get back on their feet.

Here is my own personal story, one that came to light last year not too long before I turned 44. I found out my Mom cheated on the the guy listed on my birth certificate. In other words, 23&me told me I had a different Dad than what I was led to believe. No one knew but her and my deceased granny. She was going to take that to her grave. My mother stayed with the birth certificate guy for almost five years before divorcing him. She would have likely divorced well before then if I hadn't came along. I started thinking about it a few months ago what it had to be like. I'm sure it wasn't easy and I see why she kept that a secret. Being the South in the late 70s and people are still assholes who look down on others for that these days. But what would have life been like for her had she aborted me? She had my five years older brother. She could have divorced the douche and had much better chances in life. It's not something we can know but there were better odds. As for me, I wouldn't have known anything better and even if I could have, I couldn't be upset someone wanted better for themselves and their five years old son. Now I'm stuck as a 44 year old guy who has a fairly decent live to outsiders but there is so much anguish with my family and the problems that we are afflicted with I won't get into. Simply, life is shitty and most of us aren't handed a silver spoon from the beginning nor have the capability/luck to get better. 

So what is wrong giving a woman the chance to live life on her terms? So that she isn't limited by an accident or a rape? Shouldn't she minimally be allowed to a ort if there is any danger to her life? shouldn't a abortions be allowed so that she may further her education, career, so that one day when she is ready, she can have a kid with much better options. What about the life of that unborn child who could have lived a better life but never made it cause the other one was force to be birthed? The world has enough humans, specially those dealt with odds against them. It's not my body nor should it be my choice, but I have two daughters, and it should absolutely be their choice. Perhaps it would have been the choice made had t mother would have made had she more education and society been more caring and far less judgemental. I wouldn't have cared cause I would have never known.",t2_2ngch2l,1hero4hire,0,1648005142.0,0,t1_i1r14bu,i1r14bu,False,prncpls_b4_prsnality,t3_ti38tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/comments/ti38tn/karen_berg_for_kentucky/,Karen Berg for Kentucky,/r/Kentucky/comments/ti38tn/karen_berg_for_kentucky/i1r14bu/,1,r/Kentucky,0,1,0.49983582,0.39952138,0.2775093,0.5389437,0.6537976,0.35876596,0.4083901

413,">how the evangelical leaders first agreed with Roe vs Wade in the 70s 

Some, particularly southern baptists, but part of the reason evangelical leaders began to push harder on this issue was because it did resonate with the base. It wasn't until we started to get the numbers on the increases in total abortions that people began to have reactions to its effects. It's hard for abortion to be a button issue for conservatives when abortions weren't commonplace previously. It was simultaneously coupled with a rejection of Jimmy Carter, and thus a shift over to the GOP.

>Why shouldn't we call a fetus a fetus instead of an emotional term used   
to make us regard a dependent clump of cells as a small human?

The concept of pro-life starts with the notion that all humans are equal in rights. The most fundamental part of that is defining human life and the limits of self-ownership. That includes protecting the rights of individuals when it isn't convenient or easy. The mentally ill or disabled, the injured, the sick, children, etc.

As you pointed out, compared to a fully grown adult, a newborn isn't that much different than a fetus, but yet there is almost universal views of that newborn as a full human. When you allow qualifiers to limit the rights of individuals, then that's something prime for abuse. We're not a century removed from sterilizing people we thought were dangerous to reproduce. Less than 2 from owning other individuals and affording them no rights. 

The point in making it a hard line that's consistent and left up to little interpretation is to remove that capability for abuse and distortion. It is to preserve the importance of the individual in all aspects of law. And that's something that's going to get even more fundamentally important as our society advances in technology and we start to deal with some bigger questions we can only begin to fathom now. The abortion debate is only the tip of the iceberg. It's just also one of the clearest points of conflict that has ramifications far outside of itself.

I say baby, because yeah, I view it as a life, A life that if left unimpeded by force or poor circumstance will continue to grow and be capable of so much. There is so much that we used to think about babies and their brains that we now know is wrong. We used to think they couldn't feel pain, when we now know they can. Fetuses learn and develop preferences to things like their mothers native tongue while still in the womb. The reality is we don't have the proper tools to really understand life at that point and how much brain activity or person really is there at that point. 

So as I put so much importance on all people being equal in rights, even though it is new, even though it is limited, it is still a human life and I put great hesitancy on our ability to determine what is going on just as so many times in the past we have judged others as less and stripped them of their rights because we saw them as inferior or incapable. A definition of life should be consistent for a fetus as it is for a fully grown adult. I care just as much for the woman involved and want to protect her rights as well.",t2_5se6k824,TraskFamilyLettuce,0,1647900197.0,0,t1_i1l3sr4,i1l3sr4,False,prncpls_b4_prsnality,t3_ti38tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/comments/ti38tn/karen_berg_for_kentucky/,Karen Berg for Kentucky,/r/Kentucky/comments/ti38tn/karen_berg_for_kentucky/i1l3sr4/,1,r/Kentucky,0,1,0.15340626,0.069403216,0.20925006,0.19538975,0.058795188,0.11976914,0.06406425

I agree it has a lot to do with where you’re staying and potentially even coming from if you can hit one on the way coming or going.  Some you do have to schedule so plan ahead.  I was able to sample all day and still drive safely then enjoyed my evening.  Barton’s was a surprisingly awesome tour.  Even let you try the fresh white dog.  Not sure if that’s still a thing post Covid though.  Going to add a few more from here onto my list for future trips.

OP, this is all really good advice. The only thing I’d adjust is I think Keeneland in Lexington is the more enjoyable horse track experience. Churchill is nice to say you’ve been where the Kentucky Derby races but I think is inferior in all other categories. It really depends on when you’re in Kentucky though, as they don’t have live racing year round at either.

That's takes me back to your first point, the rights of, as you say, an unborn child but I'm curious about the use of unborn child. If a fetus is an unborn child does that make all of us living humans undead corpses? Certain terms are used a lot to inspire emotion in people and specially terms like unborn child. While a fetus can be considered a life, it still isn't a child nor does it have any consciousness or independence. In fact babies show no sign of conscious using medical instruments until well after they are born.

In the Bardstown area my favorites are Heaven Hill “you do bourbon” tasting and bottling, Bardstown Bourbon Co, Maker’s Mark, and the Kentucky Cooperage in Lebanon (not a distillery, but the only barrel cooperage in the world open to the public for tours)

East of Louisville my favorites are Buffalo Trace (there’s a trick to booking it), Castle & Key, Four Roses, Wilderness Trail.

The Lexington distillery district is a must visit, basically a big party complex built around the original James Pepper distillery.

471,"You were saying that abortion wasn't an issue until evangelicals made it one. I was referring to standing up for the rights of the unborn as one of those smaller groups unable to speak for themselves. That isn't an argument against them.  

My point was simply that many major issues we take as baselines these day follow the same trajectory of not being even a part of the conversation to be unthinkable to not include. Saying abortion wasn't a major controversy until a period isn't an argument against it. 

Your timeline is way off though. Anti-abortion laws came heavy in the Victorian era. By 1910 abortion, except in cases to save the mother’s life—was a criminal procedure in every state except Kentucky, where the courts declared the procedure to be judicially illegal. The reason it became a button issue in the 1970s was because that's when Roe v Wade overturned existing laws. Before then, it has only been made legal in a few other states, so there wasn't a huge battle ground.

To be clear this does not mean that I think medical intervention of premature babies or fetuses is wrong. If someone is there to commit resources required to do it and it is not being done under duress, or threat of legal action, then go for it.

Again to put it bluntly, these undesired fetuses would be a drain on resources. Assuming we can agree that it is wrong to force a woman to gestate an unwanted fetus, because it is. 

We then must remove the fetus to grow in the lab environment. Who is to take on the medical and financial responsibility of this fetus? Who pays for those 36+ weeks? Society? This goes back to my previous statement it must equate to a greater quality of life for those involved, including the community at large. Forcing children into existence that are a resource burden on the community is very unwise.

512,"We don't make murder or theft illegal because they in themselves stop crime. It's primarily about laying out the individual rights. Effectiveness of law is a secondary purpose to the primary and deals more with how its enforced, implemented, or used to deter. 

A pro-life stance isn't denying a woman her right to autonomy or to make decisions for her body. The rights of both individuals would be equal. Meaning the woman is free to make whatever choices for herself and her care so long as they aren't done with the purpose of violating the equal rights of the child. 

In that she hasn't given up control of her body, particularly since the pregnancy is a result of a decision she made. If pregnancy was a happenstance occurring randomly or if you want to argue a case of rape, that would be very different circumstances, but in all other cases, you have a life under an equal rights for all humans system. Are you saying you'd support all third trimester abortions as well, regardless of viability?

None of that requires input on a base level for medical professionals. Again, when someone is alive isnt a scientific question. The input of professionals and those most affected by a law, women in this case, is more about what is the best way to deter unwanted pregnancies or help deter back alley abortions and support alternatives. But all of that in itself is separate from the legality of when state protections enter for a life.

Personally, I find it hard to argue that 15 weeks isn't a significant enough window to make such a decision. It does require some diligence about being aware of your potential to become pregnant and to process that decision, but when we are debating about a human life, that is a very significant decision to have to be made. 

Putting a relatively shorter window expresses that gravity and the importance placed on life. It's not something so short like a fetal heartbeat bill where many women have no cause to really suspect they're pregnant.

2 people like to act like the pro-life movement just mandates women to have babies but we don't. Pro-life just means we support 4 choices ( abstinence, controseptives, motherhood, adoption.) We just don't like the 5th one where people murder children.

3 just because people are poor (rich by every other country) doesn't mean you get to kill a baby.

4 let's teach both abstinence and sex ed in schools. If you like it or not abstinence is the only way that is a 100% way to not get pregnant. 

5 rape, incest, and the life of the mother being in danger make up less than 1% of abortions right now. I will offer an olive branch. We get rid of all the other abortions ( over 99% of them ) and just deal with cases of rape incest, and the life of the mother being in danger. What do you say?

533,"It's a lot of words because it's nuanced. This isn't a simple topic and Berg misses that. The point I'm making is that she has a line in which termination of the fetus isn't justifiable or that human life begins. She's using a scientific point to make her decision, but that line for her isn't any more or less justifiable than anyone else's. It's not science itself. 

The concern of overriding a woman's autonomy is extremely valid, but it's no more or less valid than the concern of overriding a baby's right to autonomy. Their right to simply exist. Making a line based on anything other than it's development is to state that human life is inherently unequal in rights. Because then you're arguing that the convenience of one dictates the rights or status of another.

None of that is in conflict with any other argument of self autonomy. The only ignorance is pretending your line in the sand is different than someone else's. Your entire perspective is dictating your morality on that life inside the mother. You FEEL the mother is more important. 

Otherwise, to establish a baseline that defines what life is and where rights begin is at least consistent beyond individual circumstance. If you want to put it at a heartbeat. If you want to out it at brain activity. If you want to put it at feeling pain. If you want to put it at 2 years old and some level of higher thinking. Whatever that is, it is a choice, but deciding the rights based on the life's development is the most important thing in itself. 

If they're doing that, they're pretty consistent. If you're stating life begins at 23 weeks and supporting abortion before that, you're consistent. If they're choosing to preference the child's rights over the mother's then they're not.

It has no memories, no personality, and most importantly it offers no contribution to society. Why is that last part important? Because we all gauge our personal give a fucks based on that.

623,"So, after [reading the bill](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/22RS/sb321.html) and watching this, it's just another reminder why everyone is so entrenched in their camps. People caring about important things, but just talking past each other. 

Obviously, Berg has medical knowledge, but none of the scientific points she brings up determine what a human life is or isn't from a scientific definition, nor is the bill dependent upon it. They may be factors in what people use as a baseline, but in the end, it's a philosophical decision, just as all recognition of rights and legal status are as well. I'm just going to assume external viability is the point Berg has personally chosen based on her own beliefs. That's no more or less principled than someone believing it begins at conception or any other point along the gestational period. 

Acting as if people don't care about the women is just as easy as saying people don't care about the baby. I doubt either are true in 99% of the cases. The reality is this isn't an easy answer. Yes, making abortions harder to get will mean some women will decide to risk home procedures, but if you thought this was protecting a human life, wouldn't you still draw that line the same as you would draw the line at any other form of murder? And of course if you don't think it's a life, this is a huge encroachment that's putting undue burden on individuals and invading their autonomy. Why wouldn't you fight every inch?

The only disservice here is acting like each position isn't solely founded on personal beliefs. Whatever justification you have for that belief, it's still a belief, not a fact. The more we treat people like something intangible is so indefensible or worth questioning, the more desperate and bad policy will get enacted. It's simultaneously some of the most fundamentally important policies we have, as the limitations of self-ownership and the right to exist are cornerstones to all other policy, and the most difficult time to define it, as there is no point in which two lives are more intertwined.

636,"He didn't say it gives the executive branch ""more power."" He implied that this is brand new, and that the president didn't already have this power at all. Here's the exact quote from Twitter:

""This was slipped into the Russian sanctions bill on pages 19,20,21. It gives the President broad authority to sanction virtually anyone, anywhere in the world, whether they are connected to Russia or not.

Interventionists at the State Department are doing the happy dance now.""

The reason it's not standalone is because it's a minor amendment. These are always attached to larger bills because something so insignificant can't make it to the floor on its own. If it's attached to an unrelated bill, then it's considered a rider.

In this case, since the Magnitsky Act that this amends was specifically intended to punish Russia, and the section as a whole was already present, this is not a rider.

I know what you’re probably thinking, who reads anymore because it’s so old fashioned.  Why would anyone choose to spend their time reading information, words, arranged, punctuated, T’s crossed, dotted lowercase j’s, grouped into paragraphs nice and neat, and concise?  More importantly, direct, simple, and to the point as a means to maintain the attention spans of the ever growing masses of limp noodled microwave baking Mcnugget meal thinking thoughts like  Nordstrom’s Rack has better sales than Nostradamus, so who’s the intellectual that people suggest he was supposed to be am I right?

For one it was just an instinctual reaction to muck up the thread of people engaged so earnestly in discussions of politics, because some twat dressed in human clothes and a bow tie decides that he’s been extremely selfish hogging himself from so many people that desperately have been waiting a lifetime for the moment to burn their vote on his name.   Now his life, which thus far hasn’t had enough of himself, splattered on the backs of many innocent murdered trees so that people like you can learn in ways other than reading like ignorant people still do these days.I can only imagine the 3 dozen years give or take his life has been committed to changing the world for the better, for the common reality television jello molds jiggling there and back again just to vote for this hobbit committed to be what the world has been unfairly sheltered from, until now, a man of his stature, fixing our problems one vineyard vines Labor Day sale bow tie at a time, not for me, or you my sweet sweet toasted mountain oyster, and not for the bacon strips he seeks to tower over all the better to shower with as much of him he can spare while figuring out the best ways to appear as much like someone doing a job for the people and not just another self indulgent thieving shit stain nepotistic knee high dunkaroo benefiting from things like grammarly so no one knows they’re dumb as rocks but don’t have the stones to be honest, or serve the people, or just wear a god damn tie.  It worked for Uncle Joe, of course he doesn’t know how it got on his neck, or who tied it for him, or how to spell the words he fumbles in the hogshit speeches some donkey typed straight into grammarly moments before he was pushed up to the podium by the real dipshits running this country in the direction it’s mostly been heading for quite some time now, the end.  Oh, I know I said Biden didn’t win the election.  That was an honest mistake.  I meant the votes for all the candidates, when all collected, and counted, and before being adjusted by those who determined who would be awarded the presidency, which in your world means the “winner,” would not have been Uncle Joe.  Seriously, I apologize for the mistake.  I don’t support Trump, or Biden, or Shrek in the bowtie, I don’t support politicians.  Politics are almost as much of a joke as all the words you just finished reading because I told you to.  Cheers you paragraph police enforcer.  You stopped reading long before I started typing, right about the same time you forgot how to partake in the process of thinking your own thoughts just because you thought you should.

683,"""Taxation is theft"" is an extension of the NAP ideology stated above. To collect taxes the gov has to use force. It's not a voluntary exchange. Don't pay your taxes and eventually your property will be seized and you will be locked in a cage. The libertarian argument is that taxes should be voluntary. You know best what is needed in your community, not a politician. You would spend your money much more efficiently and apply to better areas this have a better outcome and results.

You say you like having all those things. If there were no taxes, would you be willing to voluntarily pay for those services along with your neighborhood? Now you will likely reply with, ""oh but that would be expensive"". My and the libertarian argument would then be that it would be much LESS expensive than gov acting as middle man having extensive waste and corruption, not to mention the fact that gov operating a monopoly eliminates competition in these arenas which would also drive down prices.

Do you think gov builds roads? No. They simply hire private firms to do the work. I work in surveying, so I've done this work before. Does the gov build schools? Again no. They hire private firms and contractors to do the work. These projects work on a bid system and projects are issued at arguably much higher than market rate would be otherwise. It makes the firms and the politicians very happy 😉. Fire departments in rural areas are mostly volunteer already and operate fine. Police could absolutely be privatized and that would solve the brutality epidemic. Right now police have qualified immunity and there is no recourse. Make the system private and all of a sudden one bad apple gives the department a bad reputation and then they lose the trust and funding of the community they are suppose to protect. That officer is GONE. Gov and taxes perpetuate this corrupt police system of protecting their own.

The real reason is that he's a Russian tool, who *consistently* votes in favor of russian interests. He was literally the only person in congress who voted against refusing to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. I don't know if he has hidden business interests in Russia or if he's just a Russian fanboy, but he has Moscow's interests at heart more than Kentucky's. 

I vote against him every time and will as long as this dipshit remains in office.

- Taxation is Theft
- End corporate welfare
- End the federal reserve and return to sound money

Massie represents Oldham (#2), Campbell (#3), Boone (#7), Kenton (#8), Shelby (#16) counties which are all top 20 by per capita college degrees.

If we want to make a stand on those issues, then we should at least try to be consistent and focus on better building US infrastructure and energy independence.  This bill does none of that.

That might seem overly pedantic, but it's also a point worth making, particularly when he has stated long term goals of removing our reliance on places like Saudi Arabia and to quit funding their wars.

Edit: He also posted this that I missed. Says, ""[The bill] gives the President broad authority to sanction virtually anyone, anywhere in the world, whether they are connected to Russia or not."" He's a big stickler for riders like this that he either wants better language or limitations on. That's sorta the whole point of debate on these bills and the lack of it is how atrocities like the Patriot Act expanded so many powers that had nothing to do with the War on Terror. https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1504562598615863303",t2_5se6k824,TraskFamilyLettuce,0,1647630643.0,0,t1_i16uicf,i16uicf,False,sillychillly,t3_thbpar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/comments/thbpar/thomas_massie_wants_to_trade_with_russia_like/,Thomas Massie Wants To Trade With Russia Like Nothing Has Happened,/r/Kentucky/comments/thbpar/thomas_massie_wants_to_trade_with_russia_like/i16uicf/,14,r/Kentucky,0,14,0.2412265,0.061159547,0.07194152,0.3314082,0.058388017,0.08479154,0.032965634

950,"He never makes adjustments and gets out coached in almost all big games. His subbing patterns are questionable at best. Toppin was playing way better than Brooks, but yet Brooks stays in the game while Toppin sits. Totally unacceptable, where are the assistant coaches telling Cal to get Toppin back in the game. What an embarrassing look for Cal and the program. 

How many times does Cal have to fall on his face with the non calling of TO’s at the end of games. Call the TO, get organized, and have a play versus a man and zone defense. 10 million a year to scream go, go, go the whole game.

Did they even scout this team? Have a shoot around? The lack of attention to these small areas has been worrisome for years. Same old shitty plays year in and year out, man to man defense no matter what, lobbing the ball to the corner on all underneath out of bounds plays is terrible, giving up at least 1-2 buckets a game on underneath out of bounds plays is brutal coaching, and for this particular game - looking like an elementary school team who has never seen a 3-2 match up zone is the icing on the cake. 

Up 6 and then just completely fold and turn the ball over 2 straight possessions and shoot a shot as the shot clock was running down is horrendous. I mean the list goes on and on from game to game. The man is clearly in over his head and out of touch with the way the game is being played. These are basic things I mentioned. 

Also, before anyone comes at me with some BS about how Cal didn’t shoot the free throws or some other shit, anyone who knows anything about basketball knows Cal is a terrible bench coach.
