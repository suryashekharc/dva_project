1,"I‚Äôm 55. I have shadowy memories of rooting for the Friars with my mom back in the early 70s. Ernie D., Barnes, Hassett, Stacom, those were the originals for me. 
I was able to fully appreciate the Pitino years where we got back to the Final Four once again with Billy D, Delray and Pop. 
Since then there have been other great players and runs, most memorable being the 96 team with Murdock, Shammgod and Croshere. That year it really felt like it could happen. 
The years go by and I know how hard it is for a small school like Providence to attract talent, build a program and then make it to the tournament. We are not Duke, or Kansas or any of the big schools that dance every year. 
That‚Äôs why when we have a shot like we did this year it‚Äôs so special and appreciated. 
And why it hurts so hard when it comes to an end. 

My son took his life in 2020. Two weeks before starting college. We went to a few Friars games as he was growing up and we would hope for the best every year for them. We knew the odds were long but that didn‚Äôt sway us from hoping every year together. I was thinking of how much joy he would have had this season. It made me smile a little to imagine it. 

I watch the games alone now and hope for the future is hard to hold onto in general never mind for my Friars. But I can thank PC for letting me feel hope for a little while this season once again.",t2_fjs5n,Wolvercote,0,1648289671.0,0,t1_i26drvf,i26drvf,True,mkmck,t3_toez31,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/toez31/nice_run_friars/,Nice run Friars!,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/toez31/nice_run_friars/i26drvf/,3,r/RhodeIsland,0,3,0.036613766,0.013031387,0.016827893,0.016136855,0.01550348,0.041708633,0.028953327

Again, there are faster and easier ways to do so than that ‚Ä¶

Also, isn‚Äôt this part of the article actually contradictory to your implication:

>‚ÄùConley said it‚Äôs hypocritical for Langevin to criticize economic espionage by the Chinese government, as he did in 2018, while profiting from holdings in Chinese companies like Alibaba and Huay.‚Äù

If he were making significant money by investing in Chinese tech stocks, why would he publicly accuse the Chinese of industrial espionage, which could drive the value of those stocks *down* ‚Ä¶?

The charge he‚Äôs more susceptible to from the article is that of insider trading ‚Äî which actually supports your earlier point, but you haven‚Äôt made it here.

281,">The cognitive dissonance required to simultaneously believe that the state is inherently violent, oppressive, and racist and also that the state's agents of violence should have a a monopoly on access to firearms is absolutely bizarre.

What?! My argument is not at all about what the state *thinks, perceives,* or how the state *explains, rationalizes, or pursues* action. My question does not require the state's perspective at all. The reason it does not is because ""the state's"" perspective is almost entirely impossible to determine, especially on domestic issues, because the states positions is not clearly, consensually, and consistently articulated. It makes for a shitty research question because there IS NO single thing that the state ""sees"" or ""does."" To say it again: The state's ""opinion"" or ""justification"" or ""rationale"" for anything does not matter here at all.   


OK, I am really not making myself clear here. One more try because I really would love to see this data (but Im starting to get a sinking feeling that it does not exist in the way you described)

I gave my personal opinions and ideas just to try to show you that I am not arguing with you. Forget I even said anything about myself.

I want data that shows ""minorities with guns are harder to oppress than minorities with guns.""

Forget about my opinions. Forget about the state's motives. Forget that ideas of racism or anything even enter into this at all.

Just can you show me research that demonstrates that black people with guns somehow face ""less oppression"" (however you/they want to operationalize that) than black people without guns. IN fact, this doesn't even need to be about black people and it doesn't even need to exist take place in the US!

&#x200B;

In other words, imagine that *I* am not the one that needs convincing. Imagine that you are trying to convince, say, a US Senator who is totally in favor of banning all guns, period.

That Senator says: We should have no guns whatsoever in the US.

and then you say: but we do want certain populations to have guns because we know they are better able to resist oppression when they are arms.

And the Senator says: OK, can you show me evidence that minorities with guns are better able to resist oppression than minorities without them?

This evidence *should not include* any rationales or reasons or whatever. **All it needs to show is that oppression means X. and that black people with guns are better at avoiding X then black people without them.**",t2_kuhme8lr,GendunGramsci,0,1648173849.0,0,t1_i20htow,i20htow,False,GendunGramsci,t3_tklhe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tklhe0/gun_ownership_by_state_i_thought_we_had_won_but/,Gun Ownership by State - I thought we had won but then saw that Delaware had snuck in under us.,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tklhe0/gun_ownership_by_state_i_thought_we_had_won_but/i20htow/,1,r/RhodeIsland,0,1,0.55280167,0.4542469,0.7375384,0.6213733,0.66938287,0.42439038,0.13974135

I hear what you are saying about short term rentals but why not allow the party bikes?

RI is a joke when it comes to tourism.

For the most part there is nothing to attract tourists aside from Newport. 

All of south county is pretty much no man's land.

No hotels aside from run down motels, no boardwalks, few restaurants,  no attractions.  

There is a lot of wasted potential.

because even explicit statements are not necessarily proof: THE STATE COULD COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY ""it's easier to oppress black people that down own guns,"" but EVEN THIS would not make yours a scientifically valid claim.

But my issue is that while you bring up a lot of interesting/important data, none of them actually prove the point. 

If someone were to argue against your point, they could, very quickly, point to this: [https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/) Let's assume it's true for the sake of the conversation.

486,"> Any advise on finding a house that are not long term contracts (I‚Äôm thinking 3-4 months)

You'll need luck but also I'd try contacting a bunch of realtors. You need to find a ""sublet"" situation where you find a match with another family juggling the same logistics of selling / buying. You temp rent the seller's house while their new buyer juggles *their* logistics? 

Then use airbnb to chink any gaps.

But could you leave the fam where they are and just move them up here when you've found a place? IOW: Would it be easier to sell your house, then find *them* a short term rental where they are, and meanwhile you move up here on your own for a bit? You'd have more choice / options here that way.

Even without your extra complexities, it's an insanely tight housing market in RI, rental or buying. Somewhere I read the vacancy rate here is 2%. And people are losing bids despite offering $20,000++ over asking price. People are buying in cash. They're waiving home inspections. It's nuts. 

The less pressured you are, and more able to take your time the better. If it's just you up here while looking, you could even stay in one of those long-term hotels.

look like native americans *according to whom?* 

can rocks also look like white people or black people or asians? or is it only native americans whose complexions are to be found in the natural world? 

If so, might this suggest that (those who participate in these naming practices might think that) native americans are somehow more primitive-less evolved, more natured-less nurtured, more base-less refined, more raw-less cultured than those people, like white europeans, whose faces don't as often appear in rocks? 

Because, clearly, you can't tell me that this dehumanizing binary of the sophisticated European and the primitive Native has not been a significant and violent ideology throughout history.

and i guess yes, call me a gun grabbing idiot because im like the majority of people in the world. 

but just let me know the next time you see firearms used by workers to prevent exploitation by the bourgeoisie and nobles. 

**Here's how you know I'm arguing in good faith (but doubt that you are**): If can show me that this has gun ownership and use have substantially improved the rights and conditions of workers (and other subaltern populations) I'd be happy to reconsider my position. If you cannot show me that gun ownership has led to substantial improvements in the rights and conditions of laborers - and thus, we could say that guns have not be used to achieve the goals that marx had set out for their use - then you will reconsider your position, right? 

As of right now, we could say the correlation does not seem to favor your argument, as many states with the highest gun ownership also appear to have to lowest protections for workers. 

But I eagerly await your evidence that gun ownership correlated with workers rights/conditions because I just love changing my mind when i learn new things.

Some cities, like NYC, have a city income tax. You pay it if you live or work in NYC.  If you now work remote from Westchester or Hoboken you don‚Äôt. 

>And yes, it is a fair and potentially concerning point that many businesses thrive on commuters contributing to them and sales taxes, but it isn‚Äôt necessarily proven that these places would suffer from that lack of commuters. 

It‚Äôs not potentially concerning. It‚Äôs happening.  There‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre seeing big cities push this harder than most companies. 

>We‚Äôve never had a lack of commuters (besides quarantine, in which there was a complete halt to the economy altogether). People would have additional free time and money from their lack of commute. To be fair, it‚Äôs only theoretical that they‚Äôd then go out and spend that extra income to keep those businesses going, but it‚Äôs also only theoretical that the businesses would suffer.

Sure, people have extra time and money.  But I have to imagine you‚Äôve never commuted before if this is your take. 

I‚Äôm not driving 40 minutes into Providence to get lunch ever. I might drive 15 mins up the street to grab lunch from a local place, but even the occasional work lunch in PVD is a far cry from 2-3 days / week when I commuted, or grabbing drinks after work once a week. Sure, I‚Äôll still drive in for a nice dinner, but much less frequently than it was before.

>I absolutely agree that there are concerns and potential consequences to the remote work shift, but to base an economy on something proven to be largely obsolete, or at least optional, seems like a pretty futile option. Economies need to adapt. If workers are forced to do something they don‚Äôt need to because the economy can‚Äôt properly adapt, then it seems like a broken system that needs to be repaired or replaced

I agree. You just seem to be under the impression that *capitalist elites* are going to be the ones to feel pain. They aren‚Äôt. Maybe one or two here or there, but that‚Äôs nothing compared to the millions of city residents who are going to face deterioration in services as revenues shrink faster than demand for service.  The economy has adapted to leaner, less labor intensive manufacturing. Detroit hasn‚Äôt, and GM shareholders aren‚Äôt the ones paying the price.",t2_16rodp,fishythepete,0,1648056361.0,0,t1_i1tjnj2,i1tjnj2,False,rhodyjourno,t3_tkctm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tkctm8/when_will_downtown_providence_recover_from_the/,When will downtown Providence recover from the pandemic? - The Boston Globe,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tkctm8/when_will_downtown_providence_recover_from_the/i1tjnj2/,1,r/RhodeIsland,0,1,0.109705634,0.035757717,0.047788847,0.11489124,0.039612994,0.050286673,0.04291206

653,"üôÑ.  You know who the single largest owner of real estate is in the US?  CALPERS, with a $51 billion portfolio. That‚Äôs the pension fund for CA government employees, in case the name doesn‚Äôt ring a bell.  Capitalists will find ways to make money whether a market goes up, down, or sideways.  You know who doesn‚Äôt have the same option?  Cities. 

I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúaltering their infrastructure around remote work‚Äù means, but here‚Äôs the reality. NYC gets 25% of its revenue from city income tax, the majority of it paid by commuters. The contribute a lot to sales tax receipts too. You know what commuters don‚Äôt use?  City schools, which are almost 30% of city expenditures. 

Here‚Äôs how that plays out.  The the city loses 10% of its revenue, and not only can‚Äôt reduce services (still as many kids in school) but still has pension obligations to service that don‚Äôt shrink relative to income either. Cities are slow to move, and they can‚Äôt easily cut costs when revenue gets hit. The residents who can afford to leave will be least affected. I‚Äôll leave it to you to figure out who is going to get hurt the most here, but it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcapitalists.‚Äù

671,"Waterfire in Providence is free and held periodically from later spring through Oct or so. If you're new to RI and don't know what Waterfire is, I'm sure there are YouTube videos. But no video or description could capture what experiencing a good one was like.

Prov will likely have its 2-3 day annual festival again this summer -- personally I haven't gone since the one with an official Central America theme, music, dancers. The one that had the team of ""dark romance"" stilt walkers (I think from France)? That festival was free and great, at least for the hours I went. But I've read subsequent years were less so, and during the pandemic the event was cancelled altogether at least one year.

Back in the good old days Thayer St used to have at least one a year where they closed the street to vehicles and had artisans and live music and performers. And RISD hosted the same on Benefit St spring and fall. They've held one on Wickendon in recent years but hasn't been as good. Maybe it'll get there ü§û

For just a whiff of festive atmosphere, the artisans + farmers market that's held every Saturday morning on Blackstone Blvd where it meets Hope in Prov is free and fun.

Loads of individual RI cities and towns have their own events, parades (notably Bristol's 4th of July parade); historical (Gaspee Days) / cultural; and music and art festivals, many free. They must be listed somewhere -- it's something the weekly Providence Phoenix (RIP üò¢) was handy for. 

Type ""art festival RI 2022"" into google, and do the same for music. Then try just ""festival RI 2022"".

714,"In 2020, a lot of people learned firsthand what normalcy bias is.  The thought that come April, then May, then July, then... whenever, that COVID would be over, and everything would go back to the way it was before.  Now, two years later, I think most individuals have adjusted to the new normal - it's time for cities and businesses to catch up.

Eric Adams and Jamie Dimon can talk about how a return to the office is necessary to keep NYC vibrant, to keep JP Morgan competitive, but the reality is that things aren't going back to the way they were before COVID.  I've been remote for about 11 years now.  It's a perk I've always valued highly - I've turned down opportunities that would pay 40% more but require me to commute daily.  Pre-COVID I would get into my office once or twice a month, and I was on the road 1 - 2 weeks / month.

Since COVID I've been into the office once and I have yet to travel for a client meeting.  Not because of any corporate direction, but because I've learned to operate effectively this way, and going back to the old way would be a big step backwards.

726,"FROM THE STORY: Rhode Island will receive more than $10.4 million to help local providers and community partners deliver affordable housing and supportive services to those experiencing homelessness.  
The federal funding, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through its Continuum of Care grants, will support 37 local homeless housing and service programs across the state. The funds will help both individuals and families, said U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, on Tuesday.  
Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, said the funds will be used to help launch new projects to create youth crisis and rapid rehousing programs, new services for people seeking Emergency Housing Vouchers, a permanent supportive housing project at the Rockville Mill, and a Coordinated Entry System project for survivors of domestic violence.

‚ÄúEnsuring every Rhode Islander has safe, private shelter and a stable place to call home is both an ambitious goal and a basic, core community commitment,‚Äù said Reed. ‚ÄúBut too many people can‚Äôt afford stable housing or have other issues that cause them to experience homelessness, in no small part due to the alarming shortage of affordable housing in our state and the lingering impact of the pandemic.‚Äù

728,"**FROM THE STORY:** On any given weekday in 2019, workers would flood out from their offices in the afternoon for lunch, snagging a table or to pick up take out. They‚Äôd beat traffic going home by meeting for after-work drinks that could easily turn to dinner in the city.  
On weekends, a new convention or sporting event might be in town, centrally-located hotels would be sold out, and there was a wait to get a table for any sit-down meal. Providence‚Äôs eclectic dining scene was always on the menu, and nightclubs like EGO and music venues like Dusk would have energetic lines wrapped around its buildings.

But, of course, the pandemic changed all of that.  
The trouble now, in an economic recovery period, is while leisure tourism is making its return, and business travel might not come back until at least 2024; Providence‚Äôs ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù could be reliant on office workers commuting again.

‚ÄúThe offices are the most problematic in coming back,‚Äù said Cliff Wood, the executive director of The Providence Foundation.  
According to a recent survey Wood conducted of the Foundation‚Äôs 150 members ‚Äî which include businesses from Bank of America to the Providence Preservation Society ‚Äî about one-third said they would not commit to returning to the office while another third were ‚Äúchomping at the bit to come back.‚Äù

The question of how to address these issues is a really good one. I hate the trash too, but what's the solution? Displacing the homeless seems needlessly cruel. Provide them with trash cans or a dumpster or something and other people (not the homeless you are trying to help) will throw their trash in there. Maybe the city could organize things better though.
