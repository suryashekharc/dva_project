If there's not enough water to go around, the most recent water permits get shut off first. So if there's not enough water to go around, you already don't get a right to use the water under your land.

This law mostly just clarifies the standard that should be used when there's a dispute over a new well. It could potentially prove to be pretty onerous to new water users, because they have to prove a negative. It's easier to prove that there will be harm from a new well then to prove that there definitely won't. So the state engineer will have to figure out some sort of reasonable standard.

They do offer more options for shopping and dining so if that’s what your looking for then it might be right up your ally. Granted the wind in Casper is hell on wheels.

I find anything in the northern half of the state more appealing. The forests are amazing especially if you want to do a lot of outdoor activities. 

You’re best bet would be to look at photos online of popular destinations and scenic byways. You’ll find a huge difference between the landscape on the southern and northern halves of the state

88,"I’d ask why you’re deciding to move here. What do you do for work? Are you retired? What kind of housing budget do you have?  What amenities do you want/need in the town that you live?  Have you visited in the winter before?

I’m not discouraging anyone from moving here, but it’s very different than almost every other state.  Most towns outside of Casper, Gillette, Cheyenne, Laramie, Sheridan, etc. are insanely small and don’t have much in the way of grocery stores, organized things to do, etc. If you love hunting or camping, Wyoming is great. If you want to be able to go clubbing or to the ballet, don’t move here. 

What you do for work also matters, as most of the economy is based around energy with some tourism. Do you work remotely? Great!  Otherwise it can be difficult to find well-paying jobs. 

Have you lived someplace with wintry weather?  Can you drive on ice? Are you planning to live in town or do you want to live in the country? If you live out of town, there might not be anyone to plow the roads (let alone your driveway). High winds make snowdrifts that can be over 7 feet tall, so you better be ready to dig yourself out of worst case scenarios. 

What are your politics? Wyoming is the most conservative state in the country, and while people are generally friendly, they’re likely going to be *very* Republican. 

It’s a lot to think about, but there are so many people who think they’d love living here because they visited Jackson Hole one time and think that’s the whole state.

129,"FISA is a talking point (half century old legislation) just because of Trump's election assistance from Russia. Guarantee 90% of Wyoming didn't know what FISA was before 2016. 

Federal Land Management reform in WY (half the land is federally administered) just means more privatization and selling it off to out of state billionaires that want more ranch land, coal mining companies to strip mine, and oil & gas leases. Turning our public lands over to the super wealthy just means more fences and gates, less places I can 4-wheel, hike, camp, and snowmobile. I've lived in quite a few states, and it's always the same rhetoric of ""Federal over-reach, we need to make it LOCAL"" and then it ends up being owned by someone rich rather than we the people. Whether it's a Ted Turner shithead wanting more ranch land, or some logging company out of Washington or Idaho. It's the same outcomes.

What does ""Focus on Deregulation in Federal Arena"" mean? [I went to their website and it's just 17 pages of ""gubernment and regulashunz BAD""](https://www.hagemanforwyoming.com/issues) and not actually explaining what specifically is the problem and why it should be reform. Having watched the last 40 years of Reaganomics sell off my country to their wealthy donors in the name of ""privatization,"" it kind of seems ""gubernment bad"" rhetoric is actually ""I want my incredibly wealthy buddies to own every piece of the country and turn it into a giant rent-seeking cash cow.""

""Second Amendment protections?"" WY is effectively a Constitutional Carry state. There's literally nothing Hageman will do to ""protect muh gunz"" when the last couple I bought new took about 13 minutes of paperwork combined at a gun store in Laramie, and I can open carry even without my permit.

I'll give that she's not party of the Cheney dynasty. Counter point: she's loudly endorsed by the Trump Klan, so that's not remotely any better. Astro-turfing still isn't actually a grassroots campaign, believe it or not.

You can point out that she's from here; she's also the most well funded candidate by, surprise, millions in out of state dollars. Both Dark Money and otherwise.

Oh and the other important campaign points: ""Securing our border from Biden's (non-existent) open border policy"" since ya know, in WY, I'm \*terrified\* of the imaginary Ecuadorian invasion caravans supposedly in Mexico. ""Keeping taxes low"" when WY doesn't have an income tax, and the average income here is $34k...meaning marginal taxes are \~$4k, far below the standard deduction of $12k, so the average worker is getting money back every year. More bullshit dog-whistling for the wealthy donor class that means nothing to us workers.

TL;DR - A sock puppet for the billionaire class dangling social (non) issues to convince workers to vote against their own economic interests. Nothing new to see here.

It’s not about students, it’s just about the lack of housing that’s not apartments built for students in town. Also while trulia lists plenty of rentals if you actually called the number listed on the one you shared you would see it’s a scam.

The half is a good race, but it's the ensuing celebration of the 4th of July that makes the race worth it.  Lander goes absolutely bonkers.  The race is followed by a parade down Main St celebrating the ""Pageant of the Old West"" with open containers of alcohol allowed throughout town.  Fireworks start at dawn and go well past midnight.  The local Rotary hosts a Buffalo BBQ in City Park after the parade with live music, and in the evening is the Old Timers Rodeo which is the world's oldest paid rodeo.

After seeing some of the subs you commented in and your comments, (I didn't need to see the post to get this gist) it doesn't really surprise me that you aren't fitting in among the locals of a very small and I'm guessing religious and conservative town.  

Especially in the ag industry, people tend to be a little old fashioned.  This is magnified in tiny towns like Lusk where everyone knows everyone else and thier business and proclivities.  Sometimes there is more to fitting in than who you voted for, or what party you belong to.

People in small, more relatively isolated communities are wary of new things, new people, potential change. People are also bitter about the prospect of an influx of people from ""elsewhere"", for numerous reasons.  People are set in their ways, their social groups, their perception of their communities, etc.  They're comfortable with the way things are and the people they know.

It's not a new social concept, nor is it likely to change any time soon.

333,"> You think the extraction industries gives 2 shits beyond how it impacts their bottom line?

Yes, because you cannot produce your product if you don't. Most are members of the local communities as well. They spend a lot more money than activist groups in pursuit of this as well.

I disagree. Like I said previously, environmental engineers are a hot commodity for a reason.

The Wyoming DEQ does a good job. You can read about what they do here. https://deq.wyoming.gov/

> Our entire state gov't has been captured by oil, gas, and coal...So if you think WY, with 2x the wells and less oversight is going to have less clean up costs than New Mexico, than I have a bridge to sell you.

Also, Wind, Solar, and Nuclear. You have to permit your waste. Permit your land useage, permit your air quality, permit your water quality, etc. 

If you don't, then you are shut down. 

I think you are just looking at bad things in the past and thinking that we have not learned from them and not understanding all the regulations that companies have to go through. 

There is a lot more that you can do at home than you can do at an industrial site. 

For example. 

You can throw away light bulbs into the trash at home, but at an industrial site you have to collect them and ship them off as universal waste. 

>That doesn't account for the coal companies flipping the bird to reclaimation to the tune of 1.8 billion

Mining companies have to take out bonds for reclamation. Not sure what the case was in New Mexico, but I do know that mining companies in the Trona Patch all have bonds that ensure they will reclaim the land once finished mining. Not sure if New Mexico was before this or not, like I said I am not familiar with the situation in New Mexico.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

373,"That's right. We'd still have dirty-faced children working 12 hour shifts six days a week at mines and little to no reclamation. Fortunately today the regulations for reclamation make sense. To this day the Abandoned Mine Lands find is helping clean up old messes. What a disaster!

It really depends on the regulations... bureaucrats holed up in DC can write regulations that work for one region, and make no sense for another region. I know some good regulators, and some dipshits that have their head in the weeds.

Yes, Republicans want to tamp down pollution regulations. Dirty coal ash ponds ready to spill into riverine waterways if there were a 100 year flood event. 

Thank God Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). [Shit has gotten better](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_major_U.S._environmental_and_occupational_health_regulation)

I'm sort of stuck working in the industry. Family, kids, mortgage... tried to get out. I'm happy though to say I have a part in putting the land back in great condition for wildlife and grazing. They have a tight rein on us for air, water, and land quality monitoring.

We should have began transitioning from coal a long time ago obviously. It sucks. 

Oh and sage grouse conservation practices are voluntary.  Hopefully a lot of companies and ranchers will continue to work together to help as much as possible.

450,"Your simple solutions solve exactly nothing if you're looking to stop or reduce abortions. If you simply want it illegal, sure, you can make it illegal, but you need only look at the war and drugs or prohibition for evidence that this often doesn't do much to stop it from happening, and can result in a rise in crime and general human suffering. 

Just make it illegal in Wyoming? Fine, people go elsewhere. The amount of abortions you actually prevent? Minimal.

Make it illegal everywhere? Unsafe surgery, rise in crime, dead young women. You might curb those abortions a bit, but at the cost of a lot of human suffering.

So yeah, I'm sorry you disagree that legal abortion should be available here, but I'm all for it. Last I checked, about one in four people in this state have liberal leanings (if the way we vote is any indication.) That's definitely a minority, also, that's not ""hardly anyone."" And I'm fairly confident that they would generally vote pro choice. 

Anyway, as I stated, if you're looking to make something illegal, fine, but don't expect that to be any kind of solution.

\#1: Why do you want to be a mod on [r/wyoming](https://www.reddit.com/r/wyoming/)?

I’d like to be a mod because I have nothing better to do and it would give my abysmal life meaning. 


\#2: Do you have any mod experience? (not required just good to know)

Yep. I’m a mod on the r/Casper sub. 

\#3: Tell us about yourself outside of Reddit. Where are you from / what are you into.

There’s life outside Reddit?!? /s 

I’m a parent. And I’m a musician. And I fancy myself an artist. I like to renovate old furniture and I’m learning all about various construction things while I work on my house. 

\#4: In general, how much are you on Reddit?

In general? A lot. Like daily. Multiple, so many times. 

\#5: Anything else we should know about? (ex: you live in a cave and are only on Reddit 3 days a year)

632,"Mentions engine ping as if they know what they're talking about...yet asks questions and makes statements that they would clearly know the answer to if they did, in fact, know what they're talking about.  Lol.

Simply put, engine tests and specifications are normally done/set at sea level (and under ideal circumstances, which is a whole other beast we can get into regarding fuel mileage tests and such, lol).  But there are tolerances, of course, and modern vehicles' computers have a wide range of adjustments they can and do make.

Once you hit certain elevations, the air is much thinner and the adjustments are  much more drastic.  (This is the reason why guys with custom tunes have to reflash/reprogram with they come up to, for example, Laramie \[7200 ft\] from a coastal town.  Also older carbureted vehicles often have to manually be adjusted.)

The different air/fuel ratios translate to less of an issue with engine ping/knock, and you can use a lower octane.  85 is quite common throughout the intermountain west (not just in Wyoming) for this reason.

Tldr; you've really just been pissing money down the drain, lol. (Unless you've got a sports car or older heavy duty truck that's more prone to ping.)

Because the air density is so low (even at max compression in your gas engine cylinder), you can use a lower octane gasoline because that fuel-air mixture is less susceptible to predetonation on compression

> Culture?

It's a bit of an adjustment, depending on the kind of community you're coming from, but several of the towns in the basin (particularly Cody, but also Powell, Thermop, Red Lodge which is a little ways up the road) have people who try to keep the events calendar full even in the winter, so that the rest of us don't go stir-crazy.  During the summer, I'm not a huge fan of the turista rodeo in Cody, but there's a lot of other stuff going on -- I used to go to powwows pretty regularly before the pandemic :/

In Cheyenne, Big Boy 4004 on static display in Holliday Park. 

Ames Monument between Cheyenne and Laramie is a big stone Pyramid built by railroad workers to honor the Ames brothers.

In Rawlins, the Wyoming Frontier Prison is cool, and also the Carbon County museum which has the shoes from the [Big Nose George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Nose_George) story.

In Point of Rocks, the mostly intact Overland Trail Stage Stop.

In Rock Springs, the Community Fine Arts Center has an original Norman Rockwell painting.

In Green River, the Sweetwater County Museum has the glass eyes from the Chinese New Years' dragon that was used in festivities by the Chinese that lived in Rock Springs. There's also a footbridge over the railyard that is cool to hang out and watch them switch railcars.

You could stop at Little America for $0.75 Ice cream. Its standard soft serve, but theres a novelty to it. 

Ft. Bridger has, well... Fort Bridger, a frontier fort along the Oregon Trail.

When you get into Utah, just after the port of entry, get off the interstate at the very next exit for Emory. It's a 2 lane on the other side of the canyon and is a far more interesting drive and you can get back on the interstate at the other end.

924,"In general, crime rates in Wyoming are pretty low, especially violent crimes. Property crimes have been on the rise, but still not bad. Drug and alcohol related crimes are higher here than the national average.

""Problems"" are completely subjective, so I'm not sure how to answer that unless you can be more specific. The State's been losing revenue but the legislature is reluctant to create new taxes, so government services are getting cut. In rural areas, internet access is slow and unreliable. Wyoming has high rates of drug/alcohol addiction and suicide. I would consider those things to be some of the biggest problems. 

In general, the job market is pretty good, but this obviously depends on your field and which town you live in. Wages have been climbing, but not keeping pace with cost of living, which I think is true everywhere. Unemployment rates are lower than the national average.

The school system is pretty good, but again it depends somewhat on where you live. We do have lower class sizes than most of the rest of the country. We also fund special education better than any other state.

There's lots of outdoorsy activities that are great for families: hiking, camping, fishing, etc. Yellowstone is a big destination of course. There are also local festivals and rodeos. 

Cost of housing is definitely a problem, but again it depends on where you live. I wouldn't even consider anything near Jackson because you probably can't afford it.

957,"\#1: Why do you want to be a mod on r/wyoming?

Being a mod here would be a good way to give back to the Wyoming and Reddit community. My time would be better spent here over Facebook groups because this sub can reach a broader audience. The Facebook groups I am in are very focused on specific locations of Wyoming and are private. I want to be involved in groups that provide positive experiences and help grow Wyoming.

\#2: Do you have any mod experience?

Mainly small forums on random WordPress sites. I am a mod of r/WyomingTechNetwork which doesn't really count at this time. This site was spawned out of the Wyoming Technology Coronavirus Coalition (WTCC) group as a way to keep Techies connected. We had a lot of people on Slack which eventually died out due to COVID burnout. (It would be nice to have an active network for those in Wyoming who are interested in technology through Reddit, Discord, here, etc.)

\#3: Tell us about yourself outside of Reddit.

I live near Cody. I operate my own business as an Electrical Engineer. I enjoy the typical Wyoming activities such as hunting, fishing, hiking, in addition to cars, airplanes, technology, and video games.

\#4: In general, how much are you on Reddit?

I lurk daily on Reddit. I do not post much, but when I do, I try for high quality content such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/lbyzw9/starlink_install_with_proper_surge_protection/).
