199,"It's even more complicated than that. Enforcement is lax to nonexistent at best due to the passage of the 2014 law, which states that Alabama doesn't license or regulate nonpublic schools, creating an interesting contradiction. The state superintendent seems to be the final say on what's enforced and to what extent, and [this is what we were last given](http://web.archive.org/web/20210224205502/https://www.alsde.edu/ofc/osp/Pages/faqs-all.aspx?navtext=FAQs). 

>Q: Are there any requirements for teachers at nonpublic schools? Could, for instance, someone with no high school diploma or equivalent legally teach in a non public school?

>A: The ALSDE is not authorized to license or regulate any private, nonpublic, or church school offering instruction in grades K-12 or any combination thereof.

Even then, this FAQ was not carried over when the ALSDE switched to their new website this school year, but the translation is all but saying that they can't enforce anything. Now, private schools are perfectly able to regulate themselves or volunteer information to the ALSDE, but that's not the same thing. Someone can even start a school and not register it at all and the ALSDE says they can't enforce anything.

How do I know all of this? I run a home-based private school, as defined under Alabama law, specifically as defined in §16-28-1. Because I'm a homeschool parent who doesn't participate in a church-run cover school or separate private school. 

And this is information that was given to me by the ALSDE as well as my district superintendent and confirmed again at the beginning of the current school year. (It's law I unfortunately often have to cite to parents and public school employees alike when predatory church schools and lobbying groups try to convince everyone that they can only legally homeschool by joining their church school– for a price.)",t2_9bvzo,JennJayBee,0,1648230721.0,0,t1_i23ctu9,i23ctu9,False,Careless-Yogurt-7871,t3_tmfnio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/tmfnio/are_alabama_universities_as_bad_as_the_schools/,Are Alabama universities as bad as the schools?,/r/Alabama/comments/tmfnio/are_alabama_universities_as_bad_as_the_schools/i23ctu9/,2,r/Alabama,0,2,0.09311853,0.032119773,0.20250647,0.07506404,0.02940261,0.06453535,0.018204225

It’s pretty vague but I can say downvotes aren’t proof of anyone being right. That’s just people agreeing or disagreeing. I disagree. Didn’t downvote. I would still be a die hard Republican but I was heavily libertarian as well as atheist. It became clear the democrats typically want to guarantee the rights we already have for all citizens. Not giving some more than others. I couldn’t argue against big gov and then turn around and not acknowledge my own party fighting tooth and nail for anything that can preserve their way of life as THE american way. I’m not someone who gets fussy over someone wanting to have the same rights I get. Especially when the argument against is said to have come from a religious text. 

Perhaps trying to keep same sex couples from legally getting married is a bit evil as well as a terrible waste of time but seeing the attempt and then working to guarantee everybody is entitled to those rights is not evil. It may get cringe sometimes. I’ll give you that. Look at who they must deal with though. I would get aggravated if my coworkers call me a drinker of baby blood on a good day and on a bad day they invited a goon squad in to work to cause chaos (smearing poop on walls and stealing useless things from desks) and possibly physical harm. If judging patriotism and seeing our countrymen as the enemy of christianity is your thing there is a canadian born senator in texas that loves to do all that and would probably love to hear that theory about downvotes being the result of facts being angrily co-signed.

Most people on this subreddit went to Alabama public schools, and they're the folks who are taking the time to patiently answer your questions while resisting the urge to correct your punctuation. Perhaps a better educated and enlightened environment would have taught you to take the time to research the specific schools you're interested in before making assumptions based on stereotypes.

In looking that up, you'd have found that Alabama had educated actual brain surgeons and rocket scientists. The doctor who performed surgery on President Clinton's knee (David P. Adkison)? He's a graduate of University of South Alabama, and Clinton seemed to like him just fine. The guy helping to pick the current US Supreme Court Justice nominee? That's former Senator Doug Jones, who graduated from the University of Alabama and Samford University. Maybe you're a conservative? Condoleezza Rice went to Miles College. And that's just to name a few. Alabama also famously has a college right next door to a NASA facility.

So yes, the colleges are good. Even some of the public K-12 schools are good. We're not all a bunch of uneducated bumpkins. Yes, some of our schools are pretty shitty, but then [so are some of the schools in other states](https://calmatters.org/commentary/2020/01/functional-illiteracy/), and they don't have decent banana pudding.

It's not even close to the highest inflation ever lmao. Where do you get this stuff. The Trump administration is responsible for a huge amount of that spending too.

Had to abide by the withdrawal deal that your boy Big Don locked us into. It was going to be a mess no matter who did it. At least Biden had the balls to go through with it and take ownership of it, despite the political hit he took.

>While I agree with you that they were different, the democrats in congress did everything they could to remove him from office. Constant investigations and impeachment trials. They didn't storm the capital physically but they did through legal means as much as they could.

The trouble being that there were legitimate reasons for those investigations and I have no problem with congress and a special investigator following up on those reasons. Just like how the investigations into Bill Clinton's lying to congress eventually led to his impeachment. Unlike Trump's,  those investigations were not impeded by the Democrats (it was heavily criticized) and were allowed to expand beyond the original allegation.

Also just like when the Republicans repeatedly investigated Hillary Clinton over her alleged mishandling of confidential information and her alleged involvement with Benghazi.  Those investigations took place in a very public manner, to the point that it became an obvious public platform to damage what the Republicans considered a political rival.  (Side note: Several high level officials of the Trump White House were caught mishandling confidential information and no Republican seemed upset with the breach.)

**Regardless, the investigations were important due to the public's need to hold politicians accountable even if it is the POTUS or a Secretary of State.**

When it comes to Trump, the investigation was a result of members of the Trump campaign being caught on tape speaking with Russian agents that were being monitored under a FISA warrant.  Sure the Democrats had a lot to gain politically, but the investigations were valid and should not have been hampered by Republicans looking to cover their own political future.

Anyway, to bring a longish comment to an end. We can't claim a necessary investigation into misdeeds caught on tape that produced some guilty convictions was strictly a hit job on Trump, without discounting the importance of accountability and how the process was used in the past to protect the public's interests with the Clinton's.

269,">In this instance, it's highly documented that Trump himself questioned the legitimacy of Obama's presidency. Trump went as far as demanding to see Obama's birth certificate.

The demands were there far before Trump brought it up in 2011.  Back in 2008 during the primaries they were asking for Obama's birth certificate.  It was the democrat voters asking for the birth certificate because they didn't want Obama beating Hillary in the primaries.  Trump is just a very loud person and was also priming himself for a White House run.  Republicans hated Obama so what better way to gain voters then to hate someone they hate.

304,">We're just calling out your blatant hypocrisy.

Hypocrisy? That word gets used a lot, but evidently the people who use it don't actually understand what that word means.

In this instance, it's highly documented that Trump himself questioned the legitimacy of Obama's presidency.  Trump went as far as demanding to see Obama's birth certificate.

When Trump was elected, there was no serious effort to stop his election from being certified nor was the Capital attacked.

Sure there were liberals that exclaimed ""not my president"" during Trump's presidency, but those liberals were private citizens not elected officials.  Also let's not forget that there were plenty of Alabamians claiming that Obama wasn't their president either.

Today we have right wingers acting out at Biden (let's not forget the ""Let's go Brandon"" silliness) just like they did with Obama, and I don't have a problem with them exercising their first amendment right.  Sure it makes them look just as silly as the liberals, but at least we all know who the idiots are.

As hard as Trump and his apologists try to play the victim, there is no getting around the fact that during the Obama presidency a Republican called him a liar in the middle of a state of the union address, and when Biden won the presidential election, the Republicans openly defied the results. Not only that, Trump organized a crowd outside the Capital to protest the election results and it winds up becoming an insurrection.

Today we are talking about an elected official from Alabama who questioned the legitimacy of the sitting president during a congressional hearing where the GOP minority committee invited him so that he can continue the rhetoric against the current SCOTUS nominee.

Anyway, the hypocrisy is with the folks trying to claim that it all began when Trump was disrespected when the facts point to Trump being the disrespectful guy first.",t2_fckzx,space_coder,0,1648215611.0,0,t1_i22avap,i22avap,False,smiles__,t3_tmhj53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/tmhj53/at_senate_hearing_for_judge_jackson_alabama/,"At Senate Hearing for Judge Jackson, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall refuses to say Joseph Biden is the 'duly elected and lawfully serving' President, can only say he is currently 'the President.'

I am not sure how they are outside the state. I can only compare public/private to those in Georgia.

We decided to send ours to a great public school and we are seeing great results in opportunities in post secondary education. Most of our 4-year institutions are excellent- but it depends on what one wants to pursue. i.e. Health care is offered at all of them, but University of South Alabama as well as UAB are highly regarded in that field.

You confused investigating foreign interference of an election with outright refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of a sitting president.

In fact, despite evidence that Trump benefited from the propaganda linked to Russian sources and a high probability that the Trump campaign at least encouraged the propaganda if not coordinated with the Russians.  The legitimacy of the election process and the accuracy of the votes counted were never questioned. (Actually Trump questioned the accuracy and legitimacy of the election despite the fact that he won, and of course no evidence supporting the vote count being changed was ever found - I suspect it was another case of Trump projecting his guilt onto others).

A lot of the westward expansion has still been another McDonald's, another Hardee's, a Guthrie's which is essentially another Goldfinger's. The only new things that seem to be staying are Metro Diner. Taziki's is OK, different and not terrible but as far as Greek food goes, isn't that great (mostly bland). Otherwise, that new-ish shopping center on 84 next to Flowers Hospital has mostly the same options as all the others. A third Rodeo's (which is pretty good, but not different), McDonald's, Hardees, etc. Which Which was something different, but they're a chain and they used to have several options that have dwindled to practically nothing, they lost everything from their menu that was any good.

Foster Fest is just a bunch of drunk rednecks roaming the street with crappy music and the most ungodly stench in the world outside of a papermill or yeast factory. That's ALL it is. If you never been and you're not a drinker and you don't like covers of southern rock songs, it's not worth going to.

And speaking of expansion, Dothan Pavilion on 231 has been around for 15+ years now or something and it's still 3/4 empty.

But apparently you haven't been around in awhile if you think decent restaurants can't stick around. We're expanding west, and there's currently about 15 new restaurants in one shopping center that have been there 5-10 years on average. 

Speaking on the job thing, I actually did work at Southeast Health (the biggest hospital in the area for anyone unaware) until I was disabled recently, so you're probably correct about that. 

There have been some definite quality of life improvements made here, especially in the past 10 years.

513,"The problem with Alabama public school system is how much emphasis is put on using private schools in any area that has a struggling public school. This includes Mobile Alabama, parts of Birmingham, parts of Montgomery, and hundreds of places in between. Areas like Homewood, Hoover, Vestavia, Mountainbrook all have implemented higher tax rates for property to accommodate a better school system. Another major factor is that they have figured out how to control the population of who attends the school (as bad as this may be) By eliminating buses in many of these areas. By doing that, you ensure that everyone pays the same tax rate to attend to that school, which then accomplishes the same goal as a private school.

515,"Even if it was the current lowest, still not worth living there.

It's a mini ""big city"" with city level traffic (as in number of drivers), but everyone still drives like it's Sunday in the sticks and they're the only person on the road. Way too much distracted driving, and way too slow. Alabama already ranks in the top 10 (usually top 5) worst drivers in the nation, and Dothan drivers are some of the worst within the state.

Beyond the traffic woes, there's not really anything to do. For a small metro sized city  or whatever, if you don't go to church, you have nothing to do and no social network. There's not even that many good restaurant options... there's 8 Waffle House locations within city limits. Rarely does a new or good restaurant stick around very long. If it's not one of the same 3 bland things, it fails. Though as a positive, not long ago they made some actually decent walking trails.

Dothan as far as jobs is equally crap. The city tries to wear too many hats and as a result, doesn't do any of them as well as they should. Commercial hub, medical hub, ag hub, travel hub. Unless you come from old money farming family, your job options are to work at the hospital or flip burgers, and that's pretty much it so if you can't become a doctor, well, better start the 100,000th lawncare or tree company because you don't want to flip burgers.

Dothan sucks ass, there's a reason it would rank low on the cost of living scale.

I’ve been seeing people talk about the 1% death rate since very early in the pandemic.  And it was *kind of* useful as a metric early on, before “1%” was nearly a million people in the US.  To talk about a million people who didn’t have to die as “1%,” while factually correct, is intentionally misleading and downplays the severity of the infection rates at various times.  It is an ignorant way to talk about the virus.  And it keeps people from taking it seriously enough to protect themselves and others. 

Now, all this other stuff about being triggered and vaccinated people spreading the virus, you said all that, not me.

650,"Dems are not going to win this year. I mean, I'll do my best to vote for the Dem nominee, but you have to realize two things... 

1) Democratic voters in this state are outnumbered 2:1, and there's not some niche group of Democrat voters that make up the difference. We haven't had that many liberals move here or conservatives move away or die from covid. That's a HUGE gap to fill, and they WILL show up to vote.

2) Doug Jones winning was the result of a very unique set of circumstances, the biggest factor being that the special election was literally the only race on the ballot. If you compare the results of [the 2016 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Alabama) to [the special election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Alabama), both sides actually lost voters, but about half of Republicans stayed home. There was no crossover voting or sudden boost in Democratic votes that pulled that off. Doug Jones won because GOP voters stayed home. Our midterms include a gubernatorial election, and there's no way in hell that Republican voters will sit out. They won't vote race by race, either. They'll fill in their Republican straight ticket box at the top and go home guilt-free, and that will all but guarantee a GOP win.

No amount of trying to get a bad Republican nominee for that race will make it ""easier"" for a Democrat to win, unless it's another special election.
