66,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The leader of the state veterans policy board is refusing to step down as he fights child pornography charges, creating another appointment headache for Gov. Tony Evers.

Prosecutors in Milwaukee charged Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs Board Chairman Curtis Schmitt Jr. on Jan. 23 with three felony counts of possession of child pornography. He has pleaded not guilty.

According to a criminal complaint, investigators discovered two photos and a video of child pornography had been uploaded to a Dropbox account associated with Schmitt’s email in December. Schmitt told police that he was addicted to adult pornography and sometimes received and downloaded child pornography.

A judge last month bound him over for trial. He’s due back in court Tuesday for a scheduling conference.

The veterans board works with the WDVA secretary to shape benefit programs for Wisconsin veterans by adopting administrative rules. It also approves resolutions and recommendations from state veterans organizations. The nine members serve four-year terms with no pay.

Evers appointed Schmitt to board in 2019. The state Senate confirmed Schmitt unanimously in October of that year.

The governor’s office said Thursday that administration officials sent Schmitt a letter the day after he was charged asking him to immediately resign “in the best interest” of the board. Schmitt and his representatives haven’t responded to the letter as well as subsequent attempts to contact them, according to the administration. WDVA’s website still listed him as board chairman as of Thursday.

Since the Senate confirmed Schmitt, the governor can’t simply rescind the appointment. According to state law, Evers could remove him for cause, defined as “inefficiency, neglect of duty, official misconduct or malfeasance in office.” But to start that process a taxpayer would have to file a complaint against Schmitt and the governor would have to hold a hearing.

Schmitt’s attorney, Christopher Hartley, didn’t respond to an email asking why Schmitt has decided to remain on the board. A home listing for Schmitt was disconnected Thursday.

Sen. Eric Wimberger, chairman of the Senate veterans committee, didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the situation. Wimberger was elected in 2020, more than a year after Schmitt was confirmed.

Schmitt’s refusal to quit comes as Evers has been working to remove conservative Fred Prehn off the state Department of Natural Resources board because Prehn’s term has expired.

Former Republican Gov. Scott Walker appointed Prehn in 2015. His term ended in May 2020. Evers appointed Sandra Naas to replace him but Prehn has refused to step down, arguing he doesn’t have to go until the Senate confirms Naas. The Republican-controlled body has made no moves toward a vote on her. As a result, conservatives maintain a majority on a key board that decides environmental and hunting regulations, much to the ire of Democrats and conservation organizations.

Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has sued to force Prehn out. The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case earlier this month and could issue a ruling any time.",t2_12hk7x,Bob_Ross_was_an_OG,0,1648253593.0,0,t1_i24uphp,i24uphp,False,HGpennypacker,t3_tnnxfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/tnnxfu/vets_chair_ignores_evers_demand_to_quit_over_porn/,Vets' chair ignores Evers' demand to quit over porn charges,/r/wisconsin/comments/tnnxfu/vets_chair_ignores_evers_demand_to_quit_over_porn/i24uphp/,9,r/wisconsin,0,9,0.16160136,0.075642765,0.09397526,0.13501145,0.046908587,0.116827585,0.46999928

For context, 100+ people showed up to the previous school board meeting to protest the coming school years mask requirements.

As a result of ""Mr. Your Rules Don't Matter"", the school board chose to hold their meetings virtually (WebEx) for several months.

167,"1) We don't know if Woodmans is selling it below cost or not, the two independent gas stations sueing them claim they are. Woodmans did not admit to selling it below cost, they admitted to price matching competitors.

2) Woodmans can buy a million gallons of gas in a week and have it shipped to their gas stations how they want. The government can not tell them they can only ship 20k gallons to the location being sued and they have to price as if they bought 20k gallons. They have the ability to price their fuel at all their stations based on the bulk purchase price of that fuel, not what they sent to that station.

3) Today's wholesale price of gas in NY (couldn't find the wholesale price for Wisconsin) is 3.17 a gallon.

Teachers are especially prone to attacks by people who are all bent out of shape on false narratives, especially in his subject specialty— social studies/history.

194,"Seems as though he is a pretty respected teacher, and that the likelihood that this is related to some sort of wrongdoing is quite low, as that typically results in swift termination, not to mention criminal charges, etc.

A few quotes from the comments on the online [petition](https://www.change.org/p/support-mr-chambers/c), which presently stands at 1,369 signatures (most of whom appear to come from people who found him to be their favorite teacher, and who said he stood up to authority, and the superintendent didn't like that):

""If Mark Chambers had actually done anything wrong such as say pursue an inappropriate affair with a student or fellow staff member like what the school district seems to have plenty of cases of, he would’ve been terminated immediately. This is just blatantly trying to get rid of someone who is rightfully questioning terrible leadership and doesn’t agree with immoral values.""

""He's the reason I'm a teacher today""

""I think my overall favorite part about him, and the reason why he's getting kicked out, is because he was one of the only teachers that stood up to the school board and tried to make like better for the students. He had the free-thinking mindset to determine that our situation was wrong, and he selflessly took it into his own hands to fix it. This man needs recognition, not the loss of his job. Removing him from the school would be detrimental to the students who admire him and cherish his methods of teaching.""

""Get rid of the Superintendant that holds grudges.""

""The administration’s long held vendetta against Mr. Chambers is only fueled by power hungry members in the higher-up that feel threatened by somebody who encourages students to question ideas and freely think. We have administration members who put no time into connections with the youth they are responsible for feeding an education too, and as a result see teachers such as Mr. Chambers put in over time so that these students can get something out of each day they come to school. Have you ever seen Jared Burke unforcedly at after school activities or events, creating connections with any students whatsoever? I certainly know I haven’t, but who knows, he’s probably too busy doing important “doctor stuff” while stealing money from truly impactful members of the staff due to a title. Maybe gives a few calls to the student government to convince them to buy stall doors because his paycheck took the funds for it. I’ve seen students who put no effort into school give 110% to this teacher because of his ability to relate to them and inspire new thought. If we were to start anywhere with how to improve this school district, Mr. Chambers is the last thing that needs to change.""",t2_rcrn1,youdubdub,0,1648232272.0,0,t1_i23gqck,i23gqck,True,LactoseTolerant535,t3_tnlsr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/tnlsr4/we_are_flabbergasted_community_searching_for/,'We are flabbergasted': Community searching for answers after school board doesn't renew teacher's contract,/r/wisconsin/comments/tnlsr4/we_are_flabbergasted_community_searching_for/i23gqck/,8,r/wisconsin,0,8,0.17795704,0.0659515,0.073895164,0.19124423,0.0646394,0.15759137,0.10414169

For example, my dad was a superintendent of a small district in northern Wisconsin and didn’t renew a teacher’s contract because she wasn’t a good fit for the high school and the academic program in which she taught and wasn’t putting in the work to provide a good program resulting in declining numbers of students enrolling in classes in that program. He chose to non-renew as he wanted to replace her but didn’t fire her as it would result in having to pay unemployment and would tarnish the teacher’s record, making finding employment at another district nearly impossible. The board made clear to her that non-renewal was inevitable so she chose to resign so she’d still have a good shot at getting another teaching job in the future.

My guess is this guy seriously butted heads with administration, meaning his principal and/or superintendent. And maybe he had some really good reasons. I’ve worked in a school and my husband is a teacher. Educators have to put up with so much bullshit, and often administrators get fixated on some very stupid things that just make extra work for teachers without making any real impact on students. 

But if this teacher didn’t have enough other teachers behind him, or support from his union if they have one, it’s not surprising they would just not renew him. And I have to wonder if maybe he didn’t have a lot of support from his colleagues on whatever the issue was?

If it was just lower than the other stations, no biggy, but it's below the price they paid for the product, which they have stated is true. The reason the profit of selling at different prices in different places doesn't apply is because the other gas stations aren't in that location.  They are trying to avoid a local monopoly.  It doesn't matter that overall they are making a profit if they are selling below cost at that location because the other stations at that location can't compete.

Your point about them being able to buy gas cheaper is exactly the point.  They CAN buy gas in bulk cheaper, sell it at below cost in one location without effecting their overall bottom line, put every other station in that location out of business due to lack of customers, raise prices there to whatever they want, and turn around and do that at the next location they feel like putting everyone out of business at so they are the only place in town.

272,"I am a former teacher, and the documentation system is not as cut and dry as you might think across all districts. The last (and final) school I worked in, the principal absolutely refused to document anything I might have done wrong. I was informed that I was to be up for non-renewal, and asked for what I did wrong, or if there was any way to change their minds. I was told by the superintendent ""no,"" and that I just wasn't a ""good fit."" I was then given the option to resign or face non-renewal. I found out after the fact that the principal didn't like me simply because I wasn't her top choice when they hired me. This came out during a hiring committee meeting, and someone in the meeting blabbed to me.

Without more information, it's hard to say what this situation looks like behind the scenes. They're *supposed* to have a process, but if admin/the superintendent don't care to follow it, they can just push a non-renewal to the board, no questions asked.

Words like ""flabbergasted"" aren't really a part of standard modern English. Their use implies that the speaker belongs to a linguistic / cultural subgroup, in this case represented by Cracker American Vernacular, which itself is a joking inversion of Africa American Vernacular, which once denigrated and ostracized, now finds greater currency in standard American English.

This specific linguistic example of the insularity and regressive nature of Richland Center occurs against a backdrop of a school system that has fired a popular and successful social studies teacher for having the audacity to attempt to enlighten and enlarge the awareness of his students. Literally his job description.

733,"The thing I constantly see with dissent on this is people who never read the actual bill. It's very short.

It says you can't discuss or instruct about it in a way that is inappropriate for them developmentally or mentally, as determined by state guidelines.

The rest is all about telling parents when things happen or are going to happen. Medical, mental health...etc.

A gay teacher saying ""that's my husband"" isn't going to warrant a lawsuit. Matter of factly state it, his name, and move on. 

A teacher saying they want to be called whatever they want to be called won't warrant lawsuits. It's not discussion, just their name.

A child with two dad's isn't going to warrant lawsuits. They're their parents, and that is perfectly appropriate for them at that age. ""That's great! I bet they love you very much! Who else has parents?"" How hard is that to say in response?

It's silly to be concerned about this. 

As a parent of a high schooler and kindergartner, I actually appreciated the bill for what it was. Kids Pre K-3rd don't need to be instructed about sexual anything nor anything gender related beyond how to use pronouns themselves. These are kids still learning how to read and write.

4th grade is typically when kids are introduced to very very generic sex Ed, mostly to just prefacetheir upcoming instruction on puberty.

If those topics do come up...let the parents handle them. There aren't universally accepted views on them, so leave it to the parents.

Beyond that? Yeah, I wanna know what's going on in school...and some course of action I can follow if I have a major issue with something.

Kornblum was appointed by Gov Evers to fill a vacancy a year ago, under state law she's required to run ASAP so the voters can have a say on her.

Lazar served in the Wisconsin Department of Justice under Attornies General J.B. Van Hollen and Brad Schimel, both Republicans, so we can assume more conservative beliefs.

It would make teaching ABOUT the history racism a mine field.

The ""don't say gay"" bills are very similar. No teacher is actively teaching 1st graders about gender identity and sexuality... but if a kid comes up to the teacher and asks ""why does Sally have two dads"" and goes home to tell their parents ""my teacher said some guys like other guys and that's ok"", this type of bill would allow that teacher to get in trouble for that.

778,"Though I don't disagree with your sentiment, I wanted to dissuade you from using the term ""culture war"" to describe issues regarding the rights of marginalized communities to exist and be visible.

Calling this a culture war issue glosses over the reality that the rights of LGBT people to be employed in certain professions are being curtailed by laws like this. Before Wisconsin passed the law banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gay people were coerced into pretending to be straight in the workplace. (As an aside, WI was the first state to have such a law!) Though gay people have protections now, those protections are more or less meaningless if one can be punished by merely *talking about* one's membership in a protected class.

It is like if we had laws against discrimination of people on the basis of race, but did not permit people to talk about what it is like to live as a member of that race if it is not white.

These issues aren't simply about ""culture."" They're about what kind of people are and are not permitted to speak about their experiences.

Don't people actually want their kids becoming informed about the people who will be in their lives, the stories the will hear, the things they will experience? Apparently not, but it makes no sense. In my vision, kids would have well planned introductions to a variety of people, including LGBTQi+, and it would be gradual, age appropriate, and unemotional. Of course, after school, the kids would go home for their parents version, whether early disinformation,  indoctrination, or not, to get their parent's take on things, and those kids might have  intelligent questions, comments, and  observations, etc, and this conversation is controlled entirely by the parent(s). Because, unfortunately, the alternative is learning about the people they see, hear about, even know, in hushed and shameful, secret and veiled, charged and daring,  conversations behind their parents backs, in school lavatories, or on the walk home with some rando neighborhood kid or worse yet, through unguided, and unopposed searches online? Wouldn't a parent want their child to be informed and prepared to encounter people different from themselves? Even if I disagree with what you might want your kid to learn, I'd think better of you if you took a considered and active part in shaping your child. I would hope you would choose to be giving them the knowledge to draw intelligent conclusions about sharing life on this planet with all kinds of people, not just the chosen few. I just cannot fathom parent's misplaced fear and loathing, coupled with wanting their children to be ignorant and ill-prepared for this world full of contradictions.

817,"Yeah man, I too appreciate a thoughtful exchange of ideas.
I went to college to be a cop.
By the time I graduated I knew that was a bad idea (being a cop - goes against my personal style).
I worked for the UW then 27 years in corrections as a Tech teacher.

Please let me take you back to the OP.
The OP was decrying the fact that 2nd cannabis possession crack is a felony (felony is an important detail).

Why, because a felony means you’ll deal with the state (not the county where you caught the case).
If you are found guilty of a felony you have two ways to go: paper (probation) or prison.

Even if you wind up in prison you will at the end of your sentence reach your MR (mandatory release date).
When you MR you are released from prison but in all likelihood you’ll have at least a year to do on state paper (you’ll have a PO overseeing the remainder of your time).

The only time you’ll be in county lock-up is if you violate while out on MR.

Huber (work release from a county jail) is only for people who are incarcerated for misdemeanors, not felonies.

What makes a felony a felony (among other things) is that a felony conviction means more than one year of incarceration as a sentence.

Going back to my original comment, cannabis bits are rarely seen in prison, maybe dealing, but in 27 years I never (even from “up nort hey”) saw anyone doing time for possession.

My SO still works for DOC.
I can’t mention her title but she is highly placed.
I asked her last night if she ever ran into a guy doing time for cannabis possession?
She’s worked in a Max, 2 Mediums, central office and a minimum and she concurred, she’s never seen a guy locked up for possession of weed.

If you get a felony conviction for possession you’ll be on paper (with a little luck) your entire bit.
Prison is too crowded for possession of weed charges.",t2_hizsxqdm,Rumpolephoreskin,0,1648148157.0,0,t1_i1yshp9,i1yshp9,False,Perfect_Ask1561,t3_tk5d6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/tk5d6u/what_is_up_with_wisconsin_charging_people/,What is up with Wisconsin charging people felonies for there 2nd possession charge of marijuana.

Gender is usually a sex based social structure. While most cultures use a gender binary, there are some that traditionally recognize third or even fourth genders such as the Hijra of India.

So, no. I don't think there should be LGBT+ lesson plans for children *per se*, I just think it shouldn't be banned from discussion outright, which is MUCH different from what I feel is the noble, but maligned goal of introducing age-appropriate LGBT+ education for children.
