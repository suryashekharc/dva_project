Five minutes from the Pinnacle shopping area, the Amp, etc. IMO, Bentonville and Rogers kind of blend together and Springdale and Fayetteville feel like they do their own thing, tho truly it’s all clustered together. 

I hate commutes, even short ones, and the drive from Fayetteville to Bentonville feels longer than it really is. And that’s coming from someone who has lived in Dallas and Seattle, so I get a long commute. It’s weird what you get used to so quickly. 

Ultimately I think you’ll feel safe in either spot, but might enjoy life more living in Fayetteville.

280,"The first episode of season 4 is scheduled to be released tomorrow, and I wanted to do a write up of the case because it’s personal to me, and to Little Rock! 

Ebby Steppach was a teenager from Little Rock, Arkansas. She vanished into thin air in October of 2015, and for three years, no one knew what had happened. That is, until May of 2018. Ebby’s remains were found underground in a storm drain, less than 100 ft from where her abandoned vehicle had been found a week after she was reported missing. The car had been found with Ebby’s belongings scattered everywhere, the keys still if the ignition, and the battery completely dead. 

The events leading up to Ebby’s disappearance are very suspicious. 
Just days before she was reported missing, Ebby had attended a party, presumably held by students at her new school, Central High. She had switched to public school for her senior year of high school. Ebby’s friends that have been interviewed have stated that Ebby was spending time with people they didn’t know. At this party, Ebby was raped, and it was filmed. What she remembers of the attack is described in text messages between she and one of her friends. She decided to tell her stepfather about the assault a couple of days later, and also said she wanted to go to the police. She asked him not to tell her mother yet, and that she wanted to report the assault first. However, before they could make the plans to meet up and go to the police station together, she stopped answering. Her family tried frantically to try and locate her for the next several hours, to no avail. The last person to hear from her was her older brother, who stated that she sounded strange, maybe under the influence of something. Ebby had answered one of his phone calls and said that she was in her car, and outside of his house. But when he went outside, neither Ebby or her car were there. 

I knew Ebby when we were kids, as we both grew up in the area. About a year ago, I sat down and made my first podcast, entirely dedicated to her case. It’s called Subterfuge in Chalamont Park. I’m so excited though to see a big name like Hell and Gone covering her case. I know Catherine Townsend is going to do a good job!

Ebby and her loved ones deserve justice, and her family especially deserves answers after all of the LRPD’s attempts to deny them closure.",t2_5jrwe68j,Celestial_Capricorn,0,1647998636.0,0,t1_i1qng5u,i1qng5u,True,Celestial_Capricorn,t3_tkijuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/tkijuc/ebby_steppachs_case_to_be_covered_in_season_4_of/,Ebby Steppach’s case to be covered in season 4 of Hell and Gone podcast,/r/Arkansas/comments/tkijuc/ebby_steppachs_case_to_be_covered_in_season_4_of/i1qng5u/,14,r/Arkansas,0,14,0.18589547,0.11451639,0.11860379,0.13557631,0.16631867,0.23847683,0.4611093

AFAIK, the only larger race in the state is the Little Rock marathon/half marathon, which had about 5000 runners this year.

Most of the Bentonville Half is in town, but the last part follows the Crystal Bridges trail system, which is quite scenic.  Crowd support is great.  Support/Aid Stations are solid.  Swag is definitely a little nicer than average, but I wouldn't say it's super unique.  Little Rock wins in the unique medal category.

Little Rock has a few museums and such worth seeing.  If you are not going direct to Mount Magazine, it might not be a bad idea to spend a night here and just check out some stuff, so you can maximize the hiking/views on next day.

Cedar Falls is a nice view and one of the more ""must do"" kind of things in the state park system.  From Petit Jean, take Highway 154 back toward Dardanelle, then you could drive up to Mount Nebo State Park (drive up is fairly steep with substantial switchbacks).

Quote Tim Cook in 2014 

> “When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don’t consider the bloody ROI,” Cook said, adding that the same sentiment applied to environmental and health and safety issues.
> He told Danhof that if he did not believe in climate change, he should sell his Apple shares. “If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock,” he said.
Cook’s comments and visible passion over the issue are one of the strongest signals yet of his commitment to reducing Apple’s environmental footprint. He told shareholders that he wanted to “leave the world better than we found it”.

699,"LOL,  Thanks. I'll totally take it.

Moved from Springdale when I was 4. Rogers is my town. I KNOW Benton and Washington county, and got lots of knowledge of Eureka and Huntsville.

I remember the Rogers population sign reading, like, 16k and it's now around 40k (if I remember right). I remember grape fields stretching from the Lowell exit to past Pleasant Grove.  (University owned and private owned that sold to Smuckers. I ate so many there that I never want a grape again.) 2 Lane roads without markings that are now 5 lanes. 

I learned to drive on a road that no longer exists, that went through the what is now Pinnacle Promanade (and crossed over the interstate in to what is now Embassy Suites and the offices next door). Horsebarn Road use to actually have a beautiful barn and horses that frolicked in the creek that now feed the pool at Cross Church.

There use to be a couple of those little road-side motels (in the truest since of the word) that were individual bungalows. One of which is now the parking lot for Walmart, Store 0001. (I happened to be shopping at store 1 the day of the 50th anniversary ceremony, so I attended that.) Met Mr Sam at the 2nd location of store 1 (same parking lot as the NHM that has the old HS picture).

The Walmart Home Office (main campus) is basically a single storey, except for a single tower with almost no windows. That's the old IT area. I remember going in the side door as it was being built, in 1989. My mom was dropping off, I think, her application because she started working at the Sample Store right after (now called the associates store). I later worked in the Sample Store building when it became a call center.

Bentonville had a bowling alley. I remember both locations, and attended a party at the 2nd one in Jr high. The drivers testing center is now the main fire station, just up 8th from the Home Office. The fair grounds were less that 100 yards away, instead of out by the airport.

The Kraft cheese plant was basically across the street from the Fairgrounds, but is now The Momentary. Head due East, past some houses and apartments, and there was the Foundry. Now it's a parking garage, the 8th Street Market, and an empty field next to J St.

All the car lots are on Moberly, but most of them use to be in south Rogers, on 8th St. Ran from New Hope to Laurel (stretch across from Daisy BB). Rainbow Curve was a whole lot more than just the fireworks stand. (so many people have just stared at me when giving directions that include Rainbow Curve)

I remember when Hudson Foods had to close because of a recall, and their offices are now a flea market. Hwy 102 is actually named Hudson Rd in Rogers, because of those offices. 

Village Inn use to be an antique and flea market. When they were bulldozing the land there, they discovered a cemetery...by bulldozing directly into a headstone.

I was stuck in traffic specifically due to President Bush was in town...Which you may ask? BOTH. - Backup to the interstate because Bush 1 was in town to award Mr Sam his medal. - Stuck on 102, trying to get to work, but W was at Beckart. Was 35 mins late and got in trouble.

Strouds Dept store didn't close until the late 90s. [Nearly positive they are in front of Strouds in the video, on the crowded street.] Downtown Rogers didn't use to be trendy. The Little Theater was a flea market, there was the discount bread store, and Poor Richard's (Applegate's) was still a soda fountain. 

Curiosity Book store was lovely (they had a cat too) but couldn't compete with Iron Horse. When they closed, one of their vintage couches was sold to Iron Horse. It was both comforting and heart-wrenching to see it sitting there, under the front window. Had one of my birthday get-togethers there. Place use to be filled with so many high schoolers and college kids...Til Emory basically ran us off, so he could attract a more trendy clientele.  It's never really been the same since, and the couch disappeared.
