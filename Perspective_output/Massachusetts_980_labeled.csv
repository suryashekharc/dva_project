Some hotels/motels/hosts may provide beach parking vouchers for discounts. 

As mentioned, Good Harbor is a nice beach on the North Shore of Massachusetts. Crane beach is another good beach in that area. Both have great amenities and parking fills up quickly.

Good Harbor does get undertow/rip tide from time to time - as can any beach. Just be mindful of posted warnings.

5,"Zelensky did have a choice - resign and let a Russian puppet take over. Best case scenario, Ukraine would be like Crimea, Moldova, or worst case like Donbas. Russia lets Ukrainians work in Russia and send wages home, it also trades with Ukraine. Or it did before they invaded. The idea is legitimate and shared by people in Donbas and Belarus - better not to rock the boat and leave in relative peace under a dictatorship, rather than fight and get instability. You can add that in some countries democracy isn't possible, and dictatorship offers a safer and more stable alternative - Saddam Hussein and Qadaffi are good examples. The food prices, jobs, killings, and safety all went to shit after they were removed. Both dictators raped women, but after they were gone lots more women were hurt than when they were in power. Russian puppet means status quo, Zelensky means getting invaded by Russia. What do you choose. However, this woman is a Republican and her GOP talking point bias leeches through this question. And nothing stops Russia from allying with Middle East countries to invade Israel, just to spite the US. They have nukes, but still a hybrid war could be waged where they lose some territory.

6,"Gray's Beach in Kingston has a playground and a little park right there. Not sure about the parking situation in the summer though because the lot is pretty small.  Not sure it's worth the trip from the Midwest though TBH

Also this will definitely not be a popular opinion on this sub, but growing up, my family used to go to Narragansett RI for a day or two during the summer. Roger Wheeler Beach is great for little little kids because there are breakwalls that dampen the waves. Scarborough Beach just up the road from there has some bigger waves. There's lots of great fresh seafood around because the Port of Galilee is right there. The water is also warmer than the Rockport area.

With that said, you seem to have written off the Cape, but anywhere on the coast in MA/RI is gonna be wicked busy during the summer. Once you bite the bullet and suffer through bridge traffic, it's not terrible here. The Cape is great (if not always the most affordable option), and the beach opportunities here are unmatched anywhere else. The beaches on the north side of the Cape are a little calmer with huge sand flats at low tide that my 3 y/o loves to race around on. The south side beaches are warmer and a little wavier. The east side beaches are pretty wild and probably better suited for families with older kids. There's also tons of great seafood on the Cape (Fishermen's View in Sandwich is awesome) and all the other kid-friendly summer goodies like candy shops, ice cream shops, mini-golf, etc. plus indoor activities like candlepin bowling, a pirate museum, and arcades in case it's rainy.",t2_12igrb,badinplaid19,0,1648282093.0,0,t1_i26592w,i26592w,True,mnwis20,t3_tohnlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tohnlr/best_beaches_for_littles/,Best beaches for littles,/r/massachusetts/comments/tohnlr/best_beaches_for_littles/i26592w/,1,r/massachusetts,0,1,0.099488385,0.034350224,0.111618005,0.060990557,0.039116696,0.1757174,0.036308777

So it's a private museum in the public library? Which is only open a few times a year? Who are these people?

It's a Chapter 11 bankruptcy per the article and acccording to [www.uscourts.gov](https://www.uscourts.gov) A case filed under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code is frequently referred to as a ""reorganization"" bankruptcy. Usually, the debtor remains ""in posession,"" has the powers and duties of a trustee, may  continue to operate its business, and may. withcourt approval, borrow new money.

So while I think your concerns about electricity sources for New England are valid in general, I don't see this bankruptcy affecting that. The plant needs to keep running to fulfill its contracts and to earn income.

133,"If you're driving 1,092 miles per month (13,109 per year is average according to the Federal Highway Administration) and you have a car getting 20MPG, that means that the gas tax is costing you **$13.10/mo**. If you're driving a car that gets a decent 30MPG, it's **$8.74/mo**.

Suspending the gas tax does basically nothing for people's budgets. It rewards people who pollute more by driving inefficient cars while punishing those who walk, bike, and take public transit who will have to make up the revenue shortfall with other taxes.

I understand that people are reliant on cars due to the way we've structured many things. Suspending the gas tax just doesn't offer much relief while removing much-needed funding.

It also sends a signal that people should continue investing in fuel-inefficient vehicles. It sends the message that if you buy something inefficient, the government will bail you out. Don't start thinking ""my next purchase should be an efficient 40-50MPG vehicle""; don't start thinking ""maybe we should build housing near public transit options so I won't have to drive as much."" It sends the message that people should keep doing what we've done for the past 10-20 years - buying larger and more fuel-inefficient vehicles and hoping for highways and parking to save us as we boil the planet and keep subsidizing drivers.

If we wanted to come up with a real, comprehensive relief plan to ease some of the current pain, I'd be up for that. If we wanted to say ""we'll suspend the gas tax during this crisis, but require that all roads are paid for by taxes/fees imposed on drivers phased in over the next 10 years (less than half of road costs are paid for by drivers currently) and pair it with expanded public transit, bike lanes, and transit-oriented housing development that cannot be delayed/challenged"" then I'd be ok. That's a comprehensive plan to move things forward. It tells drivers - we're going to be alleviating your pain, but we're also going to be preparing for a future where driving won't be as cheap. When you buy your next car, we've warned you not to buy a gas-guzzler and will take no pity on you in the future. When you make your future plans, know that we're trying to move things toward transit-oriented development and understand that might impact your commute.

In the absence of a comprehensive plan, offering a temporary alleviation of the pain doesn't move us in a good direction. It does the opposite. It tells drivers that they shouldn't worry about gas prices.",t2_f2ltz,commentsOnPizza,0,1648235994.0,0,t1_i23q0bd,i23q0bd,True,jgeorge20,t3_tnoc2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tnoc2y/ma_senate_rejects_bid_to_suspend_tax_lower_gas/,"MA Senate Rejects Bid to Suspend Tax, Lower Gas Prices",/r/massachusetts/comments/tnoc2y/ma_senate_rejects_bid_to_suspend_tax_lower_gas/i23q0bd/,4,r/massachusetts,0,4,0.11131512,0.03374263,0.033727057,0.11467905,0.075956665,0.044990838,0.028331228

High gas costs are sticker shock.  Here's the numbers (this is the closest I could get for per-capita gaosline use which is actually surprisingly difficult to find): 

 - Most popular car in America, the Ford F-150, gets 24Mpg
 - Average miles driven per person is 13,500/year or about 260/wk
 - That's just shy of 11 gallons per week.
 - Typical two adult drivers per household is 22 gallons.

24 cents works out to about 5 bucks per week for the house.

Honestly, even at nearly $5/gal gas is too cheap for what it costs, when all factors are considered.

208,"The assumption is a reduction in the tax would result in a reduction in prices at the pump. This is not necessarily correct though as gas companies would not be required to lower prices. For gas prices to drop at the pump gas companies, the same ones making record profits, would have to on their own decide to lower prices. They could do that now and still he profitable, yet they don't. Why would decreasing taxes motivate them differently?

Even if the gas tax was repealed, how would road maintenance be funded? The gas tax already only covers about 50% of the cost. Assuming we aren't stopping maintenance a repeal of the gas tax would further burden the broader tax base with the cost of maintenance.

I'm also in a group that can never give blood, but I understand that it isn't about me individually or something that is wrong with me.

528,"Not all gay men have unprotected sex. Gay men do have a higher prevalence of HIV in the United States, however, with the advancement of PrEP care those numbers have been dropping significantly. For the first time in the UK, heterosexual people have outpaced gay men for new HIV infection. When you're on PrEP, you have to have HIV/STD testing quarterly.

The questionnaire for donating blood hasn't been meaningfully changed in decades. If you are a man who has slept with men, you are automatically put into deferral. The questions don't ask if you've been using condoms. A straight person can be out raw dogging every night and still donate, but a man in a long term monogamous relationship with another man can't donate.

All blood is tested in batches, and the risk of infection from blood transfusion is estimated about 1:1,500,000. Countries who actually ask questions about sexual habits (i.e. 'do you engage in unprotected sex?') that target *risk behaviors* instead of lumping people in by sexuality, have reduced tainted blood donations by like 75%.

They are know the rules, they know the pay  they agreed to it in there bid. however they go and do this as a free money grab",t2_fq4nq890,Aggressive-Report-10,1,1648086082.0,0,t1_i1vld6u,i1vld6u,False,Aggressive-Report-10,t3_tlr1lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tlr1lw/thought_mgl_meant_something_tow_truck_companies/,"thought mgl meant something.... tow truck companies adding $140 storage ""yard"" fee",/r/massachusetts/comments/tlr1lw/thought_mgl_meant_something_tow_truck_companies/i1vld6u/,1,r/massachusetts,0,1,0.08705896,0.025508631,0.037016366,0.07403208,0.016723689,0.060281307,0.016768845

Maybe you also want to watch a movie, host your kid's birthday party, etc... the mall was convenient for a lot of people. But that convenience factor? I don't think its as apparent. It's not that its not convenient, it's that everything else has been able to catch up.

 Like, why would I ever go to an indoor mall if there are other businesses that are closer? Why would I go to eat in the food court if the Wendy's near me is closer? Or if I just wanted a great restaurant experience and I have some favorite spots already?

The only thing keeping malls alive today, when competing with online and bigbox retail, is a close enough set of residents. With enough people living close to a mall, the mall then becomes the most convenient thing. Otherwise, it's just a place to windowshop.",t2_fibli,cerberus6320,0,1648073484.0,0,t1_i1us9bi,i1us9bi,False,AxlCobainVedder,t3_tkxfwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tkxfwk/a_1970s_era_mall_somewhere_in_massachusetts/,"A 1970s era mall, somewhere in Massachusetts.",/r/massachusetts/comments/tkxfwk/a_1970s_era_mall_somewhere_in_massachusetts/i1us9bi/,4,r/massachusetts,0,4,0.049917642,0.011456958,0.01838298,0.02725981,0.014131313,0.026963133,0.014241439

“10 model years old and newer”. Being as 2022s are currently out it sounds like that means 2012 and newer are subject to the requirement, including my 2013…and I wouldn’t be exempt until 2024.

762,"I never said most states don’t put their capital geographically central, they do. I said this approach was less efficient for attracting workforce talent, particularly younger workers.

Most of these capital location decisions were made in the 1800s or 1700s when the communications and travel situations were completely different to the modern era. This approach is largely a relic of a bygone era, not a demonstration of inherently superior civic planning. For rural states or states with multiple major metros it makes sense, but for states with one major metro where most of the population lives it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense in 2022.

I agree that government should aim to represent all its constituents. But ultimately having Springfield be the capital of Illinois, for instance, is mostly symbolic. Chicago still dominates state politics because it’s where most of the population lives and where much of the work for the state gets done because it has the workforce for that work. Moving the MA capital wouldn’t do much other than similar symbolism, most people would still live in metro Boston and most state workers would remain there as well.",t2_aiudb,WinsingtonIII,0,1648069788.0,0,t1_i1uiylt,i1uiylt,False,leroy_twiggles,t3_tl5cgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tl5cgg/i_am_running_for_governor_of_massachusetts_and_i/,"I am running for Governor of Massachusetts, and I will run this state like every governor before me.",/r/massachusetts/comments/tl5cgg/i_am_running_for_governor_of_massachusetts_and_i/i1uiylt/,4,r/massachusetts,0,4,0.043709,0.013559402,0.021638988,0.031606324,0.013638354,0.024900658,0.01458696

Speaking in broad strokes, Northampton is possibly the most liberal town in one of the bluest states in the US. 

That said, there are no food trucks in Northampton and to be brutally honest, the downtown is dying a slow death. There is this one guy that owns half the town, including *all* the music venues. He is starving out the businesses with unrealistically high rents, and when the stores & restaurants fail, he leaves the spaces vacant rather than lowering the rates.

The music scene in Northampton is dead and gone. The aforementioned property hoarder treated visiting bands like dirt and gradually word got out. Nobody comes to Northampton any more except for a handful of classic rock tribute bands that just keep playing over and over. 

There are signs of life in new music venues in Greenfield, Easthampton and Holyoke, but it is taking some time to get bands to start coming to the 413 again. 

Northampton is cool to a certain degree, but it is way more expensive than most of the towns around it. Many young idealists move there for the reputation and then burn out after about 2 years because of the high cost of living and lack of good jobs. By the late 2010s, everyone I know that used to live in Noho fled south to Easthampton & Holyoke or North to Greenfield & Turner's Falls - especially those folks who were looking to buy a house.

Funny how the article and Mr. Cruz are quick to blame Massachusetts for prioritizing Unions rather than questing why the Unions themselves are mostly male and white. But if the state had not prioritized unions then Massachusetts would get the blame for being anti-union.

833,"I should caveat what I said. For states that are mostly rural anyways (like NH or many mountain west/plains states), I'm not sure it matters a huge amount because there isn't really a major population center in some of these states in the first place. I'll admit I haven't worked with a state like that which is rural in general. Geographic centrality might make sense for a largely rural state.

For NY, it's possible that Albany is a big enough metro area (1.1 million) that I could see it not really being a detriment to attracting talent in the way Holyoke would be. The Springfield metro area (where Holyoke is) is only around half the size of the Albany metro, it's quite small. Plus, as you said there are many NY state agencies with offices in NYC, which kind of demonstrates my point. They have to put state offices in NYC because that's where a lot of their workforce wants to live.

The main state I have worked with where I've seen this is Illinois. The capital is Springfield but all of the talent in the state is concentrated in the Chicagoland area. And they do have a difficult time convincing people to leave Chicago to work for them in Springfield, to the point that they just end up having Chicago state offices for much of the roles anyways. So sure, the capital is in Springfield, but half the work happens in Chicago anyways because that's where the workers want to live.

Realistically if you moved the MA state capital to central or western MA the same thing would happen. You aren't convincing the Boston metro state workforce to relocate en masse to Holyoke and you would have to keep a significant portion of state offices running out of Boston and the immediate surroundings because that's where the workforce is.",t2_aiudb,WinsingtonIII,0,1648065776.0,0,t1_i1u8han,i1u8han,False,leroy_twiggles,t3_tl5cgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tl5cgg/i_am_running_for_governor_of_massachusetts_and_i/,"I am running for Governor of Massachusetts, and I will run this state like every governor before me.",/r/massachusetts/comments/tl5cgg/i_am_running_for_governor_of_massachusetts_and_i/i1u8han/,7,r/massachusetts,0,7,0.044999342,0.010115981,0.02384875,0.022442093,0.01291969,0.028655162,0.013816878

It made sense in 1800 when it took forever to travel anywhere by horse, but with modern communications, the internet, and travel methods there's really not a great reason to locate state capitals geographically centrally as opposed to where most of the state's population actually lives.

I've worked in and around multiple state governments and locating your state government out in relatively unpopulated areas just results in it being extremely difficult to attract decent talent to staff that government (especially younger workers).

I know this is just going to result in some ""hurr durr government workers are stupid and lazy anyways so why does it matter?"" joke. But I've had personal experience working with multiple state governments and the ones who base their operations in major urban centers attract and retain significantly better workforce talent for running government operations and policy than the ones located out in relatively unpopulated areas.

976,"The GLX stations were all supposed to have limited-access boarding, i.e. faregates, but  the suits on Beacon Hill balked at that because we know they're beholden to the angry mobs in the sticks who complain about every public transit and cycling infrastructure project being ""wasted taxpayer money."" Thus, to lower the costs from roughly $3.5B to $2.3B and keep it going after it was already canceled twice (and should've been completed at least as far back as 2006 along with the rest of the Big Dig), the limited-access boarding was scrapped in favor of ""all-door boarding/validated"" system, along with new fare vending machines and fare gate tap systems at the existing stops.

All-door/validated boarding is just the latest shiny apple that the T doesn't need to pursue right now: if you're going to decriminalize fare evasion then **just do it**, but don't say that that this new system is actually going to *save* money when it's been proven worldwide that it actually *increases* fare evasion, and the only way to stop that is to put more Supervisors and/or officers at stations to do random checks, i.e. costing more money to recoup money. This is, of course, on top of the expense of changing out all the current vending machines and tap systems in the first place.

When you look at a line that's had all-door boarding for years--like the 111 bus at Haymarket, where Supervisors check fare validation on the rear doors of buses--the long-term solution shouldn't be more buses: it should be electrifying and building out the Newburyport/Rockport Commuter Rail Line such that there are shuttle trains every 10-15 minutes between North Station, Chelsea, **an added stop in Revere**, and on up to/from Lynn and Downtown Salem. Speaking of the intersectionality of the Commuter Rail and fare validation, the conductors were *supposed* to have portable fare validators **over 15 years ago**, when the T switched from the ""T Pass"" to the CharlieCard, such that people on the CR could use the same reloadable CharlieCard month-to-month instead of being issued a new plastic card every month, but, guess what, **it still hasn't happened**. 

Plus, with the fare gates, if the T wants to emulate *far* more advanced systems worldwide, instead of half-measures like tapping an oval instead of a rectangle, go with the cream of the crop (i.e. [Tokyo](https://youtu.be/PPCDkFWAcfQ)), where the gates remain *open* most the time and only close if you *don't* pay the fare as you pass through. That way there's *far* less maintenance since the gates aren't constantly opening and closing.",t2_8h50rgbs,therailmaster,0,1648051726.0,0,t1_i1t73nm,i1t73nm,False,wgbh_boston,t3_tkivke,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tkivke/32_years_in_the_making_the_mbta_finally_added_its/,"32 years in the making, the MBTA finally added its Green Line extension to Somerville's Union Square.
