You don't seem to advertise the wages? Thus I assume they are low and the ""perks"" of being in Alaska, or being in Denali or tips are probably talked about by the supervisor.

It looks like you have a lot of job openings, I bet if the work environment was better and the pay was better (seeing as cost of living is highly inflated) you may have an easier time hiring people.

My favorite ""well guess I live here now story"" was from this middle-aged woman I was talking to at I think a wedding or something, like over a decade ago. Her whole family was originally from Virginia or one of the Carolinas I think. On a whim, her brother decided to take a month-long vacation up here one summer. He wound up meeting someone, and moved up. He unfortunately died in an accident some years later, and his family came up here for his funeral. His brother wound up staying up here after the funeral. Move on another couple years, and the two sisters go up to visit the 2nd brother, and they both wind up staying. Fast forward to when I heard this story, and now their parents had recently finished a visit and were talking about selling their house and moving up here to be with the kids.

Like a whole family came up, one or two at a time, through beauty and tragedy and love and connections.

So when I was a small child I grew up in mountain ranges in the east coast of Australia, nothing at all like here, but our version. 

I was always out exploring and have an affinity for the wilderness. 

In school we read a book called The Hatchet, and it always instilled in me a desire for the test of life.
This was probably 25 years ago, maybe longer. 
I spent many years travelling to New Zealand and adventuring and exploring; the pine forests and cold mountain air always felt like home. 

To me Alaska is still the final frontier, the epitome of my desires. 

I moved to the west coast of Australia, it is extremely flat, hot and arid. The opposite of my preferred environment. I work in mining, and recently got the opportunity to come over for a few months work with my company, and have since been offered a permanent role and will be coming back in June-ish.

240,"“Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster exists in the State of Alaska and ordered Federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a severe winter storm and straight-line winds from December 25 to December 27, 2021.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe winter storm and straight-line winds in Fairbanks North Star Borough, Denali Borough, and the City of Nenana.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Thomas J. Dargan as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.”",t2_eap63,Akski,0,1648219856.0,0,t1_i22kxla,i22kxla,True,imll99,t3_tnmqn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/tnmqn5/president_joseph_r_biden_jr_approves_alaska/,"President Joseph R.

Obviously, if you're a lone female hanging out with others drinking or doping things might get weird, but I wouldn't be too concerned about crime in general otherwise. Food-wise, ensure you can get what you need if you have restrictions, & have appropriate medications like an Epipen, or insulin, of whatever else you might require. I assume you're aware of your health needs as well as your triggers (like not skipping meals, altho it sounds like you need to stabilize your blood glucose a bit).

299,"Up to 2 feet of snow could fall in the Turnagain Pass area by Friday night, causing dangerous driving conditions along the Seward Highway and increasing the risk of avalanches, the National Weather Service said.

The snowfall is expected to begin Thursday afternoon and peak overnight, according to a special weather statement from the Weather Service.

The storm is expected to bring east winds with gusts up to 50 mph. Visibility could be reduced to a half mile at times.

Higher elevations will see the heaviest snow accumulation, said Weather Service meteorologist Shaun Baines, but the storm will still cause hazardous travel conditions even at lower elevations on Turnagain Arm.

“The surface temperatures are not real conducive to tons of accumulation, but not very far above the surface -- so Alyeska is going to get hammered. Turnagain Pass will get hammered. At sea level there’s a little uncertainty on how much they can actually accumulate with those temperatures either near freezing or even above freezing,” said Baines.

Avalanche danger has increased with the fresh snow. The Chugach National Forest Avalanche Information Center forecast on Thursday that danger was high at all elevations and human-triggered and natural avalanches are likely. Ten to 16 inches of snow had recently fallen in the Turnagain Pass area by Thursday morning, the center said.

Travel in avalanche terrain was not recommended Thursday into Friday.

The Anchorage area is not expected to see significant impact from the storm system, Baines said. There could be snow showers that produce a half inch or less of snow overnight into Friday morning in the Anchorage Bowl and the Hillside could see a few inches, he said.",t2_bnnzy,gummibear049,0,1648167753.0,0,t1_i2049dt,i2049dt,True,gummibear049,t3_tn9ma3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/tn9ma3/heavy_snow_in_forecast_for_turnagain_pass_will/,Heavy snow in forecast for Turnagain Pass will complicate driving and increase avalanche danger,/r/alaska/comments/tn9ma3/heavy_snow_in_forecast_for_turnagain_pass_will/i2049dt/,4,r/alaska,0,4,0.04767961,0.014147817,0.013217758,0.018784136,0.009041227,0.15301423,0.0094257

373,"I love Alaska! Moved here from Florida for just the summer season. Been living here for almost 4 years now. Foraging and fishing help with food costs. Buying wool from the thrift store keeps me warm at a low cost. Ordering bulk items online and using those whole food ingredients to make food at home helps with costs too. I honestly think most of the United States should learn how to be more practical and resourceful as Alaskans. Literally have learned so much in the past 4 years- like cleaning a fish, sewing hide, using power tools… hell- I even switched out my own oil filter and did my own oil change to save a few bucks. It’s really rewarding. But I don’t think I did much research *before* I got here, just listened to the advice from my friends and studied some books about winter (no real winter in Florida) from the local library when the summer ended. I think the fact that the communities are small and the terrain is dangerous that people cherish others a bit more here. I really can’t wait to finish my degree and live in other communities. See different trees. Meet different people 😊

TLDR: don’t move to Alaska if you just wanna go to clubs, hate the wilderness, or to humble brag to a friend that wants to live up here. It takes effort.

People move here with this grandiose idea of being like a Jack London McCandless roaming through the Alaskan wilderness on their off days while holding down a normal job in Anchorage. Then there’s always “nothing to do here” and “it’s so dark and isolating” (when Anchorage is no where near as dark or isolating as the rest of the state and has normal “big city” things to do lol). Then I always ask what they do outside of work and it’s never anything to do with the outdoors lol. It’s like literally drive anywhere within a few hours of Anchorage and you can find beautiful wild Alaskan activities to do. I’m almost of the opinion now that these kind of people are just miserable no matter where they live and they try to move around to wherever the grass is greener to them at the moment.,t2_d012c7j0,sierraromeopapa2,0,1648142288.0,0,t1_i1ydfzn,i1ydfzn,False,[deleted],t3_tmg5xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/tmg5xn/i_dont_know_how_many_times_this_has_to_be_said/,"I don’t know how many times this has to be said, but if you didn’t do your research don’t move here.",/r/alaska/comments/tmg5xn/i_dont_know_how_many_times_this_has_to_be_said/i1ydfzn/,13,r/alaska,0,13,0.2302626,0.08722302,0.12316454,0.29921663,0.065875895,0.14291863,0.01774703

A  number of years ago, a newcomer opened a business that we initially thought was too direct a competitor for both ours and their to survive in a small market.  They advertised heavily. My friend said, ""don't worry, they'll be gone in a year, three tops,"" and it was true.  The owner's spouse *had no concept of how dark winter was.* Neither realized how much the time and cost of flying or marine transportation limits trips out when they had East Coast family.  The owner seemingly didn't recognize realities a local would know about seasonality heavy influence on life.  They moved away within 18 months.

I also know a lot of people that won't really invest in forming relationships with ""transient professionals"" unless it's clear the person is staying.  Like if you moved from rural New Mexico or Montana, I would believe you'll last and know what you signed up for.   If you married a local, that makes me think you'll stay. But if you were attracted by a hiring bonus, came from urban California or Illinois, or value organic in-season fresh produce, don't be suprised if I'm skeptical about your lasting.

445,"Not that I want to encourage this, but you could maybe get an approximation of what you're looking for on the Kenai Peninsula, on the stretch of highway between Kasilof and Anchor Point. Look around places like Whiskey Gulch, Happy Valley, or Clam Gulch. Life out there is not glamorous, but it's also not impossible. 

You could probably get LTE service if you're not too far off the highway. You're not going to get fast Internet service via satellite here. 

Other suggestions: Cooper Landing, Hope, or Moose Pass areas. However, I think it may be more difficult to find an isolated spot around those places. 

Edit: I recommend the Kenai Peninsula in part because the weather isn't as harsh as other places and you're not too far from civilization if there's an emergency.

534,"Depending on where you are from and what part of Alaska you are heading to... Expect at a minimum around 30% average higher cost. Things tend to be cheaper in hubs like Anchorage (minus housing RIP). 

If you have a fuel efficient vehicle and time, driving might be cheaper. It's about a 55 hour (3,166 miles) drive time from Minneapolis and 43 (2260 miles) hours from Seattle. I have done both a few times and will be again this summer.  For 20 mpg that's around $700 for fuel, 30 mpg= $500.

Plenty of pull offs on the route up to sleep in your car. If you bring a couple gas cans and fill up at each city you should make it no problem -do the math yourself then add a degree of safety margin...

I have done it in my truck while towing a 20 ft enclosed trailer. I had to use my 100 gallon in bed tank at certain points but that's getting 12 mpg at best. There WERE (haven't done it since pre-covid) plenty of places to fill up 75% of the trip.

Google places to stop but my stops from Minneapolis are:
Minneapolis to Portal,ND 9.5 hrs
Portal to Edmonton 10.75 hrs
Edmonton to Fort Nelson 11.5 hrs
Fort Nelson to Whitehorse 11 hrs
Whitehorse to Anchorage 13 hrs

There are random place you can stop but I prefer truck stops or slightly out of town if it seems scetchy.


A quick Google comes up with $2,500 for the barge-no passenger Seattle to Anchorage. So plus a plane ticket one way in the neighborhood of $2750. I have no clue if this is accurate as I never have ferried anything.

Also, make sure you have an ACTUAL job and a place to stay. Alaska can be warm(70s) and dry or cool (50s) constant drizzle all summer... Too many people ""gold rush"" it and quickly run out of money so I would suggest that you save enough for at least a plane ticket home.

For safety and since at lot of people go missing every year.

If someone repeatedly calls you an asshole they usually get a temp ban depending on a wide range of subjective factors (are they really just a troll, are they otherwise contributing to the board, are they mostly polite and today was just a bad day, etc.). If someone calls someone an egregious racial or sexual epithet they generally get permanently banned. 

The misinformation bans I’ve personally handed out were strictly as a result of blatant COVID misinformation or election misinformation (like biden stole the election from trump, original strain covid hasn’t killed anyone or it’s just the flu, etc.).

667,"I didn't see the flagged comments, but I also didn't go perusing through the mod log before making that comment. Sorry about that.

Most of the backlash against the religion thing was from outside, I got like 30 direct messages from people showing support, and asking if they could help. The mods over at the athiest sub also reached out, and where banning participants in the brigade.  The whole situation was weird. But both the reddit administrators and the mods of the other communities where very helpful and supportive. Over all it was a very good experience. It was especially nice that it precipitated a very large expansion of the moderation team. It is much easier now, and having people on the team that disagree with me makes me more confident in decisions, especially when they take time to give feedback or start discussions in mod chat.

About the covid thing, I did not state that I had the authority to flag that as misinformation because I know an epidemiologist. I stated that I have the authority because in general the community trusts me with that authority. To do my best to figure out what is and isn't misinformation that poses a threat to the safety of the public and the community. I'm \_confident\_ in my decision because I know several epidemiologists and talk to them regularly about all this stuff going on. Authority is very different than expertise. Just because I'm friends with a group of epidemiologists, and have worked on epidemiological models for learning algorithms and AI, doesn't make me an expert in epidemiology. I just know folks that are. The authority to do stuff is different and comes from a general consensus of the community. 

Honestly, that is what makes moderation tough. The expectation to utilize authority on things you aren't an expert on. We can just do our best, both in being right about misinformation and judging what is over the line vs what isn't. All while trying to not be biased. (or at least take steps to mitigate the bias inherent in us all)

BTW, all the epidemiologists I know (except one) strongly recommend avoiding crowds and always wearing a mask. None of them have eaten in a restaurant yet.

690,"Right, because we were supposed to be removing comments and banning people that where promoting hate based on a protected class, including religion. Most of those guys also got reported to the site wide administrators and there was discussion about removing the athiest subreddit from the site, because of their behavior. They do this a lot.

We do try to be fair with our comment removals and bans. Talking shit about a public figure isn't as bad as planning on shooting people or trying to find someone to kick their ass. For example. Also promoting hate against a minority is bad. That is why ""I'll piss on a fa\*\*ot's grave"" is worse than ""I'll piss on Don Young's grave"".

But, weirdly, almost none of those comments got reported, so they didn't end up in the queue. Many of the ones that did got removed.

Basically, this mod shit is hard. That's why we talk to each other about removals, and bans. So that hopefully we can be as fair as possible.

It's the equivalent for you to drive to NYC, in terms of distance but the highway is largely in the middle of nowhere with the occasional town/rest stop every 2-3 hours. Cell service varies, especially by carrier. While it would be funny to picture two tourists extremely out of their element on the highway, I don't know how safe it would be if something goes wrong. I highly recommend you all fly into Fairbanks and rent a car there.

Is there enough to do in Fairbanks for a week? I'm not from there, but I'd say maybe? Chena Hot Springs, probably some nature tours based out of Fairbanks. The vast majority of tourism based out of Fairbanks is connected to Denali which isn't really in operation during the winter.

> You don't actually want to work the slime line. The money isn't that great, in a lot of places they import a bunch of people from east Asia to do it for cheap. Its shitty, hard ass work.

> The only guys I know who have fond memories of their time on the line knew the manager of the plant and were able to get out on smoke breaks so were stoned out of their minds the entire summer.

773,"King salmon season usually opens June 15th for the Juneau area. I would highly recommend a day trip to Tracy Arm. You will see a calving tidewater glacier and seals floating on icebergs with either Allen Marine or Adventure Bound Alaska. I’d also book a whale watching excursion out of Auke Bay. Just Google it, there are a bunch of tour operators for that (but I can personally recommend Jayleen’s Alaska or Allen Marine). 
As far as Glacier Bay goes, it’s hard to get to from Juneau. You can ride the ferry to Gustavus, but I don’t think it runs everyday. Alaska Tours has a day trip where you fly to Gustavus, take the small boat tour of the park and fly back to Juneau. It’s a whopping $700+ per person.  For Skagway, if you want to day trip it you will have to fly or check out Alaska Fjordlines. 
Juneau had a ton of great hiking. My favorites are Nugget Falls at Mendenhall Glacier (very easy and paved), East Glacier, Outer Point on Douglas Island, Boy Scout Beach, Treadwell (very interesting for the historic old mining district), Perseverance, and Herbert Glacier.

Lots to do:  
Rent showshoes, go hike angle rocks or Grapefruit rocks

Ice skate on Tanana Rec  
X-country skis, check out the White Mountains  
Fatbike, trails all over town

dog mushing tours

Museums at Chena Hot Springs, UAF campus, and Downtown  


A personal suggestion- take the train from Anchorage to Fairbanks! it cuts through Denali park, and is quite scenic along the Nenana River. this would cut out a potentially scary drive if weather is bad from city to city.

I’ve spent many a Christmas in Fairbanks at -30, and there isn’t much you’ll want to do when it’s that cold anyway. Also with gas and rental car prices as they are you’d likely spend more driving up than a flight up from anchorage, if you want to explore the area I’d suggest a flight.

The trail connects to a lot of other trails so you can get on and spend all day hiking or just a couple hours if you want. Rabbit Lake is also a great day hike, although not as easily accessible as the Prospect Heights/Upper O’Malley/Glen Alps trailheads. Otherwise, there’s a lot to do in town, lots of Breweries if you’re into that, a lot have outdoor seating so you could take a day to just chill after your trip and soak in the scenery. 

One of my favorite tours I’ve ever done is out of Whittier, Glacier Jet Skiing. We’ve taken a few guests and it’s such a cool/unique tour! There’s also Portage Pass hike right when you get into Whittier, we’ve done that after the Jet Ski tour. Other than that, not a whole lot going on in Whittier but it’s beautiful.

889,"Yeah I don't think you need a car in girdwood, it's very small and they should have their little bus, might even have bike rentals in summer. Locals also call it ""Goodweed""

You literally can just hike straight up the mountain in the middle of town if you wanted. I did that when I was like 20 but remember it being kinda rough/vertical lol. There's also a tram up the mountain for like $20?? Beautiful views up there and a casual restaurant you can get a bite and some beer or something. 

Pretty sure the Winner Creek Trail starts inside girdwood too and is a pretty long trail. You really can get outdoorsy without having to drive anywhere. You're basically already in the woods once you're there lol oh and yes it will definitely be less crowded weekend after 4th. Prob won't be crowded at all lol, but the Sitzmark bar & grill often has bands on weekends if end up looking for some evening entertainment. Awesome view from there too, love that place. 

Also want to add if you're only in Anchorage for one weekend you can enjoy yourself fine without a car. Stay downtown, you can walk around there you can rent a bicycle and bike a lot of places too. We have a coastal bike trail that connects to downtown with a amazing views and it connects to the trail system through the city. 

And whoever told you there's no hikes within Anchorage city limits are totally wrong, it's weird that anyone wouldn't know about our in town hikes lol. They're wildly popular and well known, but def a lot of people up there. Especially flattop most popular hike in town, gorgeous views and being so populated isnt that big a deal. It also means you don't have to worry about bear safety because all those people will scare them away. I like that. 

There's also Near Point and prob something else. But they're definitely not walking distance. Flattop is like a 20 min drive from downtown and is also the trailhead for Powerline Pass which is VERY LONG. If I went on a really long hike on the pass I would bring bear spray. 
You could easily take a Lyft to flattop or maybe find a ride on Reddit/meetup or something.

There's also a bunch of little hiking trails in the middle of Anchorage behind Alaska Pacific University campus. But it's just straight up woods so there's no view and lots of mosquitoes. Heard there's bears too, maybe not what you're looking for lol ...

If you're still looking for the granola experience in Anchorage you could just go sit at the bar in Moose's Tooth lol. That's their prime habitat. There's also a hotel across the street and a rock gym the other way. The wait for a table is insane, but finding one seat at the bar is pretty doable. Their pizza is world famous cause they have eclectic ingredients but it's really just regular pizza. They have fantastic salads and appetizers though. Oh their dessert is so good, they have a cheesecake of the month they make there. The bar is a fun vibe, usually good bartenders. You can sample beers if that's your thing. They're a brewery of course.

They might have some tour busses out there but they can be expensive or you could try to get a ride from someone on Reddit or an Anch hiking meetup group/Facebook. The elevation isn't that high so it's the same weather as Anchorage. It's a small casual granola town. It's beautiful in summer and you can go hiking basically right there in town. Fun place to kick back and relax and enjoy good food and some beers. If you can afford it the alyeska resort has a really nice pool and hot tub with a huge window and view of the mountain. If you stay at the resort their hotel shuttle will take you basically anywhere you want to go in town. My mom and I went in 2017 and they even came back and picked us up when we were done with dinner. 

Great restaurants, they even have a little bus which is basically just this guy who drives people around to specific popular stops in a quirky little bus haha and it was on donations before the pandemic last time I used it. They have a nice new big brewery that's really popular. I hope the bus is still running, it's cool. 

If it's 4th of july weekend the forest fair is usually happening and from your description of activities you enjoy it sounds like your kinda crowd, really friendly granolas beer garden, bands. They always have a big campground, lots of people smoking weed everywhere. You could even camp if you wanted to, would be much cheaper. They also have a small 4th of July parade that weekend. 

Another thing to consider 4th of July is DEAD in anchorage because everybody leaves town to go camping and stuff. It's not a huge deal, all the same stuff is available it's just quiet and it doesn't feel like much is going on. Might have an easier time getting into busy popular restaurants that weekend.

899,"Except you had a high stakes election in 2020 Texas with Beto O'Rouke—a Democratic candidate—lose because he wanted to take people's guns away. He's changed his position from mandatory seizure to mandatory buybacks.

Last month O'Rouke said that gun policy should be in the hands of law enforcement. The same systemically racist structure that specifically targets minorities—ethnic and gender non-conforming—and applies outsized scrutiny for similar traffic stops. 

You'd run into the same problems New York has with sheriffs not equitably issuing conceal carry permits to people they don't like: minorities and gender non-conformists.

[Gun control itself has always had a racist history](https://www.sedgwickcounty.org/media/29093/the-racist-origins-of-us-gun-control.pdf). But that sort of thing hasn't been talked about [only until relatively recently](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/09/the-secret-history-of-guns/308608/)

The person you're replying to would have to further expound what their political positions are; it's most likely they're more of a libertarian socialist. *Maybe* a Democratic Socialist, like a pre-Presidential campaigner Bernie Sanders; he shifted to more gun control in order to appease and appeal to Democrat voters.

The current batch of Progressives in the House are way more passionate about expanding gun control and limiting gun rights; so the current batch of Progressives wouldn't fit with the one you're replying to.

[Democrats really hate guns.](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/healing-the-soul-of-america/)

>Democrats will ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons

""Assault weapon"" doesn't exist; it's a scary misnomer entirely based on aesthetics. You can have a similar design, but the one that *aesthetically* looks like a military rifle gets more restrictions than one that is functionally the same but ""looks boring"".

> We will incentivize states to enact licensing requirements for owning firearms

Forcing licensing, and conceal carry permit fees, and any other sort of fee or tax to have access to firearms is itself unfairly targeting ethnic minorities and queer people, as they're the most likely demographics to be unable to afford a (borderline safe) handgun for basic self protection. Adding in all the mandatory licensing fees and safes and other errata to have a gun, turns a $400 handgun into $700+.

Licensing the second amendment will likely be proven unconstitutional, since it's requiring a fee to access a freedom bestowed through the Bill of Rights. I don't think it's been argued yet, but there might be a case of that making its way to the Supreme Court (I'd have to double check but I'm not focusing on that right now)

>We will pass legislation requiring that guns be safely stored in homes.

While the intention is nice, some states require the gun *and* ammo kept in two different safes, which makes it *even more* expensive to own, which will also unfairly target ethnic minorities and queer minorities. That has started to become a growing trend, although it hasn't made it past committee in some places.

Democrats hate guns. Progressives in the House really hate guns. ""Blue-dog Democrats"" don't hate guns, but they're still too much of a liberal (ie center-right) and part of the problem with corporatism and free-market greed.

It makes it so that voters are better represented by their delegates. All well still sticking to the literal definition of one person one vote, by the way.

Runoff elections are broadly considered to conform to that metric, and RCV is just an instant runoff, so they don't have to hold back to back elections.
