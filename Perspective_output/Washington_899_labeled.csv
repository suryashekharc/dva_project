You don't. Having a gun on your person doesn't make you more safe, in fact, quite the opposite.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/)

\>Results. After adjustment, individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 (P  
 < .05) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in   
possession. Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance  
 to resist, this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 (P < .05).

\>Conclusions.  
 On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being   
shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur each   
year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in   
urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or,   
at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety  
 countermeasures.

112,"From the 27 year study of mass shootings in the USA I liked earlier from American Public Health Association.

>Results. Between 1990 and 2017, there were 69 high-fatality mass shootings. Attacks involving LCMs resulted in a 62% higher mean average death toll. The incidence of high-fatality mass shootings in non–LCM ban states was more than double the rate in LCM ban states; the annual number of deaths was more than 3 times higher. In multivariate analyses, states without an LCM ban experienced significantly more high-fatality mass shootings and a higher death rate from such incidents.

>Conclusions. LCM bans appear to reduce both the incidence of, and number of people killed in, high-fatality mass shootings.

This is a comprehensive 27 year study of mass shootings in the USA with regards to large capacity magazines. Just read it, please. Studies like these are what is used for the basis of these bills and laws. Nobody wants restrictions on guns and ammo because ""guns are bad, mmk"". There is data that shows these laws do have a positive effect on lethality and reduce the number of deaths.

Because when the state fails to do the basics to protect the masses, especially in times of increasing social and political strife, people often become more concerned with providing security for themselves.

154,">Sure, fear monger to prevent solving real problems.

Its not fear mongering, it has been seen and done in other states. We al know the Democratic party is increasingly removing more and more gun rights by adding more ridiculous restrictions ala the Republican strategy towards eliminating abortion rights.

>nobody is taking away anyone's guns or ammo

Go to Cali or New York and see how difficult it is to get a firearm. They also have ridiculous magazine caps and New Jersey doesn't even allow JHP for ammo.

>Seriously, there is zero negative to this bill unless having a big clip in your gun gets your dick hard.

And here we go w/ the sexual innuendos when people just simply want to be able to have easy access to ""high capacity"" magazines for their firearms. The negative is that with lower capacity magazines for legal gun owners they are at a disadvantage against violent criminals, hence why the bill still allows both the police and private security to have high capacity magazines *because it puts them at a disadvantage.* Now it is civilians who are forced to be at a disadvantage if ever they need to defend themselves due to restricted access to high capacity magazines.

>There is clear data that these restrictions work in lowering the lethality of mass shootings

Show me this data? I find it very hard to believe as mass shootings with high capacity magazines seem hardly effected by the capacity due to often the poor shooting skills of offender and if anything most school shootings involve smaller arms like handguns.

Also this ignores what has been brought up before regarding the ease and speed of changing magazines and of course as you yourself noted high capacity magazines possession isn't banned so a school shooter could still have access to those.

What happens when another school shooting occurs? Apparently one is being used to justify these magazines sales restrictions, why wouldn't another one then also be used to close a ""loophole"" that possession is legal? Anyone can see the trend and where this is heading especially when you note other states which ban possession.

Edit: Regarding your ""data"" you should see this:

[The study found that the ban was effective at reducing crimes committed with assault weapons, though less than 2% of gun murders in the U.S. are committed with assault weapons.\[37\] **The ban was not associated with a reduction in firearm homicides or the lethality of gun crimes in general**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-capacity_magazine_ban#State_high-capacity_magazine_bans)

221,"Your point of view is exactly what gun owners rail against, you've essentially admitted this has nothing to do with preventing gun violence and is instead a baby step towards the banning of gun ownership. What buy in can you expect from gun owners to work towards regulating gun ownership if your point of view is, on the face of it, blatantly disingenuous? 

&#x200B;

Your comment tells me that you have lead a sheltered life, but I cant tell you from experience that evil people exist, that they would take the opportunity to hurt you if they could, I have seen this with my own eyes. Its from my own experiences that I know that protecting myself or my family may one day be a thing that I have to do, and to do it I need the best available weapon. I have a spine injury which preludes any sort of martial training or fighting, a gun is the single best tool I have for defending the people I love.   


Also, I think its clear you have little to no experience with guns, but a full size pistol, that is a pistol with a grip that comfortably fits your hand, with a longer barrel to help accuracy and control recoil typically holds 17-21 rounds. This is the standard capacity for full sized handguns in 9mm. There is no magic danger threshold that is crossed when loading the 11th round into the magazine, its an arbitrary number intended to reduce the total number of guns for sale in WA as not all manufacturers will spend the time and money to create a 10 round magazine for ban states. Again, disingenuous attempt to ban guns via sidestepping the constitutionally protected right to own firearms, which is also in the WA state constitution I might add.   


For your final point, you have completely miscalculated my political leanings and character. Liberal voters and people of color are the fastest growing group of gun owners in America.

Let's say you have a law against murder, with punishment ranging from 10 to life in prison. Because of the lengthy prison sentence and other ramifications  (such as after you get out of prison no one will hire you for the rest of your life, so you will always be poor), the law has a deterrent effect, so it is an example of an effective law.

Now let's say you have a law restricting magazine capacity where the punishment is misdemeanor, and the only enforcement is when you caught violating some other gun law... such as aforementioned law against murder. So now if someone commits murder with this high capacity magazine, they go away for 10 years, plus they would have a misdemeanor.  If someone commits murder with a 10 rd magazine, they go away for 10 years and they don't have this misdemeanor.  Would any criminal care about that misdemeanor? Of course not.

I let my mom handle mine and I feel I got screwed out of a large compensation check. If you're not the rear ender take them for all they're worth.

I'd suggest a dash cam that's front/rear facing. This is the one I have. It's relatively decent quality. I did not install the gps as it isn't required. If you don't know where you are on the road when you get hit then it would make me question the driver's competency behind the wheel. That and the insurance company doesn't need to know you were doing 5 over speed limit.

896,"Don't feel obligated to completely circumnavigate the whole peninsula. I prefer place like Pacific Beach or Iron Springs to more touristy spots but a cabin at Klaloch would be awesome if you can get one.  Forks sucks but the Quillayute River Resort was pleasant when I was out there way too long ago.

It's a long haul to Neah Bay but Hobuck Beach is cool if they're dog friendly.

Port Townsend is nice too but obviously inland from the coast.",t2_qogf5,renownbrewer,0,1648006028.0,0,t1_i1r2tew,i1r2tew,True,With3Cs,t3_tkk22u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Washington/comments/tkk22u/weekend_road_trip/,weekend road trip,/r/Washington/comments/tkk22u/weekend_road_trip/i1r2tew/,1,r/Washington,0,1,0.2803783,0.16047907,0.07573203,0.2911495,0.36461213,0.092979595,0.16276462
