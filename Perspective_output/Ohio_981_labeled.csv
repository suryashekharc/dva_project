They have a hunter safety class, before you can get hunting licenses. There's a reason for this - you're using deadly weapons. I know a guy who was recently killed in a hunting accident. (""Only 0.00000001% of hunters get killed in accidents!"" Well, I know one.) Given what happened, the guy he was hunting with obviously hadn't taken a safety class or had forgotten what he was taught (this was in PA) and there were fatal consequences. Where a weapon as deadly as a gun is considered, it should be an absolute requirement that you understand the state gun laws, know how to use a gun, and have decent aim when you shoot.

Comparing that to 57% of public schoolers - woof that's a HUGE difference. The ACT Data Statisticians even note additional research is needed. I've delved into [further research](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED573487.pdf) done on testing between the 2 and found some interesting data. When analyzing standardized tests between the 2 schooling categories, they are remarkably similar.

I'm not sure why this was directed towards me. Nowhere did I state that I have anything against homeschooling? I provided information that makes the data you noted a bit unreliable. I think homeschooling has its advantages and disadvantages, just as public school does.  I'm merely providing statistical data that shows most homeschoolers don't take these college-prep tests. If such a significantly low portion of homeschoolers are taking the test, compared to a significantly large portion of public school students, it causes a skew. The researcher of the information you provided does note ""Additional research is needed to better understand score differences between homeschooled and other students. ACT participation rates and sociodemographic characteristics may explain some of the differences in mean ACT scores between homeschooled and other students."" I think another big issue we see with data from homeschoolers is that it is a bit on the honor system as parents can be the proctor for the tests in some states (for example- FL, SC, MN). Even though NHERI and homeschooling coalitions state you should hire a proctor for the tests where scores are reported to the state, some don't and the honor system can be a bit worrisome, especially with parental bias.",t2_6022p,seekaterun,0,1648260866.0,0,t1_i259nuz,i259nuz,False,rural_anomaly,t3_tm1mm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/tm1mm1/rep_fowler_arthur_rashtabula_is_a_primary_sponsor/,"Rep.

Everyone I know who has worked for a charter school, or is currently working for a charter school are all in agreement about how shitty the experience is for kids. Most of their teachers and staff are way under paid which means no one is happy in their job. They are provided no funding for supplies. The buildings they use are typically empty office space that was never intended to be a school, which means it is not properly equipped to be used as a school. And here is icing on the cake..... charter schools load up and recruit students in the fall, swelling their ranks as much as possible. They get state funding based off of their high numbers and the minute they get past the date where the state funding is guaranteed, they start shedding the kids that they don't want or are hard to deal with. Then those kids end up back in the public schools and the public schools have to educate them without receiving any funding to help pay to educate them. It is fucking criminal what they are doing.

So She goes back to the store assuming they'll resolve the issue but perhaps she was too aggressive with the manager so they tell her to f\*\*\* off and this results in her calling the police.

Keep in mind a grocery would have no problem calling the police if someone shoplifted a $10 bag of chicken  and the police would have no problem cuffing them and hauling them to jail.

Of course we've all been shorted something at a drive through and most of the time we just get over it... mistakes happen and it would be too much trouble to go back.  However, not everyone is lucky enough to resources to shrug off being shorted half their order.  Perhaps she needed the whole order to feed her family and doesn't have enough food at home to make up the difference or a spare $10 to place another order.

I really doubt it is going to lead to that many more firearms on the market. People who want guns will acquire them whether or not they want a CCW or not. I rarely carry myself, though that was probably set to change when I got my CCW- still planning on taking the course. 

I just hope this doesn't lead to too many clueless morons blowing their foot off in Walmart.

531,"Beavercreek cops are assholes. 

The only time i have ever smarted off to a cop was a  Beavercreek one. It was like June or July 2020 so in the midst of the pandemic when things were just starting to slowly open up. He pulled me over to tell me my tags were overdue. I said that I was aware, that it's my mom's car and she is in the at-risk population for covid, and the dmv told her that she technically didn't need to renew them until the a.) The pandemic ends and we are no longer under a state of emergency or b.) the first of the next year (which I think ot ended up getting extended till like June 2021 if I'm not mistaken). 

He goes, ""Well, the DMV has been open for a few weeks now Those tags are going on nearly two months expired.""

And so I responded with a, ""Yes it has. But we are still in a pandemic and when my mom called them, because she does not feel safe going out yet, she was told to not worry about it. So, if you want, we can call them up right now,"" in the most condescending tone I could muster.

get an apartment in the new city for one year, figure out what neighborhood/s you want to live in, start looking at homes that have signs, or just walk around the neighborhood and if you can strike up a conversation with someone outside, talk to them about the neighborhood and if they know anyone who is moving/selling.  

realtors are okay if you don't want to do a bit of leg work yourself and don't want to be patient for one year while you get a good idea of what you actually want in the location/city your at.

621,">There is only a small overlap in those homeschoolers and the ones we are actually talking about.

My first and quite downvoted comment was that homeschoolers outperform public schoolers.  After that it's just people twisting in the wind trying to undo that fact.  You're trying to build a silly tautology that ""all the homeschoolers who are dumb are dumb,"" and then trying to paint all homeschoolers with that brush.

But homeschoolers simply do better.  Deal with it.

> No... they were probably more like being raised Amish...

>I know what these people are like.

You have no idea.  You think Rep Arthur's childhood was like being raised Amish?!?  

People are perfectly capable of being prejudiced while getting a far better education than the average public school student.  Happens all the time.

That's because ""homeschoolers as a whole body"" includes mostly upper-class people who hire private educators and tutors. There is only a small overlap in those homeschoolers and the ones we are actually talking about.

""unschooling"" is just a form of teaching.. it's not anti-science or religous cult related.

No squirming needed. I live in her district. I know what these people are like. They are the prejudiced ones, but you probably know that, and that's why you're projecting SO hard.

Literally she doesn't want public schools to be allowed to teach civil rights, slavery, or about the holocaust. It doesn't get any more prejudiced than that.

752,"If you have to choose, go with definitely big enough/less features versus smaller/more features. what I mean is a smaller home might be able to be made bigger if you desire, but the cost is going to be huge. Think multiple tens of thousands if you want to build on for more room. If you get a house that definitely fits, size-wise, but doesn't have some of the bells and whistles you want, those can always be added later, and the cost can be spread out and will likely be wayyyy cheaper. Make sure the base items are good(furnace,roof,sewer,etc.). But if you need to put some sweat equity into upgrading or customizing something later, the cost can be planned for, reduced if you can do some work yourself, and you get exactly what you want. Educate yourself before projects. Plan work patiently. Let professionals do the stuff that only professionals should be doing. That is imperative.

762,"The Cleveland/Akron area gets a lot more snow than most of the state so you're definitely gonna be dealing with the worst of it. It's not *that* cold (it rarely drops below 0°F), but driving really sucks here. Driving over ice is probably weird if you've never done it before, but it's really important to not go too fast, especially if you're turning. There's always going to be some asshole who's going to tail you for it, but just go as slow as you need to. And give yourself lots of time to slow down before stopping because sometimes if you stop too quickly, you can start to slide. All you can do at that point is blast your horn and hope for the best 💀 It also helps to keep a bag of cat littler in your trunk. If you ever get stuck somewhere in the snow, you can use it to give you traction to get out of it. And this probably won't happen here since NE Ohio is so densely populated, but I learned in driving school when I was a teenager that it's always a good idea to not let your gas tank get below half full in the winter just in case you ever get stranded so you can have the heat on for a while. Still a good tip to know if you're driving through rural areas in the winter.

Shut a plastic bag into the door to pull on when the car doors get frozen so you don't break the car door handle. Never suddenly turn your heat to defrost or the windshield will crack.

Definitely some great advice here. Down coats are great because there's super warm, but not heavy and pack down really small. Eddie Bauer makes one that's really cheap, and they also go on sale a lot too. If you want waterproof shoes, get some gore-tex hiking shoes to walk around in, not full boots. I wouldn't wear them sledding, but walking around in them is awesome, and probably better on your feet than most shoes. Start your car 5-10 minutes before you leave so that there isn't condensation on your windows. There are also big fabric covers you can buy to never have snow get on your windshield in the first place.

839,"First time homeowner here and there was so much important into that helped us in our process and some lessons we learned along the way:

-Shop around for lenders to get the best rate. Some lenders do first time buyer training, which can help you get a discount. We got an even better deal thanks to choosing a lender who offered it. You’ll need to get pre-approved by a lender before most real estate agents will work with you. 

-Absolutely spend the money to get an inspection done because it can save you so much money and stress in the future. Ask how old the HVAC, water heater, roof, etc. are and they timeframe that they would need replaced. If we hadn’t had an inspection for the first house we put in an offer for, we would have bought a house with basically catastrophic foundation issues that would have cost at least $50,000 to fix. 

-Don’t make any big purchases (especially a car) until after you close, make your first payment, etc. because your loan approval can be rescinded if you take a hit to your credit or make too big of a withdrawal or deposit. I’ve seen so many videos from realtors on horror stories of their clients not getting houses due to this. 

-Figure out your absolute non-negotionables, whether that be neighborhood, house style/layout, etc. Ex: For us, it had to be in a walkable neighborhood with sidewalks, had to be a specific layout for accessibility, have a yard, garage, etc. We got all of those in a neighborhood we love.

-Be flexible and realistic about what kind of house house you can get in your price range. As much as we’d love to have the perfect house at our price point, we knew we had to either compromise or add said things to the house via renovation to get certain things we wanted. Getting real about our expectations helped us get a house at a much lower price that we can make more our style. We didn’t get the two-car garage we wanted, but we have a good size backyard and driveway. 

-If you find a neighborhood you love and want to find out when houses are going to be sold, join the neighborhood’s Facebook group. My neighborhood was super competitive when we were looking and houses went super fast. The only reason why we were able put in our offer on our house early, which was how we were able to get the house, was by word of mouth. 

-If you’re in a bidding battle for a house you want, you can put in a clause along with your offer that you would pay x amount above the highest offer up to a specific number. For example, you might say you’re willing to pay $3,000 more than the highest offer up to $250,000. It helped us have the winning offer for the house we chose not to close on and can be the thing that sets you apart from other buyers.",t2_4w3prn9p,princedetritus,0,1648176329.0,0,t1_i20n7p2,i20n7p2,True,oxabexo,t3_tmm29d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/tmm29d/first_time_homebuyers/,First Time Home-buyers,/r/Ohio/comments/tmm29d/first_time_homebuyers/i20n7p2/,1,r/Ohio,0,1,0.06363048,0.02261562,0.04097704,0.03842225,0.026398169,0.06282678,0.025293866

yes, it is an imperfect analogy.  i can see that too.  i'm ok with vegans being vegans.  i'm ok with people eating fried chicken.  i can even understand vegans trying to convince people not to eat fried chicken for many good reasons.  i can also understand not being convinced and eating fried chicken.

i still would have a problem with someone who's never tasted chicken trying to improve someone's fried chicken recipe because they thought they knew better.

i also agree that you don't have to experience something to have rational outlooks regarding it, sexual assault leaps to mind.  Nobody in their right mind would argue that you have had to experience it to write a law aimed at preventing it, but legislating that in order to prevent it, women cannot leave the home unaccompanied is taking that goal to absurdity.

There's really so much to see and do! Columbus & Toledo have two of the top zoos in the country, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the NFL Hall of Fame, Hocking Hills caverns, professional sports, college sports (O.H....), museums, theaters, beautiful scenery, etc.

928,"Yeah. That’s why people are upset.

Literally *most* people don’t live in a self-made kid-glove shell of denial and tender language, like Republican representatives feels is most natural.

Instead, they look at their environment, history, and condition and are able to perceive when they’re just not the underdog of the story, and even when the government they live under has been the villain.

Republicans don’t like not being the underdog. Republicans don’t like that the government they worship has been the bad guy, and often still is.

Republicans have difficult separating abstract concepts, like liberty and freedom, from flawed, concrete entities, like historical figures and 300 year old pieces of parchment.

  Republicans think and function like literal children.

I often wish someone could just split the country down the middle, pay for anyone who needs to relocate, set up how water distribution’s going to work for the western or southern half, however it works, through treaty, and let there just be two nations.

Obviously liberals have to be in control of the water-rich side, as republicans are dangerous and callous.

Republicans are a danger to themselves and everyone else. Let them go live in their own country that would completely implode within two generations, as it would be made predominantly of completely exploited and uncared for poor and rural white families who lack the education or resources to continuously feed the corporate, childish desires of its right wing government.

No unions. No state welfare. Brass tacks education that ends at 8th grade. No science based medicine. No science based resource management. No science based civil infrastructure. No psychologically based rehabilitation systems. No protection of the consumer from corporate interests. No science based interiors management. No protection of the civilian from police networks. No science or psychology based police training. Scaled back fire protection. Rampant insurance company exploitation. No religious freedom.
