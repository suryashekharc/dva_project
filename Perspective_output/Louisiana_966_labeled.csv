1,"Ok, I’m very close to the situation. While **this is an extreme overreaction from Stilley**, (I’m of the camp that this isn’t a good idea) let me at least provide context and explain why it was made. 

Before I do, let me explain something. Our district is down very bad. We have the worst discipline out of any parish in the state. It’s so bad that we aren’t even allowed to write it up most of the time. This is because the district doesn’t want it on the books because they’re already under a microscope from the desegregation lawsuit. The don’t want the state coming in. 

As a result, kids are running very wild because there’s zero accountability. They know they can get away with anything because only the extremes get in serious trouble. A fight barely results in consequences. They’ll go to in school suspension most likely. If it’s a repeat offender, they’ll get suspended a day or two. Because of this, fights happen all the time. And because of fights happening all the time, they get recorded. And after they’re recorded, kids use it to instigate more fights on social media. 

That’s the main reason why that rule was put in place. 

Again, it’s a stupid rule. An incredibly stupid one. 

Plus, Stilley and the school board are bluffing. Everyone laughed at the email announcing the rule the moment it hit our inboxes. Fights will continue to happen, they’ll continue to be recorded, and nothing will happen to the kids. 

Spring Break is coming up. This “rule” will be tossed out and forgotten once we get back. We have LEAP coming up.

59,"Monroe is disappointing if you're expecting a big city.  There hasn't been a big act/show through town in almost a decade, with most coming to the local university, ULM. Right around that campus, and Old Town by the river are theost entertaining areas of you're into night life. West Monroe around Trenton St. and Thomas Rd. are also great for dining and thrift shops. There are tons of hidden holes and restaurants around, too. 

There are lots of lakes, rivers and ponds around if you're into the outdoor life. D'Arbonne, Caney, Black Bayou, and the Ouachita River are all within the parish. And if you're willing to drive 1-2 hours at the most, you're going to find state parks and wild life refuges that you can explore. 

Finally, avoid south of I-20 east of Old Town. Even the police and emergency services are hesitant. Since Katrina, the crime/murder rate has skyrocketed. Lately, the Banditos have started to move in and it's only getting worse.

A lot of people are only nice because they want to know your business and try to strong arm you into joining their church. Don’t trust anyone until you are SURE they’re not motivated by some mission from God. 

That said, I made some lifelong friends at Enoch’s and the Blue Monkey Tavern back in the day, and if the music scene comes back alive again you’ll get to peek into the best thing about Louisiana: the music, the art, the food, the culture. 

If you want to cut through the tent revival layer and get right to the good parts, just go a little farther south to Lafayette or NOLA. 

The difference in the cultures between north and south Louisiana are so stark, it’s the reason I’m obsessed with studying cultural anthropology and how it relates to social power structures.

84,"I have land and a house just outside of Monroe. It’s not my permanent address, but I’m in the Monroe area about ten days a month.

It’s nicknamed Funroe, which is literal or sarcastic, depending who you ask. If you like the outdoors, conservative mindsets, and you’re somewhat religious, you’ll like it. If not, Funroe is a pretty miserable city.

If you’ve lived in a small town your whole life, Monroe will be like moving to New York City. If you’re from a decent sized or even large city, it’s definitely going to feel pretty small, not that that’s a bad thing necessarily. The people for the most part are pretty friendly. Some of the nicest people I know are from Northeast Louisiana. It’s also a place where a lot of the people are connected to their old school conservative Christian values and most people attend church. It’s definitely not progressive, like a good majority of the South. The people can definitely be judgmental, as they think their political and religious views are the only correct way of thinking, or you’re wrong and you’re a bad person for thinking otherwise.

There’s a couple of pretty good restaurants in the area I enjoy too. Depending on what you like, you should try Cotton (nicer Southern/Louisiana food), The Fieldhouse (sports bar, usually pretty good chicken wings), and Flying Tiger Brewery. Enoch’s is the best casual bar in the area.

There really isn’t much to do in the city. The Pecanland Mall is one of the peaks of entertainment, and that really isn’t saying much. There are some antique shops along the river in West Monroe that are worth checking out. They sometimes have some cool stuff you can find in there, which I always enjoy looking for cool old stuff to hang on the wall. You have to really enjoy outdoorsy activities, like hunting and fishing, to really relate to a lot of the locals. That’s a huge deal to most people. It’s not big enough for any sizeable events to really take place. You’d have to travel to Shreveport/Bossier City or Little Rock for any somewhat big event coming through the region.

UL Monroe is a decent school, but it’s not that big. Most students probably live within about a 75 mile radius of ULM, and that may even be a stretch. If you care about sports, they’re awful at almost every sport except water skiing. High school football is a big deal to a lot of people there (especially West Monroe), if you like high school sports. That’s usually another one of the highlights of entertainment for the area for the entire year. Again, not much happening.

The crime is pretty bad despite it being a small city. There are definitely areas to avoid. The homicide rate in 2020 was over six times the national average. Even around ULM’s campus isn’t always very safe at night. North Monroe is a nice area, and where there’s less crime and nicer neighborhoods. A lot of locals there with generational wealth, not that they’re billionaires by any means.

I would completely avoid Bastrop at night. In 2020, USA Today ranked Bastrop the 7th worst city to live in, in the entire country. Just avoid Bastrop unless you’re going to Simmons Sporting Goods.

One thing I’ve noticed is that there are a decent amount of people in the area from Arkansas and quite a bit of Razorbacks fans in North Louisiana. I honestly think I see more Razorbacks stuff than LSU gear around the city at times (not like everyone is a Razorbacks fan, but there’s definitely enough for you to notice). I think it’s funny.

If you have questions, feel free to message me. I’ll be happy to give you recommendations. I may actually be moving there full time myself this summer to go back to school at ULM.",t2_1nfa1ct,butnowimsohigh,0,1648135940.0,0,t1_i1xwygn,i1xwygn,True,laurenwilson101,t3_tlyao1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/tlyao1/what_do_yall_think_of_monroe/,What do y'all think of Monroe??,/r/Louisiana/comments/tlyao1/what_do_yall_think_of_monroe/i1xwygn/,18,r/Louisiana,0,18,0.24490385,0.13289768,0.31147918,0.28150427,0.12490133,0.13066167,0.053639628
85,"Live in west Monroe. Grew up here, left for a while, moved back. It’s a decent place to raise a family. We don’t go to church every Sunday and haven’t burst into flames yet but lots of folks do the church thing. The cities are really putting forth effort into boosting stuff to do. It really depends on what stage of life you are in. Lots of pretty outdoor activities. Paper mill is stupid smelly but it’s so many peoples jobs that what can you do? Water is brown. Get a whole home water filter installed. 

I don’t regret moving back (I did so for an excellent high paying job and help raising my son with family) but my husband on the other hand… eh. The people are nice. You don’t encounter many folks that won’t help you out if you need it. It’s a small town though so people can be cliquey. I don’t intend on being here forever though.

86,"I grew up here, moved away, and came back to be with family.  The city is just ok, both West Monroe and Monroe.  If you are coming for work, then if the job is good for you to move here then do what is best for you.  The cost of living is pretty low, but there is a good bit of poverty in certain areas.  Depending on where you want to live, you can get a decent house with some land for a decent price.

If you are into the outdoors, then you will like it here.  There is good fishing and hunting in the area.  As mentioned before, the downtown is just ok, both West Monroe and Monroe, but IMO as someone that grew up here, it is improving.  Both mayors are trying to increase the quality of life of residents.

ATT fiber is here if you need high-speed internet without a data cap.  It is in the major neighborhoods closer to the city, other than that we have Comcast cable with gig, but with a data cap.

If you have kids, schools are decent at best.  I have had good luck with WM schools with my kids, but as a whole WM/M I think are average.  We have some private schools in Monroe also.

Downtown Monroe has some neat shops and restaurants, as does West Monroe's main street. There's an Irish pub, Enoch's, on Louisville that I'd recommend.

You have to do research, and you have to live within driving distance if you ever want to collect your illegal winnings.

124,"I’m not OP, but I think they were trying to imply this (please correct me if I’m wrong, but be kind!):

Many of the individuals who tend to dislike these topics are the ones who have a particular set of beliefs thag they want taught in their homes and environments. They look at issues like these and call them “sensitive” or simply don’t want them to be taught because it doesn’t allow for their own perspectives to be the ONLY perspectives taught. 

The problem with disallowing diversity of thought comes when the prevailing type of thought or perspective discourages freedom (of speech, of body use, of sexual orientation, etc etc) and also discourages critical thinking (CRT, etc etc) among other things. 

When it is therefore promoted to think in a very rigid, specific way without any encouragement of alternative ways of thinking (critical analysis), it could be said that the lack of education (ie ‘uneducatedness’) is being promoted. 

Simply - if you ask many of the people who will support this, to tell you about the arguments of the other side (like most good debaters can do), they would not be able to in the slightest - they choose to be uneducated about what isn’t inside of their rigid perspective that they’ve been socialized to adhere to.

No it didn't.  I said:

> No good can come from being able to bet anywhere, anytime.

You've had a mobile app that allowed you to bet from anywhere anytime since 2000?  That's pretty impressive considering the first modern cell phone with an app store (iPhone 1) was released in 2007.  I did have a Blackberry with a web browser in 2003 but mobile internet even in a good market with tons of towers (which was not any place in Lousiana) was so slow that if that was the only way to bet it would actually discourage gambling.  

As I said, I'm not op.  I'm not anti-gambling, and I don't think it should be illegal, but I don't think any good can come from being able to place a bet instantly any time someone gets the urge to, or gets some (usually bad) information/advice from a coworker or friend and wants to put the bet in right away before they forget or whatever.  The only thing a cell phone app is good for is impulse betting, which is always bad.

153,"That gentleman is more or less right but rarely does the process go according to how it’s supposed to. You’ll often find private practice lawyers mishandle the nuances of these cases and filings much less public defender. The courts are equally slow, misfile, or simply forget about certain steps. You need to be vigilant at every step. 

Pleading 894 when you are sentenced does not automatically trigger dismissal, expungement, or reinstatement of your rights. When you have completed the terms of your probation:

1. the judge will need to sign an order indicating that you have satisfactory completed such. Typically this happens automatically but you may need to pursue personally or through an attorney. This is the first step.

2. You will need to take that order and submit a petition personally or through your lawyer. This petition pursuant to 894 is “Motion to Set Aside Conviction and Set Aside Prosecution”. Once signed by the judge you will need an official stamped copy.

3. You will take this Motion to Dismiss to the Office of Motor Vehicles. This document instructs them that you are considered essentially not guilty of the DWI. Your license will be reinstated without penalty or, if you chose to get a hardship license at any point, the violation removed from your record. 

4. You will also take that Motion to Dismiss and need to submit a Motion to Expunge both COURT and ARREST records or it will forever show up for employers even if it is an arrest without conviction. You will need to contact and frequently prod whatever was the arresting agency and provide them with the court orders indicating your case for them to remove any public statements mentioning your name and seal their own records. 

5. If you never got a hardship license and paid for any SR22 then apply for insurance as if nothing ever happened. They will never know and when they check your record it’ll be clean. If you did then the insurance companies know about it. You’ll need to use all your documentation so far along with the clean copy of your driving record from OMV to have them release that. 

It’s not an easy process and a lot of people mix up 894 vs. Pre-Trial Diversion. I’m not aware of a way like the other guy said that you can get your license back without SR22/hardship with 894 UNTIL you have completed all conditions.

Many of the French Creoles (whites of colonial French descent) in Acadiana dropped the creole identity just like the Cajuns did (Cajuns used to be called Acadian Creoles before the term Cajun was invented) and those French Creoles became “Cajuns” too. Many surnames that are considered Cajun today like Rabalais, Fontenot, Lafleur, Soileau, Fuselier, Devillier, Mayeux, Cantrelle, Prudhomme and many more are French Creole surnames and existed in Louisiana before the Acadians arrived and are not Acadian. Also, most people claiming to be Cajuns are not Acadians but are a mixture of things like Acadian, French, Spanish, German and some even English, Irish or Native American. And on top of that, the term Cajun started out as an insult created by anglos to call Acadian Creoles to mean someone that was a poor, backwoods Acadian hick. Just like Indian became injun, Acadian became Cajun. So I can see how this term Cajun can be disliked by several people.

Also, he CHOSE to come to the US. He came here for work because he needed money. He couldn’t find work in Prussia. George Washington hired him to shape up our military.

273,"I have some suggestions for music festivals, which are really what set us apart from anyone else and are essential parts of our culture. Some festivals require a ticket to get in, but most are in public places and are free to attend. 

If you come to Louisiana in the spring, Festival International is in Lafayette in April and you have to go no matter what. Don’t listen to the other commenter who said it’s not critical,
It is. The Baton Rouge Blues Festival is also in April. 

If you come in the fall, Black Pot Festival & Cookoff and Festival Acadiens et Creoles are in October, also in Lafayette, and also part of the essential Louisiana experience.

There’s not much happening in north Louisiana - it’s more rural and they don’t really go all out for the festivals like south Louisiana does, but if you’re here over Christmas, visit Natchitoches and their Christmas festival on Front Street. You won’t regret it. 

Don’t come between July through the end of September. It’s not worth the heat or the hurricane trauma. If you have to come sometime during that period, *definitely* don’t come between late August - September - that’s when we’ve traditionally gotten the worst storms.

290,"You can’t compare humans to animals. Humans aren’t like animals. We’re not bottlenose dolphins, or bonobos or any other animal where homosexual behavior has been observed. Even fruit flies partake in “gay” stuff. To compare humans to animals and insects is foolish. Their brains aren’t the same as ours. There’s many guesses as to why this happens in the animal world. Things like practice for heterosexual relationships, social bonding and plain ole good feeling from genital stimulation have been hypothesized. It doesn’t serve any purpose to the species i.e. survival/reproduction of the species. 

I used to raise pigs and I had a pig that used to hump a stump lol!!!! He “loved” (human term) that stump! He would rub his stomach raw from humping the stump. I’ve had same sex dogs that try to screw each other. This only proves that animals are just … animals 🤷🏻‍♂️

Humans are, in comparison to animals, intelligent beings that are unlike any other living thing on the planet. Being gay/bi/trans/fluid, or whatever term you want to use, is definitely not natural. By todays standards, if someone comes out and claims they love stumps, they’d be praised and glorified and a new letter would be added to the LGBTQP spectrum. 

There’s personal benefit to the human gay couple (love/orgasm/financial/shelter etc…) but it does nothing for the survival of the human race. There may be personal benefit to sex change surgery or dressing like the opposite sex but, again, it serves no purpose to the grand scheme of things. Also, the suicide rate is very high in LGBT population.

Animals have no idea what “homosexuality” means. That’s a human term/label. We definitely don’t have animals that think they are the opposite sex. We do see abnormalities like doe’s with antlers, hermaphroditism, and other unnatural occurrences like that, but a “homosexual animal” is not a thing.

I will say to be prepared for some things to be closed, even if they say they’re open online, and have backup plans ready. Covid shut a lot of places down as did the last major hurricane they had.

We know this from things they’ve wrote in the past. They weren’t all deists as some would say. Too many people have given up on faith because they’d rather do do whatever they want without fear of consequence. People have become so self centered today. The christian standard is lost on so many young people because of attractive worldly influence. It’s also lost under the guise of “education.” We took god out of the equation and now, by todays standards, someone like me is “wrong” or “dumb” for believing in God. Specifically the Christian God. Other religions are ok but being a christian is frowned upon. Speaking of being wrong… you’re wrong about people on here giving me something solid to back up their side of the spectrum. It’s all Ad Hom and emotion. Nothing of substance. Some of the comments are deleted now but there’s been some nasty stuff said about me from people that don’t even know me lol!!! They’ve came to their conclusions from a handful of comments on Reddit 🤣 I have to laugh at that. This is an example of how shallow and lost some people are. It’s all emotion and no logic. No reason. People react instead of responding. It’s sad, honestly. They have no direction. It’s all about what’s in it for me me me me. This is why we’re in such bad shape as a whole. No objective reference point for guidance. It’s all one persons word over another, which is flawed right out the gate and leads to things like we’ve read on this thread. If you have something to say about this thread I’d love to read it. Give me something other than “f**k off,” “you’re an a**hole,” “hypocrite” and “you’re wrong(because I said so).” Give me something good.

Houma is interesting but has been wildly Americanized due to its transient population.ic and catahoula. the courier de mardi gras in Vacherie (back of Gheens) and Choupic is unique in the world (no one else shares that practice to my knowledge, more medieval than what eunice and mamou do).

Houma is interesting but has been wildly Americanized due to its transient population. Isle de Jean Charles is an experience but not welcoming to outsiders - and I'm not sure who remains. Chauvin is also a fishing community but took heavy damage - is the statue garden even there?????

Some do choose to be that way and some don’t. 

Some people are born with a mind that makes them want to murder. Some peoples minds cause them to find literal humor in bad things. Some people are born with the attraction to children. Some people are born with a mind that makes them want to hoard. Some peoples minds cause them to be obsessive and compulsive. Some people like to eat dirt while some people like to eat even weirder things like glass and batteries and other non-food items. Some people are born with gender dysphoria. Some people have so conscience. Some people have no empathy or sympathy while others have a strong sense of the two. 

We labels for each of these things
-psychopath 
-murderer
-sociopath
-pedophile
-pica eating disorder
-being gay 

Etc… 

I’m honestly not seeing your point here. 

Why are some genetic disorders vilified while some are glorified? 

Surely the pedophile takes the side of other pedophiles. Same goes for hoarders and psychos and on and on. It’s like a brotherhood or bond. The same goes for racial stuff and political parties. 

While things like murderous urges and psychopathic tendencies are much more dangerous than being gay, it doesn’t change the fact that being gay is considered a sin.

405,"Ah, yes. There it is. The ole comment about trying to downplay Christianity and it’s values. Clearly you don’t understand what Christianity is and what it means to be a christian. 

It’s simple. 

We are all sinners. This us that part you referenced with the “purported Christian’s” comment. 

There’s no way around it. We will sin over and over again. Nothing we can do about it. The wage of sin is death! We all deserve to die because we sin. 

To die in your sins means to go to hell because the wage of sin is death! 

There’s a way around it though. If you believe:

-Jesus died for your sins (past, present and future)
-He was buried (proof of death) 
-He rose from the grave (according to scripture)
-He was seen by over 500 brethren (according to scripture)
-He ascended into Heaven 
-We wait for his return 

That’s it! 

It’s called having faith. You can’t see that it happened. You can’t touch it or examine it. You have to have faith in it. It’s that simple. Once you accept it, your life changes.

411,"I’m not gonna downvote you. It’s ok to disagree. 

You should shut the conversation down and tell them it’s not your place to give advice or to teach on that subject. 

The LGBTQP topic will turn into something along the lines of how it’s ok to be gay or bi or trans, or whatever the mood of the day may be, when the truth is that it’s not ok. Like it or not, we are a christian nation. Christian values teach that being gay is a sin, just like lying, stealing, committing adultery, lusting etc. 

It’s not your place to “teach” a student that LGBT stuff is ok, just like it’s not your place to teach a student it’s ok to lust, murder, lie, commit adultery etc.

I’m not judging anyone by saying this. I’m just pointing out the fact that it’s a sin. It’s one sin out of many. It’s the only sin referred to as an “abomination.” It’s called this because it serves no purpose in regards to procreation and the survival of the human race. Two men cannot make a baby. Two women cannot make a baby. Marriage should be between a woman and a man and those two people should work very hard to stay together. A growing child needs both ends of the spectrum of kale and female. It’s unnatural to be gay/bi/trans/cis and there are many problems involved with that kind of lifestyle. 

I know LGBT people. I Love many LGBT people. I don’t agree with their life choices and that’s ok. Its ok for people to disagree.

440,"I teach 7th grade and this past week, my students had to read the Preamble to the US Constitution and discuss which rights are guaranteed to citizens by both the Preamble and the Constitution itself.  Students were expected to brainstorm current events/social issues, locate three articles  related to an issue of their choice, and then determine if the current events/social issues they selected either challenged or supported the rights guaranteed by the Preamble and Constitution.

During the brainstorming session, *almost every group of students* included LGBTQ+ rights on their lists **on their own volition**.  A large number of students requested LGBTQ+ rights as the topic they would like to research, and since one of the goals stated by the Preamble is to ""establish justice,"" I allowed them to research the topic of their choice - as was dictated by the state-mandated, heavily-scripted curriculum we use.

I almost forgot something huge!  Louisiana is a swamp.  Just about the whole state.  This means we have to be experts in water diversion and flood plains etc (and bridges).  There is a series of dams across the state, I’d recommend checking out the Bonnet Carre spillway west of New Orleans. Flooding is another very common cultural phenomenon we’ve all just accepted.  Some places flood a lot, but it floods in almost every city every year at least once.  Some people in bad areas  keep small boats near their house so they can park above the flood and boat back and forth to their house.  Totally normal during hurricane season.  

I wasn’t joking about bridges.  The top 3 longest bridges in the US are in Louisiana, and most of the top 10.  Any given day I probably drive over a dozen or so bridges.  

Last thing - the Cajun Navy..  That mindset pretty much embodies Louisianans and our culture.  When disasters strike, we go check on our neighbors and the elderly.

**La. serial slaying suspect pleads not guilty**

&#x200B;

  
A man who police say confessed to strangling or suffocating 23 men during an eight-year killing spree pleaded not guilty Tuesday to nine counts of murder.  


  
Ronald Dominique was rolled into the courtroom in a wheelchair. He mumbled “not guilty” to each count as his sister and other relatives looked on — along with family members of some of his alleged victims.  


  
The nine charges of first-degree murder, which carry a possible death sentence, stem from the rape and murders of nine men between 2002 and 2005 in Terrebonne Parish, La.  


  
Dominique, 42, has confessed to 23 murders from 1997 to 2005, authorities said. Victims were found in ditches, sugar cane fields and other remote locations in southeastern Louisiana.  


  
Dominique’s public defender, Anthony Champagne, declined to comment.  


  
Among the onlookers in the courtroom Tuesday was Angela Smith, mother of victim Wayne Smith.  


  
“I wish I could have talked to him. I want to ask him ‘Before you killed my child, what were his last words?”’ Smith said after the arraignment.  


  
“I couldn’t even see him. That’s how bad a shape he was in when they sent him back to me. I just buried a box.”  


  
Dominique, who has a heart condition, was arrested at a homeless shelter in December. Initially booked on two murders, he eventually was indicted on nine and, during interrogation, confessed to 23, authorities have said.  


  
Authorities have said he allegedly enticed victims with offers of money for sex, or in some cases by offering the men his “wife” and showing them a picture of a woman. Dominique is not married.  


  
In addition to the nine charges in Terrebonne, Dominique also has been arrested in connection with two bodies found in the New Orleans suburb of Jefferson Parish. However, it is uncertain when or if he will be prosecuted there because of a lack of evidence, prosecutors said.",t2_ag2bf3jz,HipHop_Local_Legends,0,1647356238.0,0,t1_i0r89lm,i0r89lm,True,[deleted],t3_tequv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/tequv0/louisiana_serial_killerrapist_ronald_dominique/,"Louisiana serial killer/rapist Ronald Dominique killed over 23 people between the ages 16-46.

795,"I don’t live in Thibodaux or Hammond, but I know people who do live there. From personal experience I would say these are 2 great towns to make home in. Hammond, for one, is a smaller but unique college town. It has all of the necessities: Southeastern University, an outdoor shopping mall, a decent little downtown, a few car dealerships, it’s own regional airport, etc. You also have a variety of options for smaller recreational areas such as parks and Lake Pontchartrain/Lake Maurepas south of it (surrounded by I-55 and I-12 north of the lakes). So yeah overall a nice little town but very small. 

Thibodaux is pretty similar but further away from New Orleans and decently quiet. One thing about Thibodaux is that it is very interesting to drive around in and it is constantly expanding. Plus you have Houma about 30 mins south of it in case you want or need to go there for something occasionally. Apart from this, Thibodaux has a nice selection of restaurants, cafes, shops, parks, etc. It also has Nicholls state university. Overall a decent place to live cuz there is also Bayou Lafourche and what not there as well. As far as housing goes, not sure about pricing but I’m sure there are some cheaper homes being built in and around the area. I’ve seen some kayakers out there before, but idk much about it.

I love New Orleans, but needed to get out. I'll preface that I am in my 40s and am looking for some quiet and ease along with the other stuff.  I am sure it is coming back, but the benefits were gone for me. It is tough- infrastructure is crumbling with costs going up constantly. The culture is getting lost- my partner's family has been in New Orleans forever and they were pushed out of the city from cost. The first place I lived when I got there was amazing- everyone knew each other. By the time I had to move out, the whole block had flipped and only one local remained. And then climate change made for storms that rapidly form with greater intensity. Evacuating for Ida was so exhausting and we didn't even get the worst of it.

If you are up for it, the cities in Louisiana that are fun, in my opinion, are New Orleans, Lafayette, and Baton Rouge.

876,"Ugh, I had a whole thing written out but it disappeared, so bear with me. 

The area is a different flavor of Southern than here, but I can’t describe how. I feel like I generally fit in, though. And with the universities, there are so many transplants that you won’t stick out. 

The triangle has three main cities: Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh. 

Chapel Hill has UNC, a public ivy. The city always felt a little uptight to me and a bit more hipstery(especially Carrboro, which I generally consider to almost be a neighborhood more than a city). I’d argue that Durham is the most racially diversive of the three. Even with Duke, the city felt more authentic. It was the most similar to cities like Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Then there’s Raleigh, the state capital. Like BR, it mainly has young professionals, some old money and/or political types, and college kids. 

About 20min outside of Durham and Chapel Hill is Hillsborough. I didn’t get to go there much, but I remember it for being like a small yet modern village—a liberal paradise in the woods, so the speak. We only got to go there because my wife’s mentor from grad school, a hot shot cell biologist and her neurosurgeon husband had a second home there. I mention this because it felt like the town was a pocket suburb for the rich and that kind of money kept it from feeling too much like a suburb.

There’s Morrisville about halfway between Raleigh and Durham. My wife and I always jokingly referred to it as “Lil India” because, well, take a wild guess. Again, we didnt get to spend much time there (felt more like a suburb/strip mall town), but we’d go to get food. My wife’s from India but mostly grew up in the states. She said the food there was comparable to Houston or Dallas.

There’s also Cary, which is right outside Raleigh. It’s small and sleepy while also really charming. It was growing fast but it didn’t feel like too much of a suburb. 

Outside of the cities, you get into the sticks. Just like here, I guess. But at least it was worth venturing out there. There are some pretty great state parks if that’s your thing. Pretty neat to hang out near moving water, haha. 

Not sure which industry you’re in, but there are a lot of tech hubs in NC. Charlotte is the most notable and is quickly growing, but there were big companies like IBM right in the triangle proper.

But about the culture more specifically, I was really taken aback at the emphasis on the environment. Biking’s a thing. There are sidewalks. There are greenways which are like sidewalks but through little pockets of state parks (so many parks!). People actually recycled. The state invested in growing wildflowers along the interstate—spring was gorgeous. I’ve done a lot of traveling and other places are even more eco-conscious (like Washington), but it was so nice to see that sort of love and attention for the environment in the south. I also think it helps that the areas are so pretty, though. 

Anywayyy, I’m sure I’m looking back with rose-colored glasses, but I don’t think I’m too far off the mark. It just sucks that the cities are growing so fast. But, if you can’t wedge yourself in, there are lovey cities like Winston-Salem and Greensboro that I would still love to live in.",t2_j9b0r,nerdhappyjq,0,1646971687.0,0,t1_i077v5x,i077v5x,False,Due-System-2031,t3_tbantf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/tbantf/if_you_could_live_in_any_city_in_louisiana_which/,"If you could live in any city in Louisiana, which would it be and why?",/r/Louisiana/comments/tbantf/if_you_could_live_in_any_city_in_louisiana_which/i077v5x/,11,r/Louisiana,0,11,0.069509715,0.016988661,0.09750382,0.036148667,0.03703987,0.06272188,0.043882158

902,"Yeah but to be fair things closing early besides bars/casinos is pretty normal around the country. Still a bummer. 

I think the Boardwalk in Bossier was before my time visiting, that's fair, could've been an up and coming thing but doesn't seem like much. Doesn't seem like a lot new is happening on that side of the river. Although Gina's korean corndogs and bubble waffles looks dope lol. 

Speaking of an hour away, I dig the lil downtown square in Ruston. Not a lot, but Utility Brewing is decent and has pretty good pizza, and Bad Wolf BBQ in the food truck park is the best BBQ I've had in Louisiana by multiple orders of magnitude (though I need to try Gonzo's in Luling, around the river from Nola. They look cut from the same cloth, with top quality Texas BBQ classics plus Louisiana twists like beef cheek barbacoa boudin or pepperjack brisket boudin). Another plus about that for Shreveport is that it's a food truck and I've seen them start popping up there in the past few weeks. But for Ruston, quaint café, record store, movie theater, brewery, BBQ, it's a nice lil day excursion to go hike Driskill Mountain, mountain bike and swim at Lincoln Parish Park, and have lunch.

About Krispy Kreme, I've actually never been to one. There's one in Metairie, I should check it out sometime. Southern Maid is by far the best semi-large regional chain glazed donut I've had though, and Shreveport will always have that going for it.

Both have live music. 

The Lot downtown is a pretty cool new thing with live music, local art and craft booths, a boxing ring, a bunch of rotating food trucks that are curating an up and coming food scene, and there are a few solid festivals in Shreveport too between The Revel, Crawfest, and a few others.

In the process of buying a house now and will be paying about 1000 dollars less for our mortgage than we do in rent here in NOLA, also don't have to live with roommates anymore as we are in our late 20s and the roommate game is getting old. Food was absolutely phenomenal and I will probabaly have to watch myself as I may be going to Don's Seafood every other day, and also went to Crawfish time and it also was glorious. This morning tried to do a grocery run and NOLA decided to do construction on both sides of my street here in Broadmoor and totally blocked us in for an hour before we could move.
