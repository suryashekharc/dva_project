40,"The top end vacation time for State employees is 200 hours (25 days a year) which accounts to 9.6% of work hours. The other 5% is roughly 13 days of absences which is equal to one bout of COVID.  Given that at least a part of the time this covers was during COVID, it's not that crazy amount of time off.  The only really bad thing about individual absences is that the average person doesn't get the same amount of time off. America in general lags FAR behind other industrialized nations as far as work-life balance. I'm not going to fault any person for taking time away from work. We should be working to have a life, not living to work.

That being said, this is still a problem that needs solving. And the answer is simple, add another member. It's basic staffing. If you know that you have 5 positions to fill, you do not hire only 5 people to fill them. If each of them is gone about 15% of the time, then you will be short about 75% of the time (which is about what the stats show). Really, for 5 positions, you need 7 people for coverage.  At their current pay, that's 170k which can be paid for by reducing the salaries of the Husker coaches by 3.3%.  This will have the added benefit of allowing members more time to review cases.

This might be a good situation to keep the [level of proof](https://5280defense.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/burden-of-proof2.jpg) in mind. We use different levels of proof for different consequences. 

 - Criminal conviction? Beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 - Termination of parental rights? Clear and convincing evidence. 
 - Plaintiff prevailing in a tort/contract dispute? Preponderance. 
 - Search warrant being granted? Probable Cause. 
 - Police temporarily detaining someone to investigate a crime? Reasonable suspicion. 

So the question you gotta ask yourself is ""where does holding public office fall in that scale?"" Innocent until proven guilty refers to criminal conviction, and requires the highest level of proof to overcome. Does holding public office require that same level? A higher level of proof than terminating parental rights?

""""If and when we properly contextualize Judge Jackson's sentencing record in federal child porn cases, it looks pretty mainstream,"" [wrote](https://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/) Doug Berman, a leading expert on sentencing law and policy at The Ohio State University School of Law.

""Federal judges nationwide typically sentence below the [child porn] guideline in roughly 2 out of 3 cases,"" Berman [noted on his blog](https://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/), and ""when deciding to go below the [child porn] guideline, typically impose sentences around 54 months below the calculated guideline minimum.""

Berman also points out that government prosecutors often request below-range sentences, including in most of the Jackson cases that Hawley cited.

""The guidelines are now purely advisory, and many judges of all stripes routinely find that within-guidelines sentences are unduly harsh, in particular when it comes to first-time offenders,"" said Cardozo Law professor and ABC News legal analyst Kate Shaw.""",t2_7okjh,flyrobotfly,0,1648153055.0,0,t1_i1z4z1r,i1z4z1r,False,kcl086,t3_tmwtt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nebraska/comments/tmwtt2/ketanji_brown_jackson_knocking_ben_sasse_down/,Ketanji Brown Jackson knocking Ben Sasse down like 7 levels.,/r/Nebraska/comments/tmwtt2/ketanji_brown_jackson_knocking_ben_sasse_down/i1z4z1r/,15,r/Nebraska,0,15,0.17762576,0.07889248,0.109945856,0.121006995,0.0697299,0.056714445,0.5305406

337,"I've used them multiple times, but only between Alliance and Denver, not onward for another connecting flight.  However I agree with the other posts, the fares were totally reasonable, it was a good experience, and everything was on-time.  I think one time I paid $50 for the flight and I was the only one on it (thank you taxpayers!).

The Alliance airport is fine, you'll go through regular security which will be quicker and easier than in Denver.  I would get there at least an hour before your flight; you'll see that an hour is way more than adequate but I have actually heard they won't let people through for some reason if they get there too close to the departure.  

You didn't say which airline you'll be flying next but if you check your bags, I don't think Denver Air can transfer them to all airlines (best to ask them).  In that case you'd need to make sure you can carry your bag onto the Denver Air flight.  Otherwise you'll have to go outside security at DIA to pick up your bag, check it with your new airline, and go through security again there.

One other thing, it's been a while but as of last summer they did not offer online check-in.  Probably not a problem on the Alliance side, you just go to the airport and check in there.  But when you're coming back from your destination, I don't know if you can check in directly at the gate to your Alliance flight (inside security) or if you have to go outside security to check in at the ticketing desk.  I sure hope that's not the case but you should probably ask them to make sure.  Also as of last summer their gates were at the very end of the A concourse so it might be a bit of a jaunt to your connection if it leaves from B or C.

With all that in mind I would recommend only doing the connection if you have at least an hour and a half cushion, maybe more depending on what you find out about the baggage and check-in situation.",t2_6trdog,telcogeek,0,1648129468.0,0,t1_i1xh3bt,i1xh3bt,True,MircowaveGoMMM,t3_tly65d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nebraska/comments/tly65d/flying_from_alliance_to_denver_to_destination/,flying from alliance to Denver to destination.,/r/Nebraska/comments/tly65d/flying_from_alliance_to_denver_to_destination/i1xh3bt/,3,r/Nebraska,1,3,0.027535317,0.0095543,0.010558116,0.015603353,0.0072517404,0.015778624,0.01513139

403,"The [Monument Marathon](https://www.monumentmarathon.com/) has a full, half, half relay, and 5k. It's scenic, including runs in front of the [Scotts Bluff National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/scbl/index.htm) and through the cemetery (cooler than it sounds) and everyone says the course is awesome. I have only covered it for the local paper, taking pictures and writings stories, but my runner friends love it and the folks who come from out of state and out of the country seem to enjoy it. 

For the full marathon, you start up in the [Wildcat Hills](https://outdoornebraska.gov/wildcathills/), which has awesome scenery, run down the highway for a while, then you run along the path in front of the monument, on the dirt canal road, through the cemetery and end at Five Rocks Amphitheater. The half starts at the [Robidoux RV Park](https://www.gering.org/robidoux-rv-park), hooks up on the highway with the full and runs the same as the full. I can't remember the way the 5k goes. It's been a while.

This year is its 10th year, so you might get something cool in the swag bag. Because [Kelly Bean](https://www.kelleybean.com/) is big here, you usually get a bag of beans in your swag bag. I haven't covered the race in two years, but I can't imagine them not sticking them in.

I'm not sure if they still do it, but for the half and the full, you end up running up a hill right around the last mile. At least for the first seven years, there was a group of Sioux who played and sang at the top of the hill. It let runners know they had less than a mile to go to the finish line.

Of the two half marathons in Lincoln this one feels more like an event hosted by the city, while the Halfsy--which is another great choice with a fast course, great finish and after party--feels more like a race put on for runners.

Leprechaun Chase (10K): starts and finishes out of the SAC museum between Omaha and Lincoln. Challenging course, but has an interesting gimmick. The women get a head start (maybe 5:30?) and there's a dedicated passing lane for the men for the first congested part of the race. First to cross the finish line wins a beer for their gender. This is personally my favorite race in the area. The weather doesn't always cooperate but as a formerly fast-ish dude that passing lane makes you feel like you're absolutely flying and makes up for many of the challenges.

416,"The Rattler Half is a beautiful run in the Sandhills of Nebraska. It’s the best scenery run but I don’t know if it fits your other criteria.

The good life halfsy is a really fun half marathon in Lincoln. The vibe is pretty cool. The crowd is decent, and the city of Lincoln is great. There are a lot of runners in that race with a decent party atmosphere in the railyard after the race.

The Lincoln Half/marathon is kind of the biggest race in the state. The crowds are very large, and it’s fun. It’s a bit more on the serious side of races though, so I’m not sure if that’s what you’re into based on your criteria. The Omaha full/half is fine but not nearly the big deal that the Lincoln race is.

If you can find a team to be on, the Market to Market is one of the most unique races (relays) you’ll ever run. You run (literally) from Omaha to downtown Lincoln on a team (about 10-15 miles per person, and about 3-5 miles per leg, depending on the size of the team). It has an amazing vibe with some great views through the Nebraska countryside and over the Platte River. 

Harvest moon hustle is a nice little 10k race that you run in the evening on the trails. It’s solid, but not really that big of a race or anything.

Also, wouldnt it be easier for a rapist to carry a gun and use it to force themselves onto others if we did away with the CHP? Definitely,  more people would carry. Laws of numbers means more rapists would as well.

And to add to this... most people dont know how to use a handgun properly. They are dangerous tools. Pepper spray can be a much more effective deterent, and safer to carry. Blindness isnt something most people can power through. 9mm, on the other hand, isnt a guarantee.

573,"Unless something has changed since the 90s, I know me and many friends I grew up with moved into our own apartments during the summer we graduated at 18   

I don't think there's anything your mom can do to stop you.  The police won't be able to do much and are more than likely to busy with other shit.   if they did and you fought it the whole thing wouldnt be over until you were 19 anyhow.

 just start getting accounts in your name, save money, the real world is expensive.   

Something to invest in that will save you money.   A 6 qt crockpot is definitely a great investment. For 40 bucks.    You can make full meals for 4 people and have left over for days.   Pinterest has some great slow cooking recipes along with r/slowcooking .   Bonus you can let it cook for 8 hours while you are at work and have something made when you get home.  I've never had anything burn in a crockpot. 

 Edit - I want to add I suggest crockpot as a first appliance because you can make much healthier and better meals yourself than anything frozen or microwaveable.  You can do tons of rice and noodles with a few veggies and meat.   I just meal planned 6 meals for my family for about 30 bucks.   A quality skillet if you have a oven and then a 2 burner grill.  

Invest in quality products.   It may be more money upfront but it will last longer and perform better. This goes from clothing to vehicles.

Life is very much about accumulating what you need over decades.  Just make a list of things you need or use that your parents have and say this paycheck I'm investing in silverware, or an appliance.   If it's a more expensive item save for a few months.

The next thing I can say is it's a necessary evil get a credit card but I cannot emphasize this enough only use it when you have to and make sure you have the money to pay it off and set a hard limit for yourself like $300 and make sure you get that paid off right away.   The good thing about credit cards is it will help your credit history. Allowing for bigger and better loans in the future at better interest rates.  Use it to pay for things but immediately transfer the funds from your bank account to the CC.

Jobs.  Don't know your school history but the best advice I can give is find something with great health benefits.  Hospitals themselves have this even for kitchen and janitorial help.   

With inflation today, I pity anyone just starting out, avoid gas station and fast food jobs like the plague.  They've always been dead end jobs and where they were once great for highschoolers, they don't cut it anymore.   Ironically though runza is one of the better ones. 

But best advice you can work somewhere that sells many things for a bit of money like Walmart or you can find something that makes big money on few things.   Dealerships from cars to farm equipment to pivots construction or trenching.  Healthcare as mentioned is something good to get started in to.

Edit 2.  Insurance, not health, find something local, like shelter.  Get as many things you can be insured for from the same company you get bigger discounts.  Renters, car, life, etc.

Edit 3 - there's always going to be bills, don't forget to treat yourself every now and then",t2_hnxl9ns4,BigRedHusker_X,0,1647882805.0,0,t1_i1jwol7,i1jwol7,False,Delicious_Moose_4783,t3_tj2trs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nebraska/comments/tj2trs/toxic_home_life/,Toxic home life,/r/Nebraska/comments/tj2trs/toxic_home_life/i1jwol7/,5,r/Nebraska,0,5,0.37735382,0.25424662,0.13217646,0.396154,0.5593399,0.15827405,0.09631562

591,"I have US Cellular. Paid 94/month for unlimited everything and hotspot access. I was done paying that price because my cell needs are basic nowadays. I looked into Mint Mobile and was going to switch so I called US Cell customer service. Surprisingly they were very attentive and asked good questions about why I would switch. Said price, features needed and PRICE. Mint mobile can get me coverage at $30/month for 3 months and if it sucks I can leave no contract. US Cellular offered me a $50 discount, subsidized my iPhone installment payment and now I only pay $44 a month with same features minus personal hotspot. We’ll worth the call (do not visit a store, they have limited ability to change your bill significantly) to your provider to see if you can negotiate pricing. Worked for me and only took 15 minutes on the phone. To be fair, I was 100% serious about switching and was pleasantly surprised with the offer. It was legit too, just checked my bill for April and it’s changed from $94 to $44!  US cellular has always had ok-enough coverage where I’ve traveled so it’s worked for me!

625,"We spread manure as a kid on my Grandfathers farm over in Griswold Iowa. It works ok.. but there are issues.

\- First there just isn't enough to go around. There is not that much cow/chicken manure in relation to the total demand to replace chemical fertilizers. You are talking about covering between 1 to 1.5 billion acres of farm land in the US.

\- For one You need a manure spreader. There are not thousand of them sitting around to be utilized as they are sorta an uncommon implement. I have not seen one for years, let alone a new one.

\- you have no quality control of the manure you are getting. Will there be things like excess urea, bugs, chemicals, and other contaminants. This is a second hand product and really no quality control. This can lead to the next point.

\-  Without knowing the balance of the fertilizer you are spreading you risk crop damage from it being too ""Hot"" or on the flip side getting sold alot of dirt and it being ineffective on the targeted crop.

\- if you live near me you are not going to be happy when I put 100 tons of cow or chicken poop on my land. Even composted for a considerable time there is a very strong smell and the issues with flies galore. Also there are also some unique issue with runoff.

\- There is alot more science in this too in the use of a inorganic fertilizer. As someone mentioned there are issues with nitrate balance, retention in the soil, time from application to planting, etc.... Crops vary and what you put on is very much tuned to what you are growing.

It’s also an easy place to find volunteers. I work for a nonprofit organization and we are usually full on helpers and donors. Community is important.

859,"The short answer is...your laughter notwithstanding...yes.

It might help for you to subscribe to r/Keep_Track, which is a subreddit dedicated to keeping track of what our government is doing and why.  This excerpt is from there:

2011-2012: President Obama initiated a [drawdown](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/national-security/obamas-drawdown-in-afghanistan-will-shift-tactics-in-war/2011/06/22/AGsVJagH_story.html) of US troops in Afghanistan, withdrawing 33,000 troops. Approximately 10,000 US troops remained.

2017: President Trump [increased](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mattis-says-over-3000-additional-u-s-troops-will-deploy-to-afghanistan/) US forces in Afghanistan to about 14,000.

2019: The Afghanistan Papers, prepared by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, [revealed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/) that “senior US officials failed to tell the truth about the war in Afghanistan throughout the 18-year campaign, making rosy pronouncements they knew to be false and hiding unmistakable evidence the war had become unwinnable.”

Sept. 2019: Trump revealed that he was planning on hosting the Taliban at Camp David just 5 days before the anniversary of Sept. 11.

Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations,” Trump tweeted.

“What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn’t, they only made it worse!” Trump tweeted. “If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don’t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?”

Feb. 2020: The Trump administration and the Taliban [signed a deal](https://apnews.com/article/491544713df4879f399d0ff5523d369e) called the Doha Agreement that provided for the “withdrawal of all American and allied forces in the next 14 months” (by May 2021).

“We think we’ll be successful in the end,” [Trump] said, referring to all-Afghan peace talks and a final U.S. exit. He said he will be “meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not-too-distant future,” and described the group as “tired of war.”

Nov. 11, 2020: According to [Axios](https://www.axios.com/off-the-rails-trump-military-withdraw-afghanistan-5717012a-d55d-4819-a79f-805d5eb3c6e2.html?deepdive=1) - and more recently Bob Woodward and Robert Costa - Trump “secretly signed a memo” to withdraw all troops by Jan. 15, 2021.

The November 11 memo, [according to the authors](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/14/politics/woodward-costa-book-trump-afghanistan-memo/index.html), had been secretly drafted by two Trump loyalists and never went through the normal process for a military directive -- the secretary of defense, national security adviser and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs had all never seen it. Unpredictable, impulsive, Trump had done an end run around his whole national security team...

Milley studied the memo and announced he was heading to the White House to confront Trump. ""This is really fucked up and I'm going to see the President. I'm heading over. You guys can come or not,"" Milley told Miller and Patel, who joined him on the trip across the Potomac, according to the book… It was ""effectively a rogue memo and had no standing,"" Woodward and Costa write.

Nov. 17, 2020: Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller [announced](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/afghanistan-iraq-withdrawal-pentagon/index.html) a drawdown from 4,500 troops to 2,500 by January 15, 2021.

April 2021: Biden announced the complete withdrawal of US and NATO troops by Sept. 11, 2021, beyond the May deadline set by Trump’s Doha Agreement.

May 2021: The Taliban began moving into space created by the collapse of Afghan Armed Forces.

July 2021: Germany and Italy withdrew their troops. Fighting between Taliban and Afghan government forces intensified.

July 22, 2021: 16 House Republicans [voted against a bill](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/17/16-republicans-voted-against-special-visas-help-afghanistan-people/8163392002/) to speed the visa process for Afghan allies, like interpreters.

August 10, 2021: [Anonymous officials within the Biden administration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/10/afghanistan-intelligence-assessment/) told the media that the Taliban was likely to overrun Kabul within 30-90 days, rather than the previous intelligence assessment of 6-12 months.",t2_iwo4c,Blood_Bowl,0,1647704440.0,0,t1_i1ahoe1,i1ahoe1,False,SandhillsCanary,t3_thug5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nebraska/comments/thug5l/se_nebraskas_refined_culture/,SE Nebraska’s refined culture,/r/Nebraska/comments/thug5l/se_nebraskas_refined_culture/i1ahoe1/,16,r/Nebraska,0,16,0.19976512,0.08162732,0.17241514,0.19611187,0.03344976,0.39990866,0.020100923

961,"Maybe the smiley face wasn't about him. Maybe it was about smiling because you know that LPD will get him back safely like you've seen them before, and have far better resources than you do.  

And maybe that smile lasts for about 5 seconds before you sigh and hanging your head in sadness at all the other thoughts going through your head.  Like the fact that there's nothing you can personally do, and it bothers you as a professional and a human being to see someone basically ""back at square zero"" after so much time, effort, and expense was put into getting them help. And that now restarting is going to be harder, because they successfully slipped out once, so they'll actively be looking to do so again. And you wonder what they went through to even get to the point where inpatient treatment is necessary, and if the help he gets will stick and he'll be okay after discharge. 

Or we can go with your interpretation.  

As for me, I still think about the people I knew there and hope they're doing okay.
