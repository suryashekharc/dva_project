>Littman raises cautions about encouraging young people’s desire to transition in all instances. From the cases reviewed in her study, she concluded that what she terms “rapid-onset gender dysphoria” (ROGD) appears to be a novel condition that emerges from cohort and contagion effects and novel social pressures. From this perspective, ROSD likely exhibits an aetiology and epidemiology that is distinct from the ""classical"" cases of gender dysphoria documented in the DSM.

>Littman hypothesizes that ROGD can be cast as a maladaptive coping mechanism for other underlying mental health issues such as trauma or social maladjustment, but also for other exceptional traits like high IQ and giftedness. The peer support, prestige, and identity leveraged by the youth who proudly come out as trans certainly appears to be protective in their circles.

Biden's policies did not contribute to the oil price spike.  Let's do the math.   US has about 50 billion barrels in proven reserves, give or take.  Saudi has 266 billion, and it doesn't even have the most in the world, Venezuela does, over 300 billion.   

This does not take into account even the accessibility of the oil.  It cost more to produce oil in the US.  It doesn't take into account that the OPEC nations work together either.  The future leases that he cancelled were a non-factor.  

I think that the pandemic just delayed what was going to happen with higher fuel prices a couple of years.  The only way we will see a decline at this point is if there is a massive conservation effort, or they all get to fussing again and the OPEC countries fear loss of market shares.",t2_3tvwwwau,TheLastNameAllowed,0,1648221843.0,0,t1_i22pwjt,i22pwjt,False,programwitch,t3_tmckac,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/tmckac/prices_at_the_pumps_are_slowly_falling_in_oklahoma/,Prices at the pumps are slowly falling in Oklahoma,/r/oklahoma/comments/tmckac/prices_at_the_pumps_are_slowly_falling_in_oklahoma/i22pwjt/,1,r/oklahoma,0,1,0.06296854,0.019232545,0.074201405,0.046913452,0.017949171,0.04916771,0.020677049

167,"I know there is a lot of angst about this and rightfully so. The people who want these laws are trying to control women but under the guise of protecting the fetus. But, liberal minded people need to stop fighting the right with logic and facts because the right neither cares nor is particularly capable of understanding it. They think gut decisions are the equal to well thought out conclusions. So, how do we fight them? With the same tools they use against us.

For example:

All male children will be genetically sequenced and this information is contained in a government database. Why not female children? Well, everyone knows who the mother is. This is being done to protect future children as the mother is always known, but the father is not. I imagine someone could get Larry Ellison to do this.

When women become pregnant, they no longer have to worry about taking a man to court. but since the genetic sequencing is already available, it can be matched without having to find him. Once he is identified, the government can take child support payments out of his paycheck until said child is 21. If he is not working, he will either be jailed for not paying his child support or property is taken from him equaling whatever the payment is. Of course, we can deputize citizens to bring these deadbeats in and give the bounty hunters 10,000 dollars. Hey, it is for the sake of the child.

Once a man has fathered a said number of children, he must get a vasectomy. Won't do it? Well, you get to go to jail until you do.  Before anyone starts screaming how you cannot tell a man what to do with his body, the future child's rights trumps that of any living person's rights as established by the abortion laws.  Also, fair is fair and since women are being told what to do with their body, men need to be told the same thing because they are incapable of thinking for themselves. Virgin births simply do not happen.

I am aware this is absolutely absurd, but what is happening in Oklahoma is also completely beyond the pale. The only way to stop it is by making men hurt. Hit them in the pocketbook and in their penis.  The old saying that if men became pregnant, abortion would be drive through is true. It is imperative they are made to support any child they father with absolutely no exceptions. You use your dick, you pay the price.

178,"I lived on the outer edge near Verdigris growing up and about two years after college with my parents, so YMMV. 

  
You must have a car. After living in walkable cities with good public transportation, I realized how much I missed out on. There was nowhere I could walk or even bike to safely, not school, not the local gas station, and very few of my friends. If you have kids, you will need to drive them EVERYWHERE. I lived in Chicago for a few years, and exploring the city through bicycle and bus was eye-opening. When I returned to Claremore, I felt trapped and bored.  
The schools  lack many of the AP courses and opportunities afforded to kids in Tulsa and OKC. I was ambitious in school and was frustrated--though I did have great teachers who wrote recommendations and encouraged me to pursue external programs for arts and science, and I wouldn't be where I am today without them.

Social life revolves around the church and school. If you aren't religious or have graduated and don't have kids, it's isolating. If you live on the outer edge of Claremore, it's a chore to drive to town to join a group, or start one of your own.

Small town bigotry. Not unique to Claremore, but it's there too.

413,Interesting that last part I was not aware of. I'll have to add that to my data archives. Overall I would really like to see the USA be the tech frontier that it used to be. That is to say I would like the US to look into and fund renewable power so that our tie to foreign governments supply of power generation is cut. If we can find a way to make power without them they can no longer dangal it over our heads. But I don't see biden or any other representative ever doing such an act. There are too many lobbyists and too many obstacles to go through to actually get to that point. It would mean going through gas and oil companies in potentially making them not the happiest people in the world. Not to mention the loss of jobs from no longer doing drilling for oil or gas. The entire thing would take I would say a good 40 years. Even then after all said and done you would still have the fallout of the socioeconomical problems that come with jobs disappearing.

418,"I agree with you on the fact that new drilling on federal land should be limited. I also don’t have anything against Biden. I was just trying to be as neutral as possible in my explanation. Biden did approve more permits in his first year than Trump, but you have to consider a few key facts. First, the Biden administration has been trying to keep its promise to limit leasing of drilling rights, but these attempts have been blocked in court. Second, even though more permits were approved when you compare first years in office, the number of permits approved in 2021 was still lower than what was approved in 2020. Third, permits approved so far for 2022 have been at the lowest rate since the programs inception. 

Overall, however, this program has likely had minor influence on gas prices compared to other factors previously mentioned, and that wasn’t clear in my original write up.

Damn, they aren't wrong. Last year's income would have my family in that range, and you better believe if the voucher was a window to ensure a ""better"" education for my family, I'd take it. 

That's the thing. Most lower income families COULD qualify but the voucher may not truly cover what they needed. These schools can run into 12k a year easily - UP FRONT. 

Now, say the voucher gave 8k of that 12k. Many families like mine who may be over that 100k mark would rush in and get our kids into those ""better"" schools, forging our neighborhood public schools. Sorry, that's how the game goes. We could afford it easily with voucher.

In response to low prices, OPEC lowered their production in an attempt to increase gas prices and many of the cowboy drillers went out of business. Demand then started going up as people started traveling more and the pandemic began easing up. This left the world without the capacity to meet its oil needs. Then, of course, Russia invaded Ukraine and the world lost access to oil from one of the largest producers of it.

537,"People should have the right to do what they think is best, whether that is abortion, foster care, or keeping the child. The parents (yes parents, the father should have at least SOME say in the matter, like at minimum consulting the father if possible) shouldn't feel pressure to or not to get an abortion and they should be able to make their own decisions. 

Why is abortion seen as the only option here? 

Foster care sucks but I haven't seen anyone on either side try to improve it, is there a problem with trying to refocus the budget of the state to help children in foster homes receive better care (such as slightly increasing the budget for it or redirecting underutilized assets to it).

Why not at least try to pioneer solutions and find answers to problems instead of saying the equivalent of ""ur wrong and what ur saying hurts my feelings so die"" and start asking questions like ""what do you think of this idea"" and ""how could this work"".

A week or two ago, some MtF trans athlete was ranked 400-something in mens swimming. They transitioned and started competing against women, and they won the national championship in women's swimming. We're seeing the same thing in other sports as well, where mediocre to average dudes are transitioning and then completely destroying women in their respective sports.

614,"Is there enough research into puberty blocking to justify it? I would think it would be safer to go through puberty, and have extensive counseling and therapy, for the gender identity and the body dismorphia if that's occuring, than disrupt the hormones that are supposed to bring you into adulthood. At least until science really understands what happens to people later in life. And then trans teens/ young adults/adults can transition if they want to.

I remember watching some kind of documentary about low functioning disabled children (stay with me here) and how one set of parents wanted to give their child a shot that stunted growth so they would be able to physically handle the child as they aged. Another family had to use harnesses and contraptions to move their adult children. They actually talked to a woman who had gotten that shot as a teenager, because it was fashionable at the time for women to stay short and petite and she suffered joint and back problems because of it. (My point being, is there enough research out there for this action to be safe long term...and I don't assume you have an answer, I just wanted to bounce an idea)

> Will Rogers, the Oklahoma legend who never met a man he didn’t like, remains a beloved figure in Oklahoma, his name attached to landmarks across the state.
> 
> Another legend, ""Alfalfa Bill"" Murray, is similarly honored, though he had a long list of people he didn’t like based on race and religion. 
> 
> Both men captured headlines and the public’s fascination during the Great Depression. Rogers, referred to as “Oklahoma’s favorite son,” was a Vaudeville performer, actor and columnist whose wit won him an adoring following across the country. 
> 
> Murray, meanwhile, was elected to a four-year stint as governor in 1931, and his antics included calling the Oklahoma National Guard to seize control of the Red River bridge during a dispute with Texas. He also called out troops to shut down oil wells when drillers refused his orders to drop production as part of an effort to increase prices. 
> 
> His nickname, “Alfalfa Bill,” was bestowed on him in response to his evangelical campaigning for the crop as he sought to promote Oklahoma as a land that could support a variety of plantings. History books also note Murray, a lawyer, led in writing the Oklahoma Constitution. 
> 
> In that role, Murray did an end run around then President Theodore Roosevelt, who threatened to veto Oklahoma’s 1907 statehood if its constitution included Jim Crow laws restricting the rights of Black residents. The constitution was drafted as requested, and the first statute passed afterward by Murray established Jim Crow. 
> 
> He insisted Black residents were unable to achieve positions equal to whites, and used offensive terms to refer to Black people. At other times he suggested that those of Jewish faith be sent to a colony in Madagascar. 
> 
> Despite his legacy of hate, Murray’s name is reflected in the naming of Murray State College, Lake Murray, Lake Murray State Park, Murray County and Alfalfa County. The Alfalfa Bill Century Bike Ride is an annual fundraiser hosted for more than three decades by the Johnston County Chamber of Commerce. 
> 
> An example of how schools teach Murray’s legacy can be found on the Jenks Public Schools website, where students are told how Murray fought to help farmers “keep their lands.”  
> 
> “The people liked Alfalfa Bill,” the text reads. “But he also got into trouble sometimes. That’s because Governor Murray was outspoken. He gave people his opinion, even if they didn’t want to hear it.” 
> 
> The questions on the page ask students to explain why Murray’s experience made him a “good governor.”  
> 
> **'Alfalfa Bill' Murray's troubling legacy**
> 
> Murray and Rogers are both members of the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. A bio on Murray on the website for the Oklahoma Heritage Center makes no mention of his bigotry and oppression of Black Oklahomans. 
> 
> To date, Murray’s name has been removed only once when in 2020 Oklahoma State University renamed a building after complaints about Murray’s legacy of racism and antisemitism. That same year the Oklahoma Hall of Fame started looking at how best to handle its honoring of the former governor. 
> 
> Shannon Rich, CEO of the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, said her organization is looking at how to handle Murray’s legacy but that he remains on the list. 
> 
> “We can’t speak to the thought process or discussion that led to his induction,” Rich said. “We don’t believe today a group of his peers would select him for induction.” 
> 
> After looking at how similar matters were handled elsewhere, Rich said, the Oklahoma Hall of Fame’s board decided not to remove past inductees. 
> 
> Murray’s bigotry is noted at the end of an entry in the Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture published by the Oklahoma Historical Society.
> 
> **'A miserable old man'**
> 
> Larry O’Dell, director of development at the museum, said Murray represented a dividing line through Oklahoma in which the southeastern half identified more with the Confederate heritage of the South while the northwestern half was influenced by the anti-slavery “Jayhawkers” of Kansas and the legacy of those who fought for the Union.  
> 
> Murray also initially advocated for the southeastern half to be admitted as a separate “State of Sequoyah.” 
> 
> “He was popular for a time,” O’Dell said. “He knew constitutional law really well. He was instrumental in getting our constitution passed. And he really promoted the racial divide.” 
> 
> O’Dell said Murray’s popularity ultimately waned, but not before he was honored across the state. Despite that, only OSU has chosen to go back on its praise for Murray.  
> 
> “He became, basically, a miserable old man,” O’Dell said. “There are pockets where they are pushing back. And there are pockets that say it’s history. It's a sensitive subject.”",t2_c0mlq,programwitch,1,1648128650.0,0,t1_i1xf9zw,i1xf9zw,True,programwitch,t3_tma8sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/tma8sk/alfalfa_bill_murray_governor_celebrated_across/,"'Alfalfa Bill' Murray, governor celebrated across Oklahoma, oppressed minorities with Jim Crow laws",/r/oklahoma/comments/tma8sk/alfalfa_bill_murray_governor_celebrated_across/i1xf9zw/,3,r/oklahoma,0,3,0.35842496,0.2411935,0.6092734,0.3544692,0.21094474,0.21210565,0.0895935

What you’re saying about opinions and all seems very in-line with what many folks I know used to say; things like “what we do with our bodies is none of the governments business.” This should be applied to abortion as well: don’t like ‘em? Don’t have one, but you don’t get to say what others do (again, not YOU you, those who desire to control others). 

I know people who used to espouse this stance yet today are cheerleading the rollback of women’s rights we’re seeing in red states. It doesn’t f’ing jive. 

That’s my problem with the far right. They want to CONTROL, not govern.

Yes, housing will move to surface streets, but they are much cheaper to maintain and it is presumably that some people will choose to live closer to their employer to avoid traffic.

How much are we willing to subsidize people living this far from the city because this plan costs $5 billion across all the proposals.

On one hand...when I moved from Texas to Oklahoma some 40 years ago, Texas was retiring their turnpikes.

And REMEMBER: no state income tax in Texas...so Okies and anyone else driving the pikes were taxed at least once if not twice. Add to the fact that endless on-going pike improvements and/or construction means that drivers NEVER got a good, long, fast, non-stop drive...there are ALWAYS delays.
