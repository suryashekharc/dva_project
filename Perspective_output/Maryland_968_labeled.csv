28,"My street is very nice, 1/4 acre lots, gardens, well kept lawns, no trash, etc.  We (me and the guy across the street) even mow our vacant lot every other week.

The neighborhood adjacent to me generally has nice, but older houses, but every third house has some decaying boat or RV or fixer-upper-car parked out front (that no one ever seems to fix up, like when are you going to get around to your Mustang project bro?), but you won't find trouble there.  Fewer gardens and not as nice.  Tends to be a little more trash strewn about along the curbs and gutters, but at a level that doesn't terribly bother me.  My wife and I often take walks here on her lunchbreak.

The neighborhood opposite this consists of newer built homes with well kept but sort of sterile lawns.  Houses are big, but lots seem small because of it.  We go on walks this direction too.  

Across from this is a nice neighborhood but the homes are 80 or so years old, one of the original suburbs.  The original owners are long gone and there seems to be lots of 30-somethings moving in, and even some Gen Z'ers.  It's organic with people having built all kinds of additions, second floors, porches, with all kinds of siding, window and door styles, etc. over time.  Nothing cookie-cutter here.

Go three neighborhoods in the same direction though and it's basically suburbia's take on the projects with town houses going for 200k that would otherwise be 350k.  No one here has ever heard of gardening and I imagine they just throw their trash out the front windows.  Lots of glass around.

I have bought numerous vehicles from IAAI with salvage titles. I have had those vehicles inspected with MSP in Beltsville as well as Glen Burnie and went on to sell those vehicles. The title will still say salvage/rebuilt even after going through the inspection. 

The key is to find out if the previous owner has already went through the salvage inspection. If the title is in the name of the auction company then he has not. If he has not then you will have to go through MSP inspection in Maryland which can be about a month away to set an appointment.

Remove marrow from the bones into a mixing bowl and season with old bay and chill the mix until it starts to get firm. Scoop mixture into plastic wrap and roll it into a 2” log. Twist the ends of the plastic wrap so it kinda looks like a tootsie roll, but more bone marrow-y. Chuck it into the fridge over night.

I want to change the name of a school in a predominately black area, to something that doesn’t include a SLAVER’s name.. and you have the racist fuckin audacity to compare it to burning books, art, and murder.

So in YOUR head, the institution of slavery is the same as the teachings of Confucius?

It is almost like they want us all bickering about bullshit and to take advantage of single issue voters to suck the nations blood till it's dry. 

Both major parties don't give a shit about the general population. Otherwise Bernie Sanders would have been president by now, and even he is a millionaire with multiple homes who is disconnected with reality.

>Northern Calvert has some of the highest median income homes in the nation. And is an entirely different part of the state with different demographic than east BalCo. That’s why.

Lol. Since when has ""median income homes"" been a determining factor in drawing congressional districts and why should it be? If it were, we'd be even more gerrymandered than we are nowadays. Gibson Island (the most expensive place in Maryland) shares the same congressional district with Morrell Park and Lansdowne. 😂

As for ""demographics"", Essex, Dundalk, and Dunkirk are all majority white... if that matters to you. I personally don't see why congressional districts should be drawn up on (ahem) ""demographic"" lines.

334,"In my opinion (who is just one more random person on the internet): the judge misses the mark. People can still vote for whoever they want (republican or write in) in a gerrymandered district; people who register democrat are not obligated to only vote for the democratic candidate over others. If you take the republican talking points and extend them to their logical conclusion, you end up with advocating for a legal handicap to ensure their candidates get better-than-equal odds to elect their chosen candidate. If Maryland had closer to a 50:50 split of democrats to republicans then they'd have a point - but its closer to 2:1, so the republicans are hoping that regardless of that distribution they should get even more representation then they are due. Its their court case to argue, so they're welcome to that argument, but from my spot in the gallery that's an absurd expectation (along with the judge possibly unintentionally buying that argument). 

That said, my opinion is just that - an opinion. Its up to the courts to figure out, and the judge even acknowledges (on page 26) that this particular examination of the Free Elections Clause in the state in terms of partisanship is new territory to explore. I'm simply of the mind that the judge is wrong in this instance and (presumably) a judge with a more narrow view of the law will see that gerrymandered maps are legal.",t2_16eju2,legislative_stooge,0,1648240785.0,0,t1_i241s9b,i241s9b,False,legislative_stooge,t3_tnremv,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/tnremv/judge_declares_marylands_new_congressional_map/,"Judge declares Maryland’s new congressional map unconstitutional, seeks a do-over",/r/maryland/comments/tnremv/judge_declares_marylands_new_congressional_map/i241s9b/,2,r/maryland,0,2,0.10257828,0.018240217,0.07007007,0.13257568,0.02568424,0.021974435,0.012917101

536,">Expecting consumers to have a basic knowledge of how a product get serviced isnt some unreasonable burden.

They do have basic knowledge. They even have advanced knowledge. They can repair the equipment single-handedly in many cases. This is about the fact that companies are developing new products that are designed to detect changes, and then refuse to activate after anyone performs a repair without going to their service center. Or these companies work with parts manufacturers to force the parts to only be available to the manufacturer.

Regulation that forces companies not to make products unrepairable, or monopolize parts availability through shady business dealings, is only common sense. Personally I have yet to meet a libertarian who will support the creation of new regulations that restrict the evil things companies can do, but if there are people who wear the libertarian label and still support this, they are more than welcome to join the fight.",t2_ss358,9oo9,0,1648227060.0,0,t1_i233ei0,i233ei0,False,9oo9,t3_tnjeo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/tnjeo2/why_marylands_politicians_rejected_right_to_repair/,Why Maryland's politicians rejected Right to Repair,/r/maryland/comments/tnjeo2/why_marylands_politicians_rejected_right_to_repair/i233ei0/,2,r/maryland,0,2,0.08612799,0.024453087,0.04166551,0.07457428,0.026630761,0.053055603,0.029941415

If they design it to force you to go to their service centers, which often cannot be done in a timely manner, that is not something a reasonable person can be expected to know until it happens to them. Much like you probably don't read every ingredient on every product and then conduct tests to find out if any of them are dangerous or cancer-causing, 10 or 20 years down the line, before eating. The food would be expired by then. Similarly, these farmers need something to do their job now. They can't test replacing various parts when they buy it, and then return it after finding out the company made some fixes impossible for the end user. That information is not advertised to them, it's a secret landmine they run into when they can least afford it, often years after making the purchase.

Maryland is nothing but catch and release all day. When I used to do background checks, the number of  people let go with slaps on the wrist for assault over and over was crazy.

683,"Restricting the right of farmers to fix the machinery they own is what contradicts property rights.  
Letting the manufacturer build useless software locks whose only function is to maintain an unfair monopoly on servicing restricts property rights.

Most of the software tools needed for repair are only needed because the manufacturer has deliberately introduced unnecessary software to hinder the repair process.

I'll give you a specific example: a family member of mine is a farmer and has some newer John Deere tractors. He has two regular issues that require a dealer tech to come with nothing but a laptop to ""work"" on the tractor. This causes a ton of downtime when he needs the tractor to work immediately and causes thousands of dollars in wasted crops every year. The first issue is a dirty sensor: it's easily fixed by cleaning it so it can sense what it's meant to. Makes sense right? But Deere has a dealer exclusive program that needs to re-authorize that sensor. It won't clear the code without that dealer authorization. The other one is in a similar vein: some computers in the tractor crash and need to be restored/reset. Farmers have internet and own laptops. They could reload corrupted software. But Deere wants their cut of that completely unnecessary service call, so that's what they force farmers to do. No farmer expects their tractor company to try to screw them over like that.

They do. Baltimore schools feed students three meals per day, often during the summer as well. 

During the pandemic I would often drive by the entrance to City Springs elementary school on Lombard St where they would hand out free meals while the schools were closed. Every time I did I would see vast amounts of food just thrown out onto the sidewalk, often unopened. What a perfect visual illustration that was of the failed culture of Baltimore. 

It's fine, I no longer care. I've lived here for 20+ years and people have been arguing about the same shit for the whole time. I've accepted that nothing is going to change. I'm just ready to leave this city in the rear-view mirror while the same cycle of failure continues for another 20, 30 or 40 years.

At the same time we also experienced one of the most dramatic decreases in crime in history.

Only someone who's completely delusional believes that people are regularly being ""overcharged"" for anything in Baltimore. The police basically don't bother to do anything about a lot of property crimes. Smash & grabs from cars and package theft have basically been decriminalized. Even on the rare occasions when a thief is arrested the State's Attorney's office won't bother to pursue charges.

928,"Louis Rossmann, a prominent MacBook repair tech and advocate for the right of people to repair their equipment and electronics lobbied in favor of a bill on the topic in Maryland a couple years back. That bill would have required manufacturers to provide schematics identifying the individual parts inside their product and offer those parts for sale. CT Wilson, the delegate for the 28th district claimed this meant that companies would have to share the source code for their software and that this would lead to viruses. Louis called him out on this by recording what Wilson said and posting it with mild commentary, like he has for many legislators and lobbyists.

CT Wilson responded in the hearing for the most recent version of that bill by calling Louis's video racist and claiming he (Wilson) had received a single anonymous threatening email. He now opposes the environmental, financial, and personal freedom values of right to repair because he is angry about being shown to be uninformed and foolish.

This is just not correct. What you described is called ""local apparent noon"" which happens at a different time for every place on earth within each time zone. 

The only thing we're arguing about here is sunlight in the winter months. And in those winter months, shifting that sunlight an hour later in the day would be a healthy decision in my opinion. It would allow quite a few people and kids time to spend outdoors after their work or school day. In the top half of the country, winter sunlight hours don't even get you to and from work with sunlight anyways, so why not push it an hour and instead of it being dark on one side and dusk on the other, it could be dark in the morning and light for an hour in the evening.
