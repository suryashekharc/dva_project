20,"Here's my take on your highlights. I've lived on both sides of the State and been to a lot of the areas off the I-90 corridor. Always a grain of salt, yes?

Spearfish South Dakota

Bunkys BBQ - *Yes, their hours can be hit or miss, depends on if they run out of Que, bonus same parking lot as Crow Peak brewing.*

Leones' Creamery - *Yes, you won't be disappointed*

Killian's Tavern

Creekside Bean and Vine

The Panther (Philly Ted’s Cheesesteak & Subs) *Yes.*

*I'd suggest going to Barbacoa's too, if you like burrritos.*

*And visit Dough Trader - Best Pizza ever (cash only)*

Deadwood South Dakota - *Check out the open cut in Lead too*

Purple Pie Place

Sugar Shack - *This is way down 385, but yes you need a sugar burger in your life. Hit this on your long way down to Keystone. 385 is a beautiful drive if it isn't August full of Harleys.*

Deadwood Social Club

Creekside Campground

*Suggest = Lewies Burgers and Brews outside Lead*

Model Train

Summerset South Dakota

J.R.'s Rhodehouse BBQ PIT - *Pass, it's hit or miss*

Rapid City South Dakota

Pistachio Pie Bakery

Hotel Alex Johnson - *Meh, downtown Rapid is cool*

Murphy's Pub and Grill - *Yes, get the sausage sampler.*

Watiki Water Park - *Stay here as your base of operations in Rapid*

Old MacDonald - *Yes for the kiddos*

Storybook Island - *Kinda lame but yes kiddos, first place I'd ever seen a wheelchair accessable swingset, thought that was really cool.*

Chapel in the Hills - *Meh, I mean I got married there but it's neat for 20 minutes. Canyon lake park might be more worth your time afterwards.*

1880 Train (Outsdie Rapid City in Hill City) *really cool but you have to decide if you're boarding* o*n the hill city side or keystone. it's going to take up most of your day for the trip out an back.*

*South Dakota State Railroad Museum (also Hill City)*

*If you're in the southern Hills: Black Hills Burger and Bun Co., Custer, SD But they're like the Franklin BBQ of burger joints, they have a massive line and run out and are done for the day. Might be a huge letdown.*

*the Mud Hole*

Press Start Retro Arcade (fix it felix?) - *Yes*

Colonial House (caramel rolls)  - *Yes, everything there is good*

Armadillo's Ice Cream Shoppe

Dinosaur Park - *great for the kiddos, kinda lame, nice view of the valley, cheap hot dogs at the gift shop, nice drive up skyline drive to the top of mt rushmore drive then hit Colonial House.*

Keystone South Dakota

Rushmore Tramway Adventures! - *Kid friendly*

Cruizzers Pizza

*Suggest - Get some saltwater taffy and fudge in town. You're going to go to Mt. Rushmore right? Do the badlands loop before you leave, or make that your drive back to Rapid from Keystone*

Murdo South Dakota - *Just keep driving, seriously. You should have spent time on the badlands loop. At least you skipped Wall Drug. You skipped Wall Drug right?*

Murdo's Drive-In - *There's a drive in? The best thing in Murdo is the spa tub king rooms in the Super8.*

Chamberlain South Dakota - *Nope, just Arby's and get gas. But stop at the rest area, really awesome statue, informative displays.*

Old West Trading Post

Arrowwood Resort & Conference Center at Cedar Shore

the Smoking Mule

Jalapeno Popper Grilled Cheese (Bread and Batter)

The Depot - *Nah, kinda lame bar food*

Ethan South Dakota

Farm Life Creamery

Souix Falls South Dakota

Phillips Avenue Diner - *Over rated, but chicken and waffles.*

Benson's Flea Market

Falls Park (Waterfalls) and Cafe. *Worth your time*

Porter Sculpture Park (Montrose just outside Sioux falls)

Moschell Farms (Fedora just outside Montrose)

Look’s Marketplace - *Yes, great food, market is spendy but they have really nice stuff and quality things.*

Grille 26 - *Meh, date night? They're hyped like Minerva's*

The Pickle Barrel - *They have great sandwiches, so does Gregg's Substation, I'm partial to Gregg's*

Bread & Circus Sandwich Kitchen - *Everybody loves this place, so will you.*

""Even if you don’t have a medical marijuana card, the decision was made that on low level, low quantity offenses, it’s a waste of resources to try and enforce the very, very complicated version of medical marijuana that was passed by the voter,"" Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead said.

Under the state statute that takes effect Thursday, medical marijuana card holders or anyone with a recommendation to use cannabis from a medical professional can possess up to three ounces of cannabis at once. It also allows someone arrested for marijuana possession to have charges dismissed if they can obtain a doctor's recommendation after the fact.

it's in the best interest of Minnehaha County taxpayers not to pursue convictions for low-level marijuana crimes, he said.

Non-resident marijuana ID cards will also be honored, and tribal members who have a tribal-issued medical marijuana ID card will also be protected from arrest if they possess three ounces or less of cannabis.""

Maybe you should get a better job if you can't afford gasoline...

I want to understand how much you could possibly be driving that a 25% increase in has prices is going to break you.  Door dash? Pizza delivery? 

Do you realize that there is a finite amount of fossil fuels on this earth? That means that literally the only thing that gas prices can do is increase as you literally burn it all away idling In the drive through at wendys... 

Lastly, the government already does subsidize gasoline.  It's called ethanol and they pay farmers millions to grow corn so they can stuff it in your gas tank instead of eating it.  They have also given millions of dollars in bailout money to the oil companies that profit off of high gas prices.

Do you think any of the major oil companies will be losing money this year with high gas prices? The answer is no, they will make record profits and you will be the one losing money.

And this insinuation that your security issues are because the Mayor and cops are “working with a ‘dark money’ non profit” says a lot more about you than anything.  “Natives killing Natives”?   WTF is that even suppose to mean?  Imply?   I’d like to know.  

You don’t have to read between the lines to far to get the feeling that those representing Grand Gateway feel like the true victims here.  I mean, I get it.  This shooting is likely something no one other than the shooter could have prevented.  I don’t know.

Also, hit up Pure Bean coffee shop downtown. Their coffee, tea, Italian sodas, etc, are all incredible, and they have allergy friendly food options if you have any of those to think about. The staff is incredibly friendly and very willing to give directions, tips about the area, etc. Also, they often host really fun activities on Fridays.

I don't think our Secretary of state site has any payment form on it, and I'm damn sure the security team at BIT hasn't degraded to the point to where they'd allow devs to store CC information since I moved on from there.  I don't even know what purpose this is for, especially since the state will likely tell this moron to fuck off if he is trying to bring private auditors in to look at protected citizen information.

815,"Here is a good quote that sums up this grifter:

>Frank uses the number of registered voters by age group and prior voter trends to predict voter turnout, then claims it is evidence of fraud when it aligns with actual voter turnout. Put another way: Frank's analysis finds that age groups with more people have more people who vote, which Frank then interprets as fraud, Grimmer said.

[https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/politics/douglas-frank-big-lie/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/politics/douglas-frank-big-lie/index.html)

Frank is totally out of his element and anyone who has looked into this data has reached the same conclusion - that Frank is simply wrong.  Granted even Frank hasn't bothered to provide any actual evidence for his claims nor has he shown a single case of a ballot being cast illegally.

That's probably why his claims were rated ""Pants on Fire"" by Politifact.  But who are we kidding, Trumpers don't care about facts, evidence, or logic.  They just believe what they believe and somehow believing that thousands and thousands of pro-Biden agents infiltrated government offices and bypassed election security on dozens of different voting systems and managed to change millions of votes across hundreds of different counties in their favor without leaving a single shred of evidence and without a single one of these people blowing the whistle somehow makes more sense than believing that Donald Trump just lost an election.  Neat.

I want to try weaning off fentanyl and if necessary, use medical marijuana instead. My doctor can’t approve me for a MMJ card because the hospital system she works for hasn’t given any doctors permission to do so. The other major hospital system in Sioux Falls also hasn’t given their MD’s permission either. These 2 hospital systems cover pretty much the entire state. Therefore, I have to stay on fentanyl instead of using something that isn’t made in a laboratory and can’t kill me! You do have another option, however, and this is what I did.

The Flandreau Indian Reservation has made medical MMJ legal. They’re located about 1/2 hr north of Sioux Falls. Their requirements for a card are much lower. You can go there with your ND card, present it to them, and they will give you a card. The dispensary is always fully stocked and the staff very helpful. There is also plenty of security present.

931,"Big no on that losing deal. We as a state already have enough counties with aging and decreasing populations. We certainly are not in need of another 20+ counties with less than 10K people each.

Looking at the counties involved MN still retains roughly 72% of its population and SD gets stuck with 1.6M  of MNs aging populace along with burden of maintaining and modernizing even more rural infrastructure. The Brain drain would continue with youth emigrating to the Cities (Twin on the east side, Grand Forks up North,  Fargo in the Central East, and Sioux Falls in South East). So we take on more burden without additional benefit especially since we already get more than a fair share of youth transplants from the SE parts of Minnesota today.

There's not even much of a political play here since MN would lose 2 House reps that are already Republican and SD would gain two seats which would more than likely be Republican.

Maybe the goal is a long play to try and safeguard these seats from population decay in the rural areas as the growing cities become more and more like Chicagoland in relation to Illinois?
