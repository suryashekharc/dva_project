2,"I mean, the problem is there aren't enough beds in Montana facilities to handle all the kids that need residential treatment options, or even day treatment options (like schools for kids who can't be in mainstream schools until their behavioral issues are under control).  More day treatment programs would allow more kids to be helped before they reach the point where they need residential treatment.

And the other problem is that we allow for-profit companies to run residential treatment facilities, which is a recipe for cost cutting and bad outcomes.

A lot of these kids need real support and help, and they're not going to get it at places who hire any random person who will work for the lowest wage offered because they don't have other options for better employment.

70,"Hiking season doesn't really start until June for higher elevations. Better luck trying for something lower elevation in Madison county, towards Helena, or south Bozeman.

Most hiking around Big Sky or around 6k feet in elevation are going to still have snow in shaded areas and you'll be post holing much of the way. Or they will be muddy and you'll mess up the trail. 

If you're new to hiking you should start on easier trails, plenty of easy trails around Hyalite to build up your endurance and a ton of people around so going alone is pretty safe there. Big Sky hikes are generally steeper and more difficult. The #1 mistake I see new hikers make is not carrying bear spray or having enough water. Usually I go with about 1 to 1.5 liters for every 5 miles depending on the temperature outside.

98,"""Very dangerous"" is an overstatement and the dangers that do exist are easily mitigated.   


I have never heard of a hiking group. People usually just invite 1 or more friends to go on a hike. I've spent countless hours hiking alone also.   


Some tips:

\-plan your hike using all trails or some other app or book. Let someone know where you are going, when you plan to return, and don't deviate from that plan. If you don't return, they can tell search & rescue where to look.  Use a GPS device or phone app to track your hike in case you lose track of direction.  Bring spare batteries or a portable charger/battery pack. You can also get a SPOT sattellite locator, but it's really not necessary if someone knows where you'll be and you don't go off trail.   


\- start short and on frequently traveled trails.  You can train on a stair machine at the gym, but uneven footing and grades wear you out quicker.  Avoid trails or sections with loose footing and steep dropoffs. 

\- carry more water than you think you need, high protein snacks, and a basic survival kit including a good mylar emergency blanket, firestarter, a lifestraw, knife, paracord, spare batteries & whistle (3 short blasts periodically is the signal for help). There are plenty of other things you can pack, but these will get you through a cold night if you're lost in the woods.   


\- dress with warm, layered clothes. Expect to shed layers shortly after you start.  Wool underlayers are best (cotton kills), but you also want a waterproof outerlayer in case a sudden storm rolls in. I like softshell outerlayers for breathability. Get some wool socks,  good hightop boots that support your ankles, and wear them around to break them in before hitting the trail.  Toss some moleskin in your pack in case you start forming blisters. 

\- get some bear spray and learn how to use it. Make loud noises periodically and you'll probably never see a live bear. I wear a whistle on a lanyard and blow it once in awhile. Some people like bear bells, I don't.

You will stare at that same farm house for eternity wondering when on earth it actually will get closer. You really cannot understand until you've done it.

You will litterally be stuck in traffic jams of the Bovine Kind, be patient and slowly work your way through

Time moves at a different pace in Rural Montana, people like to chat and take their time, it's really hard to meet a stranger and at times hard to get things done.

Always wave when driving past someone on a dirt road. If their window is rolled down and head sticking out,  stop and chat.

Outdoors will be all you can do, so if you want to Bird, Big Game Hunt or Fish it will be amazing. If you are into Science there is a Dinosaur dig of immense proportions up that way, we also have a dinosaur trail in Montana  where you can visit local quirky museums, they are far apart though :P

You will pay probably double for goods that you do where you are, so take that into account, honestly it would be an adventure and that's the way you have to look at it.

Fly into Billings, rent a car and spend a week driving around and seeing if it's for you. I've met some people from out of state who love the eastern part, I grew up west right in the Rockies so I could never live there, no way in hell.

Yes people are conservative in a far different way than when I grew up, but Montanans are still pretty broad minded (Always been untrusting of the feds though) and you would be surprised how much farther you can go into conversations when you give it a go, but only if you show your worth by working.

I described it as 'reheated Chung King from a can'.

I couldn't finish any of it.

The 'old fashioned' was the smallest, blandest, warmest mixed drink I've ever been served. A single shot glass with what I think was really cheap whisky and some cherry juice, served warm.

Don't take this personal, it's just how fast Montana is growing. Montana was not established enough to handle the people moving here. Now people are moving from bigger cities where $2000 a month for rent and $350,000 homes actually sound cheap. People are just filling up the rentals and buying up the houses. People who have been here saving up or just starting their life just got a 50% increase on any house they were looking to buy.

Most of us feel either underrepresented at best and unrepresented at worst by our politicians, alot of whom have come from our of state, and then aim to do distinctly un-Montanan things, like our Governor's desire and campaign goals to privitize public land. Despite living here for like, 20 years the out of touch billionaire still doesn't understand what's important to the people who live here. So some people, myself included at times, have ended up taking out our frustrations and feelings of powerlessness by lashing out at people who we view as coming here for the same reasons.

On the flipside, If you had a major life change and decided not to move here, it wouldn't change or stem the flow of people moving here.  You have to do what's best for you and your growing family.

The other part is you asked internet strangers for advice.  That advice is always taking the good with the bad.

386,"I agree with this comment. Growing up in Butte in the 90s was rough. We dealt with quite a bit of harassment and vadalism living near the Vu Villa Bar. But once the locals accepted my family (after 20 years), they take care of her (mom) like their own. I feel safe knowing mom has a great community.

622,"Yes, but it still works out as more efficient, which means running costs are lower and the car is more environmentally friendly.

It's not just the relative efficiencies of the motors, either.  Electric drivetrains are mechanically simpler, do not need to be idled like internal combustion engines, and can be used as generators in regenerative braking.

Think about a semi truck on a long 6% grade.  A diesel truck needs to worry about brake system overheat, maximize their engine braking, etc.  An electric one just charges its batteries and maxes out the regeneration system going down the hill.

There are three big disadvantages of electric drivetrains - cost, weight, and charge time.  But we will get to the point where an electric truck can run for eight plus hours straight, then charge back up in another eight, making long distance hauling practical and affordable.  The running costs are just so much lower - no filter or oil changes, little regular maintenance beyond tires and wiper blades and wheel bearings, fuel is less expensive.",t2_otv30,sampjennings,0,1647640294.0,0,t1_i17i3yh,i17i3yh,False,Sturnella2017,t3_tdpduk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/tdpduk/some_context_for_the_surge_in_gas_prices/,Some context for the surge in gas prices,/r/Montana/comments/tdpduk/some_context_for_the_surge_in_gas_prices/i17i3yh/,2,r/Montana,0,2,0.023296634,0.0063445,0.016079102,0.013255201,0.0052456525,0.016476287,0.008102078

716,"I'm not doubting it. But you'd be one of the first from /r/vexillology to actually have some claim to a reason to take an interest in our flag (though you did pivot pretty immediately to Virginia, so I'm not 100%). But regardless, the flag needs to take a lot of symbology and meaning on, which requires input and conversation. Just throwing one out there will never please people.

You've at least given it more gravitas than 90% of the rest of the submissions we've downvoted here which are just variations on [Charlie Brown's shirt](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hujUtpERL._AC_UY1000_.jpg). (seriously, search this subreddit for flag, and it's mostly Charlie Brown's shirt) so I'll give you credit there. And you've at least honored a few of the elements of the flag we already like, like the colors. That would be important.

But what flag people really need to do is look at what we like about the old flag, and are those elements that can be made into a flag with good design principles.

But honestly, I question those principles as well. If I show [this flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3AFlag_of_Montana.svg) to a random person and ask them ""who's flag is that?"", 100% of those that can read will answer correctly.

If I show them [this flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Alabama.svg/640px-Flag_of_Alabama.svg.png), and ask ""who's flag is that?"" ... despite adhering to all the good flag design principles, who outside of Alabama could answer correctly? What percentage of Alabamans could even identify it?

Where do you and your arrogant flag nerds get off? What is this colonial arrogance you people have that you think you can spend an hour on fucking MS Paint, and we'll all clap like seals for you?

You know what? Maybe Montana does need a new flag. 

But you know what else? We have actual graphic designers, real artists and people knowledgeable about history, culture, and symbology right here in Montana. People who would actually think to reach out first, and would care about what we want.

861,"I am not trying to be nasty at all, but the cold weather experience of a recreational snowboarder is really not much compared to living and self-sustaining in 'seasonally accessible areas' where the temps can drop well below zero and stay there for days/months on end. I just got back from camping at a higher elevation where the temps still got down to 3 degrees at night in MID MARCH and there was still several feet of snow! I have been a backcountry skier and camper in MT for a lot of my life, and I would not base my ability to live off the grid in the mountains in winter on that limited experience with snow. Winter driving is no joke. Sub-zero weather is no joke. We are talking weather where if you get stuck and there is no one to help you and you haven't covered ALL of your skin, you will get serious cold-related injuries with less than 5 minutes of exposure. Even if you are covered, you could still easily die of exposure.  Like, you could actually lose a finger or toe/your nose/a limb/die. Even exposure in 14/15 degree weather can become lethal pretty quickly. Or, you get your clothes wet and get stuck in the elements and it is 35/40 degrees? yeah, you can absolutely still get severe hypothermia and die.

**So to answer your earlier question - ""what's the worst that can happen?"":** This is not just 'kinda cold' weather. Kids who grow up in Montana learn about this. Decisions you make in winter conditions can literally be life or death, and if you are unfamiliar with them, I would think twice. You could be faced with avalanches, hypothermia, frostbite, frozen water pipes, dehydration, and the general hazards of driving in winter. If you slide off the road and it is -20 degrees out and you are MILES away from help, who is going to help you? You are. And if you don't have years of winter experience, you likely won't be able to do much. Even my mountain-man, native Montanan dad will not touch a property like that. 

This is not something that you just 'try out'. You need to take classes in winter survival, probably some avalanche training, wilderness first responder stuff, and then practice for years before putting yourself in a survival environment for the entire winter. To me, it sounds like you guys might be trying to Christopher McCandless it... I would not recommend.  

There are actually really nice places to live in Montana with good communities/schools/wilderness access...whatever you are looking for. My family and I are exploring buying more land in MT for my dad's retirement retreat where he can just hang out and not talk to anyone lol (3rd gen Montanan here, before anyone comes at me hahaha). BUT we would 100% stay away from seasonably usable land. Getting power there? nearly impossible. Failure with your generator or solar grid or any other life-maintaining infrastructure? Quite possibly dying of exposure. I hate winter driving and I literally grew up doing it. Not trying to drive you away, but please be realistic about this!

916,"Not all oil is extracted from shale in the U.S. (or Canada for that matter). Oil from the Gulf of Mexico, most of Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, coast of California, etc. is not extracted from shale. The old rule of thumb was oil from shale was profitable once the price of crude oil was > $60 a barrel. The # is probably higher today. I'm guessing it's closer to $70. The price of crude oil has come down since March 8th ($123) and now around $95/barrel.

Another point though is what can be refined from oil, and in this department I'm not as well versed. I know the oil companies love oil from North Dakota for some reason. A barrel there can be processed into different byproducts, as I understand it. And another byproduct of producing oil from shale is natural gas. While still bad for the environment, burning natural gas for energy results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2) than burning coal or petroleum products to produce an equal amount of energy. So, everyone keeps talking about electric cars. Electricity still requires fossil fuels to power them (for the most part). If we want to ween people off of fossil fuels and improve the environment, we should probably do what T. Boone Pickens once suggested and convert all large trucks in America to burn natural gas. And while we are at it, convert all electric power plants to burn natural gas, too and do away with coal. After 20 years and after the technology improves, then convert all large trucks to hydrogen fuel. But that's my opinion.",t2_c8jut7n4,BipBippadotta,0,1647356633.0,0,t1_i0r98pe,i0r98pe,False,Sturnella2017,t3_tdpduk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/tdpduk/some_context_for_the_surge_in_gas_prices/,Some context for the surge in gas prices,/r/Montana/comments/tdpduk/some_context_for_the_surge_in_gas_prices/i0r98pe/,2,r/Montana,0,2,0.052166734,0.0091626635,0.031734418,0.02602271,0.011207829,0.04054351,0.008072748
