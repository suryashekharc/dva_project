But...
We offer a lot to do! The food game here is great! I have traveled in and out of the US a lot (and I'm not talking about ""just"" Mexico) and eaten at numerous Michelin star restaurants. Given that we are a landlocked state, I am impressed with what the chefs here create! We have an amazing immigrant population, who bring with them their food culture - Vietnamese, Hmong, Mexican, and more! Of course we aren't NYC or San Fran, but we have a lot of really good options.

We are child-free and opted out of the corporate environment early. Living in a medium cost of living state helped us do that. We have Como Zoo and the Arboretum (both free!), MN Zoo, the Walker, MIA, MOA (debatable on whether that's something to be proud of but it's a great walking track in the winter), great concert venues with a population big enough to pull in fun names, Concerts at MN Zoo, a great orchestra in St Paul, fantastic theaters, Broadway shows that swing through, more volunteer opportunities than you can shake a stick at.

We have 4 downhill skihills within about an hour (sure, we can't compete with ""real"" mountains), cross country trails, snowshoe trails, lakes to swim at, sail in, waterski on, hiking trails abound!

If you can't see the many wonderful things our state offers despite our weaknesses, it's a shame. Thank you for ""making"" me list out many of the reasons we still live here.

385,"if you want a long, boring life - stay in mn - however, it's def. not everyone's cup of tea, and frankly fucking boring, the food is bland / sucks, appreciation of culture is hunting season, and the underlying homophobia (let alone racism) is everywhere.  

all of which are fine, but many would rather have a shorter life that's more exciting and cultured than a long banal one.  my idea of ""purpose"" isn't in popping out kids and attending their sports activities - jesus christ, i doubt this is purpose for most people.

edit: to add / make my point since it seems people have trouble understanding comparisons here, and i can't reply to anyone under me for some reason - 

Certain soviet era subs have a pool inside for worker leisure - however, it's obviously small and shitty, and less of a pool and more like jacuzzi sized - of course there are decent restaurants in the twin cities, but the vast majority of people think olive garden, pf changs, and such is ""good"" - which is fine, but relatively speaking the twin cities has nothing, and it's delusional to think such if you've lived in other metro areas of seattle, portland, boston, etc.

case in point: my school friends, the only museum they've been to was the walker art center - and they only went there during a school field trip.  of course, this is fine - but this is the general mentality.  and the response I've gotten here - really question yourself why you are being so defensive here, you know this is true if you've lived in other cities.

yikes, quite obvious.

edit: also, please note i actually can't respond to the below posters, they've blocked me so i can't respond.  how ironic and a perfect example of the people here.

-i still can't reply to anyone.  putting the suicide hotline below is a bit much, don't ya think?  even to me that's kinda below the belt, you're essentially weaponizing the hotline as a rhetorical term to make fun of someone.  I'm sure that people that actually need that find that kind of offensive, you'd think.  Well, I'm not sure if you are thinking much on this to engage in that activity.

Yikes, whatever the case this simply shows that I was spot-on and some people can't accept what I wrote has any relation to reality.  I use the terms ""fine"" simply to illustrate the subjectivity inherent hereign, ie if you like minnesota then good for you - but it's trash in many things that people value, and that many of the people posting here negatively probably don't understand it because they lack any common frame of reference (ie, never lived out of state, never been to a five diamond, never been to the MET, etc)  it's still a boring ass state to live in with boring ass people and 20 year olds who act like they're 50, etc.

432,"Not a friend of police personally (check my post history) but I do have to say the entire situation really made me wonder whether it was planned somehow to do exactly it was doing - I've been to many protests, and this one seemed very very far off, both the protesters, where the showed up, etc.  

The police in the beginning weren't terrible, they did get worse as time went on, but given what some of the wackjobs from the other side were doing it was understandable.  

People who have never been to a protest - please go to one.  The amount of crazy people in the protests - i'd always guess it's at least 10-20%, like crazy people who are there to just break shit and if they could shoot everyone else there.  I used to say that everytime a normie goes to a protest is the time when one more person wants to bring back institutionalization of mentally ill people -

the amount of crazies at this one in particular was at least HALF.

One thing I've always despised about the state - I have to say - is how pro-police everyone is, the free hand prosecutors have (particularly in the more rural counties) etc.  That doesn't change what actually happened at these protests however - and it wasn't the cops who are entirely at fault. can't believe i'm saying this but it's true.

as far as the person i replied to, this sub is largely astroturfed, like most local state subreddits seem to be these days - don't take it too personally, which you probably already know.  i'm wondering whether the majority of reddit is basically bots these days, from the ukraine coverage being entirely one-sided to any subject almost -",t2_igrc7gz9,TooColdddd,0,1648228978.0,0,t1_i238d32,i238d32,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_tnjdu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/tnjdu1/the_secret_police_inside_the_app_minnesota_police/,The secret police: Inside the app Minnesota police used to collect data on journalists at protests,/r/minnesota/comments/tnjdu1/the_secret_police_inside_the_app_minnesota_police/i238d32/,-5,r/minnesota,0,-5,0.49529928,0.3476594,0.39307478,0.5513571,0.62088186,0.6577575,0.16435023

2. Too European, Nordic culture is important, but doesn't represent MN as a whole, especially as we reexamine colonialism's role in history.  Besides, four colors are too much IMHO.  Star's offset placement doesn't make sense to me given how the flag is already sectioned.
3. Best of the four but needs to be polished a little.   I like the star/snowflake concept though, although it may be a little too on the nose.  Something about the exact color choices bothers me a little but I can't name what I'm feeling.  I could live with this one though.
4. I don't understand the color choices.  I get the shape references the state but seems too pointy, like a pennant flag with an overbite.

It's always been a cat and mouse game between doctors and insurers.

Then, on denial, the doctor will edit what they said to make it fit, and re-submit, hoping to get that payment.   This has been the way for decades.

Every hospital has legions of folks working behind the scenes to make sure the claims go out clean, in a way that will be paid.

That said, I'm not sure that insurance is the right source of funding for addiction treatment.    There's extra taxes on alcohol.    Those taxes should go to fund treatment, to be available to anyone.  For opiate addictions, we've been clawing back some money from the pharmaceutical companies that greatly contributed, those settlements should go to treatment.

An addict will give up paying on insurance long before they go to treatment.  Many of them may also be off their parent's plans, or have no one in their lives to contribute.

If they aren’t progressing quickly enough it is deemed unhelpful and they’re denied.  If they are progressing too quickly they are deemed “ready to step into a lower level of care.”

I’ve had teenagers with intravenous opiate addictions who get approved 14 days of residential care and are told they’re ready to go back to their home environments.  That’s barely enough time to withdraw and start to stabilize let alone learn the skills necessary to function.  Their disease also literally convinces them that they are managing life successfully under the influence despite consequences; they’ve been reinforcing this idea daily for who knows how long.  For some people, decades.  And they expect us to reverse all that in two weeks and have them feel motivated to make positive change?  Fuck them.

They also tell families they will cover “whatever is needed as long as they meet criteria.”  Of course a family that had found their unconscious loved one in a pool of their own vomit having a seizure is going to see their loved one as “meeting criteria” but after 5 days they’re deemed “stable” by insurance and no longer in active withdrawal so they’re denied coverage.

698,">And it usually affected the less fortunate more so than the wealthy.

Pretty much every single house built before 1925 in the Twin Cities used lead service lines, no matter how upscale the house was. A huge advantage of lead is its flexibility, preventing breaks after continued freeze/thaw cycles.

Economic status obviously has affected replacement rates since then though.


>I believe it was known lead was very bad, but people didn't care.

Eh, everyone knew lead was bad, but the amount of acceptable exposure was thought to be higher. 

Do the lines need to be replaced? Of course. At the same time, there's many very critical needs for limited dollars avaliable and the situation here in the Twin Cities doesn't justify the huge expense of a crash replacement program. What happened in Flint won't happen here and our lead lines are well-protected from direct water contact. Our local leaders aren't too cheap and shortsighted to skip spending $188K a year, which was the cost of the corrosion inhibitors that the caretaker group decided not to use.

712,"What you're saying is not wrong and shouldn't be looked at as misinformation. The mayor of Edina even said higher density housing helps subsidize areas with single-family housing:

>So what does height and density do for you in some circumstances? If we’re doing it in 7 percent of our land area, out in the Southdale district primarily, how does that help all of us that are living in single-family homes? Well, here’s the way it helps.

>The average single-family home—the median priced home in Edina, $550,000, might generate 5 dollars and 50 cents a square foot in property tax. A multifamily dwelling out in the Southdale district with some height to it might generate at least twice or more than twice that amount per square foot. I view that as a subsidy for single-family homeownership, and I also view it as a way of helping us pay for everything we own together, without putting the burden on all the single-family homeowners.”

Jobs will always be a challenge unless you are really adaptable to what is lacking and what you can fill gaps in with. But housing is a more troublesome situation right now, at least where we are, and from here down to Duluth for sure. Everyone else is looking for the same thing: modest house with land. Being a buyer right now sucks. Building also sucks because being in the sticks, it costs a fortune to get someone to come build, and local places are all very small businesses that are booked 2 years out (and take sometimes a year to finish a project due to low staffing). So even if you intend to move your business, be cautious on the housing market at least in some areas right now. Because so many people are buying homes, and trying to build homes, decks, garages etc, your skills are probably valued anywhere. The caveat to that is it can be hard to break into small towns and get them to trust someone from out of town.",t2_137tcs,KimBrrr1975,0,1648173027.0,0,t1_i20g09b,i20g09b,True,robcampos4,t3_tm94qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/tm94qt/rural_minnesota_jobs/,Rural Minnesota Jobs,/r/minnesota/comments/tm94qt/rural_minnesota_jobs/i20g09b/,1,r/minnesota,0,1,0.27620482,0.122642785,0.065873116,0.31121528,0.2737659,0.078461334,0.15727207
