Say you‚Äôre making $25/hr.

That‚Äôs $1000/week‚Ä¶and if you do a 50 hour work week, that‚Äôs $1375.

Under the 32 hour model, that would be $800‚Ä¶.but do that same 50 hours and comes out to $1475‚Ä¶.$100 more for the same hours.

OR, what your employer could do is not be a piece of shit and say that your $25/hr under a 40 hour work week is $1000‚Ä¶.that same $1000 on a 32-hour work week is $31.25.

Now‚Ä¶under the new 32 hour model and your re-calculated hourly wage, you‚Äôre a hard worker and do the same 10 hours of overtime:

$31.25/hr @ 32 hours is your $1000

$46.88/ (overtime rate) @ 10 hours is $468.80

Your gross pay for 42 hours is $1468.80

Oh look‚Ä¶you worked 2 more hours and got paid almost $400 more under the new 32-hour work week compared to the 40-hour work week.",t2_14hz1d,ItsjustJim621,0,1648273131.0,0,t1_i25uid7,i25uid7,False,gvillepa,t3_tnm6mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tnm6mb/4day_32hour_workweek_for_pa_employees_proposed/,"4-Day, 32-Hour Workweek For PA Employees Proposed.",/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tnm6mb/4day_32hour_workweek_for_pa_employees_proposed/i25uid7/,7,r/Pennsylvania,0,7,0.5154597,0.34273994,0.108127356,0.4687376,0.6961591,0.08884328,0.05841143

The leave is nice, won't deny that.

The medical benefits are nice but there are many places that have close levels... and as a single person with no kids it isn't as important. now, as I get older, yes it is going to be more important.

322,"Posted this elsewhere in this thread...

Vests have a five year expiration because they‚Äôre typically warrantied for five years from the manufacturer. So the manufacturer will only guarantee that they actually work for five years. Of course as I said it‚Äôs not like they disintegrate at 5 years and one day. On one hand I do absolutely think it‚Äôs a money making thing. On the other hand these things take a beating since they‚Äôre worn every single day for 8+ hours. So all the sweat, rain/water, and general wear and tear from moving around does make them a little rank after several years. I‚Äôll liken it to sneakers. A good pair of sneakers can last a few years but after a while they just get kind of worn out. Of course you can still wear them, but they‚Äôll be old, rank, worn, frayed, etc. with something as important as a bullet proof vest, you don‚Äôt want to take any chances.

538,"Prior to Covid - yes, I can say there were more Liberal anti vaxxers. This originated from false beliefs that MMR Vaccines caused autism. (Falsely)  This led to an uptick in Measles cases and deaths which were sadly preventable. 

However,  even in the early 2000s the data is skewed as there was also another fringe group out there of antivaxxers. The survivalist, ""off grid"" population.  These people do not vaccinate and do not participate in surveys- are not ""counted"" . And they are Right Wing. 

Today- the largest % of anti - vaxxers is Republican.  

I am a Nurse so it is not just the mandating of the vaccines that the Right objects to. They claim their natural immunity is enough to protect them. Totally different story when they are just about to get intubated though.  They claim that there are ""dangerous chemicals"" in the vaccines (the same ones they praised while being developed under the Trump administration) And this has been a GOP hot button topic of opposition since Trump was no longer in office.  

So- what started out as liberal holistic medicine leaning anti vaxxers has morphed into Right wing propagandizing of the Covid vaccine. I suspect if a Republican was going to be exposed to anthrax or ebola they would have no issue getting vaccinated and they would not depend on their ""superior natural immunity"" to protect them .

588,"My mistake it was an anchor from NBC rather than CNN, a nearly identical far-left ad-funded sensationalism source, who came up with this phrase. CNN coined ""fiery but mostly peaceful protests"" which was even more ridiculous

>Second, that's not what it means and you know it. 

Sure it mostly means the more vulgar thing, but the point was that a far left news source coined it and is responsible for its spread. At least it isn't *explicitly* vulgar. I *wish* that the ""F--- Donald Trump"" crowd had switched to something less vulgar too

>Third, anyone who's even tangentially aware of politics has seen or heard the phrase and is undoubtedly aware of its meaning, if not its origin

Including children who were exposed to F-bombs by the ""F--- Donald Trump"" crowd but not by the ""Let's Go Brandon"" crowd?

It took a while but I found an actual poll here. 58% of Americans are familiar with the phrase, about half. At least half of the population thankfully hasn't been drawn into toxic politics yet

https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/poll-americans-say-lets-go-brandon-chant-is-appropriate-protest/

Also **76%** of those familiar with the phrase feel it's an *appropriate* way to protest, implying even a slight majority of *liberals* are able to recognize this is preferable to the vulgar version.

>Fourth, great job at deflecting while completely discounting birtherism... Acting as if people go to Trump rallies to unwind is laughable.

Who's talking about *political rallies?* I'm talking about the assholes who chanted political stuff at *sports events, concerts, night clubs*, and other **entertainment**. People can say whatever stupid things they want at a rally, because attendees there signed up for that. People at **entertainment** events did not.

This article misses the biggest issue. No one is going to jail on possession of marijuana (unless its a violation of probation for some other charge). The issue is the DUI law. The law prevailing before medical marijuana was that ANY amount of marijuana in your system is a DUI even if you ARE NOT impaired. The medical marijuana law didn't address DUIs directly. So now we have a county by county debate with every judge to convince them the law changed that. It's not ended up consistent so far.

Now marijuana possession under 30 grams has only a 30 day potential jail sentence. (A lot of traffic violations in Title 75 have a 90 day maximum sentence; bet you didn't know that.) And you're most likely not getting jail; you'll get a fine. But the bag that's holding the marijuana? The bong you smoke it in? The lighter, even, that you use to light your joint?

796,"Your mileage may vary.

This isn't my experience, at least not entirely. There are people who might learn I'm not religious and get on my case about ""praying for me"" or asking me to come to church. And then I avoid those people.  There are people who have made their political affiliations their entire identity; if they can't exist in the world without being obnoxious about it, I'm going to avoid them too. Great example: Boop's Gun Shop in Mifflinburg. I went to buy a shotgun there about a year ago.  Somehow because I was wearing a mask at a time when masks were entirely appropriate, they figured I was a liberal and the owner and another customer started giving me shit.  Cool.  I'll do my gun shopping elsewhere. End of transaction.

But on the whole I think we've let religion and politics become way too big a part of our daily lives and of our outward-facing identities. I honestly don't get the sense that the majority of people want to live their lives with those two very personal, deep issues playing a central role in their everyday interactions.

833,"Honestly?  I obsess about minor things to make people's lives a little easier.  When dining with my family in restaurants, I like to stack the plates to make it easier for the staff.

When I'm purchasing  a dozen tins of cat food, I stack them for the cashier such that the bar codes are aligned, and the cashier can scan all of them in seconds.

When buying groceries, I make an effort to ""group"" them for easier bagging ... frozen/cold items first, hard-to-crush items next, ... easily-crushed items go onto the conveyor last.  When I'm buying ten bottles of diet soda, I leave nine of them in the cart, hold up one, and say ""ten of these.""

If I park near the shopping cart corral, I'll sometimes grab two carts.  One, I take back to the store entrance, and put it in the lineup.  The other I'll use to do my shopping.  Just so there's a little less work for the employees.

If my habits for putting out the trash can make life a little easier for those who collect them, I'd feel better about doing it.
