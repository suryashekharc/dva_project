57,"Let us take a look at the link you posted and point out that it's saying...exactly what I said. This exercise should be unnecessary since it seems like you basically believe the exact same things as I'm saying but maybe don't like the wording??? Anyway, here goes:

Me:

>A small but noteworthy number of Ukrainians, particularly in the east, are white nationalists who use Nazi symbolism and espouse the same kind of garbage.

Excerpts from your link:

>""There is [the Azov] regiment... There are [estimated] several thousand people who are in this regiment. It is indeed a group where many members adhere to nationalist and far-right views...But a lot of people also join it because it is one of the most prepared and fit-for-war units.""

>""The Azov Battalion stepped in. It was better-equipped and prepared to do much of the frontline fighting against the separatists. The unit has its roots in aggressive fan clubs that support regional soccer teams, known as 'ultras,' but as the fighting ramped up, they attracted various far-right activists, who often made no secret of their neo-Nazi sympathies.""

>""The militia was founded by Andriy Biletsky, an ultra-nationalist political figure who previously led groups including the openly neo-Nazi Social-National Assembly (SNA), which preached an ideology of racial purity for Ukraine.""

Conclusion: What I said is directly supported by your link.

Let's continue. Me:

>This issue has been known for YEARS.

Your link:

>""In 2014, the battalion was backed by Ukraine's controversial then-Minister of Interior Affairs Arsen Avakov and was financed by several Ukrainian oligarchs. The new benefactors included some wealthy Ukrainians of Jewish descent, who appeared to be prioritizing the group's efficacy in the battle for Ukrainian sovereignty in Donbas over its ideology.""

Conclusion: For at least 8 years the political ideologies of the Azov forces have been known.

Me:

>Ukraine...embraced the Azov battalion, as a matter of perceived (whether real or not) necessity. They accepted a self-identified white nationalist militia into their formal military structure...

Your link:

>""In late 2014, Azov was expanded from a battalion into a regiment, and was officially embedded into the Ukrainian National Guard — an official law enforcement agency, but not part of Ukraine's national armed forces.""

Conclusion: With the above excerpt as well as previous ones regarding the formation of the Azov Battalion and the desire to make use of their military effectiveness, we can clearly see that...my statements are directly supported by your link. Again.

I probably don't need to continue at this point...but I will.

Me:

>Now, does this mean Ukraine is full of Nazis? Lol, no.

Your link:

>""Azov has achieved levels of mainstream media exposure far in excess of the group's minimal electoral support.""

Conclusion: While highly visible, clearly not many people actually support the ideologies of Azov, which directly contradicts the narrative that Ukraine is full of Nazis and Nazi sympathizers.

Interesting point about this conclusion. While it's what I have been saying the entire time, it seems like the stance you took was that I was saying the opposite...which is REALLY confusing, since I very very very clearly stated it, and very clearly condemned the actions of Russia, calling the war needless murder of innocents. But hey, fuck, we'll keep going.

Me:

>It sure as hell isn't a justification for invasion...

Your link:

>""Overall, the influence of various officials, including Avakov, outside of Azov, is very limited...There were no Nazi battalions roaming around the streets and trying to embed into [the government] system, as the Kremlin is trying to portray.""

>""So if not for this war, this stage of the war, the far-right movement would have eventually vanished.""

Conclusion: The rise of the Azov Battalion's influence has been entirely due to the conflict Russia started, and yet its influence is still insignificant, as has been stated previously, so using it as a justification for war is...just plain stupid.

Me:

>Putin is the aggressor. He has latched onto a small number of valid concerns and used invalid logic to draw asinine conclusions as a justification for...really it's just wholesale murder. It's easy to posit what his reasons might be but all of that is pointless. He has led his people into a needless conflict to murder neighbors, and that is an absolute fact.

Your link:

>""Over the course of the grinding eight-year war in Donbas, the United Nations human rights commissioner's office documented a litany of human rights violations by both sides in the fight, including allegations of the 'extensive use of civilian buildings and locations… and looting of civilian property, leading to displacement' by Azov Battalion forces.""

>""The far-right in general, and their apparent impunity, have significantly damaged Ukraine's international reputation and left the country vulnerable to hostile narratives exaggerating the role of extremist groups in Ukraine.""

Conclusion: The Azov forces have committed human rights abuses, and those are valid concerns...which Russia has taken and run with to the extreme of attempting to justify what I explicitly referred to as ""wholesale murder"".

Again, I just don't understand what you're trying to argue here. If your point is ""Putin is bad and the actions of Russia are unjustifiable, and this war is murder and entirely the fault of Russia."" then...I agree with you, and always have, which makes your indignant tone really weird. If your point is ""There are no Nazis, Nazi-sympathizers, or far-right extremists in the Ukrainian military structure whatsoever, and all of it has been completely fabricated."" then...I guess recheck your sources because the one you provided clearly outlines how the statement is not true.

Condemning far-right extremism in Ukraine does not lead to the conclusion that Ukraine needed to be invaded. There is literally no cognitive dissonance in the statements ""Ukraine has a minority of white nationalists"" and ""Ukraine does not deserve to be invaded and have its people slaughtered"". You don't actually have to just claim that the side you're opposing speaks literally nothing but lies to be able to oppose their conclusions and actions. You can actually just say, ""While these one or two things you've brought up are true, you have lied about these countless other things, and even if you hadn't lied about anything, these one or two truths do not justify your actions"".

Your responses containing troubling tribality. Any given two parties do not need to inherently oppose everything the each other says or believes on the principal that they are in competition with each other, or opposed in certain areas. It's absolutely psychotic to act like any statement which doesn't categorically oppose everything stated by the other side is the same as supporting that side.

I mean, you literally posted an article that stated that there are Nazis in Ukraine and then told another redditor ""you have far more in common with Nazis"" for...stating the exact same thing as your own source stated. You can't post a link that says ""Ukraine has only a small number of Nazis"" as support for your own point that ""Ukraine has only a small number of Nazis"" and then call *another* person a Nazi for saying ""Ukraine has only a small number of Nazis"".

Everyone in this discussion is on the same side that is ""Putin bad. Russia aggressor. Slava Ukraini. This war is murder."" The only difference is that you seem to be under the extremely incorrect impression that everyone else thinks ""If Ukraine has even a single Nazi, every Ukrainian deserves to die.""",t2_9hvlf,oliksandr,0,1648253421.0,0,t1_i24ucqk,i24ucqk,False,trickle_up_freedom,t3_tmb8ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/tmb8ym/the_us_will_take_in_up_to_100000_ukrainian/,"The U.S. will take in up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war",/r/newhampshire/comments/tmb8ym/the_us_will_take_in_up_to_100000_ukrainian/i24ucqk/,1,r/newhampshire,0,1,0.37741217,0.24131308,0.58523935,0.4249913,0.2056335,0.25247568,0.0740881

136,"Just so we can reference this piece of art here is the whole deleted post below.  from u/lateja

Dude's funny and based af.

Problem is that most of the present day socially engineered NPCs wouldn't even have the mental capacity to understand this or read in between the lines.

Although, maybe this is actually brilliant. Alt leftists are mentally incapable of comprehending anything beyond the simplest of ideas -- those that require reasoning beyond that of the most basic multi celled organisms.

They can understand ""there is food in front of you, eat!"". But if you add a third step, i.e. ""there is food behind this tree, you can eat if you go around it"" their brain short circuits and they start screeching random insults at the tree. They know they are hungry, and remember something about the tree, and walking around something, but can't link the two together. So they hurl insults that the tree is racist and homophobic and start throwing stuff at it.

The way to deal with them is the way you deal with other beings of lower intelligence. They react to verbal commands in the form of buzz words. If you need to get them to eat, you tell them that it's sexist and transphobic to stand in the area they are standing on and not walking around the tree. They react to the buzz word, and walk around the tree. By the time they're on the other side, they've already forgotten why they started walking there in the first place but it no longer matters. They see the food, and now they eat.

Even in the university humanities faculties that they've been pushed into after shutting down mental hospitals in the US in the 1960s, the principle is the same. Have you read any ""academic works"" by ""prominent"" gender or race studies big fish? Practically every one of them is a drug induced stream of consciousness of random words stringed together by buzz words. Something like ""The roots of transphobia and racism in the proto-racist mis-informed history of whiteness, the role of wooden chairs, and Russia"". There you go; PhD thesis.

So this cattle-like segment of the population can be managed through these buzz words, and the guy flooded his video with them. Which is brilliant. It doesn't have to make sense; regular people could read in between the lines and make their own decisions. But the bottom 10% of society's IQ curve -- those eternally trapped to dwell the subsidized liberal arts faculties -- can hear these buzz words and will vote for this guy.",t2_9vyvf,dj_narwhal,0,1648235149.0,0,t1_i23nyq1,i23nyq1,False,5nd,t3_tnmtw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/tnmtw8/war_is_gay_jeremy_kauffman_for_senate/,"""War is Gay - Jeremy Kauffman for Senate""",/r/newhampshire/comments/tnmtw8/war_is_gay_jeremy_kauffman_for_senate/i23nyq1/,1,r/newhampshire,0,1,0.5020915,0.3033447,0.650123,0.5277687,0.20942569,0.20932715,0.39009583

140,"Honestly, I don't know. He did say: [Here](https://twitter.com/jeremykauffman/status/1402624759632908288?s=20), that he did all the LPNH tweets, but that was a good 6 months before this one, though this tweet was after the initial drama around the LPNH tweeting about child labor and getting rid of the Civil Rights Act.

You are right that there seems to have been some serious infighting in the party around that time, from what I can tell, so I don't know if Kauffman is still the one controlling the account.

Edit: [Here](https://reason.com/2021/06/23/inside-the-battle-over-the-soul-of-the-libertarian-party/) is an interesting account on that infighting I found. As far as I can tell, Kauffman is the direct cause of the infighting, as the LPNH tweets basically caused the state, and then the federal party to eat itself over the terrible publicity it recieved, ending with Kauffman's group winning, a bunch of members resigning, and access to party accounts handed back to the LPNH. Some evidence both for and against Kauffman still running the account, on one hand, the new leadership rebuked Kauffmans use of the account directly, on the other hand, the ideological side that Kauffman was on won, and Kauffman is still on the LPNH Communications Committee. If I had to guess, Kauffman is still the main person tweeting from that account, and the rebuke was just a fig leaf to distance themselves from Kauffman's most controversial tweets.",t2_9u8aucwj,kearsargeII,0,1648234640.0,0,t1_i23mpfm,i23mpfm,False,5nd,t3_tnmtw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/tnmtw8/war_is_gay_jeremy_kauffman_for_senate/,"""War is Gay - Jeremy Kauffman for Senate""",/r/newhampshire/comments/tnmtw8/war_is_gay_jeremy_kauffman_for_senate/i23mpfm/,11,r/newhampshire,0,11,0.08153562,0.02439653,0.05482016,0.07566328,0.020845205,0.06015744,0.024504231

It's how Vermont, NH and Maine didn't get knocked off in the last big blackout in 2003. New york cut the transmission and PSNH balanced the load coming down from Quebec to meet the change. Damn fast. Now power coming down from Hydro Quebec is another matter, but again, that is all fairly well balanced for outage-related voltage spikes and dips.

232,"I had voice and DSL with them.  Long history of service calls but they had usually been responsive and able to fix the problem.  Often involved them spending a day or two to trace the entire line.  Then at some point their service org turned incompetent and unresponsive.  Both voice and internet had become unusable.  They played the classic game of ""we sent a truck but no one was home.""

They also closed the work order apparently, even though they hadn't done anything.  When I called asking where the repair guy was, they said the ticket was closed and they'd have to open a new one.. at the back of the line.  They failed on the next attempt as well.  I forget what the excuse was.

Ultimately, I had to switch to Comcast.  The only reason I had put up with DSL so long was to avoid having to do that.  Not too long after, suddenly Consolidated (guys with pickup trucks and ladders) was stinging fiber everywhere.  I would love to have been able to switch to that, but I can't risk being without Internet for over a week again.  I might consider it if Consolidated gets replaced by a company that's at least half-way competent.  But at this point, I'd rather deal with Comcast.

FWIW, if your voice line is out, you can complain to the state.  Poke around on the state website.  Voice is a regulated service and they can get in big trouble for leaving you down for so long.  I did that once and the next day they had a truck on every street corner working on the problem.

397,"An SR22 can be required even without an accident (DWI for instance). In those cases, you could call it mandated.

I'm not even making a case for competition in the market, but your last sentence is indeed where I'm coming from. Imagine if NH required all homeowners to own a firearm; you can bet that most certainly the price of firearms would increase.

Demand is already high here for car insurance, but a government mandate would allow for insurance companies to charge a higher premium. All types of insurance companies pay big bucks to governments to get this type of treatment, including raising the barrier to entry into the market, to manipulate it in their favor- decreasing competition/supply to once again increase prices/profits.

The less they're involved in government and vice versa, the better it is for the end consumer.

ETA: Potential penalties come in all flavors. The  potential for accidents and everything that comes with mitigating those effects is already an incentive to get insurance and obviously plays a part in setting Insurance prices.

419,"First, let's assume that you're on Rate R which is the most common rate.

The reason that the delivery charge is so hard to calculate is that it's not just simple addition. Once again, part of the charged changed during the middle of the month. If you look at your most recent bill, there are two different rates for the Sysem Benefits Charge. So some of your kWh are charged at the old rate, and some at the new rate. Also, be careful because part of the delivery charge is actually a *negative* charge, which you must subtract.

Starting *next month*, your delivery rate should be $.09846 per kWh, plus $13.81 per month.

The comment I initially responded to literally started with:

> the lack of insurance mandate

A mandate is a state law. State laws are political. 

I philosophized about what some free staters want in this state (fewer laws), and realized that insurance is *more useful and more necessary* in a state without mandates than it is in a state with mandates (where it is still obviously useful).

The “libertarian paradise” comment was meant to take the “no mandate” concept to a logical conclusion: no regulations, redress for damages is upheld by courts where people sue one another even more than they do now. 

I agree that insurance is necessary and perhaps should be mandated. I implied that I agreed with that by talking about how big, dangerous, and expensive a car is. I’m saying: cars are expensive and dangerous. A person would be “a legit lunatic” to not get insurance and drive one around regularly.

Anyway, I was just thinking about how it’s interesting that there is not a mandate for insurance in NH. But if NH became a pure libertarian organized territory (wouldn’t want to say state, right?) such as some people in this state claim to want, wouldn’t insurance be even more necessary (not required but virtually necessary) because your likelihood of suing or being sued would increase? As I understand it, in such a libertarian world personal suits between individuals and other individuals or corporations would take the place of various laws and regulations imposed by the state. 

How does one get there? Because of discussion of insurance (and inherent reference to mandates) from the original comment. NH is a political state.

547,"Labor shortage due to high unemployment rates and additional immigration becoming a magical boon to said labor shortages is an implausible connection. 

Additionally, it’s very nice of you to automatically assume that all of these refuges would rapidly fill up the labor shortages…the labor shortages that overwhelmingly apply to unskilled/low level labor. 
Apparently all of these peasants can only flip burgers in your mind. 

Liberal ideology shows it’s true colors, yet again. 

P.S. Almost ALL said refuges will be elderly, and women/young children (single mothers now essentially, with little to zero family support) so tell me…who flips the bill after the fact? 

When we saw large waves of refuges from other countries over the last century, it typically consisted of men, women and children - and was a boon to the economy after a few years. 
When we saw the smaller waves of just women and children…there was little to no net gain within the economy, etc. 

The impact of 100 mouths to feed, versus establishing 500 working male lead family refugees is massive. 
Kind of like the statistics relating to prisoner costs, etc. 
I.E. The annual cost of every 100 inmates, could easily support 400+ citizens on government assistance.

Go to their brewery and try a few; they have a nice tasting room.  Enjoy your beer on the deck overlooking the river. 

Next door is their food truck and pizza restaurant.  You can't take your beer from the tasting room to the restaurants, but you can buy their beer in the restaurant.  Stupid laws.

Littleton is appropriately named.  It is small.  The main street is nice with a bunch of shops and restaurants, but you can see it all in an hour.  There is nice covered bridge near the brewery that you can walk across.  Cross the bridge then turn right, follow the path along the river and you'll find another suspension foot bridge.  Cross that bridge and you just made a loop.  Maybe a mile total walk.

681,"And more projection. The idea that people from central america are lazy, on welfare, and are supported by democrats because they vote democrat, and the idea that democrats are in and of themselves lazy and on welfare, is something that *you* have stated at least 5 times, either by insinuation, or directly on this thread alone. You seem fairly slow on the uptake, but I was mocking your statements there. You then turn around and start circlejerking about the hardworking ukranians, who are, your words, ""the most libertarian populace we could ever hope to import.""

So, yeah, the full extent of your thoughts is fairly clear here. Ukrainians good because they are libertarian and therefore work hard. Them lazy third world immigrants, on the other hand, are democrats because they are lazy  criminal welfare queens and are lazy criminal welfare queens because they are democrats.

This is, of course, not really true, as the stereotype of the freeloader immigrant [simply does not exist](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/immigrants-contribute-greatly-to-us-economy-despite-administrations) in demographics, with immigrants on benefits averaging the longest work hours out of any immigrant group, something that should not be surprising as benefits mean that they are likely underemployed and in low-income jobs that force the worker to have multiple jobs to make ends meet. Job attainment as a whole for immigrants, central american or otherwise, is slightly higher than that of natives, likely as immigrants are lower income and as a result have more people in the workforce. Further, for fairly obvious reasons, crime rates in immigrants, *particularly* illegal immigrants, are lower than they are in US citizens. [Source](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014704117). Immigrants are strongly incentivized to not get in trouble with the law as this either means a revocation of their status, or possibly deportation if they are illegal. Further, as per the Cato Institute, immigrants as a whole consume far less in the way of welfare benefits as a percentage of the population than locals do. So, if central american immigrants are not lazy, are less likely to be criminal than natives, and are less likely to take up welfare than natives, what is left over is racism, which is beyond clear when you are singling out ukrainians, and your token minority of Cubans, as hardworking.",t2_9u8aucwj,kearsargeII,0,1648157667.0,0,t1_i1zglgx,i1zglgx,False,trickle_up_freedom,t3_tmb8ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/tmb8ym/the_us_will_take_in_up_to_100000_ukrainian/,"The U.S. will take in up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war",/r/newhampshire/comments/tmb8ym/the_us_will_take_in_up_to_100000_ukrainian/i1zglgx/,5,r/newhampshire,0,5,0.40334132,0.22890916,0.6316323,0.42941666,0.21458721,0.18358652,0.093671575

767,"Dude. Look up the Azov Batallion yourself if you want to see proof of their claims. Their logo is literally a wolfsangel overlaid on a black sun in white, both literal Nazi SS symbols. There has been interviews with their leader who tried to claim that in defense of the unit, that the unit is ""only"" 10-20% neonazi in composition. And that is what their leadership, which was trying to softsell the organization, was claiming, particularly since the US got fairly close to classifying them as a terrorist organization and they were probably trying to avoid that sort of conflict. Personally, if the militia was more or less 100% neonazis, I would not be surprised, as I doubt many decent people would associate themselves with that group.

It isn't Russian propaganda to know that they are a literal white nationalist organization that is tacitly supported by the ukrainian government, in what I would hope was a misguided realpolitik attempt at letting a white nationalist militia with Neonazi ties stay around so they can use them as cannon fodder. It does not in any way make Ukraine or Ukrainians neonazis, but it really isn't a good look.

&#x200B;

Edit: and for that matter, Russia comes off as fairly hypocritical here, as they have made extensive use of the Wagner Group, a PMC with serious ties to Neonazis in the Ukrainian war. The Azov Batallion is real, and has real ties with Neonazis, even if we take their word that they are not 100% Neonazis, but Russia never really cared about the Nazi thing to begin with.

And for the record, as a classic example of the nordic welfare state, Finland is far, far to the left of the US, at least economically, and likely socially as well. Vis a vis Cuba, it was the end of a special exception for undocumented immigrants from that country that gave them instant green card status if they made it into the US. If other countries had that agreement, illegal immigration simply wouldn't exist, as literally anyone moving to the US would be legal if they were not caught at the border. 

The end of wetfoot/dryfoot was part of negotiations in opening up Cuba, one of the terms handed over in making the deal, not as part of some democrat conspiracy to make sure there would be fewer Republican voters. If anything, I would argue that recent Cuban immigration is a footnote politically compared to the existing Cuban population of South Florida that moved there in the first few years of Castro, and democrat chances of winning Florida is utterly dependent on the support of that Cuban population, irritating Miami- Cubans by cutting off special status to the trickle of cuban immigrants entering the US year to year did absolutely nothing to help the Democratic Party politically.",t2_9u8aucwj,kearsargeII,0,1648149765.0,0,t1_i1ywl7e,i1ywl7e,False,trickle_up_freedom,t3_tmb8ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/tmb8ym/the_us_will_take_in_up_to_100000_ukrainian/,"The U.S. will take in up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war",/r/newhampshire/comments/tmb8ym/the_us_will_take_in_up_to_100000_ukrainian/i1ywl7e/,4,r/newhampshire,0,4,0.28006032,0.15604508,0.42297104,0.3125842,0.13333797,0.1714544,0.044224467

826,"There was a thread on this subreddit many years ago when Trump closed our borders to refugees from The Middle East. The tone of the comments on that post was vastly different than the tone of the comment section of this post. And before I get on to my main point, please be reminded that there's no need to get up at arms over these first few sentences. All I'm saying is the tone was different. Go look it up before you get defensive. 

Why was the tone different? That's what I'm interested in. The reticence I saw back then about letting in refugees from the Middle East was partially attributed to the fact that we didn't trust the vetting process to not let extremists into our country. How do we know who to trust? Do y'all remember that? 

Well, I would propose this situation is similar. How do we know we're not letting in Russians? Who might otherwise be pissed at the US for arming their enemy? Suddenly, we trust our vetting process and are no longer worried?

I don't have any answers. I'm just calling it as I see it. The psychological toll that this news and imagery is taking on all of us must be viewed as a learning opportunity.
